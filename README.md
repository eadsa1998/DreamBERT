# Overview

This will contain all the data and notebooks related to training a BERT model (called DreamBERT) on the corpus of text from the website [www.dreambank.net](www.dreambank.net), 
which contains descriptions of over 26,000 dreams.
You can find the file and version information for this model in the HuggingFace hub under [asheads/PredreamBERT](https://huggingface.co/asheads/PredreamBERT/tree/main)
