# DreamBERT
This is a GitHub repo for what could potentially be my capstone project

This will contain all the data and notebooks related to training a BERT model (called DreamBERT) on the corpus of text from the website [www.dreambank.net](www.dreambank.net), 
which contains descriptions of over 20,000 dreams.
