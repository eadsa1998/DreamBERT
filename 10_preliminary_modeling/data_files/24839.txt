I dreamt I was lying in the snow in Alaska and was having seizures and nobody was coming to help me. That's because I realized in my dream that I was actually in my bed. In my dream, I was dreaming. (In real life, when I woke up, I found I had a fever of 102 degrees and was chilled. I was having violent convulsions and my throat was dry from coughing. My head was bleeding because I hit my head on the bedside table during one of my convulsions. Nobody had come to help me.) Setting: In my bed, in my home. Characters: It was only me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, sick, alone. I have no idea where it came from, but I think my mind was just reacting to my body movements in my sleep.
