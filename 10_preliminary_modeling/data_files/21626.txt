I awoke saying, "I don't know." We were trying to capture a spy. He had a gun and was using it and so was one of my friends. He was captured last. There was another spy and I helped to capture him. I waved my hand to the police when to move in. I was on top of the spy and took a blade which he intended to use on me because he had an idea that I would get him down. I sort of walked in on the air over gulleys. I walked right off a cliff and walked right on the air. A friend of mine also walked. He seemed to be Joe Arendas.
