An older man seems interested in me. We are on a cruise boat. I am flattered, but at the end of the ride I go away, not opening up to an opportunity to meet him again. I see some burros. A small, cute one is feisty and kicks his heels up just like real burros. I comment on how cute he is. Someone says, "Uh oh! You'll take it home!" I say, "Oh no. Not me." Then I notice it has some blood on its back. I feel concern. Next, I am walking back home with the burro as a cane. I comment that it is just the right height. I am concerned that when I get home, my parent will be upset and not accept the burro. Then I see Kirk Douglas who is upset at his son because the son had done some spectacular things and then just quit! He (the father) is going to have a talk with him and see if he can convince the son to get back on track. Now I see a small girl who had spent hours straightening up the nursery toys, lining them up and labeling them. She is very proud of her hard work and is waiting in excited anticipation for her parents to come and see and be proud of her. The burro is also waiting, hoping to be accepted. I feel sorry for them because Kirk Douglas is going to blast in there, with his single-minded energy aimed at the older son. The little girl and the burro are going to be ignored.
