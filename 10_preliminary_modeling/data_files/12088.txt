I left home to walk to school, but it was the first day of holidays. Samantha, Silas and Calvin were walking up the road opposite to the island. So I walked with them. We ended up at some place where there were lots of kittens. There was a strange movie called Silence and it had Kevin Costner in it. They mentioned something about silence and science. Someone (I think Kevin) got their arm cut off.
