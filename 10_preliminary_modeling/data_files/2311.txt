A baseball game is in progress. I'm in the stands watching. A guy has a box of balls, one has a pumpkin in it that weights it so he can cheat. He's very careful to protect it so no one will know. Then he decides to nonchalantly bounce it around (looks like a small basketball), but he drops it in a pile of other balls and a boy grabs it and runs off. I say, "It was the redhead. I'll watch for him." Now Paul Newman is going up to bat. I stand directly behind him so close our bodies are touching and I copy all his moves. "I'm playing baseball too," I say. He grins at me. Later, he's seated in the stands and I cuddle and I kiss with him. I touch his lips and say, "Only my lipstick." He teases me by pretending he might kiss someone else and I possessively grab him and kiss him long and sweet to keep him to me. He's aroused and we lie down. I am stroking his very hairy arm which is down by his waist so that it's almost like his penis, only furry from the amount of arm hairs. He does have a hard one and I feel good because I "have" him.
