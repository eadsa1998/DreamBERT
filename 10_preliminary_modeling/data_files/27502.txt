I was in a large train terminal in W______. I was standing in the middle of the terminal when several young girls came running up and told me that Winston Churchill was upstairs in an office. I went upstairs and the picture of the office is so familiar and clear in my mind that should I ever actually see it I would recognize it. Yet I am sure that I have never been in a place of that description. Winston Churchill was sitting at a desk smoking a cigar. I seemed to be applying for a job as his secretary.
