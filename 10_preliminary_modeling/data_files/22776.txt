I was walking by a big road, at the edge; I was with my mother. Then we met my cousin and his friend (M). We talked of something, I don't remember, and then left them. Then I was on a bus and they were in the back and I saw my little nephew sleeping and we had packages with us. We got off and didn't say goodbye to them. I got home and my mother was sick in bed, the room was in disorder and my aunt, my mother's sister-in-law, had been there. I was angry because my little nephew was sleeping on my bed and I told my mother that she was always bringing them over and then leaving them to me. I started to fix the room and I went to the closet and opened it, and I saw a black coat inside. I think I was going to take something out of there.
