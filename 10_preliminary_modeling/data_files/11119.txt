I dreamed that was in typing class and the world's greatest typist (don't remember her name) was there and the kids in our typing class were trying to beat this famous typist. We all had three times to try and see if we could type faster than she could because there was a prize of $11,000 to the one who could beat her. No one could, but then on my last try I finally beat her by 1 stroke. Just as they were handing me the money, I woke up. What a disappointment because I never did get the money.
