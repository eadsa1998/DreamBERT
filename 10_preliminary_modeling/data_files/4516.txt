["Pretty cat and pregnant clothes."] I am in a bed, sleeping. A long haired black and white spotted cat is let in the room, perhaps by my daughter Ellie. The cat stretches up on the wall to play with the ticking coo-coo clock. Then I see an image of myself in an outfit. My belly is huge. I look pregnant. I choose to change my outfit to one that makes me look slimmer.
