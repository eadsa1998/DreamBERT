I have just packed my smaller black suitcase and now put two dresses in my large gray fortnight. Think I'll check it because it's so large for me to carry but remember it is weak. While wondering what to do. The boy calls from downstairs that we will miss the train if we don't hurry. It leaves at 7:30. I come down but we must wait for H. The yellow bus with Cedar Rapids in big letters on the side is leaving the front door. When I see we missed it and won't make the train, I hurry to station window and ask when the next train leaves. Think it's tomorrow. Much distressed.
