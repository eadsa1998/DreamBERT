I was graduating from Modern Media College already and I had a friend that was graduating from the university close by, and for some reason we had to attend the preppy dinner for the preppy university, and Modern Media College really didn't have a real like distinct cap and gown like uniform things, and they had us wear like regular clothes, which I hear is what they're going to do. But I got this like get-up together that had like a black cap and a black gown from somewhere and I dressed it all up. I put all kinds of flowers on my cap, and I put all kinds of dangly, dingly things around my neck, and I went in a parade, a parade that the university was putting on, I think several universities in the area. I just paraded around and ____ the parade. And I dreamt that I had a column stand like ____ thing that I could put pens in somebody gave me as a present. And I was trying to get Mom and Merrilee to come, so they'd come by themselves, and that's about all I can remember. I don't know if they ever did.
