["False eyelashes"]  I am lying on a couch in the middle of the night. A man comes in and says good morning but I pretend to be asleep. I am now putting on mascara, looking in a mirror, because a movie company is using me as an extra. They are trying to decide if I wore mascara the last time. I look in the mirror and see a Sandra Dee type of hairdo on my head, I Say, I remember wearing mascara. I watch in the mirror as I put it on. Each eyelash is long like I'm seeing it in a magnifying glass. I goop on the mascara. I want to look a bit more sexy and interesting than Sandra Dee.
