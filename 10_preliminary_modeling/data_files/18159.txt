the dream took place in my university town. It's rather confused what happened exactly, but it seems there was some huge windstorm that had done something rather strange. It opened another passage into the town or something. I didn't know exactly what this meant, but I wanted to go see it. My husband didn't much want to, but I persuaded him finally that we should drive out and go looking for it. I didn't know what sort of windstorm it was, but nothing seemed to be damaged. It was only this one place wherever it was. As we drove along, we came to a house beside a lake and apparently we had been invited to a cocktail party although we didn't' know these people. But we got out and went in and had a drink. Then we went out and walked out onto his dock on this lake and stood around for a while. Then we finally left. We were driving around this lake when we came to a place where the bridge was partly broken down. The water was running over it. We figure this must be what they meant about another passage into town, but that didn't make much sense.
