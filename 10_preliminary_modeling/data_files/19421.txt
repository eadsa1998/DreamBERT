I was at my new home and my family came to visit (mom, sister, her fiance Jack). Zack was also there. I lived by the beach, so we went for a walk. We ended up at this club that Zack and I used to go dancing at. We decided to go in. It was Tuesday and the place was practically empty. Sherry and Jack went to get a drink. A slow song came on and Zack asked me to dance. We were the only ones on the floor. I was so happy. Then, all of a sudden, people came from nowhere and the dance floor filled up and we couldn't move, so we sat down.
