["Shitting in the park."] I am sitting on the grass in a park. I need to shit. I push and make three small molded piles of shit. Now I need to stand up and walk away. I feel embarrassed. And uncomfortable. I stand and quickly put some papers over the piles of shit to cover them. I can't wipe myself so I walk, being very aware of left over shit on my butt.
