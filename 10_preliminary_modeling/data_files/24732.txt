I was on an island with my dad and brother, and we had to get back to the mainland. The ocean that was between us was covered in brown stuff that had solidified. We were looking through the brown stuff and taking stuff out. My brother found two snakes. I didn't find anything. Before, when we explored the island, we found this hermit living in a guy's backyard. Setting: On the island, away from the mainland. Characters: My brother and dad are my actual brother and dad. The hermit I didn't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, amused. I was worried about getting back to the mainland. I was amused when we found the hermit.
