I was at the edge of a ditch accompanied by a friend. In my dream I was in love with her; she was all dressed in white. Then her brother appeared, but her brother was a friend of mine who went to school with me. But in the dream he appeared in a uniform and as the brother of the girl, called Elizabeth. He took her through the mud to the edge of the ditch, sinking in it. He pulled her up and down, but suddenly we were at the top of a mountain and there was no ditch. He left her at the edge of the ditch, because when we got up, she appeared once more. She was half inside it, getting wet. I was below and shouted at her brother who was standing with his back to me, but much higher. I shouted at him to take her out. I begged him and asked him to please do this, but he didn't do anything. He didn't turn or do anything. I wanted to get to where she was and couldn't. That's how my dream ended.
