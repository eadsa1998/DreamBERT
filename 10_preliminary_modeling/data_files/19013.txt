The setting of this dream was a small water hole and there were three students, two of which always seemed to be changing identity during the course of conversation and action. I know the fellows pretty well. I mean I've talked to them in the last couple years since I've been going to school here. The time that this took place is hard to say, but we were drinking beer and it was as if I was back in high school when we used to have to worry about being caught by policemen for drinking beer because we were under age. Well, now I didn't feel this way. I mean, I was thinking to myself, "Well, I don't have anything to worry about because I'm of age, whereas these fellows didn't," so we all sort of had the feeling of having to worry because there was a policeman on a motorcycle, sort of, well, just across the way and he was occupied with something else. We were afraid of him seeing us. I can remember pouring a beer into a glass, drinking it fast and pouring the rest from the can into the glass. I think this might have been a recurrence of what I had done prior to coming here. I was at the airport and I had a beer in a bar, and I poured beer from a can into a glass. This possibly might be sort of just a repeat of this. There might be an association there. However, this was the extent of the dream except, as I said earlier, the characters seemed to be changing from one guy and the next thing you knew he was somebody else, still somebody I knew, but a different person from the first one. We had, I believe, just one six-pack. We were all drinking it and trying to keep the officer from, you know, noticing us. The officer never did come over and say anything to us.
