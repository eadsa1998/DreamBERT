I see a large goldfish in a cute, hooded suit standing on its fins on dry land next to the pond. A cat is nearby and the fish chases it away. I wonder if it can last much longer before getting back in water. Later, I am in a huge house, a mansion. I live there and am exploring the many rooms. I see a series of unexplored rooms off the back and side. One has a huge barber chair in it; another has pinball machines. Another has a bunch of wall clocks that are all exactly alike, no frames, just the numbers in a circle and the hands going around. I consider that a real waste of money. Why would anyone do that? A group of men, musicians, come in from the side door and they each have instruments. The one I talk with has a mandolin in a cloth case. I say, "What, go out there without even the protection of a banjo in front of me?" Later, I go outside and see a huge shallow place where it used to be a swim pool. Someone fills it with water. It's shallow but swimable. Now I am on a boat, fishing. I am catching salmon and doing it expertly and well. The driver of the boat is a good-looking man who is very pleased with my matter of fact style of fishing. Then I catch a big one. I'm quite excited. "Oh dear," I say, "what if it's a dolphin? Or a shark?" I let it go. Now we get back to the mansion and I'm getting dolled up for the prom party that night. I have a younger sister. We look great. We walk down the stairs. I think the party is in honor of an older grandmother, matriarch. That same man who was the driver of the boat now comes over and invites me to dance. I curl up in his arms and we are a perfect fit. He feels just right. I like being near him. I don't want the dance to stop. We are interrupted by another man. I dance with him, aware that he doesn't feel as good. I am glad to get back to my love.
