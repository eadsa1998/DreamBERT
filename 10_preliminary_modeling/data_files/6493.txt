A huge volcano long thought to be extinct, was erupting outside the house in Green City, sending down enormous flaming chunks of ice. I finally got into the house safely along with some few teenage girls, friends of my brother. I sat down in a booth in the living room -- it had booths just like a restaurant -- and played the guitar for my grandparents. I then went and fetched from the car some Hemingway book I bought in hardcover. Somehow, the Starship Enterprise, with warp drive beams emerging fromt the eyes of Worf and Captain Picard, had something to do with the erupting volcano. I got into a conversation with this guy in the house about language and how we develop habits of hiding behind smiles and kind words in conversation, when all we really want to do is smash in their goddamn faces. He tells me this with a strained smile. At this point my dad stands up, excusing himself to piss. I've got to do the same. We were all waiting out the volcano, see.
