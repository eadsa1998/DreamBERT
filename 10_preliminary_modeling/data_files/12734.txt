I was at 'school' and I was on the computers. There was a long line of computers. A teacher was talking to Eugene. He said that he liked computers and the teacher said "so does Izzy". His friends were like "You don't want that!". Later, we had something else in common and they said "You REALLY don't want that!". I saw Mr Nixon and I was thinking 'What the hell is he doing here?'. He was married. Jeremiah took my computer when I got up.
