I was watching Deadpool but it was different. Morena Baccarin and Ryan Reynolds were still in it though. Baccarin was in this dodgy looking carpark and it was night. She was waiting for Deadpool. She was walking past a car and there were some guys in it. She realised it was an ambush and then Deadpool finally came. He fought with a few guys and dodged some bullets and then they both got into this car. She was in the driver's seat but then it was me. He jumpstarted the car and then was screaming 'drive through the cars!' so I started driving and turned and went down this street. The car was old and very slow, but started to pick up speed. He kept screaming 'just keep going' and she/I drove the car over this cliff but there was a massive drop and down below was the ocean. It went in slow motion and went quite far, until finally crashing into the water. Then it showed a beach resort and the opening of the beach. The water bubbled and then Deadpool came walking out, but he was covered in seaweed and stuff and you couldn't see him at all, he was completely green. He walked into the resort. Then it went back and showed Morena Baccarin coming out of the water and she had a mermaid costume on, which showed her cleavage. I was annoyed that they gave her the 'decorative female' treatment. Whatever had happened to them had made them immortal for some reason. They got cleaned up and there were a lot of close ups of Baccarin smiling and I wondered if her only role in the film was to smile a lot.
