I'm looking at photos and it's like they're in a catalog. Julia's getting married. I'm the maid of honor. I have to wear a green bow tie along with Kelly and Denise. Everyone is ready excpet for me. The church is waiting but I can't figure out how to tie my bow tie. I flip out. I rip up peices of paper but they're all too short or fall apart. Julia comes back to see what's wrong. I send Kelly out to find someone who knows how to tie a bow tie. My hair isn't even ready yet. I see Harvey Keitel and he has 3 bow ties: black, green and brown. The green doesn't match and it looks awful with my scoop neck shirt. <br/
