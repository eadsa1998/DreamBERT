[1997-05-27] It was lunch time, about 12ish in the afternoon and it seemed like it was a rainy day and we were walking to the cafeteria at the college where I used to work at my second job at Eastfield Community Technical College and we had to go the building where the cafeteria was and somehow my nephew was there for some reason and my very first boss that I had when I worked at [famous blind school] was also there. I don't know what we ate but we had lunch there and it was fun. Then we came back and I had a lot of paperwork to do and somehow I was at my third job and I went in my office and was working for the rest of the afternoon.
