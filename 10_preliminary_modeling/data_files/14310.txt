I was at a cinema. The guy serving at the counter was in the clip for 'Jizz in My Pants', the clip was actually different. Someone said "cash or credit" to him and everyone was asking if he was the guy from it. Then I was in school and it was a few weeks/months into it. I was doing ok, but I wanted to do MUPC and so wasn't trying. The people there were pretty mean. We were all gathered and sitting on the floor. The teacher looked like Mahone (Prison Break) and he put some music on and everyone was singing except for me, as I didn't know the words and wouldn't have sung anyway. Then they all got up to do this dance. Only two guys and I didn't join in. There was a group of girls that were mean to me all the time and I couldn't find my bag and thought they had taken it, but then I found it in the shelf behind me.
