I was with a 2 1/2 or three year old baby. He and another baby got into a quarrel. I asked about the other's crying. He said, "But I was maldeveloped too", and told his part in the quarrel. I was astonished at Jimmy's long word and told the rest about it. Jimmy wore a blue suit. We were going to spend the night in a camp. I asked him if he wouldn't rather bathe with me in the great big tube (6 x 12 ft.), and we started to do it. The Wist family were settling in some cottages that we passed. Other people were beyond until I wondered where Jimmy and I would sleep. When we reached the bathroom, it had only a shower over a dirt floor heaped up, but I told Jimmy we would bathe there.
