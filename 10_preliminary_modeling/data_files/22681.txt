Several girlfriends from my class had come to my house to study for exams. I don't remember which of them. We ate here, and they started to make a terrible mess with the food. One ate spaghetti with meat sauce, and she ate them, or took them, with a huge spoon and in one bite she ate them mixed with fruit (grapes). We were also having artichokes, and they threw the leaves on the floor. We were eating in the kitchen, and I was desperate because of the mess they were making. Afterwards I was going to the theater with my sister (at times we were in Lima and other times in Paris). A quartet which whistled and played instruments was featured. To get there we had to, or were going through, a very long, uphill street. At times it was so slanted that I saw stairs instead. We were walking there when we saw a bus coming very fast on the sidewalk, so we quickly had to get on the roadside. We arrived to the theater at the intermission and there were no more tickets. But afterwards we were inside the theater and we paid $1.00 each because we were students. The man who sold us the tickets was bald, fat, and Spanish, and he spoke to us, singing. Inside the theater we looked for my other sister. Facts: My sisters: Mary (the one who went to the theater with me) is 23, she studies at the university. Veronica is 26; she lives in Paris where she works for an airline.
