I am at my mother's and have to get back to school but there is so much to do. I am late. Clean clothes are all over the place. I finally get ready to leave and Annie, a neighbor woman, comes in and another woman is with her. I tell them about some dishes I like and they say everyone where they work just signed up for a set. There are two patterns. One is an Irish set and the other has a burgundy design. I leave for school. It is 1:20 p.m. I figure I'll make it to the next class at 2 p.m.
