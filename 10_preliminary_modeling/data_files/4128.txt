I am in a room where Michael J. Fox is the music teacher and his students are practicing. His son, a toddler, is playing a small plastic electronic piano like thing which also has chess pieces on it. He is playing with one hand but I hear notes from both hands. At first I think he is playing this incredible Beethoven like music himself and then I wonder if part of it is electronically produced. He also plays chess while he plays the piano. I talk with Michael while holding his cute son complementing Michael on his son. Later I need to go to the bathroom but the toilet is filled with shit and it is covered over with popular women's magazines. I find a bowl I will pee in. I ask my Mother's permission.
