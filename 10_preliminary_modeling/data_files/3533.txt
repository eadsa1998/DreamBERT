A man with an odd face, like it has cake makeup or something on it, is intensely and single-mindedly attracted to me. I try to get away from him politely. He follows. He is a son of a king or a millionaire, but he acts goofy like an idiot. I am embarrassed by him and I'm also feeling sort of warm and attracted because of his vulnerability. He is so out there with his love for me. He pursues; I dodge; he persists. Later, there's a statement or question, "How is it like to be a gangster?" "They both have leading hose and bands." He also has a father who is just like him who is attracted to an older woman, perhaps my mother. He intensely woos her. He also tells his son that it may be too late. He (the son) may have failed his mission, which was to convince a general to give him armies and so on so they could defend their kingdom. I want to help him as he's almost got the general convinced. We could still do it.
