I was at school and we were getting our Student Edge cards. I saw Ezra around too. We were lining up in factions. They couldn't find mine. Dmitri, Calvin and Evelyn all had pink ones. Seamus's was grey. I first sat with Dmitri and Seamus, but afterwards I sat with Calvin and Evelyn. Later I went back and eventually got mine near a waterfall. Seamus was saying something about me and Dmitri hanging out more.
