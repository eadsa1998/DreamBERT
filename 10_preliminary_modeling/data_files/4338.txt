["Moving."] I am moving out of an apartment and have all my things out now. I had a friend like Anastasia's friends take my TV to California with them and bring it back. This out of the way route seemed to be the most convenient way to get it to my new place. Now I am walking down the city street, like MM City, but not. I am getting tired, walking. The way seems much longer than I thought. I realize I haven't yet given notice to the manager and will probably have to pay extra fees. That's OK. I wanted to move. I then come to a city intersection. I see a runaway truck out of control and it is headed toward me. I turn and try to run back down the alley I was walking in. I narrowly escape being hit. Now the truck needs to back up down the alley I am in. I walk as fast as I can and the way is difficult because now there are ditches with loose boards in them and I step carefully in this precarious area. At one point I look back and the truck is backing up really close and I call out. Stop. I'm here. The truck driver sees me and slows up a bit, but I am still forced to move faster than I can safely travel.
