Some people from the hotel across the street wanted to set our house on fire. So they came in and they put little candles all in the living room without any candle holders, and they were going to like lead to a candle burn down and stuff. And I went, Sandra was in town and a lot of times I would lay next to Sandra the way I lay next to Mom. And I don't remember too much else. I remember there was a really scary part about them telling us what they wanted to do, but I don't remember it. And then I remember that after we put the candles out, I went down and I locked the front door. And then I went to come upstairs and look for Sandra, and I told her I didn't really feel safe until I locked the front door. Then I dreamt that I was setting up my equipment at the picnic table and I had Peavey mixer, I had the amplifier and the CD writer and stuff, and I was setting up the wireless microphone. But I couldn't find the right connection for the receiver and the X (?) alarm wouldn't go in right, and I turned it on and I had the fader all the way down, but I turned it on and it made the loudest squeal of feedback I've ever heard in my life. And I dreamt that I was trying to connect these two quarter-inch connectors to the board, but they were all dirty and acidy and stuff, and I was wishing I had some of that spray that Connor had, because I think I had dropped them in the dirt or something like that. And shortly thereafter I woke up.
