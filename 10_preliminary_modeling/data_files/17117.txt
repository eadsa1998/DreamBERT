I was in a department store with Stuart and my father, riding on the escalator, perhaps doing some Christmas shopping.  A bee started buzzing around.  Outside the store we were on some Astroturf with a low fence- perhaps knee-high around it.  The area was used for radio controlled cars.  The bee stung my leg.
