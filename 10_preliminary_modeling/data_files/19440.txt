I was buying cookies and coffee from a cart. I don't know where it was. The man was talking me into buying these chocolate chip cookies with chocolate bottoms. As he was bagging them, Zack walked up. He gave me a hug and we talked. When I was paying the man, this fat chick walked by. She said something to Zack, which included "Babe!" She said it like she knew him. I said, "Excuse me, what the hell did you just say?" She answered, "Are you talking to me?" I said, "You're damn right I'm talking to you," and I got in her face. She said, "You want a piece of me?" Then we went outside. I got her down and beat the hell out of her. Then I was suddenly sitting on some grass thinking about Zack. These two girls came by and urged me to give him a choice. I decided to ask him to marry me.
