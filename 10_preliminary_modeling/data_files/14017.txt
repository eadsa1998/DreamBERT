I was watching Supernatural. Then Dean, Sam and I went to this town because of murders that had happened there. We noticed that everyone looked emotionless (and it was called Happytown). Someone normal was talking to us about some creature that had a lump of stuff on its bum and I joked that it had a "rectal prolapse". We were then near this dirty, swampy water. There were ducks in it. I think someone was getting attacked on the other side and we all jumped in and swam. I had a fork in each hand and was trying to swim around the ducks so I didn't stab them. Sam and I were joking about it as we swam. We got to the other side and near another bit of water and this mother duck, which was this deformed creature came out. They stabbed it in the bum and it had a rectal prolapse, but it had this flap of skin coming up from under it, so the prolapse was kept in it. We could see this field a while away with this other lone mother duck with a prolapse. I was helping Sam get his stuff into his bag and throwing the useless stuff away. I was looking at rocks around the place for a certain type. Then the mother duck said it was going somewhere and Sam was like "The colt murders?" and it said yeah. It said that the people of the town were being controlled and some other town was sending the Happytown people to be sacrificed. We left and then we were on a street. Sam and Dean were down the street a while from me and I was with a girl. We saw this lady and pointed her out to Sam and Dean and they shot her in the butt a few times. We ran over to say that that's not what we meant, that she wasn't bad. She was ok, and we took her to the hospital. This nice car drove past and it had a black guy in it. The girl said that it was probably a good candidate for the bad guy. We were then in a hotel. There were female ghosts there and they were trying to get us to have sex with them. They turned me into a guy and made me have sex with one of them.
