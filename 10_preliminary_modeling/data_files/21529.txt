I was working for White Sewing Machine. My spindle was stalling. I looked up at belts and when I got up on a ladder and got hold of a belt, it was very loose. I saw Hilts and Ernie Koelsin there and they looked very good. I dreamed something of colored people, but I can't recall what it was now. I recall a doctor being present where I was. I was trying to cut a hole in a leather square.
