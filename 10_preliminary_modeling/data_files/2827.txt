I am in my house. Howard's bedroom is on the second floor and mine is in the attic room on the first floor. I see his face and think sadly, "We never connect. It's been years." I try to feel OK about connecting, but just can't. Someone is cleaning up, vacuuming. I see a pile of marbles on the floor. I start to walk down the stairs, which are a spiral type, and nearly fall because I was not paying attention and stepping on the little tiny edges at the center. I realize and pull back and carefully walk down the outside edges. I go outside and see a little girl and pick her up. I feel so lonely. I lie down and my head is on the legs of a nice man; we are sort of on a beach area. He observes. The baby says, "I bit my mustache." I laugh. She is so cute. I say, "Where?" I kiss her on her cheek lovingly.
