The lady across the hall from our apartment was acting very suspicious, it seemed to me. Heretofore, she had scarcely even been around the apartment. Lately, I had noticed she was bringing much food to the house, and that a number of packages were being delivered to the apartment, too. I decided then to do a little sleuthing. I took a ladder and placed it against the bedroom window. I carefully climbed up and just as I thought, there was a man sleeping in the bed. His face looked familiar to me but I couldn't remember from where. That night, I was reading the newspapers; and there across the front page was a picture of the man I had seen with a bold caption of "Wanted" above it. Of course, I immediately called the police, the criminal was apprehended, and I was a glorified heroine.
