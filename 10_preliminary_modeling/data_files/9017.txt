I was sightseeing in the city where I live with BJ, Bob F, Mother and a visiting priest. We were walking around downtown and someone, maybe me, had suggested going into one building that was somehow related to Catholicism. As we entered the building there were two sets of stairs. One leading up and one leading down. I suggested we take the one leading down first as I thought it would be of particular interest to Father. He was surprised. He thought he was familiar with this building but did not realize that this lower floor existed. It looked like a library, though it wasn't quiet like a library. There is a small sitting area and we are sitting and talking with each other. I don't think Father is sitting with us. We are talking mostly about family members. Mother is standing behind a sofa or loveseat where I am sitting. She is saying something about Aunt P and how she is planning to go somewhere with her and that she doesn't want to go. This doesn't surprise the rest of us because they are very few places that Mother does want to go regardless of who she is going with. But since her and Aunt P don't get along very well, she is particularly reluctant to go with her. I think they are going to visit a cemetery.
