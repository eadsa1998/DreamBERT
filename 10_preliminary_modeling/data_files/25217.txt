 I'm in the basement in a bed with my friend Fran Susse. I am lying on my stomach, and she is lying on top of me, with her stomach against my back. I feel some tension/electricity between us. I am cautious about moving, about how we touch. I roll over on my back. Fran is straddling me, like we are having sex. We are fully clothed. She reacts quickly and loudly, with a scream. I think she is in a dream; a nightmare. She yells. I try to calm her. <br/
