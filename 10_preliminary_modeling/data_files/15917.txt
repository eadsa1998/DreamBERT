I was watching something that was like a Tarantino film, I'm not sure if it was but I thought it seemed like one. Kurt Russell was in it, and he had this car which he loved and kept going on about all the details of it. I can't remember what happened, but something went wrong with it and he crashed it. Then there was this bridge going over this gap and someone in a car missed the bridge and fell straight to the bottom. The smoke from this caused a guy on his bike to hit this bit of wood that made this guy on a wheelchair nearby fall in. Then the car that crashed earlier was on fire and Kurt Russell was still inside smoking a cigar, the police had come to get him and he was doing a monologue saying how even on fire this car is beautiful and he can't leave it or something.
