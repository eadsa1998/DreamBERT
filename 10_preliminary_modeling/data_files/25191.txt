 I wake up in bed at home and someone is walking by my door. It is my dad. He goes into my sister Ramona's room. He comes back into my room. I pretend I'm asleep, lying with my head at the foot of my bed. He wakes me up. He has just returned from a trip to Washington D.C.. He has brought me a pair of brand new clean, white canvas-type shoes. My dad, his wife Lisa and I are driving East on 3rd Street towards the Uptown Movie Theatre. My dad tells me that his sister Ellie Halvin is pregnant. There is some complication with keeping the baby warm. We are near the bank behind the theatre, and there are a lot of donut racks like the ones at the bakery that I worked at. The racks are slanted and the donuts slide and fall off. The donuts keep the baby warm, and since there aren't enough on the racks, there is a problem. A man is there and he says he has the tool to make the racks level but he left it at home and he isn't going back to get it. I think: that is stupid; go get the damn tool!
