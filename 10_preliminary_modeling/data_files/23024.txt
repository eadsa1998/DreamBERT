I was teaching an elementary school class-as a guest lecturer, I guess, because Coretta Scott King was present as the regular teacher.  Will Halliston was also there.  The kids were seated at tables in a U-shaped arrangement, with me at the open end.  The nearest little girl facing in on my right was telling about her confusion in what to call Negroes, and she began to cry.  I looked around the class and saw there were three or four black students, so I asked one of them to volunteer to explain why (or whether) it makes a difference to them if they are called blacks or Negroes.  A cute little boy with an Afro, and slightly gap-toothed, volunteered.  He was sitting at the left end of the cross table.  He was very articulate, intelligent, and precise in his pronunciation, though he used the word "apprehensiveness" in a context which struck me as slightly inappropriate.  I don't remember the substance of his explanation, but it was good.  I then lectured about a related point dealing with language, which was a slight digression, and then the period ended.  I felt very good -- confident, organized, and articulate -- and both Will Halliston and Mrs. King complimented me after the class on doing a good job.  <p
