I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were in class. I was wearing my Good Advice shirt. Judah came in and said to us to meet him outside in a few minutes. Fletcher and I left but he wasn't there. We went downstairs and found him sitting in a chair. Other people were gathered nearby. Cecelia joined us. It was all the 'new' S+S crew, and we were getting some forms. At one point Judah was mimicking that Citizen Kane clap, which we thought was hilarious. We started putting some stuff away and had to put it in the toilets, but it was now like a shop. The toilets were all closed so we had to keep looking. Later, it changed to a spooky abandoned house. We were looking for people, but we'd hear them call out and then not hear from them again. It ended up being just me and one other person and we were calling out to someone and they called back and I started following the voice but the other person I was with said don't follow it. I left the house, and then it was a movie and the whole thing was actually taking place in someone's head - there had been a bus crash with one survivor and she was calling to the other people to keep them awake, and their voices had disappeared as they'd died/fallen asleep. Then it was real life and I was the survivor and the rest had been Good Advice crew. The last girl I'd been calling to was near the front and she had died. I went around the back and found Judah and lifted his arm off the floor and then he woke up and I was glad he was alive, but then I checked the girl next to him and she was alive too, and then the rest of the row started waking up. I wanted it to just be us two who had survived.
