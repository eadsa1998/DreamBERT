I was playing a pre-made Sims 2 family. One of them was a witch and was using the energizers. Her sister was in the family bin. They both thought that the other wasn't related to them. The evil one turned into a chocolate bunny and was labeled as "The Wicked Witch of the East". The other one was a normal chocolate thing. There were heaps of other eggs which I took since I didn't get many for Easter. This black girl had paper on her hair. Dad called. I was in a car with Mom and she came and there was a cute puppy.
