My wife and I are walking along a country road. It's as if it's our honeymoon or something like that. We look off into the distance and see a white farmhouse, several thousand feet away. It has a field of some kind of grain growing alongside of it, and the grain is very decidedly pink. We just think it's very pretty. It doesn't strike us as unusual that this grain is pink, and we decide to walk over to it.
