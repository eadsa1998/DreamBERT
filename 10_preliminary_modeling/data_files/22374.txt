I dreamed I was going up the stairs which lead to my classroom at the university, but when I was about to get there, I tripped and fell down some stairs that were different from the ones I climbed; this one was spiral-shaped. When I was at the bottom, I got to a tunnel that led to a cell. When I came close to it, I saw people in prison, but everyone was out of the Roman era and among them were classmates of mine. When I saw it was a prison and that they would all be sent to the lions, I was terrified, but when I realized that nobody was aware of my presence, that I was an invisible, immaterial being. Then I saw that the gates were lifted and my friends were pulled into the field where the lions were. Then I tried to help them. In my dream I was desperate, knowing there was nothing I could do any more and I cried. Then I tried to pull at a friend and classmate who was being attacked by a lion, but I was unable to help him and then I saw the lion eating him. I saw the remains of his body and the lion's mouth filled with blood, but the image became blurry then. That's all I remember.
