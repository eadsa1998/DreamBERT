Nancy and I are packing boxes and storing them in a small room. Alexa comes by with the keys to lock up the room and building. Alexa is flirting with me. She begins kissing me, and since Sam and I aren't married yet this is okay to do. We're now in my bed and fooling around. I'm excited because I think that because Alexa is another woman, she would have a better idea of what I'd like. She begins to take off my panties and then stops. I tell her it's okay and I take them off for her. I still feel this is okay, not cheating on Sam, because this isn't with a man. As soon as I take off my panties, I have an orgasm and no one has touched me.
