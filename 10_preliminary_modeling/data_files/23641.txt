There is a demonstration going on across the street from my home. At first I think it has to do with existentialism, xenophobia, and the treatment of foreigners. But it is something commercial. Not genuine. Something like Benetton. United Colors. A lot of people end up in our kitchen and I have to ask them to leave because I want to spend some time with my daughter, who is home from college.
