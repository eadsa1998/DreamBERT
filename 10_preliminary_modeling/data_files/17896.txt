I was part of some sort of search or task.  We had to bury something in a correct spot, somehow related to school.  We searched at the park near my parents' house.  The family of one of my old elementary school friends the Addisons were flying a kite. And somehow got the kite untangled from being wrapped around the trees.  They were master kite flyers.  At home, we hurried, trying to find the right item to bury.  It was hidden in a tangerine. My dad and I looked through them, trying to determine which was the right one.  We thought we found it, but kept looking to make sure.  My mother was on the phone, but pointed out the correct one.  It was slightly larger and 'bloody'.  We took it to a field where some construction work was going on.  We checked the work area- no, that wasn't the spot.  We were about to leave, and then we saw a table like the one in our bedroom near the construction zone- perhaps there for their lunches.    The grass looked different beneath.  This was the spot.  We didn't move the table but for some reason dug through it.  The shovel tip was sharp and pierced through.  We buried the tangerine.
