Not a dream in the sense of any narrative action, not characters except for myself--just a restricted image--it was in effect myself lying on my bed with electrodes on my head in a semi-conscious state--there was no fantasy involved--half awake and half asleep seeing myself in my mind's eye, yet conscious enough to be aware that I was seeing myself--I could roll over and see myself in my mind's eye roll over and know in my conscious mind that I was rolling over--the same applied to blinking my eyes, moving my arms, lifting my head--some think like my actions being reflected on a TV monitor--and this is entirely what the dream, the image, consisted of. The setting was my room--only it didn't consist of the whole room but just my little corner of it, just he place where my bed is--like a huge darkness with one little corner having a little light.
