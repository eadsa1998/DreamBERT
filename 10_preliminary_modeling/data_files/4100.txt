["Tidal Wave And Counseling Dept."]  The Counseling Dept staff is playing baseball on a lovely outdoor field. Chuck is yelling orders to the team members. Rich comes toward him, angrily telling him to back off. He's not the boss. I am lying on the ground between them. I say this isn't the best place to be. I stand up and walk to a clear area. I have to go pee and I sit on the grass, in full view of everyone, and put a silky orange scarf over me to be private. I know this is silly and I feel embarrassed. I pee, glad I don't have to poop. Now some woman hits a great fly ball out of the park. Jerome is talking with Tyler about how good the hit was. I join them trying to enter into the conversation. They ignore me. Suddenly I notice a huge tidal wave coming. I see the spray plumes up over the trees. My van is parked near the tree line. We stand there chatting about it. We should run for high ground. Jerome says. I agree and start to walk away from the tidal wave. Jerome suggests getting into the van. It at least would float. I think about doing that, then continue walking away. I come to a fence with barbed wire on top of it. Josh runs past me and leaps over the fence. I realize I will have trouble getting over this fence. I look beyond it and see the ground going steeply down hill. Will that be more dangerous? I clumsily scramble over the fence.
