I was at some church gathering and was trying to meet my grandmother Strong there. When we sat down to eat, I was at a table alone. When we were thru, I asked a person at the next table if a Mrs. Strong from California was there. She said she had been there but had gone. I might find her at the third floor where there was a ladies room. I took a serve yourself elevator and went up but couldn't find her so I came down. As I was looking around the vestibule, a little old lady came up and asked me if I wasn't Madorah. I had surprised that she had come all the way from California to the meeting. I put my arm around her and remarked how short she was, barely to my shoulder, and let her to a sofa at the right of the room where we could sit side by side. )She reminded me of mother. Had been reading old letters.)
