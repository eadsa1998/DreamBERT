 My coworker Tom Olson is going somewhere to buy something for me. He is riding a bus. I give him a $5 bill, and he takes four or eight quarters from my backpack to get me a card and to pay for the ride there and back. My sister Ramona is there. She has been on lunch break. She asks an Indian photograph, which is sitting there, what time it is.
