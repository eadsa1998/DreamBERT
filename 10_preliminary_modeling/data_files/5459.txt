I had another dream it was senior week. This time a lot of the seniors who graduated last year were back. I guess I had decided not to go to "Circus Night," and instead Abigail and I packed up our rooms because we were leaving the next day. The next morning it was pitch black out, but it was definitely morning. Abigail and I waited outside for Lyla to pick us up. She was an hour late and when she showed up, she was wearing a sequined full body suit. She hadn't showered or changed, and this is the first time I can ever recall smelling in a dream. She smelled like beer and a late night out, but it was acute and I could smell it. Lyla explained to us that the reason she was so late was because she had been helping a freshman boy who had gotten lost somewhere.
