[1997-05-18] A lady that I work with gave me a ride home. When we left work there was a very light, fluffy snow falling. I could feel it as I walked on it. It was about 4:15, the time we get out of work and she said "oh, I'll give you a ride home" and so I said "Okay", and when we got home, it was a Monday. My niece was there when I got home and she said "oh I didn't go to work today, but I'll go tomorrow" and I was thinking it wasn't fair that she got the day off and I didn't. Then I went to do laundry and somehow somebody had been using the washing machine, but they had it on hold. And I had to figure it out. I don't know how they had set it up, it was kind of mixed up, but we went over there and fixed it up.
