I'm not sure how it started, but somehow I had been kidnapped. My kidnapper was a man. We were on the street and he said we needed to punch it out, except he taught me how to punch. Then we were walking down the street and I wanted to go home, so he said okay. Except he had to go soon. I saw a white Explorer, so I went to check the license plate but it wasn't ours. So we continued on. He said he would drive me home but he had no room in his car. (How weird an offer is that from a kidnapper?) Then on the street there was a Marriott or some hotel. So I walked inside to phone my parents, and it was a classroom. So I said, "Mom, I have to ask you a question." But then my mom woke me up. Setting: On a street, outside a hotel, in a classroom. Characters: I didn't know my kidnapper. My mom was in it. I didn't know anyone else in the classroom. My dad wasn't seen, but I knew he was there somewhere. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared, relieved. I had just read a book where someone got kidnapped.
