 I'm in Australia near a golf course. There is a flat grassy area for golfing. Some of the holes are tiny, about one inch in diameter. Other holes are about a foot in diameter. I walk by the area. My dad is there. He has just hit a ball and now he digs up a clump of grass with his club. I toss a ball up and hit it casually. It lands between my dad and another man. I'm in Forest Village looking at the bluffs.
