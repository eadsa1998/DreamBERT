I was a detective trying to capture a very rich criminal and I went into his house, but a servant said he had already left and they wanted to keep me from searching thru his records. They cited a bunch of Navy regulations about people who have contracts with the Navy which this guy had that would keep me from doing this, but I checked up and found a lot of them didn't apply any more. I was able to check thru the records, but all that I could figure out is that he had stolen it, a very valuable jewel, and probably gone off to Europe. Eventually I decided he must have taken an ocean voyage and we narrowed it down to one ship which was going to Spain. So my colleagues and I flew out to the ship and started searching it. I was guarding the cabin downstairs while they brought passengers thru to look it over for identification, and this little girl started walking in, oh, about 3 or 4 years old, with her mother. And I realized her mother was this man's wife and that she was in on the criminal activities, so I and another detective arrested her. I believe I pointed a gun at her and she laid down on a bed in another cabin, and I went back to the other cabin for something. It occurred to me that I had better search this woman for guns and I remembered that a lot of women criminals carried a gun strapped between their legs, so I went back in and wanted to search there, and this woman didn't want to let me, so I did anyway and, sure enough, she had a revolver strapped on the inside of her thighs. So I took that away from her and also she seemed to be naked from the waist up. I rubbed her breasts a little bit. Then there was some more about searching the ship and trying to find her husband.
