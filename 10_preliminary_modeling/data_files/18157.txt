I was on campus and walking toward the hospital and some man was walking along with me, and I was going to help find or get something when we got to the hospital. First I had to go into this building next to the hospital and get a picture which had been taken of me a couple of years ago for the annual or something. So I went into the building and went up to one of the girls and told them I wanted to get this picture. Then it seems that I already had it and it was just a tiny little picture. What I had to do was pay for it, and I had to pay $2 for it, which seems like a high price for a tiny little picture, but it didn't seem particularly excessive to me. Then I went on out and went over to the hospital. By this time the man had disappeared. Exactly how this came about, I don't' remember, but when I went into the hospital, I met a girl I had known in school who is working over there now. We started talking and she suggested we go over to the snack bar and get a coke or something. So we got a coke and some crackers. Then I believe we went over somewhere to eat this and talk. We heard an announcement that everybody in the hospital was in danger of getting this disease. It was some sort of flu-like disease, I guess, but it was caused by this woman who was the cashier in the cafeteria and snack bar. Whether she spread it or whether it was because she was careless and sloppy in some manner or another, I don't know. Anyway, everybody was warned and I was sort of mad that I was exposed to this disease and I thought I was already getting it.
