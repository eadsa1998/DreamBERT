There is a raging, swollen river and I am to float down it. I have a guide. She says, "You sure are scared." I said, "Yes, I am." She couldn't understand why I'd be afraid. I was afraid I'd go under and be drowned. I see a boat going down river. It's dragging a long chain, like a bicycle chain. A loop of it catches on my right big toe and almost pulls me with it but I unloop it from my toe. Then I dive in and rush down stream. I get out. An Asian man is there. I have a list of places I saw on my travels. Mile post ----- is one of the entries. He speaks German and so do I, except toward the end I slip into Spanish.
