 I have a conflict with a woman. She is pretentious. She may be my mom. I'm at a soccer game at Armstrong High School between Armstrong and Rival High Schools. I'm cheerleading for Armstrong. My old classmate Karen Baton is cheerleading for Rival High School. My classmates Lance Drift and Sherman Andrews and professor Everett Klanter are part of the cheerleading squad, and run out with us. We give each other high fives. There is a basketball game. Rival has two players who are 6'11". One man was on hormones because he is fat. There is a woman who coordinates all that is going on here. She talks. I'm wearing a cheerleading outfit. I don't agree with the woman: she has nothing good to say. She puts players and families on television. Armstrong won the conference basketball title with Shooter Jackson coaching. The team got a bad seed, first or second. I don't want to be on television. I walk away with a shot glass taped upside down to the bottom of my shoe.
