I had another song to learn for chorus, and Mom was helping me learn it, and she was like reading the music for me and I would play the notes on the music measure. And then I would sing them, you know how you do when you're learning a song and you sight read it. Well, it was pretty different. It had several more octaves and the on-off keys and all like that were to the right instead of to the left. And I dreamt that after we were done -- well actually, I dreamt that we kept getting interrupted by phone calls and requests from Dad and people coming over. And we were moving around all over the house. And [laugh, sigh] I was kind of, you know, I don't know. [laugh] What the heck?! Finally when we were done, I dreamt that Mom like stashed it away in her work room.
