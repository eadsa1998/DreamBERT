 I'm with my old roommate's girlfriend, Natasha Lens. We are at Carter School in Oak Valley by the old pop machine. We are having a sexual encounter. I move my hand around her butt and crotch. She moves her body, and gives me some sort of instructions. People come and sit on the floor nearby, in the hallway at the bottom of the stairs below the pop machine. Three people come at first. They include my friend Tiny Combs, Alec Johnson, and another person. Then a class of people comes. The people know Natasha and I are there. She and I decide to move to the stage. I tell her to wrap a blanket around her before we go, because she isn't wearing a shirt or a bra. We get to the gym, where the stage is, and there are many people there. She says we can go back to her room. I'm then out by the pop machine. I may be leaving. Natasha's boyfriend, my old roommate Jens Nils, is there. He is confused and upset about what is happening with Natasha and I. He says no: this can't happen. Natasha and I leave despite his objection.
