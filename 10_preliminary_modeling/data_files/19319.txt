My dream was at my work. The people who were in my dream were a co-worker, her boyfriend, me, and my boyfriend. My co-worker is 23 and her boyfriend was about the same age. I am 18 and my boyfriend is 20. My dream was about my co-worker's boyfriend cheating on her. He was in California for the navy and she was really sad about it. I tried to cheer her up by asking her if she would like to stay with me for awhile so she doesn't have to go home to him, because he didn't know that she knew, but I really didn't want to be with her because she was making me feel uncomfortable. But she ended up living with me and my boyfriend.
