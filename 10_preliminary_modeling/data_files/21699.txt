Brother Steve (deceased) and I went to Uniontown to see Seventick and his wife. He is (deceased). I was brushing off dust off the easy chair. They moved there lately. They had a dog and I asked them if the dog got used to the new home. There was a storm coming. I went outside and looked at the sky. It was overcast. It was lightning and thundering when we were in the house. We left and were standing by the curb to cross the street. A policeman was standing there with his horse. He would whisper something to his horse to make him come to him. We were filing or sawing wood at Dill's. Malley McPhail was standing and watching us at work. Then he said, "We work tomorrow."
