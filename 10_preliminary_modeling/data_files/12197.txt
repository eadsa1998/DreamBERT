I was at this place and most people were under 15. It was all playground like. There were a couple of older people. Everyone there was supposed to be gay. I wasn't and I saw this guy on an escalator, and he saw me. We both kept trying to meet each other. We found out why everyone was like this, but I can't remember why. I finally met the guy in this 'ball'.
