I won something at school, and I was allowed 'nomination' points. This kid in class got in trouble and the teacher was trying to get him to give her something like $10,000, so I let him off with the points. I was then at some evil park. There were these evil haunted ghost dudes and it was raining and Mom took me on this trolley thing around the park. The ghost dudes threw stuff at me. Moondyne Joe was the name of one of them. MJ was also the coach of the soccer team, which I then played a bit of. I stole $10,000. I wanted the money and this guy took something else. There was also something about a dog with a cockroach. Also, at home there were some people after us and I tried to get away but when we went back home they were there.
