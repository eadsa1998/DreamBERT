I had a dream that I had accidentally booked spring break in Russia, instead of Mexico. When I got there, my father and I had to buy down vests, and all I wanted was for it to be warm. We were on a train to go shopping, but then I was on some pier in Brooklyn. Roberto was there and we were holding hands and walking down the pier. I jumped into the water, but it turns out it was actually this motor oil that could kill me. I was spluttering and swallowing the oil and trying to swim to the dock. I ended up spitting in real life, trying to get the oil out of my mouth in my dream. Then I was running on a staircase that was like the Guggenheim, except it was 14 stories. I tried to climb up the stairs, but the building was jello-like and really difficult to stand up. Anthony was there and he was so cute, and I felt like I was 14 all over again.
