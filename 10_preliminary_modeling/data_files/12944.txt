I was in some virtual reality type thing. The clouds covered holes in the sky. I saw a Eugene character. He looked up at me and I was going to do a reality check, but I didn't. Granma bought lollies. I was on the net on this site. Eugene had an account and I was reading everything on his profile. He had a comment that said "read more movies". There was a list of movies and out of them he'd only seen two. Autumn was on the site too and then I was talking to her about reality checks. I went to do one, but decided I was awake.
