I dreamed I was drinking beer with some friends, but the place was rather unusual. It was some sort of a cave whose exits led into aerial terraces; as a matter of fact, the cave itself was in the air. Then I went with these friends to where there were some beautiful girls clad in baby-dolls. They were very attractive and I went over to one of them and undressed her, and then we made love. Later my friends and I went to the house of one of them; he is in real life the brother of my ex-girlfriend. Well, we were talking in the living room and then he asked us to go to his room to "fly" or smoke marijuana. I refused and ran to another bedroom, but when I got in, I saw the sister of this friend having sexual relations with a good friend of this friend (excuse the redundancy). When I saw this, I was surprised, but she -- naked as she was -- was laughing and at the same time apologizing to me, but saying it was necessary for her to do this. At that moment her brother and the other two friends came in and were not disturbed; on the contrary, they talked to me. I was explaining to them what was happening, but they said it wasn't important. After this I left. But as I was going out of the house, the girl -- already dressed -- pulled me and kissed me and later we threw ourselves on the floor and made love, but I felt disgust rather than satisfaction. Then she cried and we did it again and she, as well as I, felt great joy. When I tried to get up, her parents were in front of us, not angry as usual, but on the contrary, inviting me to go and forget everything.
