I was trying to keep a big man away with me with a long pole. I was swinging it and I hit him on the side of the head and he staggered and I hit him again and then I let him come up to me staggering. We looked at wooden boxes that I put together. They were loose and wobbly from me hitting the man on the side of the face or head.
