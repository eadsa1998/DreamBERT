I was walking out of school, which was different. I went to the carpark and was following Eugene. He went to his car and I couldn't see Mom. She waved at me from this weird silver car at a different spot. Later we were at some theatre place. Some actress had hung herself and had fallen through the floor, which was the roof above the stage. I was asking Dad when elevators were made. The school was there, I think. I was taking photos and video. I was on Myspace later or something and Dmitri had photos. Calvin commented on them and I was worried he was going to tell him that I liked him.
