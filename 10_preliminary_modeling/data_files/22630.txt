The only thing I remember is that I and my two brothers were in the dining room at my home, but the funny thing is that the guys who were supposed to be my brothers are two friends of mine; one of them is 24 years old, more or less, he's short, like my brother, thin, wears glasses, and he is a very nice boy. The other one is a classmate at the university, about 20 years old, fat, and also very nice and smart. Another thing was that, though I have one brother and one sister, in the dream it looked as though I had two brothers. We were sitting in the dining room with my mother, and it seems that something had happened because one of my supposed brothers was giving her money and the other one and I were crying. This is the only scene I remember. I don't remember dialogues or anything else because at the moment I awoke.
