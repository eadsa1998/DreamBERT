I had a dream that memories and dreams weren't allowed. There was a secret service that went around and erased peoples' memories. There was a way to hide if you had any memories, though, and I tried to figure out what it was. I was terrified that they would erase all my dreams, my past, my memories, so I tried to pretend I was blank and had already been erased. Then they went into my room in Fenster and tried to rip up my pillows and comforter to find my dreams. Ugh, it was awful!
