I am training a group of people and we are doing a bike race. I notice the roads are covered with ice and snow and it is slick. I am worried I won't be able to keep up with the students and feel inadequate. We are going to go across a bridge to Canada. But I'm told the bike lane is closed and we have to bike on the freeway part with the cars. I feel concerned. That is too dangerous.
