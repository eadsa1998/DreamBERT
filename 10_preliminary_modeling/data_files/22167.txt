Last night I dreamt of the serenade we will give to a classmate. Strangely enough, the meeting was at her boyfriend's house rather than her own. It was a six-story building. We could see her mother and father, but it was his dogs that were there. He was also there. He is short, has black hair and brown eyes, and is a very good friend. She, the one being serenaded, is short, has long, black hair, black eyes, is dark and is an excellent friend. One of the dogs is brown and the other one is white. This dream is appropriate because on Saturday, the 29th, we are going to serenade her, but, contrary to the dream, at her house. I don't remember the other friends in the dream well.
