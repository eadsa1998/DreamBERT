I am dating a friend's son and living with him although the person in the dream does not look like the person I know it is. I want to build a pool in the basement. There is a cabinet there that we need to do something to for this to happen. I tell him to do it and we will lie about whatever we did. My friend finds it and is upset and we lie and then tell the truth. She is then pleased because she was puzzled over what was done. The son is upset and shortly after this tells me this bothers him because it has permanently changed "their" feelings about him. "Their" is my friend and some man I don't recognize. I say I guess I'd better bow out of this relationship and he agrees because I am a sneak and caused a problem for him. So now I have no one and I think I will never get another boyfriend. I am a teenager in the dream.
