University was different and was where North Midvale Primary School is. I was walking down and I was wearing shorts and a jacket. I had forgotten my water bottle. I heard Calvin talking. Some other people and I sat with Elijah and some other people I knew. My phone was a touch screen and I accidentally called this girl nearby. I slid the bar on the phone across to hang up. The principal lady asked "how would you introduce yourself to someone in America?", someone said "Hey, what's up?" but she had meant someone important, ie to use "yes, please, Sir" etc. Eugene had an account on some dating site and I went on it and saved all his photos. I made a fake account and added him as a friend. There was a new quiz thing and I went on to see his results but he hadn't done it. My real account had photos of me and some guy. It was then some guy and girl who were together. They had a small apartment in New York. I ate lots of lollies 30 minutes "before the start of this dream [I can't remember what word I used]". Then I was at the old house and Dad still lived there. Ezra and I went over for a bit. Dad asked who it was he normally talked about from work and I said "that young guy" and was thinking of Jim from The Office. We got our stuff together to leave. The garage door was open a bit and Dad closed it. As we drove off, the front door flew open. The radio was playing Mambo Sun. I was then with Mom and Ezra and we called Dad to tell him, but we said that it had flown off.
