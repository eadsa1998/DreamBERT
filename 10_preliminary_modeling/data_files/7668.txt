I was at Barry C's apartment. We woke in the morning. He and I were in bed, listening to his daughter talk to herself in the kitchen. She had music playing. She said she was having defibrillated cheerios. We went out to the kitchen and Barry C introduced us. We each exchanged three sentences but I don't recall what they were.
