I am in a building and trying to get a job. I am going to go take classes at the University and want to work part time also. Ellie comes in and is going to apply also. I am very upset. She will mess up my chances. I go to an elevator, which is a tiny space at the top of a flight of stairs, and go down a flight. I am going to go to classes. Now I return, using the same elevator. I go to my new room, which I will live in and counsel in. I try to set it up. Then I think I have two rooms, one with a bed and a tiny kitchen and the original room for counseling sessions. I can be very economical with my living needs because that isn't as important to have the conventional space a house would have. I do want to separate the living space from the counseling space.
