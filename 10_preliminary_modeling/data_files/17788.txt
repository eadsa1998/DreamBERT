My boyfriend Jeremy and I got married.  It wasn't a large wedding- maybe we eloped.  The setting seemed kind of like Santa's place at the mall or something.  With us we somehow ended up taking two dogs with clown-like masks on.  The 'home' we went to apparently reminded me of my friend Kip's place.  There was a bird in the living room.  Jeremy and I went to bed, ready to consummate our marriage when my mother arrived.
