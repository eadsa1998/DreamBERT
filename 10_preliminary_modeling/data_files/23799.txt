I half-woke, just before I had to get up.  Still sort of dreaming.  I saw Risk's face, she came right up to my face, and snuffed at me or kissed my face.  I could feel her presence, her closeness, the way she moves and looks, just the way Risk approaches me and kisses my face.  I was looking at her face straight-on, I could see both her eyes looking at me.  I felt her all day close to me.
