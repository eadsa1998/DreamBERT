I dreamt I was pressured into robbing a Mexican bank. When I got caught, I was taken to the jail, but before they put me in handcuffs, I took $5,000 of the $100,000 I stole and put it in my back pocket. When one of my accomplices accidentally caused a distraction, I hid under the floor. Then I snuck out and stole a motor scooter. It didn't go very fast. So the bad Mexican cop on a motorcycle came up behind me. I turned into a suburb, parked outside of a house, and ran through a back yard where a family was eating dinner. The two Mexican policemen on the motorcycle jumped off and ran after me. I had run in a circle, came back, and stole their bigger motorcycle. I took off, but I found the clutch was broken, so I still couldn't go that fast. But I made it home... and still had $5000 in tattered bills in my pocket. Driving through the town where I went to high school, driving in front of a store in one of the malls, there was a ramp that I was forced to go up on the motorcycle. I almost crashed when I landed and had to dodge cars.
