I am at a party with old high school classmates, a reunion. I walk past them and they nod acknowledgment, but we never interact. I feel sad about this. They don't really care about me. Ernie and Ginny are around somewhere. I look in my little purse to find a lipstick. I take out some old glasses and other things and lay them aside. I find somebody else's lipstick and keep it. It has a double tube, only one side of it has lipstick in it. I put it on and look in the mirror. It is bright red, with a black outline partially around the lips. My lips look full and luscious. I decide I like this color better than the washed out pink I usually wear.
