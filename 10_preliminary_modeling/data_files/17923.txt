My boyfriend Jeremy and I were going for a walk.  I wanted to show him the park my maternal Grandpa Gerald had taken my brother Stuart and I to once long ago, but I had no idea how to get there.  We walked for a while and talked, with a solemn feeling.  He stopped to look at something, and I decided to continue on, driving my mother's car.  I found the park.  Everything felt odd like the park had some strange significance somehow.  Next to the play equipment was an old building.  In front was a setup of a large hamster cage with lots of hamsters.  I walked around it and stood, watching the hamsters.  Then my high school classmates Mack and Ryan showed up.  We caught up a little.  I told them about my four jobs.  They were still in college.  Then I had to go find Jeremy since he hadn't watched where I went and I figured he would be looking for me.  The mood was kind of sad or mourning.
