I was writing out invitations to a wedding when suddenly I seemed to be in the midst of a crowd of people who were celebrating something. It must have been my wedding because I wanted to open some gifts but someone stopped me saying that there would be time for that later. A gypsy came to the door and it developed she was Japanese and she seemed to be looking for someone. Then I was in an alley or basement or someplace small but dark. I saw two shadows on the wall and then just one. A woman was on the ground. She looked very still. This Japanese gypsy had hit her on the head. She was a very nice woman. She had done a ______ at the wedding and everyone liked her.
