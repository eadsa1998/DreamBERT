I am walking along a highway at night.  I am on the left side.  I see headlights, and as they get nearer, they start to swerve toward me.  I dive out of the way, and the car pulls up on the side of the highway.  I scramble into the ditch on the side and lie low, hoping they won't see me.  I know the people want to kill me, and I know why, but I don't remember why when I wake up.
