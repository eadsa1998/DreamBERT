I was walking around in a tough neighborhood with a group of friends (fraternity brother). As I walked I picked up heavy sticks until in my right hand I carried a large knife and five sticks. We crossed several individuals who looked as if they wanted a fight. We met a group of boy scouts (men of all ages) and passed them. Suddenly I seemed to realize that, the boy scouts were actually enemy soldiers invading us. I rushed back, alone, to warn our army and found that they had surrounded the enemy. We were on a group of hills around the enemy in the plain. I took a gun and started to shoot. The countryside turned into a large machine like a tank. We were on a raised portion of it and the enemy were sitting in a large section in the middle of it. After we had fired at them, we jumped down and to our surprise were captured by the enemy who were still alive. Then as an onlooker I watched loaded airplanes fly out of the machine to attack the country.
