I went into the Big Brother house for a random visit. I was talking to David, who was still there, about hearing outside information from the people in the runs. We were whispering quietly and he said yes. I asked if they'd told Skye that she was doing very well and he said yes. I said my Mom has been wondering that for a while. I remembered I'd only paid for 4 hours parking and I'd been there for like a day. I left to go check on my car, but it hadn't been ticketed. I moved it and bought a new ticket. Later I was playing this game where a serial killer dude is in your house and you have to wake up and save these 2 other people sleeping in the house without being seen. The killer was sneaking around doing other stuff too. It was dark and had weird lighting and was quite creepy.
