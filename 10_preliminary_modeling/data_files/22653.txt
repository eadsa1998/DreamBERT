It's a pilgrimage: men and women are walking with bunches of flowers, and they stop in front of a door, the door opens, and everybody disappears. I only see clearly a thin man with delicate features and black hair, and a woman with a shawl. All the others are blurry images. I don't hear anything, I only see the images.
