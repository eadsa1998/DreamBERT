I am put by some force in a house isolated by many miles on the beach. At first I don't want to enter, not knowing if I'm supposed to or not. Maybe someone lives there and I'm trespassing. Finally I go in, calling out, "Anybody home?" I live there alone. Now I'm going up a path that seems almost like a tunnel and it opens up to a huge beautiful lawn and a mansion. My neighbor is very rich. He's getting ready to go hunting. The dogs are huge and straining at the leash. I walk up and pet the dogs, looking unafraid of their potential power and danger. I do feel a tiny bit of concern but in general know these dogs like me. They like me so well, they refuse to obey their master's command to go hunt and hang around me to be petted. This actually pleases the master, who smiles approvingly. There are jealous ladies in the house.
