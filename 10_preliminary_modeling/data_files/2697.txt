I am living in a long narrow set of rooms, downstairs. I am hosting an OCA conference and am cleaning up and organizing after the people left. A woman neighbor comes in and shows me a lovely dress she made herself. We chat about all the extra traffic in the neighborhood with my guests. Then she shows me how she made the dress with snaps up the front and she graciously offers it to me if I want it and think it would be easy to use. I accept with pleasure. Now it's time to go for a ride on my horse. It is lovely, strong, healthy and frisky. I get up (no saddle), and we ride, happily running. It is effortless. After a long run, I pull up at a deep river where a man lies in the grass and watches me. I am unaware of him. I lie down and take my top off and sun for awhile, and then I get scared because what if I didn't tie down the horse properly and it goes away. I would be stranded and unable to get back home, too hard to walk back with arthritis. I double check the reins and hang onto it hard. I lean over and peer into the river and feel nervous with how deep it is and worry about falling in. Now I ride back home. We are like one and it is very effortless and nice. I bring the horse into my rooms and turn on the water faucet in the sink and it drinks. Then I spend lots of time grooming it. I feed it hay. It is important to take care of my good horse.
