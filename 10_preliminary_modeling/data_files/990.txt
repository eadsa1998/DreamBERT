I am in a room with 3 other women. I'm tired. It's late at night. I sit in a woman's lap. We are wearing costumes of some kind. She has her arms around me and kisses me. She tries to "French kiss" me. At first, I don't let her. Then I do. It's not a French kiss, like with tongues. It's like touching the core of something. The lips, a regular kiss, were there and in the center, like in the center of a flower, was a moist, tender, very sensitive to feeling something. We touched "cores." I felt slightly repelled but allowed it to happen. Something in my mind was assuring me this is O.K. It's always been forbidden but now it is O.K. and nice to do. It is important to do. She holds me in a caring way. Another woman is in a closet, sort of narrating thoughts. A slide show is happening. Lots more happened but it escapes me.
