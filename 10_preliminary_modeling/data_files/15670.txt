I was working at the bar, which was different. A guy asked for a Corona with lemon, and it was actually this weird thing that I had to mix with baked beans, but I think he just wanted lemonade and a cake. The queue was building up and I saw Cute Irish Guy (Kieran) there. He had a name badge on saying 'Lincoln F', which I thought was a weird name for an Irish bloke and wondered what his last name was. I finished making the Corona and left it. I gave Kieran his Budweiser and as he gave me a $20 note, his fingers lingered on mine. He said his usual "thank you very much" and walked off without his change. I put it aside. There was a gambling thing going on upstairs. The guy hadn't come back for his Corona thing and someone said he'd won the jackpot and left. An Asian lady told me to follow her through what looked like a ventilation system. I tied my hair back and people queued up behind me impatiently. I started climbing through and some parts squished my head. Climbing down pipes was easier and then it was like a game. I got to the bottom and then the lady was like 'just up here' and it was a long way up. I couldn't be bothered with it and 'paused' the game for now.
