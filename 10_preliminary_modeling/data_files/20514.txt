I was washing my face. I started to wash the bottom of the jersey shirt I wore. I wanted to wash my name off. An attendant came by and I hoped he would not reprove me for washing my shirt. He accused me of doing something which I hadn't done. He said I broke a rule. I told him that I did not do it, but he would not believe me, and he said he was going to punish me. My voice was very nervous. He left, but he still did not believe me.
