Ezra and I were both able to acquire an ice-cream we had invented. When we wanted it, we got it. Ezra's was this hazelnut Magnum type of thing and mine was something else. Everyone wanted to try his. We went to this shop and we were on this little go-kart thing and there was a poodle. We knocked everything over and the shop workers were annoyed.
