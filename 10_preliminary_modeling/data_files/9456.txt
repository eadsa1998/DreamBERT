With Marita, on train to U. Town. Arrive in no time at all. Then drive over bridge on bright, clear day. Blue sky, sun, trees, birds. Happy to be in U. Town. See Edward. He smiles. See his clear blue eyes. Very clear and happy. I say, "Here we are. At least to visit. I have never seen it look so beautiful before." He says, "But you should have seen it before. The river roared over this bridge, over everything." Marita has walked away and I warn her: "Be careful, Marita." But before we know it she has slipped in and has fallen into the water but is able to swim. But then her strength fails and she can't quite make it to shore. Edward leaps from the top of the bridge into the water and with strong strokes swims to meet her, garbs her just in time and they swim together to the shore. He pulls her out and he is tender and comforting. No accusations. I look for a towel to dry them off. Relieved.
