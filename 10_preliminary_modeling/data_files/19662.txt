The time was afternoon, and no train had passed for several hours, and there should be one along any minute now. I walked through the gate on to first track and look to the right. A train can be seen in the distance. I suddenly remember that the noise of one train sometimes drowns out the noise of one coming from opposite direction, and such an occurrence now might get me run down, so I step off of track to watch the oncoming train. It proves to be a freight. First, there are a couple of box cars, then a small engine (much like a switch engine); then a very big freight locomotive which I want to see more clearly. Opposite where I stand is a "cut," and in some way this shuts off my view of lower portion of the big engine, and I am unable to see its drive wheels, which are what I am most interested in. First 3 or 4 cars beyond engines are flat cars filled with black men, evidently laborers. Rest of train is made up of flat cars loaded with wood -- mostly stumps, logs, limbs, etc. -- which apparently was picked up in some timber along the tracks. Some of the stumps show signs of having been trimmed before being loaded -- i.e., the roots are all cut off at about some length, and some of the roots "evened up."
