I was a monster? At first I was just hiding in a bush, as me. An alligator or dinosaur and a blind woman were around and thought they heard something. I was friends with the woman's grandson. I hid in the bush, and the alligator thing smelled me, but she called it away before it found me. I decided to find somewhere to live and ran through the neighbourhood during the night. I stopped at a kid's house and it started to get light and people came out. There was nowhere to hide. This family invited me to eat with them. I was trapped in another time/universe or something.
