I was leaving the CO airport by car. There were many different roads leading out of the airport. Some of them were side by side but eventually split off to go in different directions. There were several downward spirals, as you might typically find leaving a parking garage except that there were much smaller in diameter and there were no walls or anything in the middle of the spiral. The traffic was very heavy and people seemed to be driving very fast. I was very nervous and concerned. Someone pointed out some mirrors that allowed you people to safely travel down the spirals at a high speed. I wasn't sure I trusted it but noticed several cars on it that seemed to be descending safely. At times, or in some way, it doesn't seem that I'm in a car at all but rather that I'm looking down at all of this. I see the spiral in-front of me but just slightly off-center to my left. These other roads seem to be below the spiral, coming from under the spiral out to my right. Now it feels as though I'm walking on a sidewalk alongside the straight roads, with a man, talking about these roads and other things related to the airport. A helicopter lands very nearby. He decides that he is going over to ask the pilot if he can have a ride. I don't want a ride but I walk over there with him. The pilot agrees to give him a ride. When he takes off I am on the outside with my arms and legs wrapped around something that resembles a square, plastic, milk crate. I am holding on tightly through one of the openings. The pilot is talking with someone on the radio who is telling him that he is not allowed to transport someone the way he is transporting me. The pilot tells the other person that it is that person's fault because they didn't do something they should have.
