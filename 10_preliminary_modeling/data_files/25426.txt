 I'm playing ten-man tackle football in my neighbor Wilma and Gary Stein's yard. My roommate Stephen Ramos and his mother watch the game from a balcony across Home Avenue. My team kicks off. A man from my Educational Psychology class, Jason, receives the ball. I eventually tackle him. On the next play I tackle him for no yards gained. On the third play I intercept a pass and run it back a ways. Then my team kicks a field goal. We get two kicks, worth three points each. We have to kick the ball over a telephone line. The ball gets lodged in a nearby house on one kick.
