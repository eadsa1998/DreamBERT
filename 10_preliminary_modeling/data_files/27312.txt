I dreamed my mother and I had been doing something which had taken quite a bit of effort, i.e., like shopping or housecleaning. We began to argue and I felt very big like a mountain looming over a valley. My mother is shorter than I but not very much so. I saw her face turn red as she shouted at me and her hair all flung about her face. I don't know what we were arguing about, but this picture of my mother stuck with me vividly.
