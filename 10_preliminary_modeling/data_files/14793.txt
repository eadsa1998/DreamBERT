I was at a train station. Someone and I had gotten a new job looking after it. Olivia and Walter (both from Fringe) were there. Some guy threw a small rock at me but it hit a post and fell. He was confused but then it turned out there was a box which he pressed a button on and then it shot off. He showed us and it landed on the train tracks. The train came and the box shot out a blow-up thing and the train stopped, but then kept going, pushing the blow-up thing along. I went to the next train station which was a short way away, to tell them, but the door wouldn't open from that side. Walter did something else and a 'cab' landed on the tracks and then bounced off. Olivia went over and written in the sand was a guess that Walter had written before that it would land there.
