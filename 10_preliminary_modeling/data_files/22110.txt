I dreamed I had an accident with my car. First I fell into a ditch, then the wheels came off and then the engine and finally the body of the car went inside a station wagon. In my dream I thought that what had happened was a dream and at the same time I knew that it wasn't true; that is, that I was dreaming, but that it had really happened. Then I awoke.
