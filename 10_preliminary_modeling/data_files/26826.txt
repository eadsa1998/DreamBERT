 I'm in a room with my brother Wally and two others. I'm masturbating, sitting on a toilet in the open. I use my left hand to stimulate my anus lightly while I masturbate. Pieces of feces come out of my anus. They are hard and crusty, some large and some small. I drop these pieces into the toilet. I think this is embarrassing and unusual that I'm masturbating in front of these people, but I don't concede the experience is any less real. It is also less disagreeable to me: some kind of social or mental compromise has been reached. Wally says there's no more lotion, which I had used to masturbate. I give myself fellatio by bending over. I'm not able to fit much of my erection in my mouth: just the tip. I decide I'll only give myself fellatio when I'm about to ejaculate. There is an area of the room where a shower curtain could be set up: there is a metal ring structure to which a gray shower curtain is attached. Wally comes over and helps me set up the curtain. There is a metal track-like structure attached to the ceiling, to which the curtain rings are attached. The curtain slides on this track. I'm wearing a pair of my button fly Levi jeans and white brief underwear, but my erection is exposed as we set up the curtain. I'm in the shower then, to have a private place to masturbate. There is almost no room between the shower curtain and the wall: no room to move, just to stand. I slide down to the floor, sitting, and lift the curtain over my head, putting it behind me. I unbutton my fly and continue to masturbate: I just want to ejaculate. Others see me, and I feel embarrassed, but I just want to orgasm. I give myself fellatio and semen comes out of my erection. It's very salty, and I spit it out onto a while athletic sock that I have. I don't have the physical sensation of orgasm, though I did suck some semen out, so I continue to masturbate to have an orgasm.
