["Fireworks and cute critters"]  I am in a room. I ask where my father is. They say he's up on the hill setting off the fireworks so we can enjoy them. I look out a high wide window and see fireworks and black puffs of smoke. I notice it is daylight and ask why he didn't wait for night so we could see them better. The colors are faded. Someone says it's because some people who would enjoy this won't be here later. I go sit on a couch. I see an odd critter, sort of like a furry deer with a flat wide head. I am sure it will run away if I reach out to pet it. I touch it and suddenly it leaps up on the couch beside me and wants to be petted more. Very affectionate. I am amused. It is cute.
