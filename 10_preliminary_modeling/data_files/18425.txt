The last dream fragment just before waking concerned being in a bookshop with Andre Weitzenhoffer (whom I've never met) trying to buy a copy of his book, General Principles of Hypnotism. The only copy that can be found has some of the front pages ripped out. Weitzenhoffer says something about having to contact the publisher. Arlene Morgel, who is now there somehow, says this (the book being ripped and otherwise out of stock) is a bad sign, implying W. has been going steadily downhill.
