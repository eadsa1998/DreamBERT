I went to this restaurant place but it was like a cinema. There was a small TV in front. They were watching Office Space. I saw Ron Livingston but he looked different. People from school were there and we were all on Facebook. I found a photo with Eugene and he had commented on it. Eugene, Samantha and others were hanging out to discuss university life. There was a movie on and people didn't like it so they left. I got a project and stuff for it. Before Ezra could get some movie in, there was The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and some new movie but he wanted Spiderman. Later, I went out the back with Mom. She said she invited Meyer over to hang out, "but I'm not a lesbian". I said "I didn't say you were".
