My twelve-year-old sister and I were walking down Silsby Road in University Heights. It was a summer evening; a negro was following us. We became frightened and ran to a house and asked to be taken in. A young boy about 12 was the only person at home, but he let us in. As soon as we got inside, the negro came to the door and attempted to come in. The door was locked, however, and he remained outside. It grew very dark and I looked out the window and saw the negro glaring at me. I thumbed my nose at him and he ran after another small boy who was passing by, caught him and put him into the trunk of a blue 1947 Chrysler. I called the police, but when I looked back to the street the negro had driven away. At this point I awoke.
