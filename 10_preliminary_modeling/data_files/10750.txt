Two friends and myself were staying overnight at a very nice home, only we didn't know the people who lived there. We just stayed there over night. It was amusing cause we were hiding from the people in the morning. I remember having chewing gum and I got some stuck on one of the girl's coats. I remember hiding behind the door in hopes that we didn't see anyone cause we wouldn't know what to say to them.
