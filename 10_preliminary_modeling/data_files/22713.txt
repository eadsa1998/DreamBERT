It was a dark night with heavy rain. My boyfriend was waiting for me to go to the movies, but the moment I left home, a stranger came up to me and offered his car. Seeing the rain, I accepted his invitation. He took me to a very beautiful house where we talked and listened to music. After a while had elapsed, I remembered that my boyfriend must have been waiting for me. When I found him, he looked at me and slapped me and without saying a word, he turned around the left. I started to cry desperately and the stranger told me, "Stop crying; it's not worth it." I awoke.
