 I'm at a school. It is Monday. I have a class at 4:00, which is about to begin, and a class at 7:00. My friend Matt Yams may be in my 4:00 class. I'm in the classroom, but I leave for a bit before it starts. I'm going to a restaurant. I see my friend Sam Kingsley's mother Faye Klump. I go in, and we sit down together at a table with two older men and talk. I joke with her and say that I own this restaurant. The two men and I eat fried chicken.
