[1997-05-22] I was in the computer room in my basement here and my friend J's daughter was here with me. She was trying to print some stuff and I was helping her with the computer and I was asking her if she ever used Print-Shop. And we were talking about Q&amp;A and WordPerfect and I forgot to run my speech program and was having trouble figuring out where I was and she was kind of helping me. In the dream his daughter, who in reality is 40 sounded like she was 20. Next I remember being at the Guild for the Blind in Hingeville. I was walking through there smoking a pipe and the tobacco smelled really good, like cinnamon [I haven't smoked a pipe in 10 years in reality]. I was walking through there talking to some people and all of a sudden I could hear all these little kids coming in and somebody came over to me and said "do you hear the fire?" At first I said no, but then I heard some sirens off in the distance. They said it was next door at a restaurant which I remember having been in before. Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked "How bad does it look?" and she said "Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze." Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down "What are you doing here? Get out of here now!" And I responded "I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this." I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad. Then rain started to fall on us but it may have been water from the hose. I said, lets get out of this or we'll have to go home and take a bath. I also remember at some point, being able to smell the smoke, it had a rather acrid smell typical of house fires.
