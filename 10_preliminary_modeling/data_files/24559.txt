A new girl was hired to cut our hedges (she's my baby sitter in real life). When I saw her I knew she had once been my baby sitter. No one believed me. I tried to tell them she was married. I don't know why it's important. Setting: In front of my house. Characters: My baby sitter, and some other people. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, confused.
