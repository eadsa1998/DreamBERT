The last one must have been a nightmare or something, I was standing in the backyard, talking [indecipherable] to this person, wondering when she was getting out of school. Soon, she had a kid or whatever, then we start backing up, we were in the back yard, and she suddenly turned into my sister for some reason and gave me this piece of metal. We were backing out from behind this shed and suddenly I heard a wolf and I tried to yell but I couldn't yell, and I dreamed that the wolf was getting closer and closer and then I got scared and woke up.
