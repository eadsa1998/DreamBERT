I was at school in gym class and we were playing volleyball. I was playing a very good game. The guy I liked was on my team. We were unstoppable. One of my friends was on my team too, but she wasn't as good as me. I was asking the guy I liked out. Then my friend came by and asked him right before me. I was so mad at her that I punched her and knocked her out.
