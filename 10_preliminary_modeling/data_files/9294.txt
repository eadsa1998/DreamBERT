I was working at the computer, helping someone with edits to their website. It looks like they had created tables and within each cell of the table I was working on there was a box at the top inside of the cell, one at the bottom inside of the cell, and text in between. The boxes were causing me some difficulty. I was trying to get them to look good while still making them function the way the website owner wanted them to. Occasionally, I would ask the owner to look at what I had done and they would try to tell me specifics as to how it wasn't quite what they wanted. Then I could use that to try to edit it further.
