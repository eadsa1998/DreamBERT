Chloe and Eric: they return to M. City. They say they had some very narrow escapes on the road. At one point they saw bodies stacked high (like in Auschwitz) -- very gruesome. Also Ben had some strange growths on his thumb and a deep cut that won't heal. Worried about it. Then we sit around and talk about their trip. Eric wants to show photos but Chloe wants to talk and is very serious. M. plays piano very poorly. I am embarrassed. Chloe asks me to baby-sit.
