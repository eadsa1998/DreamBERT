I was at a haunted house with some people for some TV show. Mickey (Scream 2) was there. I ended up in a room with poison gas with another girl except I got out and then this dog chased me and I got in the house from another door. Then the dog took some clothes and we were told it was part of the show. But I hadn't brought any clothes. Jillian was there and some fat women. I borrowed clothes off Jillian to wear and some from a fat girl. Jillian said something about me stretching her clothes. Also this lady said to the girls something about wearing a bra and I said I wasn't because I forgot and don't want the responsibility. When I got the clothes off the girls I went into the toilet and so did the fat girl. I got changed and when I came out, Mickey was outside the cubicle covered in the fat girl's blood. Something also happened at Nana's but I don't remember.
