I was sitting in Prof. B_____'s class taking an exam. My girl friend was sitting next to me, taking the exam also. Professor B_____ walked in the room with a woman - he introduced her to the class as his wife. They sat up in front of the class and whispered to one another. I finished the exam before anyone else and then went up to the front desk and sat between Mr. B_____ and his wife. They continued to whisper behind my back - I tried to hear what they were saying but couldn't figure out what they were talking about. Suddenly a bee flew into the room - my friend was frightened and stopped writing her exam - the bee then flew out of the window and she continued writing her exam. I walked up to her and asked her why she was writing so much - as I had written a very short exam ... she continued writing. I then walked back to the front of the class and sat down with Mr. B_____ and his wife. This time I did not sit in the middle but besides Mr. B_____. He and his wife continued to whisper. I recall that I was "all dressed up" - wore high heels instead of bobby socks - also wore one of my best dresses.
