["Tired and sleepy."] I am on a grassy gentle rolling hill meadow. There is a group of young women, one is Anita B. from high school. They are a group I join in with late. They all ready have their official pen given to group members. Mine looks different than theirs. There are at least 2 "monk" like teachers, male. I lie down on the grass. I feel so tired and sleepy. I can't seem to keep my eyes open. The monks encourage me to get up and join in activities with the women. I groggily get up. Anita B. hugs me and does this rocking hug that is like dancing. She moves us up the grassy slope to where the women already had their school desks, hidden under the surface of the grass. They dig down to reveal the "pigeon hole" desks. I see their pens are wrapped in pink tissue paper, mine is in white. I ask why wrapped in pink. Anita says because that indicates things that glow.
