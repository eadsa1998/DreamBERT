I was a contestant in a quiz show. After I was quizzed, my sister appeared as a contestant. She knew some of the answers, but did not come out ahead of the several other contestants. My mother was in the audience. When the show ended, the others left the stage, but my sister remained seated there for a few moments and stared ahead as though she were in a daze. I was startled by her stare. Later I was with some other people. I was clad in a bathrobe. My mother came up to me and said she had bad news for me. She explained that I would have to go to court to answer a charge made by some man.
