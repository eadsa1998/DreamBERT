I'm chasing after an artifact in the islands. The small bead-string of land is somewhere remote in the Caribbean. They are pine islands, scrub forests and shanty settlements. Shallow sea and reef lay in between. Large companies have set up some mysterious operations on one of the larger islands, requiring copious amounts of power. The adventure begins when I hijack a twin-engine split-tail seaplane and fly into this island in pursuit of a bad guy. I'm with a close ally in the plane. Someone who I care about and trust. The bad guy has henchmen. They thwart our escape. We incapacitate or kill many of them, but they slow us down enough for the bad guy to escape in a small, single-engine plane. We've been in pursuit for months. I wasn't going to let him get away. In a mad, desperate, injured dash, I make it to my waiting plane. I can't really fly well. But I am co-pilot anyway. The bad guy has a smaller, more maneuverable plane. He takes off through the mess of power lines. At first I don't think it's an issue -- but we soon learn there's no way to blast skyward with the big plane's power with the lines overhead. Instead, we fly low under them and try to accelerate. The bad guy zips out and takes off toward another island.
