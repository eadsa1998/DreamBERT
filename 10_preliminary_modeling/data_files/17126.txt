I was in English, and we were reading the papers we'd written.  I later read the word "notice" and could not figure out if I was remembering the way something was written in The Color Purple or if that was the paper in my dream.  I met my aunt and uncle's foreign exchange student Yuriko after class.  She lived two years in Canada.  She was wearing a sky-turquoise flowery kimono.  She was somehow connected to the ocean.  She spoke French.  Somehow I had known I was going to meet her, and I knew we were both going to the movies again the same night.
