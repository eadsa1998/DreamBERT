I was with Nathan Scott (One Tree Hill). We were signing a marriage certificate thing. We had to sign a different paper and then a lot more. On the last one I signed my name, although my last name was "Abrams" and I wrote "I -- Nathan" in this really nice writing. Nathan had written "I -- Izzy" the same way.
