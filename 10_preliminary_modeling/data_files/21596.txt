We parked the car in Hinkley and stopped to see Charlie Charvat. He was standing in his shorts with his baby in his arms on the porch. He didn't know we were there. A fellow came up to me with something on his mind. He said something about my car and kept on hinting. I said, "I parked my car properly." Then I asked him what did he mean and he just hinted and would not say what. I got mad and was threatening him, but he wouldn't talk. We walked to where the car was and there was a gang of fellows standing around. One of the fellows came up to the car and hit it and put a couple of dents in the body. I pushed him away and told him again, "I'm going to sue this fellow. You know who he is and you are going to be my witnesses." They didn't answer me, but turned away from me. This fellow came at the car with a pitchfork. Me and my partner kept him away and finally got the fork away from him. Then we found out they were peeved at me and the car because I laid a big cardboard box on top of a tub of water. When I took it off, they were relieved and I apologized. I said, "I laid it there without thinking that there was a tub of water under it." We drove along where the streetcar tracks were from Fairchance to Rivertown. I had to straighten the wheel for peanuts. He was driving. The fork was broken in the fellow's hands when he came at the car by me and my friend. I looked up the date of my insurance and I saw June 1.
