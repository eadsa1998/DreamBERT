 There is some kind of party going on. It's happening at a house that is being remodeled by the Dirty River Park in Oak Valley. It might be out house. My dad is in charge. Our neighbors, Mary and Kent Robbins come. My dad brings home two huge bowls of tacos and burritos. They are on top of a refrigerator, which is by the big tree near the alley adjacent the compost pile. After I see these, I ask my dad if there is any food around. He tells me there is a big bowl of tacos and burritos to eat. He is eating some now. It looks like they are filled with something white and creamy.
