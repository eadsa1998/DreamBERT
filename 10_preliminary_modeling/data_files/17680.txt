We were in Disneyland, I think.  There was a building with three theatres in it.  The one on the left was a travel/worldwide theme.  My mother and I walked down the long stairs to the theatre, but I don't remember watching anything.  I remember being back outside the front talking to my dorm roommate Sally at a cash register.  I think it was some sort of group adventure we were preparing for.  I think my longtime classmate Mark might have been in our group too.  Plans changed a little bit before we went out.  Then it seemed like we were at the zoo.  There were dry rolling hillsides.  We started trekking and came to some yak I think.  One had curly hair like the man in the video we saw in class yesterday.   Another had a moustache.  They invited us inside.  There was a table or something in the center that my mother sat down on.  Then it rose up; it was a trap.  I ran to the left and started pulling sets of floppy disks that said something on them, I wish I could remember what.  A piece of the puzzle had come together for me.  We had been collecting pairs of disks at various locations all along.  I took those and sorted through, looking only for the ones that said the same specific thing on them.  We went back towards the starting place, and were near my parents' stereo.  There was a rubber-banded bunch of papers for our journey, and I pulled out a map.  There was an animal- perhaps a pig or a bull, on the front, with little colored dots in various places around the face.  It was a map, and the colored dots were locations to find the disks.  It was hard to read, though, because it had crayon coloring all over it, as did several other pictures.  Someone had drawn tongues into every mouth.
