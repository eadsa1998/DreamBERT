Mike Kovacs handed me a fat mss: "I was sustained for years in a Communist prison by one sentence from a Mark Harris novel." I didn't remember the sentence, but it was not profound to me. It was so profound and meaningful to MK that he wrote 300 pages of commentary and praise of it; and in giving me the copy, I noticed it was rather faint Xerox, so faint that I was immediately afraid that it could not be Xeroxed again; and I didn't want to part with the "original." I handled the heavy thing, single-spaced and compact and unvarying to the outer edges in style.
