I had this red book that I was looking through. It was little and the pages were kind of thick cardboard. And it had these scenes from like in a church, of like praying girls and angels, and it was showing you like what you're supposed to do when you like get communion and stuff. And there was black print under a red background, _______ that's under. And I was looking through that book, and while I was looking through that book, I had a lockable diary that I had opened, and I started writing in it, "Okay, I have found this book, and now I'm going to tell a story." And I was deciding what story I was going to tell. Oh, my gosh! [thunder sounds] Getting closer! So before I wrote anything more in this diary book, there was a tape that came with the red book of like prayers and stuff, and the tape had like a choir singing and then a background accompaniment and a girl speaking. And what you had to do was, they put the girl speaking in the left panel and the accompaniment music in the right panel so that you could turn the balance knob and adjust mix pretty much. Well, Mom's boom box was plugged in, in my room here, and it had LED's on the front, which is something that hers doesn't. And it had LED's on the front and it had ______ meters, and I played the tape and I was adjusting the balance knob, adjusting the mix, even though in reality her boombox doesn't have a balance knob, and man, it got me really excited in an embarrassing way. And I went in the bedroom, and then I woke up.
