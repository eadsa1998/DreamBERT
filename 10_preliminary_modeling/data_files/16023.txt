I went to this small cinema to see some horror film. Dan Palmer was there and he sat next to the guy next to me and waved hello. His hair was longish and scruffy. He saw some people he knew afterwards and went to talk and sit with them. I moved seats and someone voted for the next movie which was called Suicide Tattoo. I hadn't seen it but had heard of it. I moved to the front row but there were lights that annoyed me and it was hurting my neck so I moved to the back where Dan Palmer was. It was too far from the screen so I moved forward.
