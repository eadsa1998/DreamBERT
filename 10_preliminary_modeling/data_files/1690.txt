I am in a wheelchair. Someone says, "Let's go downstairs and make fresh bread." I pull my chair around me like a deflated flotation device. I call Michael over. He's driving a two-seater with a small truck bed behind it, quite fancy. I ask him if he were to get a set of tools, which ones would he get? I don't want him to know I'm thinking of getting him some tools as a gift. A man calls us over. He's upset we're all in chairs, or maybe I'm thinking he might be upset. He says, "Well, for instance, what if I was black instead of white?" Lucy says it wouldn't make any difference to her. She's blind. [BL]
