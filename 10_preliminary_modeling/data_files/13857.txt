I got to school late. I thought I had chemistry because it was Wednesday but this random class was in there. I went to English (which was in a different class) and saw all these old school books of everyone in the class on random desks. No-one was in there. I had been put between Dmitri and Alejandro. I saw Elijah's book. I was looking for Eugene's desk but then he and a few others came in. Duane and Eugene were playing Pokemon together and I was playing by myself. I ended up talking to Evelyn about Neopets until I said "Your mother's gay". Her password was 'rarity'. Ms Solomon said we were going to the library, so we went to the library. Ms Olmstead complained when I cleaned up some mess. I was outside the library and these two girls were saying that people never knew what they had in their bags. I tried to get my bag on, but it was too heavy. They said they had put sand in it and I chased after them and I was going to throw it at them when some other girls heard what was going on. Dad went to Midvale shops and bought a Danish. Eugene was there and Dad had said something about his leavers jacket (something rude of a sexual nature). As we were leaving, Eugene and some others were laughing at a bus stop.
