Okay, this is sometime in the middle of July, 2002. Last night I dreamt that I was at Bancroft Middle School, but I was in Warrior Vision from Westport High School, and I was sitting there at their board and it had a blue faders except they weren't uniform all the way across. The mono-mike channels were pots and the rest were blue faders, and I was trying to work this board and we were under a lot of stress to try and get this show done right now, and Mrs. Talmadge was trying to get us to do something. And then the bell rang and Melinda came over to me and said that Mrs. Hollander's class was going to be in the auditorium. And then all of a sudden the halls and stuff were like at Bancroft, and Mrs. Hollander's class was up on this other floor and I had to run up to her room and get my stuff. And then I was like running through the halls to get to the auditorium on time. I had books in my arm, but no bag, and I was running through the halls and I was coming down a stair thing and I fell face first, I was like falling down the stairs and then I woke, and my books went everywhere and I woke up.
