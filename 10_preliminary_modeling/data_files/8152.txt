I was with Matthew. We were looking at some newspapers. The one newspaper had quite a few, maybe 4 or 5, sections of full-color comic strips. It wasn't a Sunday paper. I thought that was very unusual. There was another black and white newspaper that I was looking at. It had comic strips in the business section, where they announce people's new positions. Someone wrote a comic strip about each of these people. I thought whoever was responsible for it wouldn't have alot of time to come up with or create them. In one of them, one man had alot of names. This man had maybe ten or twelve names. I thought that was very unusual. Matthew and I were looking at these newspapers together. We both got up and I was going to use the bathroom. He had gotten there first and had started to run a bath. I went into another bathroom. He saw me going in there. I said I was just going to use this one since you are getting ready to take a bath in the other.
