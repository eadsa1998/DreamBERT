My best friend Emma and my boyfriend Jeremy went with me to the doctor.  I don't recall my ailment and Emma and Jeremy handled the meds for the most part without me, so I didn't know them, either.  Going back to the room afterwards, we were looking for apartment 362.  Tried the wrong room, there was a guy in there.  Back in our room Jeremy told me to take my clothes off and turn around.  I did so without question because I was pretty out of it.  The surprise was a suppository.
