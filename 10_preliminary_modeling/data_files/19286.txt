The setting began in a hotel like place. We went into our room (me, my sister, dad, stepmom). I walked into the bathroom, dropped my clothes to take a shower. The bathroom continued on and sort of turned into what I thought was the Mall of America except I was naked. Sometime later, I had clothes on and found one of my really good friends. We walked outside into this extremely cold, snowy field. There was this farm house and the farmer was screaming at us. He said, "Watch out for it at the end of the chain!" It was this huge freaky  dog thing. To escape it, me and my friend had to jump into a cage.
