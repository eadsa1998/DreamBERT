Grabbed her and kissed her. Looking back into the past. Plaid, plaid. Revenge on TMM. They've kicked me out of management. I'm with Carrie, Carlos and saw black people (an old shiny woman). We are stepping on a circle of stones - not touching the ground. Each step costs TMM money. On a trip. Go on a ferry with Tracy and Jessica. We're in Maine. Water is freezing. Tracy dips her feet in. Our boat leans - almost makes her medicine fall in water. A girl on the raft (ferry) is doing a little drug test and a red light goes off showing positive.
