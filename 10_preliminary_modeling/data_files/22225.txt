One day I went from my house to the country, looking for solitude. When I was already on my way, I found an old man who told me, "Give me money," and I did this with delight. I continued on my way, singing and whistling, because I was afraid that my parents hadn't given me permission and when I was half-way there, I returned to my home. When I got to my room, I saw a very nice girl sleeping on my bed and when I acted surprised, she said, "Don't be afraid. I am going to be your faithful companion. I am going to lead you through the good road." I asked her who she was and she said that she had been sent from far-away places by the man I gave money to, and the old man had recommended that she be my companion. I asked her what her name was and she said "Silvia" and I woke up.
