Frank and I are on a LONG JOURNEY by train: we are coming up from San Diego, L.A., S.F. and going cross country to Washington DC. Frank wants to take a boat trip as well and I am angry that he wants to be away such a long time; he tells me that it was I who first suggested the boat trip. I don't know where to get off the train and remember vividly standing at the open door as the train jerks to a stop and I almost fall out.!! feeling angry and depressed......
