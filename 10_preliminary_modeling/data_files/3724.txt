I am in a hospital. I have a female roommate, sort of like Michelle Pfeiffer. I am being released and so is she, but then she comes back to tell me she has to have a surgery and can't leave yet. Her surgery will happen on the 21st. I say, "Too bad," and she leaves for another room. I wish, after she is gone, I had asked for her name and address so I could write her. Not that I wanted to, but that is what people do and I should have. I am packing up the files I had been working on while in the hospital, the Hollywood information on movies I'd been watching. Then Grandma Agnes comes in, much slimmer than she usually was, and asked me why I wasn't at the family gathering at her house yesterday. I say, embarrassed and caught, "I was busy doing stuff." So she, two aunts and my father come in to visit. They sit in a circle on chairs and I am lying down on a couch. We all go to sleep during our conversation. I wake up and so do they, and I feel embarrassed like I should have been more attentive. But I also think it is amusing that we all fell asleep together. Some visit!
