I go down a long narrow room to the left to get shoes. And hose to finish dressing. I want to sit down but the long white bench is all covered with bits of cakes of blacking. I look out window and see mother outside, looking sad. She had just been let out of a car and I judge she can't remember which house to enter. I say to R, "If you don't go and let her, I will." She says, "Oh, you go." But E. who is standing near says, "No, R. you go, you have your coat right there." So she goes but mother is now lying down in the snow. I think she looks real glad to see R. and must be saying so. R. helps her up and I ask her if she isn't cold.
