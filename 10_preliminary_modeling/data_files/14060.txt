I had been to this place to get a TER before and passed, but went back to enter another course. I went with Calvin who was sometimes Haley (One Tree Hill). It was in this huge building full of obstacle courses, all physical activity stuff. If you made one mistake you failed. I got to the last obstacle, which was this little playground and had to climb up a rope ladder and go down it. I saw Eugene and his mates and Calvin pointed it out. He was also like "Oh, I might go to University too". Eugene waved at us. I went back to get my shoes, when I finished. Then the people there congratulated us and said we passed. I had used a fake ID because I didn't know if you could do it twice. Peyton (One Tree Hill) didn't want something either. They let us off. Then it was episode of Red Dwarf. Rimmer wanted to be a "matre d" which was someone who goes out to kill themselves in a war.
