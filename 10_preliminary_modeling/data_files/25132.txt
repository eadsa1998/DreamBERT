 I'm up by Rock Lake. I'm an observer. Jet ski-like snowmobiles are going across open water and frozen ice. There is a police group there. I try to stop these snowmobiles. The offenders (the snowmobilers ?) are chased. The head policewoman is hard-core. There may be a movie being filmed. There are dogsleds there. There are two dogs, one of which is swimming. I go out on the ice and call it to me. It comes up and licks my face.
