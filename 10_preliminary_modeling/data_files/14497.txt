There was a new season of Scrubs. The Janitor said "I'm Dr. Matthews", but he was actually talking to Dr. Matthews. Then he realized who he was talking to. I don't know where we were but had a list of certain personalities he did and when. One of them was an Australian cop and said "Badge!" (or at least, it looks like badge, it's hard to read). He also talked about kangaroos. He named his tools and his mop didn't work now? I looked at his family tree and he had a son called Eugene. It had a weird layout and it said he was called "Eugene 2nd Eugene". I started fixing it up. Ezra was there too. Mom said it was offensive without having been asked to fix it. Turk (Scrubs) was somewhere.
