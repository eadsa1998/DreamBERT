I was talking to Vikram on MSN, then went to make food. The house was different and had a big kitchen. There were sandwiches and cakes on a plate and they kept getting taken. I asked Mom and she said it wasn't her. I went back to my room with lunch. I was in the lounge room at the old house and there were ads for Chicken Treat and Chicken Treat stuff all over the room, including a uniform. Then I was at a shop. There were shelves with bed sheets. I grabbed one and pulled off something that was eating it and I was surprised. Someone pulled a light green one off the shelf and then it was Arnie. He sat at a bench next to mine, then Vikram joined. Arnie asked Vikram something and he replied and I felt weird, then I remembered I hadn't heard them speak before. Neither had much of an accent. Arnie said 'don't make fun of my accen't and Vikram said 'that's part of the fun' and I said 'what about mine, that's going to get some laughs'.
