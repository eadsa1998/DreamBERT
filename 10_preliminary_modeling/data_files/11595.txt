I was lying in bed. My uncle came into the room. He said something about the development of aortic arches. Then my uncle was replaced by my former piano teacher (male). He started to talk about doughnuts and tubes. Piano teacher said each doughnut weighed one pound because of these special tubes. Therefore a dozen weighed two ton. He asked me if I'd like a doughnut. Then the front wall of the bedroom was gone. Instead there was a baking shop. He got a bag of doughnuts. He showed me the doughnuts with tubes. He offered me a doughnut. I took one. He took what looked like a cupcake. It had chocolate icing. He took a chair and sat at the foot of my bed.
