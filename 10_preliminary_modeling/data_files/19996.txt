I was a hospital patient. I was in church with other patients. A woman patient stood up as the men seated themselves. She was slender, and looked to be 20. Later I was walking to church for Mass and I was wearing a suit. I found that I could float horizontally about 5 feet from the ground. I traveled about 5 miles an hour, eluding the attendants. I came to a motor-powered paper cutter. Someone said it was for killing fish. The fish would trip a switch releasing the blade, which then came down upon the fish. It needed some glycerin. I went to get some. I tried to float again, but I couldn't. I noticed that I wasn't wearing my suit coat, and I assumed that I needed the coat in order to float. (I don't recall when I took it off, but I was wearing it while I was floating.)
