In this dream I remember being in my car on the expressway heading west. I was coming into the toll area. When I got there, I had to reach over to the wrong side of the car to pay the toll. Then as I left this toll area, I came into another one about 50 yards past the first. I didn't pay at this one; I just drove through. Next I remember being on a bus and getting off at the corner of my block. There seemed to be two girls, about 19 or 20, who got off at the same place. They got off out of the back of the bus, and I left through the front doors. I seemed to know these girls, but I can't remember who they were. Then I remember walking down my street until I came to my house. I don't recall going into my house. This is all I remember of the dream.
