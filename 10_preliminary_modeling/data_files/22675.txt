In this dream I was with a friend named Vicky in Union Street. We were about to go into Sears, when suddenly a car stopped right beside us. I saw two people inside -- a man and a woman -- and I recognized the man who was a well-known TV actor, Fernando Larranaga, but he looked different than what he looks on TV. He had a beard and moustache. We went over to him, to ask his opinion about some matter, but he answered us in a bad way, with a cuss word. We were horrified, and the lady who was with him also insulted us. We stepped back, but then I reacted and answered him, and said, "You were looking for it!" And then I insulted him and his profession, and the girl got out of the car and tried to hit us with her purse. I struggled with her and pushed her, and she threw some object on my back when I was trying to run away. I saw Vicky paralyzed with fear, and decided to go back, and I got things out of somewhere, which I threw at her face and body and I grabbed Vicky by the hand and laughed at having been able to hit her and take revenge for what she had done to me. I went into Sears, but I wasn't in the door on Union Street, but in the rear door. I went in running and here my dream ended.
