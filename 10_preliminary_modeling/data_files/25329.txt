 I'm in Germany. Something about or with an inheritance happens. A man trades me 23 American dollars for German "dollars". Later, I think I could have been ripped off. I ride in transportation in the snow. I say to the German man I am with, "Ich brauche eine Jacke." We speak a little bit of German together.
