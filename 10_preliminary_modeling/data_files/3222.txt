A group of people are waiting to use a public restroom. I am inside and point out to someone that there are two stalls that flush, one in a stall for privacy, the other just out there in the room. I say we could save time if we used both. Someone sits on the private one and farts and makes noises loudly as a statement about how they feel about doing this publicly. I grimace and smile; it is expected they would do this childish thing, and it is kind of funny. I go out to the group and tell them that we do have two stalls and it is their choice if they feel they can handle the embarrassment to use the open one. We'll get done faster that way.
