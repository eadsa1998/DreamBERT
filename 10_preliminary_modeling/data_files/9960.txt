We are staying with old friends in Arizona at a Psych. convention. Their home is a big mess and I see our friend's husband laughing and he jumps up and down on a pile of bottles; he also tells of a complicated scheme of a kick-back at the railroad yards. I see a green light flashing; -- See a river at flood stage: huge green breakers as the river rushes past us. My friend wants me to help her put a small child to bed: it is a brat but I don't want to do it. "I am on vacation." Wendy and a friend go shopping for fancy clothes and French perfume. /s/--I address a green envelope to someone in England, but can't quite read it; so I leave it unfinished....
