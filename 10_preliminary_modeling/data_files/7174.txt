I moved from one window to the next where there was a larger counter on which to write and on one side of which a woman had laid her baby. I told her to lay the child on hers. I went to lie down myself after lunch. Then I went back to my room but the two beds were unmade, the toilet gone, a chamber pot and slop jar by the door. I wanted to change my dress but I must lock the door since they must have let others use it while I was gone. Where was my key? Then I saw Miss W. in a yellow dress at the door of the room opposite. I called to her, "My toilet is gone." But she kept on talking to some woman in the next room. Finally she paid attention to me and said the toilet was full of gravel. I wondered if she was going to blame me. I woke up trying to count in Chinese in both dialects I had known.
