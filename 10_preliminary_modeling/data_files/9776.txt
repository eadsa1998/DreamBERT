Father Andrew comes to my office where I work as a civil service worker. We go out together and lie down on a couch: He asks me about Marissa, and tells me he does not feel like embracing her any more; wants to embrace me. We are very close. "What happened in your case?" he asks. I explain and tell him how I came out of my depression. He asks if it will happen with her. I say it will get better. He turns to me and embraces me on the shoulder. "I got a new insight," I say and we leave and go back to office... where 3 people (women) wait for me.
