I was at a meeting at the B'nai B'rtih Hillel Foundation. I was alone in a room with a member of the committee which I head. Apparently there was the first time I pictured her in a sexual role. I tried to get a date with her for the coming Friday night because I would be unable to see my girl then. She said she had a date already, but I felt that she'd break it if I talked a little more about it. I then awoke.
