I was going to get married and we were having a pre-wedding dinner. It was in a banquet room at the Holiday Inn. I remember my whole family was there. It was time for my dad to make a toast and I was pouring champagne, but he was drunk and he was messing them up. My mom said, "What do you expect? He always gets drunk and screws things up."
