The Rocky River bridge was washed out. It had been a big, big flood. my father was driving the car and my mother was in the front and me and Rudy were in the back. Dora was not there. my father was excited to drive across the flooded river with the bridge washed out. I wasn't scared because I knew he knew what he was doing. A piano was stuck in the middle of the flooded river. It had pull knobs like a very old pump organ. I thought I should say something funny, so I said, "I could go practice the piano." Nobody laughed. The piano had twigs and dried mud wedged around it where the water currents had been building debris up. The college guys said, "We have 3 chemistry labs set up in the kitchen." We were secretly playing with the Ouijee board because we knew we were not suppose to, as it was going against the Bible. There were job try-outs on St. Marks. A girl was standing on a piece of tape with no shoes and making faces. She got the job. The mermaid statue was concrete but she (the girl with no shoes making faces) stuck her head out from it--so you could see a still body and expressions change on the face. The next one had 2 statues with girls' heads sticking out. They were both wearing horn-rim glasses. It was called: Sisters. The lady on the greyhound bus said, "This bus is half empty." I said, "You never know who will get on." She said, "Is the destination the Laurens-Greenville metropolitan area or just Greenville?" I said, "Laurens used to have only one name." At the diner I couldn't concentrate because I was trying to figure out where I put my shirt. I didn't have it on. When I found it I started whittling a stack of thin young bamboo shoots. Manicure tools were attached to some underneath the ''leaf'' layers and I chopped the ends off with my knife. There had been trouble on the floor and Joey Holmes called a lawyer instead of knocking on the door and asking politely.
