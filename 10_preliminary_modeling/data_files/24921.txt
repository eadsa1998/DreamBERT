I was walking in a forest, humming to myself. Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. I heard someone call my name, so I turned around. Some strange guy was chasing after me. I tried to run but my feet wouldn't move. I was trapped. Setting: The woods. Characters: A strange man that I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I got very nervous just thinking about it.
