It consisted of my dreaming that Gary had 2 girls in the house while he was monitoring, and I was asleep. I think I can identify these girls as the 2 girls we saw last night, Janet and Ellen, but I couldn't be certain of that, but I would think so as I remember it. Anyway, the air of the whole affair seemed to be very gay and efficient, but light, cheerful. After I woke, I was sitting in front of the bar by the kitchen. Gary was behind the bar. I began arguing with one of the girls over the cake. I had baked a banana cake and she had baked a fudge cake. I don't know when, but they were both around, and I was sampling a piece of each. The argument came up about who baked the better cake. She insisted that she did. Of course, I knew better. She said the reason that my cake wasn't as good as hers was because I didn't use any lard in it. I insisted that I could make it better with oleo margarine. It was really silly because I don't think you use lard in cakes anyway, at least who would want to eat it. Even though we were arguing over this thing, I didn't get angry really because she was rubbing my back throughout the whole discussion rather good-naturedly. I was very pleased with this. Then she leaned over and kissed me on the back and I woke up. Where this idea of lard came into my mind, I can only think of that when we were at the grocery store yesterday, I happened to notice a very large jar of white material which I didn't know what it was, and I went over and looked at it and it was lard. I found it rather curious because this was something I never had occasion to use. It just caught my eye, so perhaps that's where the thought came from. That was all of it. Just a brief note. There was some color in the dream. The color of the cakes, chocolate-colored cake, and the banana cake was white.
