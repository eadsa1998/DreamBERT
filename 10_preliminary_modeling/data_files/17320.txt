I don't remember much of the setting.  It was dark, as usual.  It might have been some sort of race.  I remember riding around a sort of track.  My mother told me our friend Neil Block was dead.  She was waiting until the end of school to tell me.  He was away in the Army, not church, and he'd died.  It sort of came as a shock, but then I'd remembered.  Yes, I'd dreamt about it.  The track I was riding eventually took me inside where there were some plants.  Later I asked my brother Stuart, I think.  Confirmation- yes, Neil was dead.  It was hard to believe.
