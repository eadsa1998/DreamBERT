I was doing my homework and needed to copy something, and remembered that I had jammed the copy machine and it wouldn't go, so I put a small piece of paper in and the other piece of paper came out the other side. I was the novice, and stunned with the little piece of paper. Setting: In my office at my house. Characters: (Me.) Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry. Angry first, because I was not getting the copier to work, then happy when it did. (This happened the night before and I haven't told my mom yet.)
