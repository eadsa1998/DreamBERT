I was at the Midvale shops. I scared some little kid and his mother. I had to get something about of this car. It was Michael Palin's car and he gave me the key and I could guess what each key was for. He had six kids and one was called Treasure. There was a grabbing machine and a weird kid was there. I said "I want that one, it's cool" and he said "That's why I'm going for it". He got it and gave it to me. Then I was in the car and there were lots of seats. Ezra was friends with these two black rappers. We went to Nana's. I lost my diary and Mom and I were looking for it. Poppa and Uncle Wilbur were there too. I found my diary in my own bag.
