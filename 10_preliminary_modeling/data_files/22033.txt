I was coming out of the notions department of Vestitex, Inc. of Lima when I saw my brothers and his friends with pieces of toast. They were spreading butter and marmalade on them. They were laughing a lot, but instead of eating them, they would throw them at the people who passed by the store, but at the poor ones. I strongly admonished them about their behavior and they agreed with me.
