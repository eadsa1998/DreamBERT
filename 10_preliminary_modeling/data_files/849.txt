I'm crawling up some stairs. I have roller skates on my feet, wire rim glasses on and I carry a white, collapsible cane. A man asks me if I need help. He uses sign language and yells like I'm deaf. I'm annoyed with him and explain that I'm not totally blind, it's just my periphery vision that's gone. I go on my way. I'm shopping. I'm in a large department store, like Payless. My daughter Dovre is around but I can't see her. I remember that I'm going to meet her. I skate past many aisles of merchandise. I skate into the restaurant. I see several empty tables but decide to eat later.
