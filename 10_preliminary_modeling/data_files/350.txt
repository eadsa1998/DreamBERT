       There are cats here, Tree in particular but also others I don't know well and haven't been here long. One's just died suddenly, it was quite a surprise. Now another one is playing around, sort of jumping up on its hind legs in front of Tree, and gets hit in the head by the ceiling fan. Poor thing - I'm sorry, but I'm really bamboozled now. This is too weird. Later, as I'm looking for something to put over the windows (I think) I'm poking outside and start to take a box, but I look in it first, quickly realizing that's the box we put the dead cat in; I just glance in briefly and move away.
