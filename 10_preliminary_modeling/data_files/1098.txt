A huge refrigerator, freezer, oven, furnace combo machine. I am looking at all the nice extra features like a mirror so I can see if the pilot light is on easily. All these extra items cost extra money. I open a sliding drawer and find lots of extra "free" things. I'm delighted. there are lots of pots and pans of different sizes. A spotted green metal one, and lots of measuring cups and spoons, carrot sticks, apple slices, foods, etc. I am spooning out the white flour and I call to Paulina to bring me a container. I fill it (a one cup measuring cup), and ask for another. I have a feeling of happiness as I put things away where they belong.
