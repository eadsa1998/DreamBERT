A desk of Norman's was being given to me, and I had to ship it somewhere.  It was in something like a meeting hall, with some other desks.  It was strange, because it seemed to me that that desk was much better than that of some people with "more seniority."  This desk had to be loaded on an airplane which was due to take off at any time, and in this project I enlisted the aid of Bertrand Therber, who had just appeared on the scene, looking much younger than in real life.  I remember looking at the desk a lot and comparing it with the others, but not actually moving it to the plane.  In the same place, someone gave me a message and asked me to "deliver it to Senator Goldwater," who was taking a walk somewhere on the grounds of the place.
