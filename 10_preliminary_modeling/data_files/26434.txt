 I'm riding a bicycle on what seems to be part of Home Avenue that runs by the Roadside Company, then the Farm Store warehouse by the Dirty River Park. I may be pedaling at times, and not pedaling at other times. I go fast, and come up on my high school classmate Daryl Yeller, who is also on a bicycle. I try to pass him, and do. We're both moving fast. I ride through a coffee shop area. I seem to be following someone. Something happens with my friend Matt Yams. I'm with my childhood physician Mark Zadra, and another doctor. The other doctor talks about an important and popular book on dreams. I say that I have heard of it.
