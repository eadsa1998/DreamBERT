Lucy Ball and Desi Arnez are very, very old and she is wrinkled. I see a closeup of her face. She has heavy oldness makeup on. Her nose is like the gnarled, twisted juniper tree trunk in shape. Her eyes are very human and sad as they peer through the makeup. Then I see a second pair of eyes, small and close set under that sad pair. I wonder which pair is really her. The gist of the feelings is that they really still love each other and are trying to get back together.
