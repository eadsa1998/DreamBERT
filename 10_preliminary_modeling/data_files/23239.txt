I am playing basketball on a playground with a full contingent of other players-the court seems kind of crowded.  I retrieve a loose ball which is about to go out of bounds, and drive to the basket at full speed, dribbling the ball high and surprising the defenders with my speed.  Just before I reach the basket, I see one of my teammates under it.  I leap to fake a shot, and pass the ball to him.  He is a little surprised to get the pass and fumbles it before he shoots.  He misses his first attempt, but gets his own rebound and makes his second attempt.
