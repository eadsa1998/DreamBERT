Samantha had a balloon as did all these other people. I was trying to get one with a string (some had strings, others didn't) but other people got them all. I managed to get a blue one. Samantha kept trying to pop it. Later, she was asking herself when she had art and I said that she had it next. I was then on this oval place and Mr Reilly was there. There was a little electric fence and I walked over it. I went to class and Amazing started playing and I realized it was coming from my iPod. Someone said "Who was that?" and I said "Oh it was my iPod". Eugene was in the class.
