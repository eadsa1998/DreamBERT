We started down the hall. I carrying my plaid bag. But we set our bags down while I hurried back for my handbag. When we returned our bags were gone. I asked people in the adjoining room about them and she told a small boy to take me to the show room; perhaps it was there. I took his hand but the people in that room who apparently were putting machinery together had not seen it. I must call the police.
