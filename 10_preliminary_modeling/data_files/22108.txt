The cold was extreme, our limbs were frozen and we could not move them. Many people were crying, the snow was falling, the melting ice ran down very heavily and noisily. The weak rays of sun didn't have any effect. We saw a huge valley. It was the beginning of the Huaylan canyon. The two lakes of Llanganuco and the majestic Huascaran jealously guarded their belongings. The landscape was impressive and threatening.
