I had a dream where there were about 8 of us at the house and we were eating, seemingly picnic style. I remember the taste and the smell of the food. Some of us were eating inside and some outside. We have no facilities for eating outside and so they were just eating on the steps, sitting wherever they can, just milling around eating their food. And Mary and I were the only ones who were blind. I think our friend H was here and it seemed like we were going to some kind of meeting or party afterward. And it was something to do with travel, verbally planning a trip or something. That's pretty vague, but mainly I remember everybody being here seems like people just kind of drifted away. It started out vividly and then it just kind of went off into some kind of oblivion. We were supposed to go somewhere after we ate.
