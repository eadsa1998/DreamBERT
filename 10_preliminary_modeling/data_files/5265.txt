I dreamed that I was PERFECT in every way: looks, sports, brains, personality, talent, etc. I was perfect. So I was running around with this really tall, dark, handsome guy. We were by the ocean and he said he'd love me forever. Then I realized I was just a character for a John Updike story, so I was really scared and wanted to see the ending, but I was woken up instead for Christmas.
