I am in a wheelchair, going to a doctor's appointment. When I get there, the nurse tells me he's got an emergency and must leave. I get very irate and write a note. I say, "I'm very busy too. He can call me later." The pains are very serious. I leave. I'm in a manual chair but it moves like a power chair. I sign my name differently in the note. I am Olgn G Alix or someone. I wonder why I did that. I get to the elevator which had been held in place by a manual chair. I hear voices talking about me, how selfish I am, and how no one else can use the elevator. A cute man in a wheelchair says he's met her before, he doesn't wait, he just goes up a ramp. Now I'm me watching the selfish woman being carried down a long flight of stairs just to see some ceramic vases with gilt on them. The guy and I walk about her. Then we go on. We like each other. I see a book store that we both want to go in. We do. We each go to our own particular area of interest. He goes to the H row, and I go to the B or C row. It's a mutual enjoyment. We're polite and would give it up for the other but we are understanding of each other. It feels nice. Then we see a stereo, an old one for 45, 55 dollars. We dig into it and see old music books and things. The guy really wants it, so when he's somewhere else, I bargain the sales guy down to $10 dollars. He says $18 and no lower. I offer $15; it's a go. Then we are outside, standing in water and I'm going to give my present to this nice guy that likes me.
