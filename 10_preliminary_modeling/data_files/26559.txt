 I arrive at Carter School with my sister Heather. This is a new school for us. We're about our age now, but may be younger, in our teens. I'm in a sports club with my brother Wally, Heather, and a white man. We're in a small room. The man is a basketball player. We go to a small gymnasium. There are a group of black and white men gathering to play basketball. I have on my white, new-looking Nike basketball shoes to play. The hoops are small: about eight inches wide, and about seven feet high. The game starts. There are two referees. I want to get in the game and see how I'll play. I think that I'll play okay.
