I am in Geneva, Switzerland, for a short period of time. While I am there I meet a girl who is short, has black hair as well as a somewhat sarcastic sense of humor, and is very lively. We wander about the city streets doing fun things while she makes wisecracks. Then we come across an outdoor cafe which is on a patio one story below street level. We go down the stairs and eat dinner there. Suddenly it is my last night before going back to the U.S., and she comes back with me to the hotel where I am staying. We get into bed for the night but my mother is there too. I have my arm around the new girlfriend, but I feel uncomfortable about this with my mother watching. I get up and walk into the bathroom. Mother also comes in and she says to me, "Everything would be okay if she [the girlfriend] weren't here." She then returns to the bedroom. Thinking about my mother's remark, I say to myself ironically, "That's what I was thinking about her." [I.e., that's what I was thinking about my mother.]
