Murphy Brown and the crew are staying at a motel they have rented to do a show. In the garage are four white cars, very spendy and pretty. The show is over and Murphy wants to drive one of the cars. Miles pretends great fear that something will go wrong and says no. Murphy says, "Yes, let's do it." She gets in one car. He gets in the passenger side. She somehow manages to get it out of the garage by driving between the other cars; it's a tight fit. Now she's driving. She puts her arm across the seat and looks out the back window and jokes about how there is no long back end (like my van). Now she's driving fast down the road and Miles is nervous, "Don't go so fast, be careful. She says, "Let's see how fast this thing goes. She speeds up. She says, "I'm only doing 40, and Miles says, "But it's a 300 mile zone." She sees a car ahead and hits the brakes, a fender bender. They stop. A tiny bit of red paint from their car is on our car. He gets out and tries to make it seem it is a dent and much worse than it is.
