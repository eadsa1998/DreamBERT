I was watching Battlestar Galactica. Adama was in Caprica and cheated on Roslin with a teenage girl in a car. He fell asleep and Roslin came and saw the girl coming out of the car. He was dead and she was crying. I was watching it with someone else and I was thinking 'why do they have to kill off my favourite character just as I start to like him?'. Then he twitched and came back to life and they hugged. I was on the net and I found a video of this guy called Yan, though sometimes it was a longer name that started with 'D'. He was Russian or Swedish or something. They were all short videos. Either I found out from the videos, or this email he sent me, that I had actually written them and sent them to him. The last one was done in April 2008. I didn't remember anything about them at all. The emails were in his language although he spoke English fine. I had already done plot summaries for the last few; one of them was about a girl getting raped. We lived at this different house. Dmitri also lived there. His hair was orange and spiky. I was in my room and Michael Trucco was over, I think he was a relative. He had a kid called Melody and she was trying to get into my room and crying. I 'lifted' the door off the hinges and put it down and it wouldn't fit in. Mom told me off. There was an advertisement for Yan. He thought the handwriting that the stories were written in was his, but I showed him that it was mine, but I don't know where. I was playing Sims 2 and one of the Caliente twins had babies. Also on the Sims 2, a Dmitri Sim and a Mackenzie Sim got together autonomously. Because of this I didn't know whether to marry my Sim Self to a townie that I liked or to Dmitri but then I remembered that I didn't even like Dmitri anymore. I got back from somewhere and I forgot where my room was. It was the "one with the pretty green door". Dmitri's door was green too and was two doors down from my room. I walked into my door. Ezra was there too.
