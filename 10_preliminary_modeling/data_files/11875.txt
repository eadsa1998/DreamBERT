I went to this school and it was the first day and Raquel was there. I also saw Valerie and Farrah for some reason. Raquel and I were hanging around with each other and for some reason lots of people from Whitehall High School were there. We sat down at a table with Cedric and Wallace. We were trying on uniforms. I got a strange one with straps. When the teacher said something about splitting up Raquel got annoyed.
