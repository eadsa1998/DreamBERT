I was working for a company that published some type of periodical, like a monthly magazine. I was looking for some article or information and I had to go back and look through each issue individually, one at a time. They have some software set up for this, but still it only searched one month at a time. Other than that it was a typical kind of search engine. When you went in to do your search, it would pull up a list of blue hyperlinks with one or two sentences after each. I had to try to figure out which one was the right category to look in for what I was looking for. There were one or more other people there, and we were having a conversation about whatever I was looking for and whether or not there was a way to find it and then discussing this search capability, and how it was working.
