I was driving a bus. Two other buses were coming the other way. They stopped on the corner and had the directional lights flickering to turn left. This kind of bottled us up because I couldn't make a turn to my left to make a trip back on my route. I was at a housewarming or it was a house open. There were rich and common people there as we went in a line. I noticed the rich got whiskey from the caretakers and I and the commoners didn't get any. In fact, the man with the whiskey took my drink himself and the same with the rest of us commoners. As I went by some waitresses were going in the line with food. A chef stuck out a plate with two beef sandwiches smothered with onions and said, "Give this to him," so I carried the sandwich and as a few smothered onions fell on my hand I ate them. We commoners were snubbed.
