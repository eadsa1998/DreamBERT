We had a new house. The bedroom was too small, so Ezra and I split the living room. My side had a door going outside and it was like in a block of units. There was a long pool. I went to sleep in the back of my car, which was undercover. Mom showed me something out the window. I had a box of private stuff and it had been moved. Ezra had chucked a hissy fit and moved me out of my room. Darren said they would put a wall up for me soon. Calvin came over but I didn't know why. I also had a letter from the university but it was weird and was like a math exam.
