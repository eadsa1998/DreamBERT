["Chased by incest."] I am in a large house. There is a black man and a white man, football player types in a hot tub on the roof. I am very upset because the men in this house have constantly harassed and sexually incested me. I can't seem to escape them. They are laughing at me. I refuse to look at them. Another man comes by jeering or taunting me. I am exhausted with all this. I keep trying to walk into another room to be alone. They seem to follow me. I say to several of them. You have hurt me. It is wrong. Finally I acknowledge they have been hurt too. The black man's face suddenly becomes a darker black and I realize I've made him understand. He feels the pain.
