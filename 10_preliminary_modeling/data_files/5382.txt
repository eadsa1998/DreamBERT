I had a dream that Tyler was talking to someone about a friend deserting him, and I made some snide comment to him about that. Then we were driving on windy roads around mountaintops, jumping over abysses like it was a video game. I had to wear lots of eye makeup and a tracksuit to do math problems while we jumped over the gorges. It was much more detailed, and everything felt so jam-packed into this one dream.
