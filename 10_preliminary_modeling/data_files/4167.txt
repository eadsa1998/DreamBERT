I am sort of a 6th grader. I have a very helpful kind teacher. Another girl is getting in trouble by not doing what she is supposed to do and will go to prison. I choose to help her learn how to do the right thing by putting myself and her in a prison setting for a short time. She realizes this isn't good and we return to the classroom. The teacher welcomes us back.
