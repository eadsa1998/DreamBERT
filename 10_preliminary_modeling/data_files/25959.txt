 I'm with my high school teammate Simon Naver in Woodsville. We're going to his house, walking down a sidewalk. We talk. His mother drinks rum. He is living with a "brown" man next year. I know this means he's living with a black person. He works that the other Fishing Haven, which is in Woodsville. It is similar to the other, but different looking. My roommate Sean Williams is fishing in a pond there that is 10 feet wide.
