I was an ant. The queen had just given me my mission. I was to collect the great bounty of food left over by the giants. When I reached the destination, a picnic table, I saw on it a gleaming piece of chocolate with crispy rice in it wrapped with silver foil and a blue cover. As I went to collect this beauty, I noticed one of the smaller giants coming after me. He was shouting, "poopy bug, poopy bug." I tried to turn, but it was too late. His batman shoe cast a shadow over me and that was it.
