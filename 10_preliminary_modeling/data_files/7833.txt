I went to ELC and told them if they were really in a crunch about that training coordinator job that I could still take it. I tried to assure them that I could do a good job. They misunderstood and they thought I was coming to them because I wanted to work directly for them as opposed to working for Kathy U. They were going to pay Kathy U $65 an hour for this job and Kathy U was only going to pay me $20 an hour. She wanted to talk to me, but asked me to wait. While I was waiting, I took an elevator downstairs. Lilly H and Tony U were there from SVH. There was also this map on this ceiling. The woman I would be working for and some other people needed to take all the pins out and stuff. I got up on this chair and was helping them dismantle this map. Some had flag heads, some blue balls, and some regular straight pins. I had a clear plastic box that I was putting them in but I kept dropping and losing some of them. I would put them in my hand until I could put them in the box and then I would drop them. I finally took the box from someone else so I could just drop them directly into the box.
