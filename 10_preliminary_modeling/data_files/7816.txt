I was at home in bed. I heard someone come in the house and come upstairs. He got into my bed with me. I was frozen. I couldn't move. He spoke to me but I don't remember what he said. I had my back to him and I tried to roll over but couldn't move. Somehow, I finally was face to face with him. He was leaning over me. I reached up and poked his throat really hard with my finger. I kept applying the pressure trying to render him helpless. I knew I might kill him but it would be in self-defense. I had no other way to fight him off. I was outside getting into a car with him and two other men.
