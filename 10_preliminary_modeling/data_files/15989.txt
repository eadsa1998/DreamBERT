I was at this kind of zoo in an Asian country. People would often sleep over and stay there for some time. I was with some others but I can't remember who. We were sitting near this hole which was called something like 'the unending pit'. I saw a yellow and white striped snake curled up around a small tree across from us. It woke up and started coming towards us and seemed to be looking at me. I slowly tried to move behind the others, but it followed me. I ended up falling into the hole but I landed on a wooden slatted platform some way down. I was trying to call up but no-one was coming. Then I was in some water and my car was there. I got into the car to get my water bottle and it was slowly filling up with water. I was sad I was going to lose my car because I liked it. I opened the window and swam out. Then I was back on the platform and waiting for people to help me get out.
