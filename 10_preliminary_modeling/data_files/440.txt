I was looking at a mouse with a crowd of people around me. The people seemed familiar to me, but don't exist in real life. We were trying to figure out what to do with the mouse or where I should put it. I suggested my hamster cage. A woman in the group said, "No, the mouse will never fit." I argued, "Yes it will," and I put the mouse in the cage. Then a problem occurred when I saw my hamster. I was afraid that the mouse and hamster would fight and my hamster would be killed. The hamster was in the first compartment of the cage and hadn't seen the mouse yet, but was moving to the part of the cage where the mouse was. I got the mouse out before anything happened to it.
