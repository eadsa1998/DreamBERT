 I ride a bike into a Perkins restaurant. I dodge a table and brush up against a lady on the end. I stop my bike in a corner of the restaurant. There are many people from my high school, a year younger than I, that are there. As I get off my bike they notice my short hair. We joke and engage in small talk. I say that I have to go talk to Annie. I walk down a little ramp and over to a booth where my girlfriend Annie, friends Nelson Eastman, Simon Naver, and others are. I shake Nelson and Simon's hand, asking how its' going. Then I slide into the booth, which is a semicircle, and sit next to Annie. I kiss her and she kisses me. I feel awkward kissing her in front of everyone. She starts kissing and licking on my left ear. It feels good. I kiss her neck and mouth. We pause; I think I should order food. The waitress hands us menus. Everyone orders, I am last. I can't decide what to get, and then think that I want the Blockbuster. I turn to the menu page on the menu where it is, but see that when you order it you get a hamburger, not pancakes, eggs, and hash browns. I see that and don't want it. I think I may have ordered the breakfast blockbuster, but I don't know.
