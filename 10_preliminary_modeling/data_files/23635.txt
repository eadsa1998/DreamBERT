I'm with a group of people. Someone is conducting the way Australia is going. We're in some kind of in a tent formation and suddenly we're going very , very fast. There has been an election and the people are very clear that this leader is not going to win the elections. The more staid forces will win the elections. We're going very, very fast and we're running into a wall and then we break through it; we fly through and everything is in motion again-which has been his objective. He is a wild, youthful Australian. He supports Macquarie's idea about the Academy, which is in constant revolution, constant motion. [The only Macquarie I have heard of was one of the first governors of New South Wales. I have no idea about his thoughts.] It just is totally moving and breaking through. The pilot loves it because that's what he wants and that's the way the world is. It breaks through, flies off, and is entirely new.
