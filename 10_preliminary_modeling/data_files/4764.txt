["Nearly dead cat."] I see a pathetic calico spotted cat who is very week and ill. Bald patches on his head by his ear, his eyes receding from near death. I feel very sad and upset with myself. Did I forget to give him water and food? I go find a bowl of water and bring it to him. I don't know if he will survive. I feel terrible.
