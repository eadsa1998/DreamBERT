A Columbine flower. I must eat its poison berry to get well. A newborn baby girl is handed to me. I love it and I feel very happy. It's wrapped in a pink blanket. It has brown, thick, curly hair with reddish highlights. I caress it and exclaim, "How nice! Look Ellie, now there are two of you with the same hair coloring and two blondes." Then we're in a trailer house/camper and it's tumbling over and over. I protect the baby by making a circle with my arms and holding my body around her. I am concerned for her safety. [BL]
