 There is a man talking on a pay phone. He is a gunman. He talks casually as he blasts a machine gun up the stairs next to the phone, killing people. When he is out of bullets he casually alters his weapon to use shotgun shells, or uses a different weapon. He is poised, cold like steel, calm, and he kills. <br/
