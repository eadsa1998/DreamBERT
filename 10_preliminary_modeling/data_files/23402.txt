I think my boyfriend and I moved to a new apartment of some sort. It was really strange the way it was set up. It's not totally clear, but we would climb over on the top of the building and it was full of grass and there was also a lake. We were laying up there with several other guys who lived in the building. It's not clear to me who these other guys were. When you went below, there was a city (completely two different worlds) and something with a gas station and gasoline was involved. I think there was one below. The last thing I remember is having to go to the bathroom so I was in the gas station's bathroom and one of the guys came in and tried to either zip my pants up or down (I hadn't gone to the bathroom yet) and I told him that I could do it. I said it as if it were no big deal, but when he left, I checked my zipper and found that they were zipped up and was thinking that it was really weird. I also remember swimming in the lake while we were on top of the building.
