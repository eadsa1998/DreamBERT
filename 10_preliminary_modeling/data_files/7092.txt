I introduced the guests and mother and we started to the museum. Mother said, "Can't we walk faster? We must catch the train." "It doesn't leave until 4:30 and it's only 9 a.m. I'll take you to lunch." "But the packing?" "I can do mine in ten minutes." We reach the museum. A young boy at the entrance admires a collection of small stones with bits of bright and colored specks in them. When we reach the carved ivory, he handles the small pieces. I warn him not to lest he break the legs of the miniature animals. Another boy was to meet him there. I am worried.
