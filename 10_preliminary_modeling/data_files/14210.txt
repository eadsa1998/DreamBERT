Eugene and I got ourselves a house/apartment. We had a double loft bed and brought a huge TV to put under it. We joked that we had more stuff than when Mom first got a house. The bed was shaky. I was lying on it. He came up and I said that we needed to get a better bed. He agreed and put his arm around me. Then there was a thing to record past times. One of my dreams that was recorded was about Sims 2. He put it on the low setting so I could dream properly. Then it was The Simpsons and Homer said he put it on low but instead of actual scenes showing it was pictures of a dude in a bricked house and Homer said "Doh!".
