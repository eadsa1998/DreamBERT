More flooding waters. I run for the elevator to go down to the basement. I can't because the basement is all flooded. I reluctantly must go up. I see Dickie. He is looking at a TV set. I come over and face him, and peer at the TV. I see war and pain and confused people. I burst into tears and cry for the sad, confused people. I am surprised and touched that Dickie is crying just like me. He reaches out and hugs me. He tenderly touches my hair and says, "I didn't know you had such soft hair."
