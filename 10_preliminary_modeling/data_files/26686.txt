 I am talking with my grade school friend Ray Jackson about how he has alternatives after college. I say that he can avoid work and loans while getting paid. He doesn't believe me, or he thinks it is not a good, practical idea. We talk more. A fat lady comes in the room and sits down. She has talc/powder on her fat. Ray may be there. The lady says she is hungry. I see it's 10:30pm. I think: no wonder she's fat if she eats a lot late at night. They haven't eaten dinner yet. The lady has a bag of strawberry flavored hard candy. She and Ray eat some. I decline to eat any, though she never really offered me any. I know Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills from Fishing Haven are near. They may be in the next room. I hear baby noises faintly, and I think Mike and Phoebe may have had a child.
