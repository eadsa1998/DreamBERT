I dreamt that my brother Stuart and his girlfriend Sheila were going to have a Halloween party.  8 friends and family were coming for dinner.  We swung up to a huge ship and leaned against the boat in an oval.  Dozens of people were below.  The salad was made.  The people from below threw fruits up for it to land in the large bowl in front of us.  Carrots, grapes, melon...Then it was diced.  Monica from Friends was clinging to the window outside (like of a building, not the boat) while it was raining, she had to get something.  She almost got knocked off.
