I was to meet a lady about a possible exhibition - perhaps she ran a gallery or something. She'd arranged to meet me outside a fast food pizza place - it was brightly lit and full of kids. She encouraged me to bring my bike into the establishment despite the fact that it had carpets. I cycled in between the tables as we looked for somewhere to sit. Eventually we sat and ordered coffee and talked about art. My bike propped up against the railings of a stairwell - this place was all stainless steel and bright colors. It was massive like a multi-screen cinema. She seemed to be slightly insincere but I wasn't sure - until eventually she enticed me down some stairs into what appeared to be a huge contemporary art gallery with white walls. Large sculptural exhibits were dotted around. Amongst them was a coffin-like perspex box. In a moment of spontaneous madness I threw my clothes off and jumped into the box, and lay perfectly still with my eyes closed and my hands cupping my genitals. After a short while I opened my eyes slightly. I could see that the place was packed - and yet no one paid any attention to me. It was as if I was invisible. When I decided to put an end to this nonsense, I opened my eyes and realised I wasn't naked at all, but in underwear and a vest. I went to get my bike, but it had been stolen, and the art woman was gone.
