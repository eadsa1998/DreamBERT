I had this dream where this devil guy was at my house. He was morphing into things. Example: my cat Kally. I was standing in my living room and I saw my cat Kally and a cat that looked exactly like her, so I ran to my room and grabbed the cat treats because Kally usually comes running when I shake the box. So I shook the box and Kally came running. I picked her up and said, "Good kitty" and Kally morphed into that devil guy. It wasn't Kally! I was so scared. The devil dude said, "Am I a good kitty?" Then he started laughing this devilish laugh. He told me the downstairs was on fire (we live in a duplex) and I had 5 minutes to get out. But I couldn't tell my mom there was a fire or else I would die. So I was looking for my cats cages and I couldn't find them. So I grabbed a box, threw them in there with some food and grabbed my photo album of all my friends back home. Then I told my mom to come outside with me and she said, "No, I'm really tired." And I said, "Please, mom, please come outside, I have to show you something." So she came and I told her to grab her purse. So she did. We were walking down the stairs and she said, "Sierra, the house is on fire, Sierra, Sierra...." and then I woke up and my mom was saying "Sierra" and waking me up.
