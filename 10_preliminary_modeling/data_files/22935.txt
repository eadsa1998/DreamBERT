I was attending a town meeting in a small meeting hall among trees in the country.  It was night.  I noticed that Pedro Mendoza was there.  It was the first time I had seen him in a long time.  Whether the speaker was supposed to talk about language or some political topic, or what, I don't remember -- but whatever it was, he was talking about something different and was very long -- winded and boring.  I was disgusted, and when an appropriate time came -- a pause for getting a movie ready or something -- I made for the exit.  To my embarrassment, about half the audience took that as their cue to leave too, including Pedro.  We walked a ways together, till we came to where he was staying-a large treehouse dormitory.  I wondered about Yolanda, but didn't know whether I should ask.  He volunteered the information that she was in a room in the back which adjoined his room.   Later I found myself in bed by a window opposite a similar dormitory.  I could see very plainly through the window opposite, because we were separated only by the narrowest of passageways.  There were two women in the other room-one in bed and the other attending to her.  One was nude, or partially so, and they were pondering the advisability of lowering their blinds.  I pretended to be asleep, however, so they decided not to.  Apparently the one in bed was pregnant, or had just had a baby and needed milk, because the other one began to breast feed her.  I did my best to watch without their noticing that I wasn't asleep.
