[1997-06-23] [A day dream] Mort was on the computer, which he was when I woke up. My mother came and said "come on upstairs. I want you to try this dress on." I put the dress on. It had a zipper and a belt and this thing that snapped and it hung down the back. I never saw a dress like it. My father in law and his wife came in. They had a whole bunch of groceries. I guess my dad went out and he came in, and he must have gone shopping for us because he had groceries too. We didn't know where to put them all, the groceries that is.
