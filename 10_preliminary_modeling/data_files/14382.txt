Ezra called Mom saying someone kept leaving 'rapish' on his desk. We suggested the cat was bringing chicken in. Then I asked if he was on My City (Facebook application). He was. I had added a chemist to his and he had new stuff to add. I went home at one point. There were maggots everywhere. I was on the floor in my room and there were baby maggots on there. I went to the kitchen and got fly spray and used it on the sink and the floor. I called Mom. I was then at Cat Haven, or something. There were kittens in a cage. I was cuddling them. One was black and fluff and there was a cute Rag doll looking one. There were also puppies and birds. Mom and Ezra were around. This building had metal pipes for the roof (cube area). I had to water the metal so it turned brown. Then we used it before it got hot, but it didn't stay cool long enough. I signed in at the Cat Haven. This girl told me to stop texting and I said I was trying to get my Mom to pick me up. I asked her what grade she was in and she said something weird. I said I had graduated and mentioned I was in university now. She laughed. I don't know why. I asked where she went and she said something that I don't remember. Mom text me saying she was ages away, but would be picking up Amelia then getting me. I walked across this field and there was a hill. This guy with "gay [something]" was there. There was a game where people keep 'sexing'. This guy told his friend he was gay and he was like "You're not gay, I'm not gay". But he did say he would engage in anal sex with him. This was the last episode of a show? I decided to download it.
