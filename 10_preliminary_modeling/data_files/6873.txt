Quite a number were walking to church. I followed them but special groups were in front seats. I found one on the left side about halfway back where a ramp started. Then I saw a seat in a pew ahead but when I got there, a man's coat was in it so I returned to my former seat. There was singing but I could see no man. There was a curtain and men's feet and blue trousered legs shown beneath. I thought they're getting ready to dramatize family prayers. A child next to me tried and asked to get down. I told her I didn't think her mother would like her to.
