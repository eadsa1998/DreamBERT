 I'm at the University of Montana-Great Falls campus. I'm on a bicycle, riding towards Middleton College. My friend Tiny Combs gets out of a lecture at Middleton and I see him. He didn't enjoy the class. I'm near home. It is really icy, and I slip on my bicycle as I ride. My classmate from Brimson Anthony Holden and others are at a party. It seems to be near the northeast corner of the intersection of 2nd Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley. I decide to drive my truck to Middleton, and give others a ride in the bed. I go home, and people are gone on vacation. The front door is open. I close and lock it. There are two blue Chevrolet Suburbans in the driveway. I think one is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas', but then I realize they belong to Fishing Haven. I want someone to drive the suburban to Middleton while I drive my truck so tomorrow someone can drive it to work at Fishing Haven.
