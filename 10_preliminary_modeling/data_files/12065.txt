I was at school and the people were acting weird. No-one came to form. I had seen people earlier that morning though. I found them in this lounge room. Some people were behind a chair listening to music. There were evil animals. We were hiding in classrooms. Ezra was playing on the 4-wheeler. Then I got on and so did some people from my class. The animals finally left. Then monkeys came. Mr Nixon had lots of cake.
