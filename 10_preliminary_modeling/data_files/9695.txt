Eli came back! We are at a big rally; Jews telling how some prophets begat people who died at Auschwitz - see huge crowds, look like the Beatles... Eli arrives and lives in a house nearby. We are invited for dinner; Wendy goes in first: "You've grown," then I walk up and we embrace. He gives me presents, and a present for Frank and another present for me! Very happy.
