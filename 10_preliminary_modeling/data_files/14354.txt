I was watching a movie with Ezra. A girl was waiting for a guy on the beach. It was night. She lay down to wait. She started to rub her belly button with her finger and then put her hand in her pants. She grabbed something and put it in her pants and turned over and masturbated. Then she pulled it out and it was this bit of watermelon and she called it a 'bon bon' and ate it. Then I was with some people and we were mucking around, throwing things etc. Then I was naked and holding a blanket to cover myself. Then there was something about how years ago, some guy from the sky told these people something. Then he told some guys that in the past only two women were given a wish and they wanted to get married. Then everyone was allowed to get married and there was a lot of resistance from men and it cost a lot.
