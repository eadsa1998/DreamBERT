Mom gave Dad this show to watch and Jason Lee was in it. It was a 'dare' show. He was doing all this "R-rated" stuff and it went for 84 minutes. At one part he had his pants off and someone held his legs and his genitals were showing. Ezra was watching too and said "I'm the only one who hasn't seen this before", although neither had we. We were then in his room. I was getting dressed and wore my Spongebob shirt and my school pants. I had an exam earlier and Mom had picked me up. Bradley and Eugene weren't there. Dad and I were going to some Feargal Sharkey concert. I found this old music tape of Dad's and it had Shake the Disease. On the label it had Depeche Mode and Icehouse. There was something about digging up "fossils", but it wasn't actually fossils. Elijah was at the exam. I forgot to do some questions. There was a Ted Bundy question but it was a math exam.
