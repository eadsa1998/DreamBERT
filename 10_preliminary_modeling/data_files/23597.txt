I am at my grandmother's church, in the second pew, listening to my brother and cousin Joe sing a duet (this is unusual because they hate each other). After they finish, my brother comes to sit by me. The Reverend is preaching a good sermon and I get filled with the "Holy Ghost" (which is also unusual because I am not a religious person). I start to speak in tongues, I look over at my brother and begin to exorcise the demons from him saying, "In the name of Jesus I rebuke you Satan." Everyone in the church is looking at me in total shock. Roseanne, another cousin in the pew directly behind me, points to five chubby little white girls. "Now you've made the skinheads mad." Politely, I turn around to see if I've offended these girls, but the first four just smile at me bashfully. The fifth girl, also the chubbiest, scowls at me and murmurs a racial epithet (I can't remember what she said). Then I woke up feeling somewhat shaken.
