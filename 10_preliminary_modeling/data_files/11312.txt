I went to my clothes closet in a desperate attempt to hurry up for a party which I was supposed to attend. My friends were waiting downstairs and I tried hurriedly to dress for it. I slipped on it kept disappearing. Finally I used up all of it and I slipped on my shirt and soon that disappeared before my eyes as did my other clothes. I figured I was seeing things so I went downstairs to greet my friends the way I was. They were all shocked because I really did not have any clothes on.
