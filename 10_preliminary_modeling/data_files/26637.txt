 I'm deer hunting using a muzzleloader. My friends Jose Ramos and the other hunters are all set up in deer stands close to the house at the Ramos' property. They are all north of Jose's stand in the small cornfield. I continue to walk down towards the tire pile. I encounter several deer off to my left, near the pine trees to the east of Jose's stand. I have difficulty getting my gun ready to fire. Several hunters on my left fire at the deer, which then run out into the field in front of me. One of the hunters may hit the deer closest to me. I fire at the deer. It flinches and jolts its body, so I think I've hit it. We all seem to gather a short time later. I say I saw four deer near the pine trees. All of the deer were relatively small, hardly any with antlers: some small does and fawns. I walk with my friend Gretchen Warwick. We go after deer, to a forested area. We go through a flock of sheep that contains several fawns, which I point out to her. We don't shoot at them. We must cross a fence to get to the area, which is a hard climb for her because she's short.
