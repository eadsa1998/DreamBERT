I had all this money. Mom and Mom's former boyfriend were with me in his truck. He was driving. We stopped at Taco Bell. I bought food for everyone, and then went into the store next to it. I was looking all over for the ice cream. I felt lost in the store because I couldn't find any ice cream except ice cream bars. Finally I found it. Max (a 19-year-old friend of Vickie's cousin) said, "Oh! Wow! Look at that ice cream. It's only one dollar and something." And, he said, "Oh, but you probably don't have enough money." I brought out my money, and it was three dollars. He said, "Oh, cool. Can we get that?" I said, "Okay." It was a small size.
