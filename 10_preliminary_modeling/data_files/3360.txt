I am a busy traveling professional, on the circuit. I am tired and go to bed. A nice man who is there, one of many, to help me, is in bed with me. I am a bit uncomfortable, but curl up on the pillow and try to sleep. As I lay there, he becomes interested in sex. His hand starts exploring my breasts. I keep my eyes closed and think I hope he can find where they are (meaning I am embarrassed that my old age has made the breasts sort of slide off to the side.) He is hesitant and then moves on. Now he kisses me. I am thinking, "Oh oh, now what do I do?" when I notice it is pleasant. Each step is pleasant and we end up making love. His penis is short and stubby. I stroke it with my hand and he says in a gasp, "Are you sure you should do that? I'll only last about two minutes that way." I smile because I realize I want it to last longer. He says to me, "I am surprised you allow me to make love to you, you're a professional and important and I'm just an old boy from Texas." I say, "But you are a nice old boy from Texas. You are kind to me." I smile and say, "Lots of them have asked, but you're the one who is really nice to me."
