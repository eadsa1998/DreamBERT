Andie (Dawson's Creek) was going up an escalator. People were stopping random people to ask questions. The first one they asked Andie, the answer was 'no'. They asked her if she had a problem with sex and she was now Joey and she said "I've only had sex twice and used a condom twice". They continued asking sex questions and she got annoyed and said "Do you want to know their names so you can make sure I'm not lying -- Pacey Witter,". I was then at a shop. They had this chocolate with mint cream and it had 14g of fat. Ezra was there. This girl said she would give me money to swear and eat one, or to kiss her and eat one. I said that "swearing makes me feel like I'm taking my clothes off" and James Van Der Beek was there and said "or you can do that" and we laughed.
