It was a very nice dream. I dreamed I went to my girlfriend's house. When I arrived, I found three boys who looked like hoodlums and who were standing at her door. I rang the bell and a boy came out and let them inside. And suddenly she appeared behind the boy and she looked very pretty with her long hair loose. She asked me into the dining room where her parents and other people were, but I had the impression that only she and her parents were there because she talked a lot, addressing us only. She talked about many current affairs and made her points in a very heated way. Her parents merely nodded to what she was saying. Her parents were very nice to me and they seemed very pleased. They smiled the whole time. They were also happy about us. And so we had a pleasant evening.
