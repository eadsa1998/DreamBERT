I am in my wheelchair and come up to the reception counter at the doctor's office. I say, "I'm here for my appointment." She says, "Yeah, 9 minutes after 10. You're late." She is putting some sickly looking grapes and berries into a bowl. They are a pale white and look a bit slimy. I look at another clock. It says one minute after 10. I say, "I'm only one minute late. That's not so bad." She calls out to someone else to verify the time. She grudgingly agrees I might be right.
