Mom and I were driving down a road. I was in the back. A guy turned a corner and flipped onto his side. He got out and slammed his car onto the other car. I filmed it, and he looked back and saw me. He chased us. I can't remember what happened but then a girl was after us. We were in a shop. After a while, I got this long knife but couldn't cut through her skin. She grabbed a serrated one, so I did too and cut her head off. But then she was still alive and came after me and then her head fell off and she died. I placed her at the accident and tried to hide the evidence. I walked past the scene a day later and police were there; we knew one of them. Then Benjamin and I were walking around this place looking for somewhere to have sex. It was like a giant house. Some people were having sex outside against a wall. We went into this house where the person had a lot of kids and had just had a baby. We went onto the lounge, but got interrupted. We went onto the table and were interrupted again. We then found a small bed and began having sex [I woke up during the 'end'].
