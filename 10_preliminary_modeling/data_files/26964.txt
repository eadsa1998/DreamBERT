I dreamed that I was in one of my classes and we had just received the results of an examination we had taken about a week ago. I looked at my grade and it was marked "90 - 30, grade 60". I asked the teacher why I had thirty points taken off of my grade, and she said, ~You used a blue book that had notes in the back of it." I looked over the book and showed her that the notes were pertaining to another course. She said that she would give me the original grade but I should be careful of this in the future. My teacher was a lady about 40-45 years of age.
