I am a feisty old woman and my daughter is trying to run my life. I meet an old man and we are going out on a date. My grown grandchildren are watching, feeling happy for us. My daughter is sour and disapproving. I am like a pixie, choosing a video from a stack of them and deliberately misplacing them, mixing things up. Now we sneak out for the date and come back two weeks later. I say to my daughter, "We got married." She is shocked and then I laugh and say, "And then we got unmarried." It's like we got married to distress her and then got unmarried to be more naturally who we are. [BL]
