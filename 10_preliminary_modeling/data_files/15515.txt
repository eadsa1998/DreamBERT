I was at home and my room was smaller or had more stuff in it. My bed was next to a robe which had drawers. I was talking to Seamus and he mentioned a conversation that me, him and Elijah had all paid $127 a month to hang out, but never did. I had cancelled it not long ago. I went out and talked to Mom. She said (maybe jokingly) to invite him over. I did, in the hopes he would refuse, but he accepted and then I remembered I had to work. It was 6.30pm and I really didn't want to. I got a call from a woman asking if I could do something, saying "quarter 25 now". I told Mom that I wasn't going to work and she got angry about it. I had a shower and Seamus opened the door while I was standing in a towel and I closed it. Mom said he was sleeping in my bed and I said "what's wrong with the lounge?" and he said 'I don't want to'. I went to my room and my bra and underwear drawers were open and I was annoyed. I was trying to work out what to do. Ezra was on some site like Facebook and posted about my 'geekiness' for watching movies and keeping stats. He made a joke about Seamus being my friend.
