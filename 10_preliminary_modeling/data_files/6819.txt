I got a second lot of medicine from the doctor. Several small vials in white, blue-edged enamel cup. First lot was in a battered rusty cup, second in a good cup with extra powder in a small used carton. I decide to throw away the old cup. Then I noticed the doctor had also given me a dark green bottled marked 'Histamine, two or three times daily.' I ask mother what to do about it.
