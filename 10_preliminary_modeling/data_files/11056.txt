I dreamt I was supposed to go fishing on a fairly big boat. I was near the sea and it seemed evening since the sky was so overcast. It seemed that this expedition was part of a class requirement in which the majority were males--something at that. They were waiting for me and I was trying to get a fishing rod. I called to them to help me if they were in such a hurry, but they wouldn't, so I started picking out and untangling a line I found there in the sand, thinking to drop it in and hold it wound on a stick. They said it would be fine. Then my mother came and said it was so squally that she didn't think she'd go and I thought about it and decided I wouldn't either, so I told them to go ahead and leave. Then later someone came to my house and seemed quite distraught. The ship had gone down and she was grieving for her son. I had been in bed, but got up and began putting on my clothes to go and look for him. I had the feeling, however, that he was dead. I also felt glad that I hadn't gone on the trip. I also felt that his arm was off.
