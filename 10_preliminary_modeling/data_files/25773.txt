 I'm eating with high school classmate's younger brother, Ron Owens. I turn away to do something. When I turn back, I think Ron or his buddy has done something to my plate of food, of which not much is left. I scrape the food off the plate with my finger and throw it away. My classmate Nick Schreder is there, and I'm eating with him. He is a wrestler. We talk about him wrestling someone and doing very well.
