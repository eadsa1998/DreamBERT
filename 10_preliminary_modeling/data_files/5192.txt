I dreamed that we were all going on a field trip. We were all organized into different buses and Sue and I were put on a bus with a lot of people we didn't know at all. So we were really frustrated. When we got off the buses we had to take out our English exam. I remember we were in this huge dark metal room underground. We were able to get our results the minute we finished the exam. But when I finished I couldn't get to where my results were. Then I remember beginning a new dream where someone was chasing me in the dark metal room, but then I woke up.
