Last night I dreamed many things. What I remember is that I was on a beach with many people, where several of my friends were. I went with my mother, my aunt, and my cousins. I arrived and wanted to go swimming and the boy I like accompanied me and took me in his arms. We had to go down from what looked like a hill, but it was full of people. We got to the sea and he went -- I don't know where -- and I stayed, looking at my aunt who had a little bench in her hand and was telling somebody that it was from Cuba. What a bench! Getting here over the sea! I turned around and saw a fishing boat near the shore and my mother swimming next to it and grabbing ahold of it. I looked at it and thought, "How strange! How could it have gotten here?" I don't remember any more.
