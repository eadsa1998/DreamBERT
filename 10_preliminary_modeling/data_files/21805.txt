Chester was barefooted tamping down the railroad ties. We were laying down a railroad track. The track was like a steel chain for pulling on a big spindle. I was holding the chain or rail in place while it was fastened to the ties. I was driving and came to a detour. The road was roped off. I drove over some tracks and I saw an engine (train) go by. I was with someone who looked like Ed Mcunis. He was drinking beer out of a bottle and kind of spilled a little on me. I took the bottle and told him to open his mouth and I poured the beer into his mouth. I have a faint inkling someone told me of a big horse winning. I came up to the bed where Ann was sleeping. I awoke her and when she got up, there were hundreds of small bedbugs crawling on the bed. I had a shovel in my hands, so I started to hit the big ones with the shovel. Ann showed me a couple aquariums of fish and she said the bugs fall into the water and the fish eat them. I was riding a small car. I moved it by turning the wheel. Then I saw a small donkey. It was as small as a small dog, about 8 inches high.
