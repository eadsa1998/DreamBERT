My dream was about me breaking up with my boyfriend and then having to go babysit his little sister at his house. In the dream, after I broke up with him, I had been asked by his mother (who loved me) to babysit her daughter (my boyfriend's little sister), and at the same time, keep her son company. She ordered pizza before going, and left us there with some movies to watch. When the pizza came, my boyfriend's best friend came over and said he was going to stay the night. I thought it was kind of weird, but I trusted him and said okay. I ate pizza with my boyfriend's little sister and told her to go give her brother some slices. She went upstairs and came back with Monopoly (the board game) for us to play. Not only that, but she also came with my boyfriend and his best friend. I said sure and we started playing the game. Everything went on fine, and after the game, we watched a movie and had a great time. Then we all went up to my boyfriend's bedroom and played on his computer. After I put his little sister in bed, my boyfriend said he was sorry for what he did and gave me a kiss. We started going out again, and everything was fine.
