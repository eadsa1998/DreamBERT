Dawn, a childhood friend, and I are going somewhere. I go to her house to get her. Her mother is cleaning and everything is outside and the inside is all washed down. I overhear someone inside talking about someone being pregnant. Dawn's mother sees me and invites me for lunch. She says she is so pleased that Bill Brown (an acquaintance) has decided to have these "RC&amp;D" lunches in appreciation. I have a package of tacos that are like cake and she says she will use hers because they are healthier.
