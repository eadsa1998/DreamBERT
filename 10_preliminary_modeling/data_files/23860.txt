I was working as a new employee in a convenience store.  I was to get a raise, $900, this info came from one boss at a little party or meeting late at night.  I offered them all four water or beverages.  Undressed?  Flirting?  But the other boss had not intended to offer me that much, he offered $700, he was mad about the first giving me a raise.  I went to clean up spills, to make the place neat and clean.
