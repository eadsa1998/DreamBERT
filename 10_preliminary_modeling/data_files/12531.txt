I went back to Mom's with Ezra. We then found out that Mom had been told to burn our school bags in the car or something would happen. Lydia was there to make sure it happened, but I refused. This guy I used to know (not really) had ordered it. I saw him somewhere and started bashing him so he let me take my bag.
