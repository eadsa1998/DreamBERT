This dream was centered around my drama class. It was early in the morning, I mean like three or four, something like this. It was just him and me in this room. At the present I can't remember what we were doing. It might come back to me. Anyhow, I remember going out and then coming back, thinking how late it was. Then the next second two other fellows came in, one fellow came in who I recognized as being in my class, my drama class, and another fellow coming in who I did not recognize at all. I was standing around and they were having a conversation. Then they mentioned that there is an error being made, one every, and then the guy was lost for words. I said, "Well, there's probably being ten made every minute, every second." Then the other guy asked me, "Well, don't you agree that errors are being made every minute?" I said, "Yeah. In fact, I think there's as many as ten every second being made." Then I left this, during this time I was leafing through a stack of mimeographed papers of an outline of course. This could possibly be a test or something and then just fill in the information you know about. It was in outline form, Roman Numeral I, A, B, and so forth. It seemed like we were in an office. Before these other two people entered, some fellow went walking through the place and just kept on going. Occasionally someone would just like to use it, the room or office, to get from one place to another, not that it was so well-located, just these people happened to come into the dream. He was sitting at a desk and I was always standing up, either running errands or moving about for some reason or another.
