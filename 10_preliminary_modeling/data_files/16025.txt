I think I was at the Technical College which was different. I was in this building with a young boy and girl who were brother and sister (around 5/6 years old). The boy's left eye was fake.  Some kind of fight/war started happening and we shut the curtains and closed the door to hide. We saw people getting rounded up outside. We heard them coming into the building and ran upstairs. We had to jump out of a window and I went first. They jumped next and the girl landed on the spiky stuff that goes on fences which was all over the ground. The boy hurt himself landing and his fake eye started coming out so he took it out and gave it to his sister to look after. There was a gap between buildings and I looked and saw soldiers. We waited for a bit and looked again and no one was looking this way so we ran across. Later I was by myself and snuck into this massive house. I hid in a room and some of my clothes were there. Some other people came to hide too, one was a gay dude and he saw the closet of the guy who lived there and it was really flamboyant and he wanted it. The guy (who was quite old) caught him later and I hid in the cupboard and the gay guy had sex with him to distract him. The wife came home later and we snuck out and left.
