I had a dream that I met the kids on The O.C. Granddaddy lived in one of the dorms and I had to take a roller coaster to get there. When I got there, there was an itinerary that told me when I would be getting my teeth pulled out. I wasn't aware of this and was thoroughly frightened. Then we had some tribute dedicated to Keira Knightley because she had died. When cars passed by, they would honk out of respect. Then I woke up.
