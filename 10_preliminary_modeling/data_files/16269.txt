Dad was doing some construction work or something for this neighbor of ours, and we were all going over to their house to have some kind of party. And we went down into this big, huge cellar where they were going to have the party, and it had a linoleum floor that was white and walls that were white. It wasn't gray like cellars usually are. And it was all real fully lit and they had a sound system down there so people could dance and sing. And I remember dancing and taking the microphone and singing something, but I don't remember what. And then I remember this boy got up there and did the same thing ______________. And we were all taking our turn and doing our things. And then I came up from the cellar to check on Dad and he was doing some construction work while we were all down there. And I could hear the little boy singing "Pointer's Bay." And I don't remember what happened too much after that, but when I went back down, I had kind of missed the party, and the party was over. And the cellar, it wasn't fully lit, but it had these little like spotlights -- I guess they call them emergency lights -- around, and a few candles that were lit. And it had some flashing lights on the railing like emergency vehicles have. And Mom took me down there and she was showing me how to turn on the other lights. See, what people did when they went down into the cellar, okay, so what a person would do when they'd go down in this cellar, is they would turn on the big lights before they turned off the small lights, because if they turned off the small lights first, they would be in total darkness. And I was trying to tell Mom -- she like had me on her shoulder -- I was trying to tell her to turn on the other lights before she showed me how to turn off the small lights, but she didn't listen to me and we turned off the small lights and we were in total darkness. And then I woke up.
