["Growing computers."]  I am in a field planting old computers in a row. I finish my work and look over the field where many green plants are thriving. I pick off a flowering fruit that is forming. I taste it and am very pleased. It is moist and sweet and slightly crunchy. Someone asks me what this all is. I point out the beginning of the first row and say that was a Compaq computer, and that was an old Commodore 64. It even has the old fashioned keyboard with the shift button on the left. There is an Atari.
