My boyfriend, who was Eugene, suggested I finish school early so I could go to the movies with him, but to not tell Mom about it. I agreed. I was then with Farrah. We found a shop so we went in. There was a Timezone, which was packed. There was a Science Museum like place. There was a dark room, and there was a corner where you would fall over. At the door you got shot out by a burst of air. I was with Eugene now too. We waited outside another building, and then there was gas. This guy opened the building which was a big room full of single desks which had paper and pens on each. The instructor said to draw your last dream or a pedophile. He said we would have to present it in front of the class. He handed out paper and mine had my name on it and I wondered how he knew it was me. Then Farrah didn't know how to do something on Microsoft Excel (we were now on computers). She wanted to superscript a single word inside a cell.
