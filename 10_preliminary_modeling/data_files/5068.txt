I'm in a river raft in the back. A man is in the front. I tell him I can't swim. He says, "Hang on." We hit the rapids. The raft is tipping up and I throw myself onto the man to put more weight in the front. It works and I'm pleased with myself for quick thinking. I also like being there in a semi-embrace with him. We come through a tunnel of white water and are safe. [BL]
