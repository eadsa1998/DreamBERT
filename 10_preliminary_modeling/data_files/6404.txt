I was standing upon a beach with a huge milling crowd of people. I didn't really know what was going on, but it seemed to be some sort of good-natured rock fight. People were picking rocks up and flinging them playfully at each other. They weren't pebbles either, they were ROCKS. Then, everybody started going crazy, and it was like a battle. People were throwing to kill. Talk about a shift. Then a gang called "VS" showed up, and things really got vicious. One girl got me good in the stomach with a big rock and I followed her around, determined to kill her. As it turns out, it was one of my brother's old friends, who he "hates" now.
