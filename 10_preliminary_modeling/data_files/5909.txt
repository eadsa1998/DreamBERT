Am skiing on the sidewalk and then enter a ski store. Owner complains there is not enough snow and says South Carolina would be better. I insist it will get better here and that children will all come to the corner lot on which he is building a ski resort. I walk out and try to put ski gloves on my head! Then put on my ski hat and with skis on shoulder, walk down the street.
