I was at school and Calvin was there and had come back from his trip earlier than expected. Eugene and Darius were near us and he said something about me and "Swamp Boy". Later, I was at a park with Farrah. We went across the road to this little rollercoaster and I remembered going on it when I was younger. We climbed up and Farrah went for a ride but I realized I wasn't going to fit on it, so I went to climb down. Ariana was on the ladder and she wouldn't go back down. I was going to fall, so I pushed the ladder and she fell, but I had done it in a way that she wouldn't get seriously hurt. Dad put it back up and I got down.
