A patient named Young -- from a former ward -- appeared in this dream. He put his hand on my buttocks, and I said, "No, don't do that." A little later he was sitting alone looking very depressed. Then a young patient came (this dream took place in a hospital), and he became violent, and the officers treated him by poking 3 holes on each side of his head just behind the ears, and one behind the other. They used their fingernails to make the holes.
