I stopped at some sort of gym department to see about working part time. The instructor was a older woman but seemed very kind. She asked me if I could sing. I told her that I couldn't too well, but that I knew quite a bit about music. She called in a couple of girls to listen to me sing, and decide if I could. I remember trying a number of different songs, but I only knew small snatches of them. After I sang they all took a vote. Each one said that I only rated about 50%. On this basis the teacher decided that I should not have the job. She was very nice about it; and I thank her for at least considering me and went out.
