I have come from somewhere else to a house where some others taking a mastery class live, we're getting ready to go together. There's at least a brother and sister, maybe more. I move, with somebody else, to a sun/sitting room where the sister is - these people are recent grads and are expressing their apprehension of "having" to process all the time in the future so hard, it won't be any fun. I make a little speechie about how after you get used to it and good at it you don't work so hard and - although Roy doesn't think in these terms - gee whiz, you can go whole days without processing anything. And that eventually your mind gets trained not to react in the old way, so it's not as though it's a constant uphill struggle.
