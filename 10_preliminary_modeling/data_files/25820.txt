 I'm in a very old big house with my grade school mate Jim Granger. I do something with Jim. I think I may have been Jim's second choice of people to accompany him. I go to my room. My old roommate, Jens Nils, is there. Jens' sister is also there. She has blond hair and is physically larger. She goes out to her car and brings back two CD's of her favorite band to play. I have never heard of them. I have trouble with the CD player: the discs slip and won't come out, they are hard to grab. Jens gives me a used comb and a toothbrush he got. He bought 16 combs for $2. The sink is very dirty with his used toothbrush and dental floss covered in toothpaste spit. This disgusts me. My friend Norman Noman is there. I am going with him upstairs. It seems as if the house I've been in is my house for this coming fall at school. It also seems that Jens' sister is my current roommate Sean's sister who is coming to visit us for dinner tonight.
