Uncle Dale says, "OK, now it's time to go to Grandma's." I don't want to go, but I now walk through a crowded dining room to find Amber. If she doesn't want to go, then I can feel OK about not going. I see a man from high school. I pass several times looking for Amber. I feel sad that I didn't look at or respond to the man, and now he's gone. I now go past the dining area to the kitchen. Amber is sitting on the floor in a pantry talking to her mother. I wait until she pauses and I say, "Sorry to interrupt, but Dale has announced we're going now to see Grandma." She smiles and her mom says, "Oh, he did, did he?" I say, "Oh well, he probably means in a few hours. He knows how long it takes us women to get going." We laugh indulgently. I ask Amber if she's going. She says yes, she wants to. I sigh and decide to go because she is going, even though I don't want to.
