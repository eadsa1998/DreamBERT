It seems more as though I knew this was going on as opposed to being involved in it or observing it. No one told me about it. Bill C had promoted Jennifer C and given her my old office. He hired another part-time person named Heather. One of the primary things they wanted Jennifer C to do was to make calls to suspects and prospects and either try to sell programs or products over the phone or setting appointments for the men. She was not successful doing this and they actually seemed surprised by this. Bill C said something about her not being able to be successful because she is timid and soft-spoken, as though they had not noticed this before, which I can't see how they couldn't have, or they wanted to change it.
