["Katherine Hepburn on a sub."] I am in a kitchen. I want to eat some toast. I decide to break the diet. I find a half loaf of bread and check each piece out for signs of mold, since it's been so long since I've eaten bread. I find several spots and pull them out. I decide the rest of the bread will be OK to eat. I put them in an odd toaster and cook them. As I do this, I am hurrying Charla to get ready for school. I also am starting back to work at the community college and need to get ready. I see on TV a movie with Katherine Hepburn in it. I am happy because this is the one I haven't seen yet, called Iron Petticoats. She is a captain of a submarine in Russia as a spy. I am frustrated because I have to leave and am preparing the toast and then I remember I can tape it. I hurriedly grab a video tape and see it has the cellophane wrapping on it. More frustration as I struggle to pull it off. Surprisingly, it comes off quickly and easily. I now have to figure out how to use this VCR and set the timer. It is nearly nine o'clock in the morning. We are late. I decide we can skip going to school and work today. It won't hurt anything to do so.
