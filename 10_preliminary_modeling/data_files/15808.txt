I had finished a stocktake and was waiting outside with Co-Worker-M-02 and Niles. Mom was giving us a lift. I was thinking now she'll meet Niles and 1) hopefully hate him too and 2) realise that he's not attractive and I don't like him. She got there and had to only take a few of us at a time. Niles got in the car, but she misunderstood and just took off. I ran after her trying to get her to come back, but she was gone. Then zombies came from nowhere and we had to run. I was with more people now and we ran through backyards, alleys and over fences and jumping from roof to roof. When it quietened down we walked. It had then been some time and we needed water. We found this guy who gave us shelter and some water bottles. One of the guys in the group found wispy white hair in the guy's bed, and brought it out to us - saying that his dead wife was rotting in there. We took the water and left quickly.
