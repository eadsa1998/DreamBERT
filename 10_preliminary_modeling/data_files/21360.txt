I was at a small party. There was a small child with us. When the party was over, the child -- a girl -- was going home with us. We lost her in the crowd, then I heard her cry. I called for an officer who was guarding the party. He ran around the block or somewhere and came in front of the would-be kidnappers. I yelled to him, "That's them!" I noticed the girl was about halfway between me and them. I walked towards the men and when I met one of them, he started to talk. He said he was with a girl that invited him to the party and he didn't care for her. To throw her off, he took this young child by the hand and walked with her, and his girl then noticed he didn't care for her, so that was the reason he walked with the child. I told him I did the same. I wanted to meet a girlfriend of a girl that liked me, but I had no use for her. So I met this girl just to get acquainted with another girl. Then when I met my wife, I also met her with her girlfriend and my wife told me later she thought I was going for her girlfriend.
