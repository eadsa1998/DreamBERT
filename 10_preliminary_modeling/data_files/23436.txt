Starts out with me attending some press conference/town hall meeting with President Clinton, the vice president and their wives. I sit very near the President and exchange looks. Some people I apparently work with are there. Two of them get in a fight and one is punched in the chest and starts having chest pains. Someone comes to tell me and I get my sister, who's an emergency room nurse, and her sister-in-law, a doctor, to assist. Next scene I'm with an old boyfriend who is an investment banker. I convince him to review some business arrangement of my parents to see if it is financially worthwhile.
