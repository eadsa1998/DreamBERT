My cousin's friend was over who I'd never met but always wanted to meet. When I saw Michael's friend I couldn't believe it 'cause he was tall and fine and looked about 14! (I'm 13.) I kept asking him and Michael "are you really only 9 years old?" and he would answer yes! That's all I remember. Setting: At my house in San Jose where we don't live at, but my family and Michael's family lived. Characters: Michael, my 9-year old cousin. Miguel, Michael's best friend who I heard so much about but never met. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, confused. Michael always told me Miguel had a fine older brother so I guess I just pictured him as his brother.
