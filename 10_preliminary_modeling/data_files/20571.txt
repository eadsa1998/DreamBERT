I was doing something, and then I lay in a bed and smoked a cigarette. My sister was asleep in a bed a few feet away. I was worried about burning the bed with the cigarette. Later I saw some tickets from the VA hospital in my wallet. Then I was working on a machine with a conveyor belt that slanted downhill. A man came to repair it. He was working at the lower end and I was at the higher end.
