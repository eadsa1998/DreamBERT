Benjamin was talking about something that he'd gone to with his "love", but he'd broken up with her and was now dating someone else. I was helping Ezra with a quest except it was real life. I did it recently and it was in this haunted house and you had to put torches up to stop spiders spawning. There was a staircase and we had to mine blocks and replace them with paper and climb up. We had to stand on the sides and it was hard. We had to use the walls to lift ourselves. Then we were fighting the boss and we didn't realise we had to poison him to kill him. We killed him then we had to donate something to Morena Baccarin who was the hero of the quest. Ezra decided not to though. I was then at a shop that was closing. I had two water bottles but one was an empty Mount Franklin and was warm, and a half full Pump. A lady was saying the shop was closed but it was like, the freezer was closed and the counter was open. I just left. The doors were closed but opened, shaking slightly. Eugene was there and he was chubby and with a girl. He saw the shaking door too but no one else did. We got to his car and he was worried about it but got in and left. Two guys knocked on the passenger window and gave me contact information for some collection.
