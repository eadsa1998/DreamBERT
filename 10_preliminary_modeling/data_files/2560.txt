I am sharing a room with four other people - Aunt Elaine, Uncle Benjamin, me and one other woman. It is confusing at first who all is supposed to be in this room. Aunt Elaine says there are three beds, so three of us can stay. Uncle Bus leaves. At first I only see one bed, but I decide to believe on faith that there are three. I turn and see two more single pink beds on the far wall. I also see two more sliding doors, and through a crack I see more beds, one with a plaid coverlet, and I see the movement of someone's knees and realize someone else has that room. I see a door that could lead to a bathroom. We are at a sort of retreat and we each have to take a turn at cleaning up after a meal. The food isn't very good and Aunt and I decide (her suggestion) we go to town to have dinner. I think about the added expense and the waste, but agree. I am now looking through a book. It has some pictures of young boys and men. The other woman likes one of the pictures and wonders who it is. I look through to see if I can find more information. I see the name Hans Solo. I chuckle because that's from "Darth Vader" movies and mention that my Aunt had a different memory connection to the name. The number 512 is mentioned and I can't remember why the number seems familiar.
