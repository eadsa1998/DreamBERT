We were in the dorm, about twice the size that it is.  We had the windows open, and I guess it was after a rain.  A turtle came in, somehow, and although we didn't mind at first, we were going to try to get rid of him, but he was too quick.  A chimp was there, but we sent it away.  Then, king snakes.  At least 3 of them.  One slithered over and around me.  Supposedly if I held still they wouldn't strike.  After that we summoned the chimp back, and she and I were good friends.  We hugged, and I asked her name; she signed something but not letters.  She wanted me to take pictures.  I got my camera out, but it was all dirty with grime and I couldn't see well through the viewfinder.  She sat on the couch, and looked like a person.  She smiled, and had the big chimp-like grin, though.  We took other pictures, too.
