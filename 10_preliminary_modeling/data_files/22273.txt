I was at the beach and I saw N. (a girlfriend of mine) pass by, driving a car with three more people inside. She kept turning around and had fun going at the greatest speed and rubbing me each she turned around. She stopped and I asked her to let me drive. She said alright and I took command, but discovered that it was a motorcycle instead of a car and that she was sitting behind me. I drove and realized that I wasn't on a beach, but on an ice skating rink. I was afraid we would overturn, but then I realized that what I was driving was a dune buggy (N. was still next to me) and I ran through a rough field raising a lot of dust.
