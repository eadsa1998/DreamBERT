["Elvis is a brute."] I and my beautiful friend who is blonde and shapely are outside near a house. Elvis is in the house. Women are crowded on the steps to the front door and screaming Elvis! He comes to the door and sees my friend walking away. He tells his assistant to invite her in. She isn't really interested in Elvis but she is curious so she goes in. For some reason, I come with her, as a sidekick. We are shown to a side room and wait. When we walked up the steps the other women were very upset and jealous. After a while, Elvis comes in all arrogant and sure of his self. She doesn't like his attitude. He just assumes that of course they will make love. She refuses him and he thinks she's just being coy. She keeps refusing and tells him what she thinks of him. He looks me over, but I'm fairly plain and dark haired. Not interested. He walks out of the room. As we are leaving, a young man asks her to go upstairs with him and make love. She doesn't know him but she decides to go. I call out to her Cyb. Cyb. Don't go. But she doesn't pay any attention to me. I sigh. And leave, alone.
