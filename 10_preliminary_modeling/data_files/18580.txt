I was teaching Bible school without a plan. So it was pretty boring for the kids and they didn't particularly want to be there either. Near the end of the Bible School session I realized, "We should have made a Bible movie!" The kids could have dressed up like disciples and we could have thrown a few good miracles into the short film for action. It was the perfect plan--but it was too late. It was the last day of Bible School. I felt so inadequate. I thought the least I could do was to show the kids how to use the darkroom. My darkroom was in a 2-man pup tent set up on top of a dog house. The tent had collapsed and anyway, I had not figured out how to make the tie-down flap door light proof. So we ended up not being able to do that either. It was a big disappointment. A man was trying to decide if he lived on the Florida mainland or otherwise. I said, "Chances are you do." Marianna said, "Merri, if you're going to teach Bible School, at least get the sand out of your shirt. Here, over the sink you can shake it out." I hadn't thought I had sand stuck under my shirt but when I started shaking it out, huge clumps of sand kept on clumping out.
