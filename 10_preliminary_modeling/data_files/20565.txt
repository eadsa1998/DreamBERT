I was discussing someone's behavior with a man about 55. He spoke about something the person had a habit of doing, and I replied, "That's the way Plato did -- he separated things (referring to Plato's dualism)." Later I was in a locker room and a young boy about 15 was standing with his back to me. He seemed timid, and seemed to be afraid of me.
