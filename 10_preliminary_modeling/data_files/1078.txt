I had been away doing something. I come back to my house. My husband, Burt Lancaster, is entertaining guests. I try to get his attention. I want to be kissed and hugged. He's very busy. I go into the bathroom to take a bath. I sit in the tub; I have a blouse on. Muffin Cat twice leaps on the tub and goes completely underwater. I see him under there, all curled up with his eyes shut. I pull him out and pet him and laugh. I look at our guests and explain, "How strange! Cats never just jump into water! I don't understand it." The guests are rather distant and formal. I notice that the door to the living room is open and I see 5 play mice and 5 real, dead mice under a chair. I think, "Ugh!" I get out of the tub. I follow my husband into the kitchen. He's fixing something to eat. He makes a comment, something about what a good cook he's getting to be, with me gone so much. I want to hug and kiss him. I feel sexually aroused. I try to but he keeps slipping away. He's busy doing stuff. I say, "Please come here. I want to hold you." He comes over and says, "What do you want from me?" He's aroused, and he rubs his hardened penis against me, like to show me he is aroused and attracted by me and to appease my sexual appetite until the guests are gone. I feel slight resentment because I don't just want to be bumped against. I want to be held. I want him to be less distant!
