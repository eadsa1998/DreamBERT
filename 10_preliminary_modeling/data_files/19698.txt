I was in an institution. There were hills and a smokestack in the distance. A steam shovel was dumping coal into the smokestack. A patient on the ward named Kabot appeared in the dream and said they were filling the smokestack. He had a motorcycle which he drove away in saying that he tended the grounds. I was wishing he had taken me with him, but I guessed that it was against the rules anyway. Later I was among a crowd, and an attractive blond had fallen and hurt her ankle. Her back was to me and her dress was up above her knees as she sat on the walk. When she saw me, she came up to me and begged me to do something. I said that I am not a doctor, but I suggest soaking her ankle in Epson salts. She went to a drug counter.
