I was driving G.G.'s car for him because he was not able at the time. Ann murdered someone and was trying to put the blame on me. Ann found a milk can that was sealed and I was sharpening a chisel on an emery wheel to even up the can. I went out into the street. It was dark and I was afraid of a holdup. I came to a boy and he reached into his pocket. I thought it was a gun, so I grabbed his hand and he had a small toy gun that shot a dart. I was driving at night, some car stopped on the right side of the road facing me and I had to run over the lawn to get by it. I drove and stopped near a theater. Boys were shoveling snow, so I gave them a hand with it. We were playing catch the apple like ball. I threw a long spear twice and it went a long distance. I was around my boyhood school.
