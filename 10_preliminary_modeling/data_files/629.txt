My husband and I are riding in a royal blue sports car. Two men are in a car behind. He says or does something to anger them and they follow us. We come to a bridge, cross it and drive directly into a store that deals with car parts or cars. He tells the woman there that he needs to hide because of these men. One woman seems to know the men and agrees they are bad and dangerous. Another has a card she shows me, like a greeting card. She says she needs some help from me because she has some health problem. I am wearing only a nightgown and am concerned about how I will walk home.
