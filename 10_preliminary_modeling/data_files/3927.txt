["Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum."] I am a man and part of a musical duo. I play the guitar and my "sister" plays another instrument. We are at our next gig. The audience is rough and doesn't like us. I am getting my guitar out and notice one string is out of tune. I try to tune it, but the string comes undone and I can't get it back in correctly. My sister tries to help. We are on stage and the audience is restless and booing. Then two people in the audience start their own music, singing and guitar, they are very good! This is their way of humiliating us. I am wearing a sort of tail coat with a high pointed collar. I pull out the fiddle and begin to play with them, harmonizing and counter point. They are impressed I am so good. I walk down the aisle in the audience to join them. Now a number of people are walking up and down the aisle playing instruments, and I see with concern they all had very wide fat butts. This is the only acceptable body shape here. Of course, I look normal, which makes me abnormal. I get a clever idea and my sister and I walk, arms entwined, both of us playing. I am on the right and now she's on the left. I bow and she holds the fiddle and does the fingering. We walk down the aisle carefully, stepping together as one person. This makes our butt wide enough to be acceptable. We are playing a song. "We are having a baby, a baby, a baby. We are having a baby. Tra la, tra la, tra la. ." We step into an open suitcase and out of it without tripping or missing any notes. Everyone is impressed. We are successful. Tweedle dee, and tweddle dum.
