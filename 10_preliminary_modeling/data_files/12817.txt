I had a job at the McDonald's at Tuart Hill. I had worked there already. I got a job at a better one that paid more and I could work less. I went to the McDonald's to buy a burger. I got my pay slip which had $180 on it. I got an ice-cream too. I was then at school. Autumn was there. Darius was stalking Eugene, Calvin and I.
