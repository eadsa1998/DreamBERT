I was hanging out in a room out the back of Mom's. Ezra and a friend asked me who it was I was supposed to like and they were like "Swamp Boy, right?". There were golf clubs there. I was then in an airplane and they handing out Pokemon Diamond and if everyone handed them around they would release Pokemon Pearl. Ezra couldn't wait and opened up Diamond.
