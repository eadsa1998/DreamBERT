I was in the kitchen of a strange house when I heard a woman (about 50) call me to come out to the backyard. I did so and found her to be my boss of last summer. She indicated a man (about 60) who was standing nearby. She said he wanted to borrow my bicycle. I went near where he stood in order to talk to him and started to tell him he, of course, could borrow it. I kept talking and then proceeded to give him reasons why he could not borrow it. I became somewhat angry. It was about dusk. I turned to go in and he followed me. I tried not to show my fear and felt he was going to shoot me, although I had the idea that he followed me inside with evil intentions. I sidled around the doorway into the kitchen and awakened.
