Waiting for a meeting. A plump woman had a sort of program. He said his brother had prayed for a certain question on his exam. I asked if he got it. He said no. I say, "When I was a child, I prayed for a certain question on the book my mother had been reading to us. But even though I prayed aloud at her knee (she was our teacher and would set the exam) it did no good." But they didn't really listen to my tale.
