I see showers. A mentally retarded woman lives in one stall. Whenever she showers, the water stands and spreads to the next stall. The woman in the next stall gets upset and wants someone to clean that up. I take a small razor handle and start to suck up the water with that. It will take forever! The woman says, "Thank goodness someone is doing it!" Then it's time to go. As we are leaving, we see our electrocuted friend being moved into the apartment across the way. A nurse goes with him. We are sad. "Oh, if we had only known he was coming. We'd have arranged to be here, but we have to leave now."
