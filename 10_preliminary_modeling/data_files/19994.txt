I was in a theater watching a movie about a man traveling in a section of a city. A woman sat next to me. She was slender and attractive. She seemed to know me. I had to go to the rest room. The urinals were in an awkward place. When I returned, the man in the movie had found the place he had been looking for and the movie was ending.
