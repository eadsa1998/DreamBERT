 I'm making ground cherry jam. I use some of my mom's jam that is already made to make more. I have about two cups of ground cherry juice that is yellow looking. I ask my mom how much jam that will make. I collect ground cherries from the front yard at home near the stone wall. There are young boys there. I show them how to collect the ground cherries. <br/
