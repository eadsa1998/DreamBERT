I lived in this strange house, where video games, toys and other inanimate objects came to life and mixed with the living. It started at school. I was going around, trying to take my finals. I get to my PE and Math finals, and look on my sheet of paper. Damn! They're being held at the same time! I take a look at the teacher's name. Patterson. This guy was the quintessential chaw-munchin football coachin' American bastard when I was in the 10th grade. I think, "He WOULD follow my to college and ruin my life. Just to ruin my life." So I run over to his final, do it very quickly, and then run all the way back across the campus to do my math final as quickly as possible. I remember that I've never been to the class, but I breeze through the material anyway. I hunt around in empty classrooms for mathbooks and dictionaries to steal. Once I've got my backpack loaded up with valuable "study materials", I'm all ready to go. <br/
