It was going to be cold so I was going to wear pants but I decided to wear a jumper instead. I went to school and I had an English assignment due in. That period, we had to film a music video and we had lunch 1 and 2 to edit it. I storyboarded it and tried to get Calvin, Samantha and the rest of my group to do it, but they wanted to talk instead. I was thinking we should do Maxwell's Silver Hammer again, but with big smiles on their faces. I was asking Ms Solomon about something. Then I was watching something and Betty and Daniel (both from Ugly Betty) kissed because some lady asked them to do something. There was a video camera on a computer.
