I have to bring up a recurring dream because it has great significance to the dream I had this week: dream #5. It always starts the same way. I walk down the stairs in my house and out the front door. I walk into the street and I always turn left. I lift my arms up to be perpendicular to my body and wait. Soon a big wind comes by and lifts me up. At first I am nervous. I am afraid of falling. I have no control over what I'm doing and the wind takes me where it wants. If the wind dies down I begin to fall or a large breeze makes me move quickly through the air and I get nervous. But soon I get comfortable with flying and I can turn in any direction I want. The wind dies down less often. I go higher and higher, often I get scared and come down a bit, but when the fear leaves I go higher than I previously was. Eventually I get the hang of flying and am comfortable with it, but I still feel as though somehow I'm missing something. Once I get the hang of flying I often realize that I've got no place to fly to. The dream ends with me kind of floating around aimlessly. I've had dreams along the lines of this one many many times.
