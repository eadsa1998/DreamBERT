[1997-05-05] I was eating Cheerios out of a ceramic, square dish. There was milk in the Cheerios and I can remember taking the spoon in my right hand, and I was holding the spoon and I was eating and tasting the smooth, cold milk and the Cheerios. The dish is one my mother had made me a long time ago.
