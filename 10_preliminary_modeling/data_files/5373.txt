I keep having this recurring dream that I am on Law and Order: SVU and I have to catch a serial rapist/killer. He always uses this particular knife that has a blue handle. I keep walking through all these houses, turning over tables, trying to find his next victim. Then I see this blue handled knife on the table in the last house, and I realize that I am the next victim. I open my mouth to scream, but no sound comes out. I feel like I'm choking and can't breathe at all. I always wake up gasping for air. It's always the same though.
