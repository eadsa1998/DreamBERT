I am in a large house with many rooms. I want to show off these rooms to someone and start to open a door to show two rooms off my bedroom. I see someone in a bed and remember that some of these rooms are rented. I feel embarrassed and shut the door. Now I and Ellie are ironing some dresses for the little girl, who is full of energy and hard to manage.
