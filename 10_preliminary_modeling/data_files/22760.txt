Last night I dreamt I was at the movies with some small cousins, seeing a movie about animals -- what kind of animals, I don't remember. We got home and everybody had a headache, except the smallest one, who liked the movie. From there - I don't know if it was right away or how - I was in a store and I wanted to buy a scarf with turquoise polka dots to go with the skirt I was wearing. It was taking me a long time because there were lots of them. The salesgirl came over and I was going to give her the polka dot scarf, but instead I took one which was of solid color. I would tell her that this wasn't the one. So it happened about three times until I took it and we went inside to wrap it. There were shelves filled with toys and a girl who was looking at us. She told me it cost about $10, and I told her that I didn't have that much, only about $5. Then I told her that I would leave the small radio I had as a deposit. And when she had it, I told her that I was only leaving it because it was an expensive radio; it was foreign. She took it and liked it and then I realized that it was too much, that I should only leave the money. She didn't want this. She told me it was the radio or nothing. I took the radio from her and at that point a friend called Mary came to tell me that another friend had come to pick me up in a car because I was supposed to study with her. I went out running and got in the car, and the first friend was left alone. I didn't know what to do. The car had already started. Inside my friend Rose had a baby with her and her aunt was driving, and there was a good-looking girl, who was angry, next to her. She turned around and started to lick the baby's face and Rose took her away.
