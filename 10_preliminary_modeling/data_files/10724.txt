I dreamed that I was walking up Euclid Avenue on a shopping trip. I was going into the small specialty shops such as Quinn-Maah's, Milgrims, etc. looking for bargains in lingerie. In each store there was a counter with a large pile of pink slips with fancy lace trimming and in each store, after looking through the pile and disarranging it, I walked out. Finally I came to an unidentified shop operated by two elderly women. There I found what I was looking for at a much lower price and selected several yellow slips and a pair of gold handing earrings. I was quite satisfied.
