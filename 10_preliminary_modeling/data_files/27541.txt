I dreamt that I was in my father's drug store--my parents were around and there were a number of other people around, too. I don't really know who they were--customers probably. I was dressed in a Hawaiian Hula costume and performed a hula dance on the spot, without any feelings of impropriety. An old man, about 75 or so, was looking in at the entrance to the store, and smiling. That is all.
