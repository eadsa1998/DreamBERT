Took place somewhere on 27th Avenue, I don't remember any specific location. I was just sure it was 27th Avenue. I saw a male Negro being run over by a car. They had run over him so fast there was not only an outline of him on the street, but an imprint of his facial expression when he was hit. I remember other cars crashing about me an d I had a hard time getting my brakes to work to slow down. I finally did, though, when I saw a green traffic light at the corner of the accident. <br/
