I was walking through the streets looking for a supermarket that I had been to once. I met my mother and after walking past some buildings, we found the store. I noted that it took us _ hour to get there, but I recalled that the last time it had taken me only 5 minutes to get there. My sister had a bag which she said held groceries.
