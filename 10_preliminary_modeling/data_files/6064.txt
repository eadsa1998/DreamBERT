[Before I went to sleep I was in an extremely bad mood.] I had a dream that I was parked behind a red Volkswagen. I was picking up my brother at school. Every time the VW moved, I moved. This went on for a few minutes. The person in the VW was my brother's friend, but I didn't realize it until after he got out of the car. Anyway, you could tell that the person was getting aggravated with me, but I was in such a bad mood that I didn't care. Finally he got out of his car and started yelling at me. So I got out of my car and started yelling and swearing at him, telling him he could take his little red car and shove it you know where. Then before I knew it my mother was calling me to get up.
