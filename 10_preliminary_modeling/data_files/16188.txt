I had a dream about Mrs. Talmadge in Mass Media. I dreamt that we were going in the room to take a test and I was holding Melinda's arm like I do Mom's and before I knew it, I was holding her hand. Mrs. Talmadge was saying, "How are you going to help her with this test? How are you going to be able to give it to her?" And she said, "Well, I will sit at the desk that was next to the mixer." And in that room the mixer and all the sound stuff is out in the main room, and it was all one big room. And I remember fiddling around in there a little bit, examining the mixer, making sure it was off, and coming out and hearing the fire alarm go off and we went running. And then I woke up. [laugh]
