Was driving with my family in our automobile when we came to the corner of my street and the car in front of us had two little children sitting on the roof of the car. As the car turned the corner, one of the little girls was hurled into the street and another car ran over her. Since we were the only witnesses of the accident and therefore it was our responsibility to get help. I didn't know where to find a doctor, so it seemed as if it took me hours and hours to reach a friend's home. After finally arriving there, I couldn't get in touch with a doctor. Finally I got a Dr. Meyers of whom I never heard of, but it was too late. We were held guilty for the accident.
