Judah was making a short film and he had written it but had a girl directing. I asked if Tristan and I could work on it and said I didn't care what the job was I just wanted to work on something and he did his nod thing and I thought he looked really hot and then he said something like 'you, yes but I'm not sure about Tristan' (jokingly). There was a spot free taking the trees out of the ground and he said that we needed more experience doing that so gave that job to us. He also said he was now in for D&amp;D and I clapped and said 'yay'. Jason was around and I didn't know if I should ask him to come to D&amp;D and he was keeping his distance. Then Judah was in some TV show where there was a mid-shot of him and you saw this grey-ish dragon appear behind him and he turned around and it roared and lunged towards his head and then cut to black. I was like 'no, you can't kill Judah!'. There was also something else where we had a small budget and had to simulate doing some effect by drawing lines on a screen and I accidentally blew something up and something exploded at the bottom of the sea and was likely causing World War III (it played out as 'real', but I'm not sure if that was just a simulation or not since no-one seemed that bothered).
