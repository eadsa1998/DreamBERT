I dreamt my boyfriend Jeremy, perhaps my best friend Emma, and one other person were here with me at the observatory.  They wanted to go downtown to catch a movie.  I had to be back for dinner.  I didn't actually go, but Emma did.  I went to check out.  There was a little cartoon of a small giraffe amongst all the other baby animals riding on their mother's backs.  The giraffe said, "I want a mother too!"  I told the clerk I was sad because of it.  He gave me a little stuffed giraffe.  My brother Stuart came in with some change that I had given him and got another rubber animal.  A man at the desk said we were one of the few people who had collected them all.
