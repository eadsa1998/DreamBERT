I was at school and I can't remember what in the world we were doing and why I was there, but I had the notion that I was at Bancroft Middle School. And I also, then I suddenly dreamt that I was at this like outdoor sound studio under this little walkway, and I was at the sound board adjusting levels and stuff, and doing a test-test-one-two-three kind of a thing. And there were a couple of people on the other side, and I was recording all this on a mini disc. And then I dreamt that it was starting to rain and we had to get the board inside, a little shelf thing was taking on water. The two engineers and I kept dumping it as we went. And I know there was more of a connection; I just can't remember it. It's so frustrating.
