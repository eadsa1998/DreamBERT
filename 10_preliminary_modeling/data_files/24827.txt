I was sitting on my bed and I looked up and saw a centaur. It fit the description of "Chem" in the Nords of Zanth by Peirs Anthony. On her back rode a women (sic) with green hair. They told me to get on the centaur's back and go with them. I did and we left. We ended up at a house in S.F. They told me to go knock on the door. I did and the person who opened it was my current crush. Setting: My house, and S.F. Characters: My crush, and 7th grade boy. A female centaur, very developed. Women - green hair and green eyes - looked like "Irean" from the Zanth novels by Piers Anthony. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised. Quite happy and surprised.
