We were going camping near a river. We decided to pitch tents at the bend so we can keep an eye on both the shallow part and the deeper, more rapid part at the same time. The small children will play in the shallows part and the teens in the deeper part. I see my tent and my towel is set up right on the sink. I brush my teeth. A married couple says I can sleep in their tent and the implication is that no one will have sex so I won't be embarrassed.
