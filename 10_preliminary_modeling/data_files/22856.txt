This involves a science fiction movie phenomenon, "The Creeping Unknown," and I have the feeling during the dream that this is the second occurrence of it that I have experienced.  It is like a great mass of mud, but high, and reaches out in branches and consumes things as it slowly moves.  It seems that it is only a matter of a few hours or a few days that we have in which to decide how to eliminate it, or else it will consume us.  It doesn't seem to be as alarming as it was the first time, but still pretty scary.  Willard Furst and I finally discover that by holding a Wint-O-Green lifesaver near it, the "dryness" will repel it.  We are glad of this, but we are still uneasy as to when it might come back.
