I was at Nana's for Christmas Eve. The lounge room was slightly different and Dad and Ezra were down there, along with Eugene and his brother Rodney. I wondered how they knew them. We were watching TV and I moved to sit on the floor next to the TV. We had all been talking together and I was wondering how to 'get in' with him. Later, I was in the house alone and I was just sitting on a step and I looked up and Eugene was in the hall and I said he scared me. Then I walked out and went into this new room and everyone was in there. I sat in the corner on a seat next to Poppa and Ezra. Eugene joined me. Then we were in another room and Ezra and I had a huge fishtank each. He had a piranha and I had a normal fish. There were big groups of little fish for the piranha to eat and it was practically jumping out of the tank. Ezra got it and put it in my tank by mistake. I freaked out and got a net and tried to fish it out, then he tried and managed to catch it and put it back. Then my tank was low on water. I ran to get Poppa. There was a rabbit cage which had a little pipe. I said 'they're going to die!' and he quickly got a hose and filled it up. Ezra's was going down too. We had to raise the tank and it was full and started to spill. Poppa was also impersonating the Marx brothers at one point.
