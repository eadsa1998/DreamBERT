A story is unfolded in a "court." A judge, male, fat, and cold, in a clothing store of some kind. Racks of "lacy" and "painted" dresses hang right next to jury. During the story, the one juror interrupts to say that someone wants to buy a dress. The proceedings are halted so that a dress is tried on. Lacy butterfly sleeves, a print skirt. The story involves a baby named Nancy (or Amort) who swallowed a peanut and started to suffocate. The air was cut off and she became a mental retard with a score of a "little less" than 70. Some man was keeping her as a pet and playing sexual games with her. The man was on trial.
