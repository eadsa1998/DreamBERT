We came into the dining room which was crowded with round and square tables for four. At our places were bouquets of purple lilacs but I couldn't think why. The person who had entered with me disappeared. I sat down and Mrs. McRae, the only one at the table said, "so, it's your birthday." I said, "no, it's my wedding day." Then I thought I'd better sit with my husband but I remembered this home is only for women. Saw a man briefly in front of another table but he went away. I wondered where Mrs. Kn., my tablemate, was. We should be at the same table, saw her at another table. Was I at the right table? Yes, there was my napkin ring. I heard Mrs. McRae say, "it's her birthday and her wedding day both today." I thought that won't do. They'll expect my wedding but it has already taken place. Where can I meet my husband to sleep with him? Then I realized at last I had gotten to sleep and was dreaming so I needn't worry about Mrs. McRae spreading the news or my husband.
