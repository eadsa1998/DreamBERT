I am a teen and I've been invited to sit at the head table with the rich and intelligent ones. I am honored. They ask me if I think classical or rock music is better. I say definitely classical. An old man is dying. At first they won't let me into see him because I'm so young, but my sensible attitude and emotional strength are seen and I am permitted. I hug him, weeping. We say goodbye. I go on and become an intellectual genius having taken "ap" classes in high school and learning in a single-minded fashion. [BL]
