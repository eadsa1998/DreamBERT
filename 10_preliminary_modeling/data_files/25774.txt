 I'm playing football. It seems that my arms are going out the sleeves of my jersey crookedly, or my shoulder pads are too big. People are tossing the ball around warming up. I want to play tight end. I get assigned to play right guard. I go and tell my classmate Bud Slick, who is the right tackle, to move over because I'm the right guard. The linemen must lie flat before the snap, then get on all fours, then up on their toes as the play is called. I'm not quick enough to do this. I'm still on my knees when the ball is snapped. On the first play the man I am defending helps tackle the quarterback. On the next play I block well, keeping three men off the quarterback. We score a touchdown! The coach tells me I did a good job blocking.
