This dream was very recent. I dreamed I was doing finals and right after finals I flew down to Cancun, just by myself. It turned out I went swimming in a pool in Cancun. There was a bar in the water in a cave. When I swam up to get a drink I heard my name being called over the speaker. There was a guy speaking half Mexican-Spanish and half English. What I remember him saying was that I forgot to feed my dog and I had to go home. Next thing I knew I woke up and my dog was licking my face.
