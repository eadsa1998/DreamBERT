I was down close to the ground and there was a bee close to my face. One was in a hole. His rear was sticking out. I was in Fairchance, PA. I saw a train coming. When it passed, two cars with red hot coke went by and then another two. I was going across another crossing and the red signal flashed and he gates came down. I went back to wait for the train to come by. I met Pisto Jernick. I asked him if his sister was still around the neighborhood and he said she lived in Oliver and her two boys were men now. I sat in a restaurant. Mr. Stebner sat in a chair and the sun was shining on him. He moved away from it because it was to hot. I was in a restaurant and they had success on the menu. We had a little dog. We went up on the screen wire of our porch. We spun around the porch and the dog ran on the screen around like on the ground. George Lasko came over and put my electric lawn mower beside a tree and it started to burn the tree. I went on someone's porch and pulled the pipe out. A little dog tried to bite me, but I held him down with my hand. Then he turned out to be a little baby and was loving me up. I could see a glare flicker light on the horizon as though there was a fire over the hill.
