 There is blue and/or brown water tower. It has a smiley face on it, like the Oak Valley water tower. It may be being painted. It is first wrapped in a large bandage-like material, like a huge ace bandage. I'm on top of the water tower. It sits in a body of water, like an ocean. There is a boat at the bottom of the tower. I'm very afraid of the height of the tower. I'm afraid of falling, and of darkness. I want to get down fast! It seems I have some sort of bicycle that I made it to the top with, and that I have to get on to go down. I'm very afraid of going from the top of the tower to the bicycle. I'm in a boat on the ocean with two men. I want to leave. I try to force them to leave; to control them. I have a rope and a 2x4 piece of wood that I use to wield my power. The man gets the rope from me: I lose it. I want to smack the man on the head with the 2x4. He cuts me with a razor blade so I won't go in the salt water. He then pops my air suit, on my body, with the blade. It's dark. The ocean water where we are is shallow: a couple feet deep. The water dries up, leaving a floor. A man committed murder unknowingly when he had sex with his wife in saltwater on their wedding night.
