I'm at a swimming pool and a bunch of kids I know are there. They got into a fight and the rest of the kids had to go to reform school. When they were on the bus, we ran away and stuck our tongues out at them and ran to the end of the school. We went in and I saw my best friend Mary. We walked up the stairs until we reached the top. The only way we could go was through a pipe. They said, "Don't go through," and Mary went in. She landed in a swimming pool. It was like a waterslide... she said to go north in the waterslide or else I would land somewhere else, so I went down. It was lots of fun. Then the other person went down and went south and we never saw her again. It was a cool place.
