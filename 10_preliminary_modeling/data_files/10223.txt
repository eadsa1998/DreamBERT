WALLY has been taking down all the pictures from the walls in our home; he says he is "studying" them. I try not to be angry, and manage to re-hang the heavy painting of San Antonio that I like especially back on the wall, with great difficulty. -- shift: the French doors in our house do not close properly and SNOW has drifted in during a snow storm; I soak up the wetness with newspapers. shift: in VIENNA with a young girl and fat lady; we are driven around by a chauffeur and the fat lady invited us to dinner, but says not to come too early because she likes to sleep late; We agree and say "till 2 PM tomorrow."
