I was at the Technical College and it was still yesterday and some time after my interview. I walked out into the lobby and saw JJ DeCeglie standing outside the front doors, leaning against the wall of the ramp on his phone. I ducked out of sight and found Cecelia and said that he was still here. When I went back out he was inside and saw me and invited me to something tomorrow. It was some really expensive show (like $600 or something). I said I couldn't afford it and didn't really have spare time and he kept saying weird things. I managed to leave briefly and found Cecelia and said he invited me somewhere and she said 'like on a date?' and I said 'I don't know, maybe he's just trying to be friendly' and she went out to speak to him and I was trying to tell her not to. She started saying stuff like to back off and she said something to me like 'stop being so deluded' [as in, people do like you]. Then it started pouring down and was really windy; the rain was also coming inside somehow. JJ went down a tunnel around the corner to go to a carpark and we had to follow as it was the best way to avoid the weather. We were concerned about how we would get back to Good Advice. Later, I was at Good Advice and Gordy was there dancing around.
