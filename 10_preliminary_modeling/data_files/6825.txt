H. is talking about Jo. One of her friends wants a gardener but she doesn't want Jo. because he is always talking about his divorce. I remark, "He's lonely. When someone is always talking about personal matters, he's lonely." H. doesn't see it so. I ask if she thinks Jo. Should rather be a gardener than a carpenter. She thinks he could take the latter job on after hours. Not much work is needed.
