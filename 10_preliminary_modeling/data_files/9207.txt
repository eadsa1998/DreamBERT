I was thinking (in the dream) about the things that sit on my nightstand and how they impact my sleep and my dreams. I was trying to figure out which things I could move. The little things that sit there are there because I want to use them every night and I'm afraid if I put them in the top drawer I will forget. Some of them I have gotten out of the habit of using. Still, I would like to get back in the habit of using them.
