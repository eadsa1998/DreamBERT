["Man Loves me"]  I am a young woman dressed in a beautiful evening gown. I am walking down a long flight of stairs, reach a platform and then down another flight of stairs. A young man is at the bottom of the stairs waiting for me. He is dressed in a tuxedo. He is in awe of my beauty. He loves me. I walk to him and he puts his hands on my shoulders and looks lovingly into my eyes. He is completely and awesomely in love with me. I feel loved and special.
