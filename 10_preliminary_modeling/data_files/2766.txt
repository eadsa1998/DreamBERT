I decide to take Abner's baby for a few hours. I don't tell him. It ends up I kept the baby overnight and now I feel guilty because I never called Abner to let him know and he must be worried. I worry he'll really be mad at me when he gets the baby. I am standing in the middle of a huge grocery store looking for some food to give the baby. I see packages of baloney, cheese and so on. I choose to feed her cheese and crackers. Then I remember she eats cereal and milk and decide to find some for her.
