Boat wants to leave. I go to the White House and enter the Oval Office through a large door. Am pleased to be here and that I am so familiar with the place. I see President Clinton, who is very insecure. He is glad I'm there and takes me to a meeting of the Cabinet. I only recognize one friend from Washington. The meeting is next to a dark, rectangular pit. Suddenly, prehistoric birds fly up. They are red with gigantic, glowing red wings. I ask my friend if these are pterodactyls. He says no. They are archaic birds I have never seen. Then it is five years later. A new communication system has been developed that uses very elegant feminine units which give universal access.
