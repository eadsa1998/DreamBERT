Last night, I first dreamed that we were getting new flavors of ice cream in the snack bar. I was in the library with Sue when we found this out. Mr. Chloe wanted us to babysit. So we did, but then we had to leave to go bake cookies or something. Then it was the last day of school, and everyone rushed out of main building to the music building, where we had to listen to a concert. Everyone kept sliding down the side of the hill. All of a sudden, I was in the alumni house with a Spanish home stay family (and I communicated with them in Spanish in my dream). Margo was there and we were looking for ice cream, before I realized I had to be babysitting. I ran into the main building and went down to the English wing, where there was a talk about college. The bell rang and I had to run up to the history wing, where I knew no one. Then I woke up.
