I am working for MIUSA. We are at a camp someplace. A woman with CP wants to show me something. We walk up a long rickety flight of stairs at the back of a building, go in, and walk down another flight, go across the building and out the door. She trips several times, nearly falling. She is very happy because she's been given permission to adopt a young disabled girl. She's taking me to see her. I haven't a clue why we had to go through that empty barn first. Now I'm leaving. The camp trip is over and I get a gift box sent in the mail. I open it. It's from the crew at the Forest Department. I had stayed at their office building and they so enjoyed my charming personality they wanted to give me a gift. I am very touched. It's a large logging truck, but no logs, just little cubicles to put cute little miniature knickknacks in. It is filled with little things. Behind it is a knickknack holder in the shape of a doll house and had oodles of miniature furniture and things in it. I'm very pleased. Now someone comes in with bad news to tell me. Charla comes in and sits on my lap. She is very sad. I ask her what happened. She says, "Henry the 16th has died." I at first don't remember who that is. Then I remember it is my daughter Ellie's good friend that Charla loved so much she named her kitten after her. I rock Charla, being soothing and also thinking, "Well, I thought the bad news was going to be bigger than that, maybe a national tragedy." I am a bit let down. Some other counselor comes up to say goodbye and we talk about the young woman with CP. I say, "It's so amazing. Here she can barely walk across the room without hurting herself and yet she has just the right loving skills to help her adopted child. It's a beautiful contradiction.
