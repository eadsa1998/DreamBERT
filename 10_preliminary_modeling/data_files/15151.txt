I was watching Supernatural. Two people were in an office who liked each other and then one got possessed and killed everyone. I was thinking they were chosen because the actors were married in real life and they had chemistry. Then I went into a bathroom and when I came out, the possessed person was nearby and was a demon. Then I was Sam, but it was from my POV. Dean thought I went to get my gun and came into the bathroom to stop me, but I was in a bath, hiding behind the curtain. The door was locked, but he got in anyway. I explained something to him and then the creature tried to get in. It managed to get in and we said some spell and got rid of it. Ruby 'melted' into water into the bath. I wondered why Sam had married Ruby in real life. Dad watched a home reopening.
