 I'm with my friend Melanie McDyss. She and I jump off a cliff by the Main River into the water. It is later. I'm with a girl whom I don't know. We see two men across the river from us. They are jumping off what looks like a giant metal underground tunnel. The tunnel opens up at the street bank and they are jumping off it. The tunnel is big: it could easily hold 20 people. The girl I'm with won't jump with me. I remember jumping with Melanie, and I think, "I wonder what Melanie was wearing when we jumped", but I can't remember. The girl and I may be in a power struggle, which is why she doesn't jump. I see something down by the Main River, and I want to head right for it. It is something big that I want to see. I start to walk there. It is as if I am on the west side of the river in Wilmerton, just north of the hospital. I see my high school classmates John Kulik and Aaron Stevens. I walk by, keeping my distance. They verbally antagonize me. They say something about my sister Heather's friends beating me up. In his cocky attitude Aaron tells me to come towards him, taunting me. I walk over to him, poised. I get near them, and they come at me. I fight them. I punch them each several times, solidly. I know my mom will be home tomorrow. These two may come to our house for me and disturb her, which I don't want.
