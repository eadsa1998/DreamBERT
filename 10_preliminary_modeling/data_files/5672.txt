[1997-08-02] I had this weird dream. I was at a Waldbaum's Food Mart, at the cashiers place and somehow I told her that I had to take this liquid medicine that the gynecologist had prescribed, I asked her if she could tell me how much to take. She said "This isn't liquid medicine, this is nitroglycerin for your heart." I said "I don't have any trouble with my heart." But I took them from the cashier and somehow I wound up at a place with round picnic tables and there were a bunch of people there, males and females that I didn't know. I asked someone about this stuff, this liquid like a Maalox or something that I should be taking for my stomach. They said "Oh, those are heart pills, do you have trouble with your heart?" and I said, "No." and I ended up putting the bottle of pills in the shower. It was still sealed. How the shower got into it I do not know.
