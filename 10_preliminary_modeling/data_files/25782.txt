 I'm at some sort of gathering. My high school classmate Chad Owens is there. I talk to him. He jokes about his girlfriend, who is a short, skinny woman. The gathering ends. It seems like, or it is, a Teen Variety Night that I would go to in junior high. A lot of people from my high school class are there. People leave quickly. I go to the room where people's shoes are. I can't find my boots. I look all over and can't find them. Something may happen with my Grandpa and Grandma Redding: it may be their house. They say someone's shoes always get stolen.
