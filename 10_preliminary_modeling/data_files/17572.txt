Something to do with my old online friend Marty, but he was in a wheelchair.  And then I was pissed at my boyfriend Jeremy because he didn't let me go to a city an hour away, but he went to a city 6 hours away without any notice.  And then I found my mother and maternal Grandma Jane in a department store.  My mother called to some kid 4 floors down about a laundry basket and I gave my mother and Grandma Jane both hugs.  But there was a guy with my mother, and according to some strange test she'd taken, the results showed that we were his kids.  This didn't seem all that strange to me- I just figured that in an alternate reality he was her younger brother so the DNA would be similar.
