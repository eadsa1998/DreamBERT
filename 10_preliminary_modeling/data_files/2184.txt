I'm in the back seat of a car telling a woman in the front seat what my father does for a living. I sit in different positions like a teen on the phone, including up-side-down. I say he's a paleontologist now and even has a plant fossil named after him, "S.i." I comment that he used to be a musician, or rather a music teacher. I see a plant that I call an S.i. (named after me). It is a primitive, a green stalk with nodules for roots. It is easily plucked from the ground (like the plant at the forest camp). I see it only grows in clumps at the end of benches (like picnic table benches). Now I'm getting into a convertible car. I have boots on -- black, lace up boots (not sexy, but interesting). It has a lavaliere mike on it and I say, "I'm wired for sound." I get in the back seat, seated up on the top like a prom queen. There's a baby girl (2 years) in the corner of the back seat with me. My father is driving. He gives me a glass of champagne and I comment (or think), "It's a good thing I'm not in the front seat with Dad. People could get the 'wrong' idea about a sexual relationship." There's a black cover top over the back seat that I'm seated on.
