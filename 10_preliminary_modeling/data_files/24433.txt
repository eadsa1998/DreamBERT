I am again led to a prison. The black man in front of me kisses the jailers hand. I walk past, then turn around and do the same. The gesture is followed by submissive talk, that he will be as on me. I escape. There is a cave from which come holy sounds. The shadows of animals run across its walls. I am flying through rock, then thick, lava like water, then water. I see a piece of rope and with both hands reach for it. My head clears the water and I see that I am in a beautiful lake. Still clinging to the rope I am 1/10th my normal size. I have been hoisted up by a child, a little girl of perhaps seven.
