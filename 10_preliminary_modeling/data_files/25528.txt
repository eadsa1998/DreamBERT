 I'm playing volleyball against my high school classmate Laura Thompson and another woman. I beat them. Then, instead of playing them against me, it is a team sport: I am playing against a team of women! The game is kind of like football. A big piece of peppermint candy is the ball. I pick it up and run the length of the field, breaking and dodging tackles. There is a cute black woman there. I evade her before I score a touchdown. I hump across a road in one stride.
