I bought something from Liddie Fosek. I gave him a $5 bill and he gave me two thin sheets of silver, a little bigger than a dollar bill and he said that each sheet was worth a dollar and I would not have any trouble passing it. Later I had it bunched up together. I got close to the wall and looked to see if it lined up with the wall on the other end. I was on the 6th floor of the White's building in the flats. I looked down the sidewalk and it was high. I looked twice. I said, "If you would jump down, you would kill yourself." I was working in Dill's and John Sereno, the boss looked at two clocks on the wall and said, pointing to one of them, "This one is the right time." I looked at the sky and the air was polluted with smoke and bad odors. I had a carrot. I was washing it off. It was kind of soft, which meant it was old. There was a pile of carrots near me. I was tempted to take one, but it would be stealing.
