I'm in T City. I look out the window and I see huge white puffs of smoke and steam. Mt. St. Helens has blown. I see a white sky scraper in Dover that falls over. The awesome power of the volcano is approaching me at T City. I run to the sink to fill empty milk bottles with water before the shock wave hits.
