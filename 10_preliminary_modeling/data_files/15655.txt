It was the day of my flight, except it was night. I hadn't packed anything and I didn't have a suitcase. I had that light blue bag and a plastic bag and I was putting my stuff in them until I realized I couldn't fit my clothes. I called Dad to ask if he had a suitcase. It was almost time to leave for the flight and I started to panic and wanted to cancel, but tried to stay calm.
