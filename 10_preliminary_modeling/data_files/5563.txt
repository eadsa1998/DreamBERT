[1997-05-19] I am at work, walking around the halls without my dog, I don't have a dog and it doesn't seem to bother me, and I am walking around without a cane. I'm walking around without getting hurt or bumping into anything. My boss is there and he's saying that we have to treat a certain person well at work because he is going in for an operation and they don't know what's going to happen to him. I'm thinking, "yeah, he ought to be telling people to be nice to everybody all the time anyway and not just when they're having medical problems." I was wondering if I was going to run into him before he went to the hospital and people had said that he was at work and I said "he's too sick to be here. He shouldn't be here." Its later and somehow I'm upstairs of my house and a whole bunch of strange, bad people come in but they're barking like dogs, they're making these noises like barking dogs make and that sound like Bob Steele used to play with, the barking dogs which were supposed to represent some kind of hunt. My mother was there and she said that I had to get rid of this cough drop because the bad people put something bad on it that would hurt me. Then I remember my mother how my mother had cancer in real life and how she wouldn't and couldn't get better, even if she got rid of the cough drop, it wouldn't matter.
