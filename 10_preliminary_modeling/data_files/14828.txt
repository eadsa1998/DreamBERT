I was at a shop but in the car. Calvin came and asked me to drop him off at school and so I did. It hurt my left leg and arm to drive. I called Mom to take a look. Chase (House) was sick and he had been sick before. Cameron (House) was upset and said "I'm sick of having to tie you up". He didn't know what she was talking about. There was a photo of him as a baby with this metal thing on his head and he screamed.
