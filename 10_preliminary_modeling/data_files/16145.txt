I had a dream last night; actually, I had several choppy ones. I dreamt that I was in Ms. Hanson's class, and she was having us copy things. She had this bag that stunk and she just wanted us to copy what was due on Monday and make sure we understood everything. Then I was watching a variety show, and they had Jackson Browne perform the Stay (Loadout) song. And then we were having this Christmas party, and Alicia was there, and Mrs. Andersen and Lawrence were all there. And it was Allison's birthday, I think, and Allison didn't come yet. And then we put on this CD of instrumental stuff, and Mrs. Andersen and I were singing. And I was telling Mrs. Andersen, I mean, I Mrs. Andersen was telling me that my grade was gift (?) of my voice, and I told her that Mrs. Dougherty really brings it out in me and she should volunteer for us sometime. And then she said that she had to go, but then she came back with this big jar, that was like a candle thing, and she gave it to Allison for her birthday. And then she was helping us lift things into this truck for some reason. And then I woke up.
