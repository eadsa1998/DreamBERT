Outside a two-story house.  I asked my boyfriend Jeremy how he thought they got the car parked on the first floor roof.  There was a pathway up the hill near the next house so I figured that was used, but it was still not fully explanatory.  Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived as Mr. Freeze, asking if anyone wanted anything frozen.  The neighbor wanted the driveway frozen, so he squirted a little 'freezing liquid' on it.  I objected because it was dangerous, but they didn't listen; fortunately he didn't squirt that much, just covering a spot that had oil on it.  I wondered how the people get the car off the roof and backed my car off of it into the driveway.  The bump wasn't as bad as I was expecting.  Jeremy drove me somewhere.  There were signs, one for graduate students and one for undergrad students, with arrows pointing to respective areas, yet they both only led to tennis courts.  We drove around the tennis courts.  I went to the shop, which was a pizza parlor or restaurant.  We seemed to be having a sort of company party.  My boss Juana's mother was coming in and she was getting some sort of mozzarella nuggets, a large slice of pizza, and another quarter of a cheese pizza.  It came to $41 something.  Her mother was gone so I was going to pay for it, assuming I would be paid back.  I only had a twenty though, and I asked if anyone had change to help pay for it.  Someone gave me a handful of coins, but that was it.  Somehow I had become responsible for this outrageous bill even though it wasn't my food.  I went upstairs.  The entire place seemed pretty dark.  I went to use the restroom but it was the elevator, an old one with a metal bar door.  People kept coming in and going up and down so I had no privacy.  A mother tried standing in front of her children so they would not see me.  Jeremy and I decided on something else we needed to get from the wholesale store.
