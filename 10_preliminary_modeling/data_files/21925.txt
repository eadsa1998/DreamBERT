I was at Dill Co. and a fellow came out of the office and I heard over the PA system, "If you guess who Mr. Dill is, you win $75." I yelled at the fellow, "You are Mr. Dill," and a fellow near him said that also, after me. He shook hands with him, and I walked up to him and shook hands with him and we went into the office. The fellow and I won the $75. So the man in the office gave us the money. I counted it and only had 20 some odd dollars. I told the fellow that this is not _ of $75. I said it was $37.50. So I counted it over and he gave me a couple of dollars and it was still short, and so was the other fellow's. So he gave me items and said it was worth a dollar and still I was under $30. I must have counted it about 5 times and it was short of the amount. Then I saw small girl children, like Judy, 3 and 4 years old, come in handcuffed like prisoners. A row of them came in, about seven or eight cuffed all together. I looked at them and thought what where they -- prisoners or small shoplifters or what?
