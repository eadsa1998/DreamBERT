I was approached by a friend who made Japanese gardens--in the dream only--and he said he would make me a garden free. He was so slow or so busy, he got around to finishing it when he was famous. He and I never discussed money--I felt it was free as practice for a beginner. He finished it and it was perfect. Just as I wondered if it would bankrupt me, a beautiful woman came and stood in front of it. She was confident, cocky, and luscious: her print dress showed her good figure.
