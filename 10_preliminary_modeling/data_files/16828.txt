I was driving my car, drunk and stoned out of my mind. I was totally out of control and couldn't see straight. I hit a curb and wondered if it would be OK to leave my car there. I decided I would have to because I was in no condition to keep driving. I got out of my car and there were a bunch of people in a jeep who wanted to take me to a party. In the dream my car was a convertible and the top was down. They didn't want to wait for me to put the top up. I was afraid someone would steal my car but I decided to chance it. I got into the jeep and they whisked me off to this wild party. I decided I wanted to go back to my car and someone agreed to give me a ride. When I got there not only was my car still there but someone had come by and left me gifts in it.
