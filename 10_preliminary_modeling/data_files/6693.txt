Four or five of us are drilling outdoors. We each have two spears which we must hold upright and parallel about a foot apart. One of mine is almost broken and I can not hold it up. The drill master, a woman, comes out. When she sees my broken spear, which is splintered across, she agrees I couldn't use it and goes to a shed and from a long piece of wood, a 2x4 inch in width, begins to whittle out a new spear. A man goes to help her as she will be too slow.
