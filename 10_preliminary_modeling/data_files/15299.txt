There was some gathering thing at Dad's old house. The pool was iced over. Spaceman and Gizmo were sitting on it. Spaceman's bit of ice fell in and he kept sitting on it and kept dipping in and out of the water which looked funny. Then I jumped in and saved him. Gizmo fell in, but got out at the steps in the shallow end. A creepy black cat stared at her. Some guy decided to make me do a magic trick, so I needed a pair of pants with a zip. We were going to to the shop to find some. Ezra and Dad were there and I decided to go with them instead.
