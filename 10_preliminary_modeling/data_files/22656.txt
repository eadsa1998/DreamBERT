I was in an old bus. There were few people and the driver was a Chinese guy whose wife, also Chinese and with old clothes on, was next to him. I didn't know where to get off. We were going through unknown places; they looked like highways with farms along the road. All the passengers were getting off and finally I was alone. I went over to the driver and asked him where he was going. Suddenly the bus disappeared and I found myself in an old house with the same characters, who smiled in a sinister way. I wanted to open the door, but it was very heavy. Finally I did open it, and all the houses were white and looked empty. I started to run, the streets were narrow and with stones, and suddenly I saw myself alone, nobody was chasing me.
