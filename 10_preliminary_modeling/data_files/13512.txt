I was at this place that we went to regularly. There were a bunch of different obstacles. One was this turning platform and you had to jump to the next one and you get food. There was one which would either be this easy thing to get rid of or it would be Godzilla, or a 'snake' (with water and it 'slips'). They would chase you and you could die, but we survived.
