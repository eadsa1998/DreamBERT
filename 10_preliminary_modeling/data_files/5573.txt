[1997-05-23] I'm trying to type on a little tiny portable typewriter on my lap and I'm having all kinds of trouble because when I go to type I know its not writing. The key isn't hitting the mechanism and I'm worried about the quality of what its going top look like and I'm having all kinds of problems, and I was mad because we didn't have tables, we were all sitting in this theater style room and we didn't have tables or anything and there wasn't anything we could do about it and I was really frustrated and there were all kinds of people around and D, my boss was there and a whole lot of other people were there. I'm not sure what the situation was.
