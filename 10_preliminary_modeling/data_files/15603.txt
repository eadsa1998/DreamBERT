I was in a line of prisoners. A guy behind me joked about him and his boyfriend having sex. Somehow I got out and ended up in this sandy place like a town/village. I was with a girl. I saw this guy who I'd seen earlier shoot and throw his hands up. Nothing happened and he told us to come with him. We tried to run up this big sand hill which was impossible to climb. He ran 'into' it and then stairs appeared -- there was a secret button? It didn't reach to the top, but we went as far as we could. He had to get some peanuts. Then we were sitting on a small round disc on the top. The stairs were gone. The police came and saw us eating on there, but I don't know how we got there. His name was Common [something] but later he said his real name was Windy Bags, which I thought was weird.
