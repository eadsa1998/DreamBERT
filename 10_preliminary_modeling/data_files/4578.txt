["Raining in the bed."] I am in an apartment. I met this attractive nice guy who is attracted to me as well. He is friendly. He wants a relationship. I am attracted, but I am concerned. It won't work out. Something will go wrong and I will be disappointed. I see that a large leak of water is pouring onto the bed and it is very wet and soaked. I am distressed by this. See, I think, it's clear the relationship won't work.
