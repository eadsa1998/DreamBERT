My friend Tyler was going out with a girl who worked in a brothel. We went to meet her after work. It was a large bungalow surrounded by overgrown fields on the outskirts of town. We didn't go in - rather she came out to meet us. She was tall with long hair and didn't speak much. To me she was simultaneously attractive and repulsive. Tyler didn't seem to share my view. Some of her friends or colleagues came outside. There was drinking. It gets fuzzy after that.
