I am in a store and notice some of Wendy's drawings on a counter; they are small cards and sell for 15c. "Why not sell them for 10c or 5c?" But Wendy says No and shows me a review by an art critic who says she is a great artist! I am very proud. -- shift: Frank and I have to drive all night, as we gave away our last $20.-bill to a girl in need. We stop at a place that is not familiar to me, but when Frank walks in a young girl says: "Oh, I missed you so." But then she is embarrassed. Frank introduces me to her and she is quite pleasant; he also knows others and walks about the place "snooping." Frank carries a Tupperware container filled with chocolate candy but does not offer them around to anyone. we leave without saying good-bye; I am embarrassed.
