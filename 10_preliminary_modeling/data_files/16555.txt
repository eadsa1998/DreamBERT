Mom and I were shopping at this little store in downtown somewhere. We were on a trip somewhere and I don't remember where we were. And I dreamt that we stepped outside and we saw these two like plumes of smoke in the east, and that kind of symbolized something. I think it symbolized Lorna and Reyna and how they kind of stand together, and in my dream, instead of all the way, there was sort of a reddish colored CD called "This is It" with, there were two figures on the front, naked. And, of course, that doesn't actually exist, but it was right after talking about love, kind of as a farewell thing for a while. And so I was going to go over and investigate what in the world that was, and it was like a fancy, exclusive hotel with a meeting room thing, and apparently I got the notion that it was through the fundraiser thing for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. And they were doing a thing there, and Mom and I snuck in and how she does sometimes, sent me to the front with somebody else. I climbed over a couple chairs and there were like four empty chairs in the front row and I took one of them. And this lady, this Barbara lady is talking and talking, and showing little movie things about their life and stuff, and then Celine Dion came out to talk to the people, and she was in a wheelchair, like one of those scooter motorized things. And before she addressed the people, apparently they were like taking a break or something, and she came up to the people in the front, and I said, "I know you've heard this a thousand times, but I'm one of your biggest, most humongous fans." And she leaned over and the took my one hand in both of hers, and her voice was like real soft and mystery, kind of like _________ is, and I couldn't figure why that was.
