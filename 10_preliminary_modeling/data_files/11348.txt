I dreamt that I was in, the lounge in the basement of Adelbert and suddenly the thought occurred to me that I had my final speech in Speech 200 togive the next period and that I wasn't prepared. I got very panicky and began to sweat and to moan what am I going to do. I woke up with a start. There were other students in the room but they were shadowy background figures.
