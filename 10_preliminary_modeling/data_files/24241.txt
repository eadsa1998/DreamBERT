I dreamed of my former girlfriend Karen. It was a mix of lust, jealousy, want and affection. I was with her in an older house, hybrid of summit view and vista place. We went upstairs. She wanted to talk and was flirtatious. I left her briefly and when I returned it had rained and everyone was gathered in a high-school like hall lobby, where a dance party was taking place. I was looking very much forward to dancing with her. But she was dancing with some other guy, my polar opposite, the tall typical white fratty guy. It hurt, but I let her go without saying anything. She was the type who couldn't be cloistered. And I felt that her heart was true. If she really did care, it wouldn't mean a thing. I walked to the back of the room, into the theater area. It was dark. Safe.
