I dreamt about paintball and my boyfriend Jeremy's mother.  I was sitting at a table with her.  I got up to follow Jeremy but wanted to be polite toward his mother.  I said, "Chotto matte kudasai"..no, there's something more polite than that.  I corrected myself and went off.  I was going to run off into the paintball game but I didn't have the mask, so had to go back and get it.
