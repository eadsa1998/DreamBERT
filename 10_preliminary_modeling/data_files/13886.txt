I ended up in 1910 with David Tennant as the Doctor (Doctor Who). The TARDIS had screwed up and didn't come through with us. Sometimes I was with Eugene not the Doctor. There was a video of this girl and a guy with a doctor on some rocks. The girl hated them but she was enjoying herself anyway. The doctor mentioned Bonnie and Clyde. Then it was like 1919 and we met up with these other people who traveled in a TARDIS. They knew we were too and I went to go with them but the Doctor said "Izzy! Don't touch it!". He explained that I'd get disconnected from the other TARDIS and I would disappear, so I didn't touch it. In the mid 1920's, we met this lady who was a psychic. I asked her what you play games on and she said "computer" and I mentioned a song and started singing "I asked Bobby Dylan" and she said "I asked The Beatles" (The Seeker). There were photos of Bonnie and Clyde and there was a whole section in a library dedicated to them. There were photos from the movie, but with different people. Somehow I told Dad that we were stuck in time and had been for 10 years (although it had gone faster for us, we also hadn't aged). He went inside the TARDIS and hit something, he got out of it and it fixed it. We got back and I hugged him. I went to hug the Doctor but I thought 'we did enough hugging'. Dad and I were walking across a road and there was a car with an old number plate.
