The YOH fest was on and there were fifty people in it. Darius, Jeremiah and Eugene told me to do it. I didn't want to. They were all on a stage and Alejandro was there. Darius's 'boyfriend' came up on the stage and they danced together. Darius had a body suit on. I was going to ask the people if I could do behind the scenes stuff. Colleen was one of the nine directors.
