Prom Dresses Over The Sink. I am in M City house. There is something about my parents. I go in the kitchen and see clothes hung up like in a closet only it's just across the kitchen area. I see several of my prom type dresses from high school, with scoop neck, bouffant skirts, blue, and one is yellow. I touch one and think it's rather course, cheap material, not like I remembered it.
