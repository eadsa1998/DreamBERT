At a conference where we're talking about Pitjantjatjara. It is a Jungian conference and all the experts on Australia are very upset because we shouldn't be talking about this. It should be kept in the area of the experts. Someone says that we should try to understand the individuals. I say, "No, it is important to first feel the foreign- ness of the whole culture. Only then can we begin to understand and feel the individual." I feel there is an artificial split between the individual and the culture. One of the experts comes in. A young man, like a serious student. He says, "We've done all these studies and now you are all doing this. In the end you'll end up walking behind."
