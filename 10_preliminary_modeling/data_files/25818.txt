 My coworker Tom from Fishing Haven presents me with birthday presents. They are from my bosses Mike and Phoebe, but Tom gives them to me. I get them a month early. I get a cap made of animal fur with a tail, and it says "vegetarian" on the front. I also get a fishing lure, which is a yellow floating lure with a weighted tail that sinks. I talk to Mike then, and he indicates I can have a backpack too. I am happy because my backpack is falling apart.
