There was a long piece of tinsel lying diagonally on the table, but there had been something supporting it in the middle. What was it? A clock? I started looking for it but what was missing was my little tree. I asked the steward on the ship if I had left it in the dining room. He said no. I continued to hunt. Then asked conductor on train if we were at C.R. yet for the train had stopped. He said no we were at Longview. Someone asked me where I lived. I answer 610 So. 5th St. C. R. Iowa. When hunting for tree saw its colored ornaments.
