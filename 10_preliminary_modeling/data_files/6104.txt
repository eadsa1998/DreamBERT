My friend, Natalie, who I met this past summer at Suffolk and who has been in several of my classes, invited me to her apartment. I was then in her apartment, only I knew in my dream that this was my house that I was renting out, not knowing it was to her, or that it was once my house and I sold it. I'm not clear as to which was the case. (After I woke up, I realized this house reminded me of the house of my mother's friend who I used to visit quite often as a young girl with many differences. My mother died eight months ago and her friend has been dead for many years.) The first part of the house I recall in my dream was the roof patio. Natalie had expressed that the house was in bad shape and needed quite a lot of repair. We were looking at the floor of the patio and its red terra cotta tiles that looked quite nice to me. However, Natlalie wanted to replace them. I'm not sure why. We then went into the living room. The wallpaper was so old, dirty and torn. It was in terrible shape. As we were walking through, I saw some kind of porcelain doll that I thought had belonged to my mother. There might have been other items that I thought to have once been mine or my mother's. I was surprised to have seen them there. (I did not recognize any of the items in real life.) I also think there was a sort of hurricane lamp. I was trying to fix the chimney part of it. (In real life I do feel a sort of connection with this sort of lamp and feel as though I remember my family had one that resembled the one in my dream a long time ago.) The chimney was either missing, broken or crooked, I'm not sure. I was quite agitated about this doll and some of the other items. I may have felt that I didn't want to lose them and felt connected to them in some way.
