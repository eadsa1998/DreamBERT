I'm working with a lobbyist [a woman] in Washington. Not clear if I'm being paid or volunteering. We go to a meeting for a briefing on some recent event. Everyone eats breakfast but me -- I'm aware I'm pregnant because I'm thinking I should get something in my stomach. I leave the meeting early. Next is a brief scene at a university. I'm there with my husband and some friends. A white limo rolls by with two guys in it. They look like rock-band types -- long Fabio hair and they're stripped to the waist.
