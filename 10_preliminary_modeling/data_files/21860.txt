I played Jet Marble. I almost missed him because he was on the back of the page where the entries were. He won. I was on our side street. A big truck came by and then a ditch or trench digger was digging a deep ditch on the side street. The man was in the water in the ditch holding the digger and in water up to his shoulders. The water was dirty. Ann was standing in the water also. Then she swam across the little pond of dirty water. She was black from it. I was surprised she could swim. Her head went under and she came up all dirty. I wrote my dream on the paper, so I wouldn't forget it.
