 I'm in a room of an apartment watching television with my mom and my siblings. My mom is on the phone. A second phone rings. My mom answers it. People come to the door and ring the doorbell. I get the door. I go outside and see what two men at the door want. One of the men is the owner of the apartment on the second floor next door. He has a sidekick with him. They are like gang/mobsters, dressed in suits. The owner tells me that they can't have the owner of our apartment standing out in front of our apartment all the time. I ask the men if they mean to tell me that the owner of our apartment can't stand on his own property! They say yes! I tell them that we're moving out tomorrow, but that I'll call the owner and give him the message. They thank me and give me a message for him written on the top piece of a small blue pad of paper. The man gives me the whole pad of paper and they leave. I drop some coins that are inside of the blue pad. The coins are a tip from the men for calling the owner. They want me to give him the message. I look inside the pad and see a $10 bill. I pick up the dropped coins and go inside. I have a recipe for soup on something like the back of a paper plate. This is the important message. I show everyone my tip, which I see upon opening is a $10 and $5 bill. The recipe is a valuable secret. I'm going to copy it down so I don't somehow lose it. I sit naked on the floor of the main room and start writing the recipe. I want to be more secret and protective of the recipe, so I go in the bathroom and lock the door. The recipe calls for #1 Loon or 1# Loon, other ingredients, and finally celery and onions.
