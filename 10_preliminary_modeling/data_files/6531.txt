There is the theater. A man asks if there is a donut shop nearby and where. I tell him where and he goes. A woman comes by and asks the same question. I lead her halfway there and she goes the rest of the way. Before long I hear her frantic screams for help. I know that the man I talked to earlier is to blame. Swallowing my fear, I run in the direction of her screams, also shouting for help.
