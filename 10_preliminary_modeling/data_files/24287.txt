I was in a place that reminded me of Southern California and Thailand. There were suburbs, and a city part of town. The suburbs were new and in neat rows with green lawns. They gave off a vibe of bourgeois pretentiousness. I was at this place where a man was in charge of the events going on. It was like a certain dive resort I know, but not a dive resort. We were all playing in the pool. It was overcast, and probably getting dark. There were animals playing with the people in the pool. I set my camera on the poolside. I left for a moment and came back. I asked the supervisor where my camera was, and he said the squirrel took it. Yes, there was a water squirrel running around. It had taken my camera to the bottom. In the empty pool, the water still and blue, I could see through to the bottom and my lumix there with the hand strap floating up. The guy said, oh no, sorry. I said no, it might be ok -- it's water resistant. But to being lightly splashed -- not completely submerged.  I dove in to grab it. Shit. As I lifted it, I could feel the pressure change inside and water leak inside. I turned it on. It started up, but went very very slowly, like car windows after a freeze. I could see the continuous, never-ending boot menu. I said damn, I should have taken out the battery first. I then took out the battery and there was water in the compartment. I set it out to dry.
