 I'm with my friends Stephen Ramos, Amy Leopard, and Virginia Hamms. We're getting into a car by the train bridge in Wilmerton. Stephen has babies. It is not clear to me if he physically gives birth, or if he is the father of babies. I sit in the back seat behind the driver. Amy is next to me. I'm leaning on her. She tells me not to lean on her shoulder, but to lean on her chest. We drive past the train bridge and I ask Amy if she has every jumped off. She says no, and I tell her that she should sometime and that it's a rush. She laughs. Amy and Virginia are being really nice to me. We drive to a park at the Main River. The water is really cold. Amy and Virginia eat a bratwurst with sauerkraut. They want some seasoning, and go get a packet of onion soup mix and pour it on. They share the bratwurst.
