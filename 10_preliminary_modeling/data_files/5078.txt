Some guy brings in a box of groceries we supposedly ordered. I laugh and say, "Oh no. We ordered Rye Crackers, not Rye brand dog food. We don't even have a dog. But, I'll accept this steak and porkchop." A man comes out and says, "No, we didn't order that either." I say, "Yes we did. I heard you do it." "Not this steak," he says and gives it back. "Trust me," he says and I shrug, letting go of the meat. We go back into the house and the guy starts kissing me. I like him where I hadn't before. He's the cook and has a spray of potato juice on his face. [BL]
