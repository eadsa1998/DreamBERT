I was at a dance at my school, but I didn't recognize anyone. Everything was very dark and very blurry. Then, I saw my boyfriend, Noah, across the room. I waved to him, but he didn't recognize me. I don't know what happened after that. Setting: School. Characters: A bunch of people who I didn't know, and Noah. Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. I couldn't figure out why everyone seemed so weird.
