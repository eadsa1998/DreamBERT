Third dream: I am standing on a sidewalk and a beautiful Indian man stands at my left. He's a dancer and the music is calling him. He starts to dance away and turns, smiling to invite me to dance with him. He'll teach me how to dance. As we are walking, the scene changes and we are walking into a cathedral. I think to myself, "How odd. Why am I dreaming a catholic church?" Then I notice it's a Mexican Mission. We are drawn in as a part of the crowd. We go upstairs and move to seats very close to another Indian man who is preparing his instrument. I am equally attracted to him and go closer. He has a guitar with a printer in it. Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, "Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string." It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. (I'm in the passenger seat.) I look out the window and see a two-story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears (grizzlies) starting to get out the windows. I tell my Indian man and he gets out to stop them. I see the two bears followed by a dog running away. In the sky are a helicopter and several planes. I begin to cry, left all alone in the car. I keen and lament, "I've lost everything I've ever loved." My two beautiful Indian men are gone. I weep uncontrollably. [BL]
