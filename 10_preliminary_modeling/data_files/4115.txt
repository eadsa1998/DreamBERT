I am a some kind of street carnival or celebration. Our area is like an open box with three sides. A man is lying down. He is ill. Another man is behind him. Several young women are seated in the van with us. Lots of noisy people are going by. Someone shoots a bunch of tiny metal needles. One hits the sick man in the middle of his forehead. He is hurt and complains. I am angry. I tell him I am going to complain to the leader of this carnival. I get hit a couple of times. Other different kinds of sharp things are thrown at us. I walk up the street to the leader. I complain. Nothing much happens. I walk further, feeling lost. I see a small object hung up on a prominent corner that ridicules me. I am more angry. I keep searching for my box. When I get there, everyone is gone and some other people are sitting there. I tell them to leave. They do. But they stay close by and try to set up their things very close by. I tell them again to move. Suddenly the young women return all upset and agitated about all the hostility around us.  I calm them down and ask where the man is. It is all confusing and I am angry and unsettled.
