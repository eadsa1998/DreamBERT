I was at the library with a friend of mine who was going to help me locate something, I had difficulties finding. I couldn't get into the library because I lost my ID card. So my friend was going to give me his after he slid it through the machine, but I refused because there was a guard nearby and I was afraid of getting caught. So he went without me. He seemed to take forever and I kept looking at my watch because I had a class that started soon. He finally came out and it was 5 minutes after my class already started. I grabbed his hand and let him out. We ended up in this room. There were lots of people, it was loud. We passed by this guy who I had a crush on in Highschool. . I was talking to someone and he paused and looked at me when we passed by. I feared he was thinking this friend and I were going out.
