I was watching a movie except it was playing out live and I was the main character. It was night and in the rain and I was in the UK, I think, and had no way of getting back to where I was staying. I saw this small building and knocked on the door. They opened it and let me in and I said 'My name's Abby'. There was an underground section and it turned out they were scientists and working on lots of secret things. They let me down there for some reason. While I was down there an alarm went off saying that something had escaped. I somehow 'knew' it was a zombie type of thing. There was this cage in the middle of a room (it looked like a type of lab, the whole underground area was very white and had machines and things all along the walls). I saw this fast, rabid zombie run into it and attack the guy in there. I tried to find somewhere to run or hide and I could hear chaos going on in the distance. They wanted to stop the zombie before it got outside.
