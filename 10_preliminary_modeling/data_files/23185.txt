I was at a resort hotel we stayed in once to collect my refund.  The house was even worse than I observed when my wife Anita and I were there:  There were dead fish on the floor, many of them cut open and rotting.  The owner wanted to show us a collection of mounted animal heads as if it was a museum, but all I wanted was our refund.  I heard two people discussing it and saying something about what was in the ad we were responding to, in a smaller type than the rest of the ad-a disclaimer about the conditions of the offer.  I told them there was no disclaimer, it was a very straightforward offer, and I confirmed it on the telephone.  So they wrote a check, and they told me it was on a pile of checks on a table.  I looked at the check, and found that my name was spelled wrong.  I dreaded having to ask them to write it again, but I had no choice.
