I had the worst dream ever. I dreamed that I was at some sort of camp, but it was military/boot camp. We were running laps around the track until I thought I was going to be sick. Then I got news that both my mother and father had died. I freaked out. But the guy kept making me run more laps. So then I threw up and I told myself that this had to be a dream. But I couldn't wake myself up. So then we had to sail down this river. But my boat got lost and I had to swim against the current. Thank god I woke up.
