I was at Dad's 'work'. I had friends over at Mom's. No-one was in the car and she took me to near Dad's work. I complained and walked off. I had wanted to go to somewhere to 'eat, talk and play'. There was a place with this game thing but I don't remember what you were supposed to do. The first time I got a really low score but then I got a really high score and I got rewards. The score was 2364, I think.
