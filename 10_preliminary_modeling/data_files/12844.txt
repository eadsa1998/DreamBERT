I was taking photos of Eugene and Darius. They got attacked by something. Then they were chasing me. When we finished, we ended up at this room with containers and jars. Then we were on grass and were friendly with each other. I was trying to get Eugene to eat the dirt and he did. Someone said something about "bubbly two something", but it sounded like they said another number first. Eugene asked "How can you have bubbly two something?" We were giggling about it. I can't read or remember what it was, but when I read it, I think it was either peas or pillows, or maybe neither.
