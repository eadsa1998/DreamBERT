I was somewhere and there was a toilet which only had one side and no walls. Ezra was nearby. Then we were at the shop at Toys 'R' Us. They had this yellow Runescape boat. I was in the electronics section. They had this Beatles trivia thing and something about Audrey Tautou in Amelie. I thought it was a dream and did a reality check, but then I was out the back. Then I was at 'school'. Two girls were hugging each other. I went up some stairs and I heard "Izzy" and Max (Roswell) gave me an envelope and said "It's important". I opened it and it said that he loved me and knew my "birthday secret". I closed it and said I'd read it later, because it had said in there to meet him if I felt the same way. Later, I was in a car with him and a female teacher. We went to this boring lawn mower place. The teacher left. We went past my 'mother's' (not really her) work and she sold tea and it was a drive thru. She didn't give them to people my age but she let Max have one (he was a year older). The cup the tea was in was really hot but Max had no problems holding it. Godzilla and some thing went after Brendan Fehr and he said something to Max. He could make Godzilla things and clouds appear.
