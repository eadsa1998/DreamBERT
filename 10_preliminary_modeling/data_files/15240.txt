I went to Chicken Treat for a work trial. There were no "shifts" (which actually meant places to work). The lady in charge didn't seem to care. She suggested putting me in charge of the "Harry Potter section". I said no and that I had other stuff to do anyway. I got in my car (in an underground like carpark) and was directed out. I ended up in this other bit of the shop, now on foot. There were 'forums', which were these little rooms to the side. There was one for Das Boot, Harry Potter and down the stairs was a new Joss Whedon one. Everyone was excited about the Harry Potter one. There was nothing of Joss Whedon's in his one yet. I called Mom to say I was trapped in the shop. I squatted over a bin and peed. I apologized to the others and put a towel in it. This guy opened a door which let us out. Mom was waiting and she had caught a taxi. I went off to the car and she came along saying that some guy needed the taxi so she let him take it. There was a big cruise ship parked next to the shop too (in water).
