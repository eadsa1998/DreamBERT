I was playing some odd game. I had to climb up these tunnels, using pillows to propel me. The next area I had to go into, someone else was there and they were stuck. I didn't want to go in, incase I forgot stuff that I needed and got stuck. Then we went to Nana's and we were in the lounge room near the front door. It was night. She had a present there for Granny, but Ezra opened it and it had shoes in it and he sketched a 'gamer' insult on it. Nana was upset about it. We saw Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and Poppers pull up outside. We went to a shop. I was looking at the shoes, to replace the ones Ezra had ruined. Mom said she was going to a different shop for that. I was looking for the men's clothes section. Mom asked a guy and he said it was around the corner. Then it was no longer a shop, but a 'fun' place, like a museum/amusement park thing. There were rooms with different themed activities. Gizmo was in a room. Ezra was riding around on a little wooden bike, so I went and got one.
