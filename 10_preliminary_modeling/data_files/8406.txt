I was on a team working on a project. I have no idea who the team was or what the project was. I just know that we were working on these things that were made out of wood that were probably 5 or 6 feet square. Two perpendicular edges were trimmed with something that looks like crown molding. We were cutting the wood, cutting the molding and attaching it and then painting them. On the back of each one we were writing three things. I think they were paint color, style of crown molding and I can't remember what the other was. We thought we had them all done when we learned that we still needed a couple more. In another scene we were working on something else. There were six of those. They were much smaller but square. They did not have trim on them. They seem to be something decorative to be hung on walls. We had three of the six completed. It was very late in the day and we were all exhausted. We were asking someone, I think it was the designer, if she could make do with three because we were all just totally worn out and did not feel that we could even do one more.
