I was at a swimming pool. A woman is sniffing. "I smell smoke," she says twice. I think, "Huh." A man is concerned because he likes her but doesn't feel that he wants to give up smoking. I then get into the swimming pool at the shallow end. It is pretty pedestrian, so I start moving toward the deep end. I get to the rope and decide to brave it. I swim underwater. I open my eyes and see everything clearly, as if I weren't underwater. I see the feet, legs and tummies of the swimmers on top of the water, and the water swirling as they go through it. I then realize that I need to breathe and look up. I am way down deep. I start to swim for the surface. It's hard. About half way up, I feel the pressure in my lungs and can't help myself. I take a breathe. I'm aware that in reality I'd be drowning, but I'm O.K., I'm not drowning.
