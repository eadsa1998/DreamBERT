Clark and Raya (both from Smallville) were somewhere with me. I ended up with powers at one stage. Raya said we had to do something to this box. We didn't get near it though and it exploded. We moved away from it and it exploded again. It responded to movement, so we made everything in the shop that moved, move. I was then in a container as I had been captured for something. Raya hosted some dating show and matched me and Clark. Later, Dad was on the show. Raya said that the next match wasn't "spiritual", but purely from watching me because I was funny. The match was a black woman and Dad and I were laughing.
