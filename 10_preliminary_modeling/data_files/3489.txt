My cousin Terence is flirting with me. He'd wrestle gently and I'd accidentally fall back on the floor and he'd "fall" on top of me and we'd sneak kisses and so on. It was very pleasant and I knew vaguely it wasn't right, but it was so delicious, I didn't work hard to avoid it. He was an adventurer, a wanderer, and was home for a short while. I was working on a play.
