Uncle Carl gave me a digital surround receiver for Christmas and that I was going to keep it handy to go up in my room someday. And I wanted to see if it actually works. So one time, Dad was still teaching CPR in my dream. While Dad was at a CPR class, I took our old one out and put this one in and wired it all up, and it worked. It kind of had funny sound to it though. And then I took it out and put ours back in, but I only had time to put the front left speaker wire in and I had to slide the cabinet back real quick because he was coming home. And so then I was putting it in its box and set it in the dining room. And another time, when nobody was around, I went to go look at it. It had turned to solid chocolate. [laugh] And then Mom was driving me and a couple other friends to a chorus concert in the car and Dad had to go to another CPR class, so we let him off at the park. And then when we got home, I went to check on it again, and the solid chocolate had turned into white chocolate with little marshmallows in it, and I took a bite of it and said, "Hmm, I think I've had enough for a week."
