I was swimming in a country lake with a friend of my fiance's, a young man of about 22 who was recently been married. In the dream, however, he was unmarried. Suddenly I realized that my bathing suit had come off. The water began receding slowly, exposing me from the waist up. The young man then laughed at me, pointing at me and saying that my breasts were too big. I was embarrassed and at a loss for words, and at this point woke up.
