I was walking thru a store and someone that knew me said, "Evans, Evans," and I went up to them and jokingly said, "Shoes." I had a suit on that had fancy pocket decorations with a medal decoration. A fellow got off a truck and touched my pocket and said, "What fancy pockets." I was going to hit him, but noticed that he was just jesting and didn't mean any harm and I knew him. The 79th corner drugstore was vacant. The fellow was sitting and a load of steel beams. Joe Lasko was with me. He was ready to go to work and was staggering and swaying drunk. I was pitching a dead ball to the boys in the shop and they couldn't catch or judge it. I looked into a man's and lady's eyes. They were brown and black. I saw a sign and on it was Master Bid.
