I was back in the city. I looked for a place to park and the signs were all 1 hr. parking and I wanted to park all day. I was on a big boat. It was loaded with coal. We were going up the river and I somehow was forcing the boat to go fast. All at once the coal ignited and we had to jump off the boat. I was fixing something in the house. Delatt and I were in a house fixing some repair job. The man came home from work and he knew Delatt. His wife said, "We are Booth," and I said, "I am Evans." My brother (deceased) Joe was alive, living with us. He had bad teeth and I told him to get them fixed up. When I went to sleep, I seemed to see a big girl coming towards me. I was looking at the time and it was 2:10.
