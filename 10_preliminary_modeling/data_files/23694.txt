I decide to run away and live in Carlsbad Cave.  I want to disappear from my known society.  I bring a few things, but realize later the things I forgot.  Seems like I had a pillow or sleeping bag.  I go to the cave, planning all the while where I will sleep in the cave, how I will live.  The cave is a totally different setup than it is in waking reality.  But I know my way and recognize passages.  I wonder how I will get into a side passage without all the tourists seeing me.  I look for the passage I want, passing up some because they are not the right ones.  I find the one I want and carry my stuff in.  I am thinking about cave security, logistics of getting out, when they close the cave and lock it, etc.  I go back in this passage (I wanted one with light so I can read) and at some point realize that it connects to a ranger parking area, like a covered garage or in-cave parking.  So a ranger sees me (seems like he recognizes me), and my stuff and he frowns, wondering what I'm doing there.  I realize this is pretty impossible, living in this cave.  So I decide to go home and to impress everyone, I think, I'll walk home.  From New Mexico.  Then I think how will I get my jeep home?  I think, I'll push it home.
