I'm a government spy on a mission. The police come to my house. I pretend to be an ordinary citizen. A child is snuck out of the house by my "husband" while I keep the police occupied in the front yard. He is suspicious. It's time to make a run for it. I run to the helicopter waiting in the backyard. My "husband" tells me that Ellie has run away. I am torn in conflict. I must do my duty and I want to find Ellie. I decide that we must escape. I see a friend of Ellie's and ask her if she's seen Ellie. She won't talk to me. We fly away. The helicopter now is a square pizza racing over artificial turf. Now I'm in a room and a man in a 24 karat cold overcoat has two golden derringer pistols. He's holding them to the head of my husband. I watch for my chance and jump him. I now hold the guns and my husband is safe, but the man is coming toward me. He's saying, "You won't shoot me." I hesitate and then shoot him 5 or 6 times with golden bullets. Some blood spurts down his front. He won't die. It hardly slows him up. I feel fairly neutral. Then the mail man comes with a package and I say, "Oh! It's Ellie's picture. She ran away and I can't wait to see her picture." The man gets all happy and says, "Oh, I'm delighted. Let's see it." We look at the picture. It's satin and Ellie is wearing a blue evening dress with a white sash. It's a little too big for her.
