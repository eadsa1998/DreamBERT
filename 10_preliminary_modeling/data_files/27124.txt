My dream is in three different parts and places which did not seem to have any interrelation. The flrst part took place in the kitchen at home. My mother had bought a new brown leather davenport and I was looking at it and wondering why it was in the kitchen. In the next part I was suddenly out in the snow walking along a little path. There was nothing around me for miles but walking along in front of me was a boy who kept getting farther away from me. It was getting dark and the snow was getting deeper. I called to the boy in front of me that it was getting dark and that we should go over to the road so we wouldn't get lost. I recognized the boy, let us call him W, to be a friend of my girl friend here at school. I walked over to the road which was quite slippery and began sliding along. Then suddenly I was in the living room of my dormitory. It was quite different from the way the room really is. I had two callers. One was the boy to whom I am pinned and the other was a friend whom I had dated at home during the summer. (Let us call the boy to whom I am pinned K-- and the other B) Both were sitting on the same couch reading a newspaper. I was unsure of how to handle the situation. I was afrald Ken would be angry because of the other boy. I introduced them but instead of calling Ken by his right name, I called him my brother's name. Then I was once again in the kitchen and the new brown couch had a red leather cover on it.
