I am on a space ship or station and there is a technical problem with some equipment on another ship or station. A friend of mine on board with me is worried about the problem, but I find myself telling him over a radio of some sort not to worry because I am fixing the problem. "You see", I say to him, "I went outside for a space walk." Indeed, I suddenly am out in space, working with some tools on the other ship or station. I finish the job and then radio to my friend, "As you know, there is no gravity here so I can just push myself back." I give myself a shove off the repaired vessel and begin drifting through the black space towards the mother space vessel. Just before reaching there, I see the big blue Earth a little to the side of my destination, and I slowly begin to change direction toward the planet. "Oh, oh", I say to my friend on the other end of the radio, "I'm feeling some gravity after all!" I still move slowly, floating through space and I see the Earth looming larger and larger as a giant blue and white globe. I pass through some kind of dense white barrier, like a cloud, and I radio to my friend, "Now I'm in the atmosphere. I should be burning up soon." My slow, floating re-entry now suddenly picks up speed, and I accelerate faster and faster in free fall, like a man who has jumped out of an airplane without a parachute. I then suddenly turn into a long, thin ribbon of ashes strewn across the sky for many miles. Still somehow retaining consciousness, I think to myself words to the effect of, "What a glorious way to go. Life has been a big adventure and I now I return to be ashes scattered all over the Earth. I will miss being able to see and hear, but this death is an adventure too." The dream ends with a feeling of exhilaration.
