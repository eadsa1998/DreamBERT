In chorus we were at this like big picnic in Becker Park, this field trip thing. And I was with a girl, Laura, and she was helping me get my lunch and stuff, after I finished eating, Dad was showing me this metal board with stuff on it that was supposed to make scary sounds like, for example, there was this little truck that rides on the metal board. And when it goes forward, it doesn't do anything, but when it goes backwards, it makes the back-up alarm sound. And there were these ambulances things and stuff that would ride around the perimeter, and then Ms. Dougherty was busy running around doing things. But then we were in our kitchen and Dad was questioning Mrs. Dougherty about the way she teaches, and she's defending herself. And Mom says, "Why does it matter, who cares?" And he said, "Well, even better if people are trying to contribute," and he goes in the bedroom, and her grade book happens to be sitting on the bed in the bedroom. And he looks through her grade book and he sees that she does actually have an orderly way of keeping things. And there's these CD's, these really flimsy CD's that are bigger than normal CD's that are running there and then we go around and we do different things, and we were talking about going to this restaurant, and then it's dark and we're on our porch and Mrs. Dougherty suddenly appears there, and she was talking about how she was thinking of doing this certain song. And I told her about the bluebird thing and I held her hand and I sang "Bluebird" for her and then I woke up.
