I was taking a walk near my apt. It was twilight, about 6:30-7:00 p.m. I heard a plane getting louder and louder and when I looked up, I saw that the plane was flying very low in the sky. Suddenly lights shot up from the ground and spotlighted the plane. I saw that the plane was dropping something and heard the whistling sound that bombs make in movies. I felt the bomb strike and felt the shock and fire envelope me. I figured that I must be dead; then realized that I might be dreaming, and wrenched myself out of sleep.
