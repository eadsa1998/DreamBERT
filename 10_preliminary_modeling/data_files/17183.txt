The details are hazy but general idea is there.  Something about a boat.  And riding through a small tunnel into a room with...hand puppets? Surrounded by a moat in a dark room.  And people around the outside visiting.  My dad told us to go back to bed (here in college. and my boyfriend Jeremy was with me) and we were going to...but got distracted.  I started climbing/flying through a toy store with lots of colorful boxes, and a game system demo...I think it was a toy store.  And at the end was like an airport exit, with glass doors, and I saw Merry, my old preschool teacher sitting on the floor in front of it.  Lots of the teachers.
