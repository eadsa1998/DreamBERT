It is winter: fresh snow; we have a dog: white and black. He keeps running to neighbors. Bernice has done some archaeological research, but is still deferent to my learning. --In the choir: I go to the choir conference with Bernice (neighbor). She wants to take a photo of a rack covered with snow, very beautiful; like notes on a staff-- but I hit it (accidentally) and the snow falls down. I hear the choir singing, see several people who come late. Also see Frank walking with Cindy. I am very angry at Frank: because we have to take the bus to Texas. They ask me two times if they could lend us some money: I say, "No thanks." Then on the bus, crowded, noisy, tired. I wish I had stayed home in the snow.
