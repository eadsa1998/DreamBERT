After work we are driving to where we will stay. It turns out we are going home to N City rather than stay over in the city for the night. We are driving backwards down a curvy hill. I am in the back. I say, "Lookout!" I see our back wheel has gone over the edge and we are teetering. I feel scared and in danger. I realize I can get out of the car. I crawl out of the top, which is on its side. The car doesn't fall, but I see the tracks and realize how close to danger I was!
