Me and my friend were in the attic and one of us by accident lit a match and the ceiling caught on fire. Both of us put it out, which was weird because we used a hose. My mom called and said that she had to pick me up because we were going to a wedding. We had to go to a nearby town. When we got there the couple was already cutting the cake. I got a piece of cake and then sat down. My mom got me a drink of Ginger Ale. After that I went back to my friend's house. Setting: First, I was at my friend's house, then at a wedding, then back at my friend's house. Characters: My friend Helen, her mom Joan, my mom, her dad Bill, my aunt Leslie and Uncle Hank and a bunch of people who I don't know who were at the wedding. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, bored. I was really really scared when my friend's roof caught on fire and I was worried. And at the wedding I was really bored.
