Visiting some rich people - there's a fire in their oil field, very near the house - people trying not to panic - hadn't caused any building damage yet and we're trying to salvage things from the house, china in cabinets and so forth. I'm aware of a difference between us, that my visit is okay and they're glad I'm helping, but after the emergency I'm not necessarily going to be a permanent fixture.
