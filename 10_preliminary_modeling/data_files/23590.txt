I go into the fish store to buy the green plant for my tank. It's very dark in the store. The man behind the counter shows me all different kinds of plans, but not the kind that I want. I leave and go to 219th Avenue. It's a beautiful residential area near The Park. Large houses and many trees. I walk up with someone to a large brick house and a man is walking. We go in to check his messages. We ordered Mexican food. I'm careful not to leave a mess. It gets very noisy. The peacefulness is gone.
