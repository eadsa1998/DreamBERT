It was my family's home but it was a different house than what we really have. It was cool, huge rooms, porches. My brother and sister were home. There was one room with these cool doors with flowers painted on them. There was another room with orange walls and a fluorescent orange ceiling. I sat at dinner with the family somewhere and gave my mother a card with a paint brush and white paint so she could paint the orange ceiling. Instead, she told me she had painted over the flower doors that I had loved. I was so angry. Rage. Later - there was a party at my house. No parents but Julia and Eric were there. I was there but then it seemed that I was there only at the end of the party. I was frantic because either my parents were coming home or the police or something. I wanted to start cleaning. I was pissed, yelling at people. I went to my parents room and there were people in there and a bong. I went to my room and my brother and some girl were in bed kissing. Eric said not to worry so much. Then I saw the police come. They wanted everyone to sit on the front porch steps. The front porch was really cool; it was sort of dreamy. On the rafters above the walls and against the walls were these white sculptures; some were tall white fans, others were just things, but they all had thin strips of white paper hanging off them. I liked to look at them. The police officers were all female. They were bitches and shoved us around and talked real loud. One of them (the leader I think) said, "Yeah, we just got back from doing some gay bashing". They were really macho. The officers had some attack dogs with them. They were huge and would sniff in our faces. They also growled fiercely a lot. One of them, the biggest one, was so huge and had such a bug snout that it looked like a pig. It WAS a pig, an attack pig. <br/
