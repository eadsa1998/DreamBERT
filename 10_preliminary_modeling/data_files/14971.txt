I was at a clothes shop trying clothes on. I thought someone was next to me but realized they weren't making any sound. I realized it was a mannequin. I heard someone looking in all the cubicles and it was creepy. I was trying to try on a shirt but someone reached over and I left. I was then in a carpark trying to park but there was always stuff in the way. There were some kids, but I can't read what it says. Their mother came and she yelled at me. I tried to explain but she ignored me. Ezra was there. I went over to her again and she was like 'you don't want kids having fun' and I said 'yes I do. I mean, I'm still a kid. I have a year to go before I'm out of my teens' and she was like 'oh I love those times, do you like dancing?' and I said "Nooo.". Our next door neighbour looked like Marisa Tomei.
