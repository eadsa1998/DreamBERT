I am with my friends; M. and his wife in a basement apartment; There is an air raid alarm but we laugh and joke. No fear. M. reads a sexy poem from a book in Latin or Greek. His wife goes to bed. He is sitting at my feet. I look out and see bright shiny fire engines being wheeled into place. Still no fear. Happy.
