It's my birthday. I get up and go to the living room, where there is a bed. On the bed is a guru person seated on a pillow. I say, "I dreamt you were here and now you are! How amazing." I am joined by a group of my women friends and a box of chocolate candies. It's not exactly the same candies as in the dream, but close enough. Then I get up. Howard has come in. He wants us to stay together. I want to get a divorce and go live alone in a cabin in the woods. He is sad, but agrees. We discuss who will keep the children. I want to keep them this time, but am torn, because it would be so hard, so much energy.
