I was in the car with Mom in the middle of nowhere. There was a bridge with wood slats. There was another one which also had gaps. We drove fast and then [did something I can't read] for the last one because it wasn't far. We went into a building. There was a concert with Bruce Springsteen and some guy. Springsteen's nickname was "Boxy". I had something and we mentioned holes and he gave me a light shovel and said we had to "dig a hole for safety".
