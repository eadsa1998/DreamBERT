There was an excursion. We left the excursion place at 4pm. We were on a bus and then I realized I forgot my bag. I went back to search for it, when it was realized that Calvin had taken it. We were at the back of the bus. Seamus and Dmitri were on the backseat and we were in the seat right in front of them. They were drawing pictures on this electronic thing. I was stealing theirs and saving them to my electronic thing. Seamus was making fun of a face I made. We got back to school at 7pm. The school looked like Mom's house. Then, I was at 'school', but it was a different school to the one mentioned above. Our names were called and there was goo. Adele was hit with the goo on her first day of school. Calvin came. Evelyn and I had this swappy goo stuff. I threw some at Calvin and he pretended to vomit.
