I'm leaving work - going to be picked up by a boyfriend, who will go with me somewhere, where we'll be wearing VKian costumes. I've got on this rather nice outfit and I'm really looking forward to seeing him in his - he's good-looking, and I'm really fond of him. I work downtown and the office is in a building, upstairs, and I can't say it's the library, but I've just realized that I've left my keys there, and some other things as well, that I ought to have, and now I can't get back in since I've left my keys. I've gone down a side street - it would be near the library, at least, might be Field - so I turn right, I'm going there anyway and I keep looking out for this boyfriend, he should be along pretty soon. There's a truck of some kind there, maybe a large van, a bus, something like that, the kind of vehicle that you have to sort of climb up into. I'm up in there [I'm not sure why - maybe to wait], looking at something [that's kinda like the dashboard, although I can't say that that's what it is], and I rearrange something on it - I also am wondering if I shouldn't just go in what I've got on - somehow (this outfit) doesn't seem complete to me anymore.
