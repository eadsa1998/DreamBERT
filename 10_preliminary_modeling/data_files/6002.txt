I am reading a ski magazine full of advertisements showing sexy pictures. I find it boring and I flip through the pages quickly. Finally I come across something which I find amusing: a middle section of the magazine which is a parody of itself. This joke section has a false cover page which shows skiers going downhill unsafely in various ways: skiing backwards without looking in the direction of travel, two people sharing the same pair of skis, and a passenger sitting on the shoulders of another skier headed straight towards a tree. The silly humor of this cover is a welcome relief from the slickness of the rest of the magazine.
