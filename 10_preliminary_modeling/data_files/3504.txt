It is dream night. Some new people have come. Derek tells his dream. I'd heard this one before and remind him of a detail he'd left out. Then I begin to tell my dream. Just then, lots of people, all dressed up for a fancy party, come in and now the woman who is new to the dream group is decorating my fancy, ritzy apartment for a party. It's her friend's birthday. I am shocked and upset. She simply takes over and very quickly the place is crawling with strangers and the music is blaring and the decorations are all over. Derek says to me, "I don't know about you, but if it were me, I'd be extremely pissed." I pace back and forth, back and forth, angry, and yet, look at all the trouble they went to. It's so big it would be impossible to get them out and they'd be angry at me. I pace some more. Derek hands me a bottle of drink and I take swigs off it as I pace. I ask what it is because I can't taste it. He says, "It's apple juice." Now I am walking through the rooms, watching, my eyes blazing in anger. I go to my bedroom. Derek sees in my face that I'm about to go ballistic and he loves it. He's grinning from ear to ear and following me around. I go into my bedroom and check to see if any of my jewelry had been taken. Then I find a couple making love in my bed and I start screaming, "Everybody out. The party's over!" I grab women by the hair and drag them to the door. I start ripping down decorations and wires to music speakers. I grab a microphone from the party MC and tell everyone to get out. "This is my apartment and no one asked me permission to have this party and it's over." I am getting them all out as they bitch and complain and get sullen.
