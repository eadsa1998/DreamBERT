I was at my friend's house in her bedroom trying on prom dresses. She was allowing me to borrow her last year's dress. I took it home to show my mom, but we decided it was way too big. Together we took it to a tailor shop to try and see how much I needed to reduce the size. My friend had told me when I was at her house that I could do whatever I wanted to it. When they told me I'd reduce it by 4 sizes, I worried my friend would be mad I was changing it so much. It ended in the tailor shop with me not sure what to do.
