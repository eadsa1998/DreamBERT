At the home of Father Andrew's Daughter Nevena: she is feeding her baby Pabulum and then puts the baby down; Father Andrew gives me a magazine to read, but I am embarrassed. "I can't remember the name of the publication." Father Andrew is reassuring and says: "That happens to me too." Nevena is very friendly and I offer to baby-sit. -- Later at home, on a porch, am anxious because Frank will be gone till late at nite It is raining mixed with SNOW; reading a book to wile away the time till Frank comes home....
