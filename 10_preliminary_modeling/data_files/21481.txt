We looked at the results and a sail horse won the big race. I said why he won the last one. Ann said she played and if there was a 29, she would win. I was working at White's again and Peter A. came in and he had two big bugs in jars. They must have been about 8 or 10 inches long and about 3 inches in diameter. He said he was not feeling good because he worked too many hours. I saw "whence" by itself in the paper at the end of a sentence or it was alone. I wanted to dream if Star Boots was going to win today and someone gave me a $7 bill, which there is no such bill, but Evans had a 7 in one way. I had it on the ticket. A fellow was sitting on a horse. Walter Unger came by, made a pass at the horse and the horse went backwards thru a crowd and no one was trampled on. I saw a man lying on the street like dead and two fellows were standing near him. Then I looked again and the man that was stretched out on the street was standing up.
