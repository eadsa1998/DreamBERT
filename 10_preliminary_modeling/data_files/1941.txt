I am talking to him (the same guy) on the phone. I am constantly interrupted by the antics of his 2-year-old boy who I am apparently babysitting. The boy runs and jumps from a high place. I yell, "Be careful," and get up to pick him up. He's flat and I peel him off the floor like a gooey plastic toy and then he's back to his original self. "Are you hurt?" I ask concerned. He smiles, and takes off playing again. I return to the phone, only now it's a girls voice and I ask who this is, hoping it's not his wife. It is his daughter and I think of what I'll say so I'll appear to just be a friend. Then the boy has a platter he's carrying with a wine glass, tall and slim, on it. "Be careful!" I call out. It slips off and hits the floor. I run to see if it's broken. It has a piece chipped out of it. I feel sad. The shape is changed. It's like a blue flower petal design. I go back to the phone. He's on the line. I say, "It was the glass we got at the Expo, in Seattle."
