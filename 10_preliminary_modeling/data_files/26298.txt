 I am pregnant, very pregnant. I am with my housemate Jack Thigpen. We're going to a party. I will need to go somewhere away from the party to have the baby. We meet two women who are virgins. Jack has just lost his virginity. Something involving work happens with my old coworker Lauren, from Fishing Haven, and her family.
