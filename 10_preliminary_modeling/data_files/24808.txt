My friends and I went to this cabin every summer on a train, but the train was bombed so we couldn't get home. We had to repair this old train to get us home. We had a big fight about what color to make it and two of my friends left us. We later found them dead because they had starved in the snow. Setting: At a cabin in the woods. Characters: Five of my friends, two boys and three girls, and me. One of them I haven't seen in two years. Not all of them were even my very good friends. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared, worried. I was scared and worried we wouldn't get home, and sad when we found both of the girls dead because of an argument.
