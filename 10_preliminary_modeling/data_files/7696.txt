I was at a sleep medicine conference. I saw Alan Alda there. He kissed a friend of mine. I told him he had to kiss me too. I put my hands on his cheeks and gave him a quick kiss. He didn't seem very pleased. There was some problem with taking the booth down. I was working at a boot but I don't know why. I went to the booth and it was gone, a box of my stuff was sitting on the floor. Two women that I worked for took another female coworker and me to another room to train us on closing out the paperwork and money. I did the paperwork while the other woman counted the money. I had completed some of the papers earlier but had done them partially wrong. I saw that they had used a black marker and crossed out the info that was wrong. It was personal information, like maiden name and such I think. I had to recount the money to verify from the first woman. I had trouble doing that because she had put loose change and bills in with other money so I couldn't count it, but I didn't say anything. She had rolled the other coins but put them in the wrong wrappers so I wasn't sure what I was counting there either. I still didn't say anything.
