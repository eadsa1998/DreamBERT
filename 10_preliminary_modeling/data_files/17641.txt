A return to the old days. We were in the Volvo, but I was in the back seat- my mother was supposed to be driving. The whole family was there. My dad and brother Stuart were in the car, as usual, waiting for my mother to stop talking and get in so we could leave. This time we had another task for her. The whole car was covered with spiders. Some were the typical one-inch or so. Others were bigger; huge, like 3 feet across. She went around the car stabbing them. The big ones thumped off the car spurting krill-colored blood all over the place.
