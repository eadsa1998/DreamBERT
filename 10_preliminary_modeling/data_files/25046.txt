 I'm going on a trip with my dad and my siblings. We're going to a pie shoppe in a small town in west central Montana. We get there, and there is a weight room in the rear of this shoppe. I want to do the bench press. I ask a girl if I can join her doing the bench press because no benches are free. She reluctantly says okay. I put on a 45-pound plate on each side. There already is a 5 and 2.5 pound weight on each side. The plates have lavender writing on them. I bench press this weight twice, stopping to rest my arms both times. It's hard to lift. It shouldn't be hard; I can lift this weight 15 or 20 times. My basketball teammate Shawn Salzburg is there and I ask him if he's going to lift hard. There is a guy there who lifts hard and has big muscles but doesn't say much. I like, and respect him.
