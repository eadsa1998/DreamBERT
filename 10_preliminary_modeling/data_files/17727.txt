I was on some sort of field trip.  There were small cabins, arranged in a tiny village.  I stayed back in the area while the others went on a hike.  I was collecting fruit from the trees.  I ended up distrustful of something, and went to stay with my old dorm mate Sally in a tree.  I had her head in my lap.
