As I first remember the dream, I was upstairs in a room with my sister-in-law who is a nurse. I was mixing some blue chemicals. We were talking happily. Next I was out in another room with my girlfriend from school. A teacher whom I can't recall was lining all the girls (many of whom I recognized and spoke with) in a straight line to have their tonsils out. I stood in the line at first and then finally remembering that I had had my tonsils out, I left with my girlfriend. We went downstairs and there in a little room off to one side was a group of fellows singing and laughing. We stopped and talked to a few and then we left.
