I had found a television set somewhere in my home. The chief concern of the dream was the television set. It was different from any set I have seen, in that it worked with a switch on the end of a cord, and the screen part was in a separate unit, detachable from the rest of the set. I remember being quite surprised at finding it. I played with the set for a few minutes and then walked away from it, whereupon I awoke.
