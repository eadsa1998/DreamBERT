We are all at a Retreat Center gathering. I give birth to a perfectly formed BABY GIRL with blond hair, she lies curled on my left side. She is content and does not cry, even when she falls off the low bed and waits to be nursed. I gave birth quite painlessly. I need to check with Dr. Williamson that everything is OK.
