I finally went back to the radio station and was working with Dick Jorgenson, and I had brought my mini disc recorder and all my mini discs. I just threw them in my purse because I didn't have the lunch bag thing that they gave me any more. And I was going to sit down at the gorge (?) and edit some stuff I had recorded with him, and so, and also Mom was going to make this soup, and I told her rather than make it before we go and have to wait, why doesn't she take the stuff over and make it in the little kitchen there and make enough for everybody. So she did. She took the ramen noodles and she took some other vegetables and things, and we went to the radio station and I was there with Dick, and I don't really remember doing too much editing. But I do remember her making the soup and stuff.
