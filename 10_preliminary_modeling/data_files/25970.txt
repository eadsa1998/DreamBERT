 I'm going to a cafeteria with my friend Kevin Simpson after lifting weights. I hope they have chicken. I hear that they are serving fish cheese. We get there. There is a deli-like place where I can get a turkey sandwich, which I want to do. They woman there has people fill out a form, like a menu. I have to get back in line though I was there before some of the other people in line. It takes a long time! I sit on an area covered with small rocks. I woman sits, waiting, next to me. The woman at the food bar has a Nin_ car. I tell the woman we're not waiting! I'm mad that its taken so long. I grab two pink sheets and look at them to fill them out. I say if she really wants us to fill them out we will. There are boxes with letters next to them. One needs to check the boxes. A woman there falls over, like she is fainting. I immediately go over to her. I yell for someone to call 911! I talk to her. She can breathe. She can hear me. She has a cramp-like symptom. She is the sister of a woman I met at a party last night named Kirsten Peters. I yell for an ambulance. It seems that she will be okay. I'm outside Mason Cafeteria at Brimson, but where I helped the woman looks like I'm outside Carter School. The table where the deli woman was is gone. It was down by the "Bowling" sign near Billie's Daycare. I hope I can get back in since I've been outside with the woman.
