I was in a building (probably a House of Representatives office building), and a Negro woman came out into the hall and gave me a slip of paper with the names of some people I was supposed to see.  Some of them were well-known people, but I don't remember now who they were.  I asked her what it was all about, but she didn't know.  While wandering around, I came upon a meeting in progress.  It was being conducted by Neil Findley and a brother who looked just like him except that he had red hair.  Phil Darter and some other warrant officer from the agency were in the audience.  The meeting was on some political subject.  At one point, I voiced my opinion on some issue, and my voice sounded strange to me -- rather high-pitched.  I expected Darter and some of the others I knew to turn around and see me and be surprised by my beard, but they didn't.  After the meeting I went up to Neil and asked him if he remembered me.  At first he didn't, but then he did-but he didn't seem excited at all about seeing me.  I also spoke to his wife.  I called her Carol, or Carolyn, and she responded, even though I wasn't at all sure that was her real name. (It isn't.)
