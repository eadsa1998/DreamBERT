I guess I went on a date with John Leguizamo.  We went to a movie with animals.  Then he took me to a hotel room and showed me how to pull away a panel in the shower to get a hidden bag, part of a thieving scheme he was running.  Later on I ended up going back there.  I snuck in and grabbed the new bag.  He and his cronies were coming to get it though, so I had to fit myself through the hole into the bathroom next door.  There was a honeymooning couple in the bath.  I did my best to sneak out unnoticed, and I guess I made it.  Somehow my mother found me.  We went back to the car where my brother Stuart and my father were waiting and drove.  We followed some freeway named after a girl, with 5 confusing lanes.  We stopped at a part and picked up a newspaper with a map.  We were in a nearby town, but it was at the very northern tip of the state, not geographically accurate. We were trying to find the nearest police station to get rid of the sack of wallets and clear our own name.
