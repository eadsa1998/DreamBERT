My friend Chloe lives near by and takes care of young Reynaldo to play with her kids; when I return I show her 8 small records I want to lend her, but she says that it would take too long. At CHURCH: sitting with Frank on wooden benches and holding Reynaldo as a baby on my lap. He stands up and looks back to where there is another toddler, so he is happy.
