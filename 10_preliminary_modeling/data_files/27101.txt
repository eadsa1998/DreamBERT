Our dormitory (M--- H---) was having an exchange dinner with D--- fraternity. The procedure was not usual, for the boys came over separately instead of in a group. Also, it was a very crude affair for the boy and his date were not properly introduced. Furthermore, our housemother (age 50?) did not wait for all the guests to arrive but went on into the dining room with three girls and began eating.
