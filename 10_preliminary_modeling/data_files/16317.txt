First of all the clock on my alarm radio was totally whacking out. It was like light and there was like no numbers in it. And then I go to hear the time on the parrot thing, and I go to the clock and I double-click the side key and it gives me this commercial. And I'm like, "What!!?" And so I open the door and I go over to the next thing, which gives me another one. [laugh]
