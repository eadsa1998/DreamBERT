I dreamt of being in my boyfriend Jeremy's parent's bedroom.  We left and went to talk to my boyfriend's brother Jeff.  There was something to do with an action figure and visiting someone in a hospital, getting in right before they closed.  After leaving things seemed to change.  Something to do with the action figure, and we were going to hold up a bank.  It was like a western, and I don't know who was with me.  We got the money and a few rings, one of which was 'the' ring (LOTR).  We went on to rob another.  My high school friend Leon was there.  We walked past tourist sites.  A museum, an old Parisian movie theatre.  We went to rob one more 'bank' although it was more of a general store.  We thought it would be an easy hit because there were only women there.  We were wrong.  I ducked in the crick of the glass counters.  I had my gun and I was practically straight below the tough woman behind the counter.  I fired a couple times, but somehow it didn't faze her.  I was out of bullets, so a person tossed me another gun.  This happened maybe 4 times, but there was not a scratch on the lady behind the counter.  I kept trying to pull my right leg up to protect it, but it didn't work.  I got hit, my right shoulder.  Bloody, but I didn't feel it.  Again, and then the pain sunk in.  Eventually we rode away on a trailer.  In a building, I looked through the bars to see little statues of my 'parents'.  They were dolls.  I went back through my boyfriend Jeremy's house (which of course wasn't) and met with the mother.  I was going to put cortisone cream on all my wounds- my waist, my left ankle, my right shoulder, many other places on my legs.  They weren't bleeding very profusely, however.
