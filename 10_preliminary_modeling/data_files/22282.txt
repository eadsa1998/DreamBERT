I dreamed that I invited a 25-year-old girl I know to dance. I deal with her often for work reasons, at the place where I work. We were in a far-away place which was completely clean and cloudy, though the clouds were only above us. I took her hand and led her with rhythmical jumps. I couldn't see her face clearly, but I could see part of her body. This scene lasted only for an instant. Afterwards I don't remember. The only thing I remember is that we were doing it with joy, at least I was, and then I felt that the same was true for her.
