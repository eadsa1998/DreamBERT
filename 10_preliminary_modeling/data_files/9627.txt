Cardinal wearing red robes: I meet him on the stairs: I am walking up the stairs and he is coming down. - Wide, elegant stairway. The Cardinal is reciting a prayer on each step: actually he is saying the name of a saint &amp; a composer. As we meet he touches my two fingers lightly and I curtsy and introduce myself. "I AM EMMA" - He says: "Why haven't I heard from you before?"
