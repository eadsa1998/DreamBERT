A rather complex dream of which only the following can be remembered -- scene appears to be in an army camp. My duty is to repeat, in a loud voice, the range-finding figures (elevation, windage, etc.) which are announced by another soldier. This soldier is also instructing me in "taking down" the breech of the gun. There is a pin to be pressed and this releases another pin and 2 screws which fall into a small, square tin box -- the gun breech apparently being partially enclosed by this box. When the screws drop out I am to see whether my fingers are small enough to go between the gun and side of box and reach down for the screws. Experimenting shows that I can pick up the screws between 3rd and 4th fingers (i.e., the 2 longest fingers) but can't turn my hand sufficiently to make use of my thumb. However, the soldier seems to feel that I will do as far as picking up the screws go.
