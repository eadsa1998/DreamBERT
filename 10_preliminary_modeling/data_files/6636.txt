J. asks "Will you bunk with me?" I am startled and he explains that he has bought a house up Nuanuu. But I say it's too far from the University. He says "It's only 4 blocks from here." We drive over in his car. He shows me through two connecting rooms with a red and green carpet on the floor. There is a bookcase with a few books. Then we go upstairs. There are rooms on both sides of the hall. M. is living with him. They show me the room I can have. It has a very poor floor. I remember M. is married and has two children.
