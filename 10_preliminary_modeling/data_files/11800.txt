I was at this shop with some people. Zombies (Dawn of the Dead remake like) were coming. We got in a car and drove off. We went to some girl's house. I went to the toilet and it wouldn't flush, then a dead rat flew out and it was really freaky. I ended up on a boat where zombies couldn't get us (it was dark and stormy looking). There was a little house nearby. I went there and there was a big, fancy girl room. I went into the closet where there were lots of dresses and Goosebumps books. Zombies were coming so I went back to the boat. A kettle was being evil. Zombies broke in but then they turned normal because they liked us.
