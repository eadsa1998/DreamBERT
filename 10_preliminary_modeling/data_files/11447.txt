The scene took place in a station. My mother was leaving with another acquaintance of mine on the train. I remember my mother remarking that the acquaintance was going to have a baby. As I heard the remark it caused me a great deal of anxiety since I felt the remark was a little too tactless. The dream ended before anyone got on the train and therefore consisted only of conversation on the station platform. I remember bits of the conversation such as my mother's saying, how much she was looking forward to getting where she was going.
