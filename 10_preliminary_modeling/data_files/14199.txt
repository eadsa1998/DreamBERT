Calvin and I were in a car and then were walking down a street. There was a big woman with blonde hair in a clothes shop -- she was Nordic looking and reminded me of Elijah. I told Calvin about her. We went to the end of the street and then we were going back and we saw a car put its brakes on. The driver guy hit his head on the wheel and then drove off. As we walked away, Classmate-M-03 fell to the ground as he'd been hit. I said to Calvin "Classmate-M-03's been hit", but he refused to look around. We got back to the shop and realized we'd left the car and I said I didn't want to walk all the way back. Calvin said he would. I saw Alejandro walking the way we wanted to go, so I went with him. We got to a school. We were outside the gym. I took my pants off, because it was hot, but then realized I had no shorts. We went in through the gym, into the room next to it. A teacher lady kept walking in and out and the other students there helped us stay out of sight.
