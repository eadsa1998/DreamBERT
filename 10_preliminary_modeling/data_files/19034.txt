In the beginning of the dream I was eating a doughnut on an airplane. I was captain and it was either a DC 6 or a 4-engine plane or DC 3, which is a two-engine. The stewardess had just finished coming around with doughnuts. She was making the rounds to the different men on the plane. There was a  total of about four men on the plane. The plane was on the ground and it wasn't up in the air. It was just sitting. And I had a captain's uniform on; however, the front was not buttoned and I was sitting in the pilot's seat which is on the right hand side as you stand facing the airplane.
