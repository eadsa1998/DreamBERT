The dream begins as I am standing at a window watching a beautiful sunrise. The sky seems to be filled with all colors--red and gold especially against an azure blue sky. I realize that I am in the desert and am in the W-- B--. The next moment I am on the Navy bus going to work. I see the brown hills, the clean white desert, and at a far, snow-covered mountains. My inner feeling is one of great happiness -- I feel completely free and independent.
