I was watching Californication. Hank and Mia were talking and Mia said "you enjoyed sleeping with me". They were at Hank's house, but then he was Milo Ventimiglia and no-one else was there. The house was completely different. Inside the house, this kid was carrying things with leaves because he was being controlled. In real life, Tigger was being controlled.
