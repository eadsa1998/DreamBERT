I was watching Quantum Leap. It was Sliders-ish. I was in Scott Bakula's world and he decided he wanted to check ours' out. We ended up in a shop at the top of an escalator, which had those little things you walk through, with the metal and it clicks. He said "there are kids working!". Then we were in a forest and were trying to do this thing to get back to his world. There was a symbol on the ground and we put water on it. His hands were on mine and he said he didn't think it was going to work, but then we realized the symbol was gone and we were in his world. Then it was like The A-Team. Dirk Benedict was standing next to a wire fence and I snuck up and grabbed his shoulder. I was thinking that maybe I should I go to Comic-Con. Then creatures and people that Scott Bakula had come across in his travels were there (as in, ones he had killed or stopped). They started attacking us and then it was a quest on Runescape. I was about to fight the boss monster which was a dragon, but I got scared and teleported away. As I ran through the forest, things attacked me. I didn't know where the closest bank was.
