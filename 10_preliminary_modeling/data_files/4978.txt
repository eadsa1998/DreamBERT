A man, a friend is doing laundry. Some electrical problem starts. He goes to the circuit breaker. As he touches it, he gets zapped. We pull him off. Now we need to get him to a doctor, but someone brings to our attention that he needs to have a check-up and update his insurance or they won't pay! We carry him there to get it worked out. [BL]
