My husband is taking me to a football game here at the university and he had brought his car. And I had brought my bus and we had parked in this private parking lot that was for the faculty near the stadium, which you had to have a key to turn on the parking meter or something. But we parked, then went into the stadium and found seats and sat down, and the seats were not like in an ordinary football stadium. They were seats like in a gym or something. Neither of us was particularly enjoying ourselves and football isn't a game we would particularly go to see in the first place. I don't quite understand why we had gone to this particular game. We sat there and talked for a while. The game never did start.
