I'm taking my car to Belmont Garage to get worked on, early early in the morning, and there's a new guy behind the counter who looks and sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger. He's got on your basic mechanics' blue shirt and pants, and really doesn't look like him in the face, but everything else about him is a dead ringer - voice, accent, size, muscles, it's quite weird. We talk about the car, and he walks me outside to look at it, and I'm going to go on down the street to have breakfast. While he talks to me, I get very attracted to him, and he's being a little more than polite himself. In fact, he offers to walk along with me, and that's just fine. I'm still marvelling at how I could swear I'm with Arnold, except his face just looks different for the moment - or maybe this is how he "really" looks. Golly. So we walk along, and he even holds my hand, he's getting very attentive, this is swell. We get to the cafe, and I'm meeting some friends, who are around a table already - we'll have to squeeze in with extra chairs. There's some shuffling, me getting 2 chairs, somebody else getting one, taking back, putting in, then we get settled. This is a cute little place, close, chintzed-up, white with blue flowers, captain's chairs, early American, da da. We chat for a bit, and then I get up to do something at the next table, which is empty. [It has something to do with sorting keys or something, that relates to work, but I'm not getting it now - me and somebody else have these things out on the table, when these 2 ladies come along to sit there, and I apologize, clearing them off right away.]
