There was a crisis and EMS workers were called. I was sitting in the way because ??? waiting around (ring?) being told I could not practice the piano during this emergency crisis. EMS knew I'd cause trouble if I could not do stuff (art, piano) so an EMS guy locked me in the bathroom. There were very high walls but no ceilings. He threw 3 bags of dope in there to me and said, "That'll keep you busy for awhile." I thought about it for a while and decided not to do it. I looked close and some had spilled out of one bag onto the counter. I thought it might be a set up or at least a placebo to see what I'd do so I tasted it. It was real. I didn't have works or a spoon, so I had to just sniff and I just did 1/2 of one bag and I didn't feel it much except time did go faster/slower at times. It slowed me down and ??? trouble ??? play ??? of the locker room ??? I immediately went to the bear section at the zoo and picked up a black bear cub. Somebody said, "That mother Bear don't want her cub messing with no dope addicts." I held the black bear cub up and he held onto me around my shoulders and neck. He held onto my arms. He was all wiggly and happy. I saw Johnny Gage and I thanked him for the birthday autograph he'd given Rudy 2 years ago. Carlos was staying at Rudy's. His landlord evicted him because he was messy. But it was not that bad. It wasn't. I did not think it was the cops' business whether or not you make your bed or cleaned up.
