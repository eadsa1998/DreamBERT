I am a teenager but it seems to be before the time when I actually was a teen. I am in an area like a worship grounds. It has a circle of flat stones set around in the woods like small altars. I am with a boy (whom I never actually met until after I was married and had several children.) But in the dream we are dating and I am debating whether to have sex with him. It is not a sexual dream, however. I am just debating the question. At a point I decide to do this as payment for something but then change my mind. We are then talking about marriage and someone mentions this is inconsiderate because his mother would have to travel over 100 miles. The setting is in northern New Mexico. I know this because someone says so, but it is not a place I have ever been in reality. The rocks look more like tree stumps.
