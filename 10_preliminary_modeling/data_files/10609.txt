It is Spring Break and everyone goes to a hotel right by my old house. We stay at my house. It has six swimming pools. Each one is a different shade of blue. One of them has turtles, fish, and other animals in it that I try catching. I'm having fun. Then I have this waterslide. My friend John goes down the slide with me and I tell someone I like this boy Kevin. But then I like John. Then Kevin thinks I like him. I realize I could never like Kevin and I don't want him to think I like him! My best friends were there. We were going to videotape the house before I moved. I don't want to move.
