I was at an amusement park. I was talking to some ladies about ages and Elijah was there too. They were talking about the year he was born. There was a waterslide, which was all screwy and Elijah and some others were on it. I slipped into the water and fell down and I got in trouble. I was trying to tell Dad later but we kept getting confused. I tried to draw a diagram? One of the ladies was talking about flowers and a fairy which had something to do with birthdays. She was born the day before something that brought bad luck. Her birthday was June 7th.
