I dreamt I was on my way home from visiting when I saw our house was on fire. I saw fire engines all around and people everywhere. The firemen told me everyone was safe except they couldn't get my dog. I ran into the burning house calling for Terry. I spotted him on the floor and picked him up. When I looked at my arms, they were black and pain shooting up and down. I got Terry outside and threw myself on the ground, putting out the flames on my clothing. I kept holding my arms, screaming because I couldn't stand the pain. I woke myself up and found myself with a tight grip on my left arm.
