There was a heavy windstorm and rain. I watched the rain come down from the gutters. Then another windstorm came. I watched it blow smoke by big smokestacks and it blew by big trees. They were bending from the wind force. I was going to run for cover, but I was afraid to run by the trees in fear one would topple on me. All at once the storm stopped and there were two trees near the smokestacks. They broke about halfway down as they sprung back when the wind stopped. We were visiting Jack Kearney's. We climbed up and thru a hole between two buildings. Jack gave me a gun to hunt and it was a single barrel, but he said it was a repeater. It was an old gun.
