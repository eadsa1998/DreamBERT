Herb, a friend of mine, had borrowed my car in order to transport some movie equipment. As he drove the car off, he misjudged the height of a low steel bridge; the car struck the lower part of the bridge, damaging the top of my car quite severely. Angered, I pushed my way into the car and demanded that Herb let me drive. We got underway, but the car behaved in a crazy fashion. It weaved all over the road. The brakes would not work, and there was no pick-up. Driving into the parking lot at home, I noticed several cars parked in front of my garage, so I was unable to park my car (which further irritated me). My sister then approached, glanced at the damage to my car, and began to insist loudly that our parents would not help to pay for the repairs. Angrily, I told her that I didn't expect anybody to help me with the repairs -- that I would pay for them myself.
