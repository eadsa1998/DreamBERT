It was in the olden days (like before cars). Ezra, Dad, Michael Cera and I were there. We were in this desert with a bunch of other people. Michael Cera and I planned to do a fake robbery and then run off. We both smoked and we had to separate, so I took some of his smokes. Then I was at Nana's and it was no longer olden days. Michael was supposed to have made it back before me. I went inside and Ezra was on the lounge. I asked if Dad or Michael had explained why we had stolen the stuff. I said to Ezra that I hadn't seen Michael for "like four days!" and Ezra said "long time, huh?".
