At breakfast. I want more toast but the landlady isn't toasting enough. Bits of bread are not even browned. We look in locker and discover a frozen woman seated inside. Shut door quickly. Who will call the police. Betty and her two daughters and I prepare for outing. I help the younger one get dressed. While still in petticoat call to J. to hurry. Betty is ready and I see she has on a blue figured short sleeved organdy.
