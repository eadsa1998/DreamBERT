I dreamed that I was moving into my dorm room again, but I had never moved out of my old room. I had to go clear all my stuff out of my room so that a new freshman could move in. But I fell asleep while packing. Then I dreamed I was at a hockey game, playing in it, and instead of having pads and a uniform, I was only wearing a white bath towel. I was really afraid it was going to slip off while I was skating.
