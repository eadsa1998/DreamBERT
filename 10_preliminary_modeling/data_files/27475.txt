My dream was an exact reproduction of the morning I spent at work that day. I had been helping with the electric shock treatments for the first time. My duty was to hold the patients down during their convulsions immediately after the shock was administered. The doctors and nurses I worked with were in the dream. The patients' faces were not too clear. The dream was very real in that it seemed I could actually feel the waves of muscular contractions of the patients as I leaned on them. The preparations were very clear. I saw the nurse applying the electrode jelly, put on the rubber head-band and insert the mouth gag. I remember feeling very upset and I also felt sympathetic towards the patients.
