["Man helper guides me to health."] I am working creatively with a good-looking nice guy like Davey We are in a large living room and are happily collaborating. Our writings are up on a board. Later, my family comes to visit. My Grandma Anne comes in. I am surprised, because she's been dead for along time. Davey happily goes to embrace her and she cowers from the hug. I apologize explaining she's afraid. Davey backs off so she won't be offended. Later, Davey is doing Tai Chi. He asks me if I know what it is. I proudly say "Yes, I know, its Tai Chi. He smiles, hoping I will take it up as it is heathful for me. He is also showing me a better diet (maybe veggie) to eat for my health. I am glad he is helping me to be more healthy. I feel happy and loved.
