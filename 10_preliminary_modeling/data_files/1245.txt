Co-worker Tyler and I are cuddly. He starts kissing me. I feel hesitant. I remind him about his wife. He says, "It's O.K. No problem." I enjoy kissing him. Then Jim C. joins us, on my right side. I am surprised. He wants to kiss too. I feel hesitant again, because of Tyler. Then I just sense that it's O.K. I remember feeling how Jim C's beard tickles. After awhile, we decide to go so somewhere. We have to hop on a boat to get there. I leap, chair and all, over the water to the boat. I turn and look. They have hesitated and will have to wait for the next boat. I'm a little annoyed at them.
