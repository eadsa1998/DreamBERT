Gwen and I are going on a hiking trip. The day is beautiful, the sun is shining and we're both quite happy. Suddenly, the hiking becomes rock climbing (the grassy hills have transformed into clay-red, jagged, rocky boulders). Gwen is unaware of the transformation of our surroundings. I, on the other hand, am acutely aware that my sense of stability and gravity are off. Gwen begins to descend; I'm irritated by this because I am now holding on for dear life and she's calling out to me, which is a major distraction. Cautiously looking downward, I see Gwen sliding down a water slide made of the same red clay, but very smooth. She's sliding down and yelling happily, for me to come join her. I want to; she looks like she's having so much fun, but the rocky edge I am clinging to has created a chasm between us. I'm so scared and afraid. I wish someone would make the jump with me. Suddenly an old man is standing beside me on the edge of the cliff, beckoning me to join him to jump. He jumps down to Gwen. The slide slopes into a pool where there are lots of other people laughing and splashing. Gwen is in the pool and calls for me to come down, but she cannot see how high up I am from her. Suddenly a new hot, clay-red boulder begins to emerge from the earth. It is huge and is shaking the foundation I am desperately trying to cling to. It erupts slowly taking my boulder higher. I can barely make Gwen out. I still hear her though, she sounds like a screeching mouse: "Kerry, Kerry, come down." I give up trying to jump or descend. I feel a lump in my throat, I want to cry. No tears come.
