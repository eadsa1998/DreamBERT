Derek is with someone else or is ignoring me. I am sitting next to his brother and decide to hell with Derek, I will chase after his brother. We hug and flirt. Derek is jealous and moves between us. Now I'm having dinner with Derek and then a helicopter comes and picks me up in the middle of the dinner.
