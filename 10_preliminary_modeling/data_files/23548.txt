I was walking down Y Street in the city where my university is located, going to Peter's house. I had keys to his apartment. I walked up to the door and opened the door. When I walked inside, I saw someone was in the bathroom by the light and shower running. I suddenly realized it wouldn't be him because he didn't live there anymore. I remembered this, was embarrassed and ran out. As I left the area, I saw a couple in the top part of the house watching me through the window. I was scared.
