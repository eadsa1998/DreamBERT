There were rumors about a girl named Irina having killed herself to spite her parents.  I don't remember how, but it was bloody.  Her last name started with an S and had "olga" somewhere in it, but I kept having trouble remembering what it was.  My mother and I were talking about it, I guess, with someone.  Irina came in and my mother started talking to her, asking questions and wording things in ways that wouldn't put Irina in a good light.  She obviously didn't know that that was Irina.  I was embarrassed but Irina answered her questions flatly without much affect.
