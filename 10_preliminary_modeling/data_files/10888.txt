I was in the Hebrew school where I work. I evidently had come for an afternoon class on a Sunday afternoon. Another student (girl and my friend 20 years old) was there, but came in after I did. There was also a reception for our principal (who is leaving for Israel, 50 years old). I waited for my teacher, but he didn't come. The principal (female) came, but didn't go into the auditorium where the reception was. I then saw myself standing on a little side porch with my friend (the other student) and the principal. We saw a girl in a white dress coming down the street towards us. It was a girl I know, but to my knowledge doesn't know Hebrew. Anyways, the principal remarked how hard the girl promised to work in class. I seemed anxious and worried because it was after 9 p.m. and the program hadn't started yet.
