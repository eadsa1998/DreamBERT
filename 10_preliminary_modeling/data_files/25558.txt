 I'm on a train in a city that may be New York. I have two cups of coffee. I am then in Australia riding on a bus, and then a train from a beach back to a hotel, where I can eat. I have an artificial green apple and an artificial pink fish. I see a man in a San Francisco Giants baseball uniform. The Giants are playing the Minnesota Twins. The man is wearing my friend Norman Noman's jersey. He is holding up a big sign trying to get people to be loud. I play my radio very loud. I'm in back of a group of people. My friend Holly Lapson is in front of the group. She turns and looks at me when I turn the volume of the music up. I shake the man's hand as he walks by. My classmate Dolly Storms and others give him candy. He is not supposed to get any candy. They keep giving him candy, and he won't go away. The group tour guide woman tells us to stop feeding him, but people keep feeding him. I grab the man, who then has one arm. I push him away, overpowering him, and punch him. He comes back to the group. I go to punch him again. My friends Jill Banks and Yvette Ullman try to stop me. I easily push Jill out of the way. I go to punch the man in the stomach, and Yvette tries to stop me. I talk to Jill about how I was trying to protect my own child, if I had one. I say that my wife was pregnant and nine months ago was beaten. My son Mike was born mentally retarded. Later, I call Mike Kenneth.
