Mary Shortte was in this dream.  I was trying to help her out of a high place like a tree house or barn loft.  I was on a ladder, but couldn't quite reach that high and had to ask her to drop into my arms and trust me to catch her.  My wife Anita was down below expressing her concern, shall we say.  Later I was trying to get into this high place myself; it was difficult and caused me some anxiety.  It was a long way to try to throw my leg up onto the ledge and try to pull myself up.
