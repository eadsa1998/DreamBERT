I was a student in a class. It was the first of a series of classes. Diane S and Paulette W were both in the class. There were two female instructors. I was talking with one of them. I told her that Diane S, Paulette W, and I have been in school together for 22 years. For one part of the class, there were three different topics that we had to do a presentation on for the class. Two of the topics I was extremely comfortable with, but the third I wasn't comfortable with at all. It was very foreign to me. I had asked the one instructor if we could split them up or if we had to do all three topics at once. I explained to her that if we could split them up I would be very comfortable doing either of the first two topics at any time and even going first if she would like. The other one, however, I would really need to do some work on so I was not comfortable being the first presenter if I had to include it at that time. However, they scheduled me to be the first presenter and I still had to present all three topics because they couldn't be split up. I was meeting with the one instructor individually to help me understand exactly what needed to be covered in each of these presentations. We also talked some about my background. She, too, was very comfortable with me being ready to present the first two topics because of my background and experience. For the third topic, she was trying to help me understand it well enough so I could do a good job on that presentation.
