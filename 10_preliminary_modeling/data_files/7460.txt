I am walking with Mary, who is wearing a white dress. She looks terrific -- as she had prior to the last recurrence of the disease. She has been resurrected for a particular purpose that is not made clear in this dream. I comment on how terrific she looks, even though she had been in the grave only a short while ago. There was no decay nor any indication that she had been dead. But as I speak, I realize I should not have said anything because she doesn't know she had been dead and is now resurrected. My remarks disturb her greatly. Her mood changes from one of smiling happiness into surprised sorrow. Something in her belly begins to bulge and throb. Now I see (or am aware of) a woman hiding at the side of a road, holding a child in her arms. Someone else is at the side of the road, but in the field, behind the woman. This person is spying on her. This spy believes he had seen a man and a woman "sneaking" down in the grass to make love.
