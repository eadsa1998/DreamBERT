I was at school. Samantha met with me when I got there. She gave me a bit of paper which she had found in my bag. One side proclaimed my love for Dylan Moran, and the other proclaimed my love for Daryl, Eugene, Dmitri and Darius (for some reason). I was really freaked out and I told her not to tell anyone. She was talking to Payton and I was extremely worried. Evelyn was there too.
