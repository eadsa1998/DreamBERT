There was some kind of glass that someone invented. It was to look thru. I had to sign my name to get it. I signed John M. Evans. Chiska also signed. I think I helped to invent it. A tiger chased me up a stairway and into a house. I closed the door and held it. He kept on pushing and pushing, but I held the door. A lady was there. I told her to go get some help. She picked up her baby and left, said she would. Grandpa came up and gave me a gun. I pointed the gun at the tiger and he surrendered, then he turned into a boy. I was in the city. Someone had two barley animals. They looked woolly and were like a tiger. Grandpa had a toy. It was some chemical. It got hot and boiled. A small kid came by and drank it. He started to make faces as though it burned inside. I got him a glass of cold water. He drank it fast and it seemed to fix him up.
