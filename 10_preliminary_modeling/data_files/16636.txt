Last night, I had a dream that we still had three chickens. I had seed, and they were eating it out of my hand, and I was out in the yard. I had something when I was out in the yard with them; I had the feeling that maybe it was a bunch of sound equipment on the picnic table, and I was bringing it in little by little. The part of this dream that I can remember best was that Mom was doing something, I can't remember exactly what she was doing, but I felt like she was packing things up. She seemed to have one foot out the door in terms of leaving Dad. So I went in the bathroom and I whispered to her, "If you're leaving, you'd better take me with you." She said, "I'm not leaving, I'm just thinking of moving. " In my mind, I was thinking, "same difference". She said, "I have to be real careful with my shoes because this wood floor will scratch. And these spoons, if you scoop ice cream with them, they'll bend" - or something silly like that.
