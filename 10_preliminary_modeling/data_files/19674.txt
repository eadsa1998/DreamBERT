Walking along a dirt road and meet a man traveling on a strange tandem-arranged bicycle -- 2 bicycles connected by a tall, metal arched framework. He travels a great deal with this vehicle. At bottom of a long hill I see a wide and rather deep (6 or 8 feet) ditch across the road -- this the result of road repair work. 2 horse-drawn rigs (?buggies) cross the ditch. In each case the horse jumps across the lowest part of ditch, apparently because of a fear of getting mired or otherwise stuck. This jolts up the passenger badly. Then comes a mule drawing some kind of rig. Having more intelligence than the horses, the mule realizes a jump is unnecessary and picks his way skillfully across the rough bottom, and plods up the farther bank. Next, Chester and I are at a sort of basement entrance to a cafeteria (like Justice Dept. cafeteria). The large door way is blocked by a big hand truck piled high with filled gunny sacks. There are 2 or 3 black men standing around and one of them asks me to predict or guess how long we will be delayed by this truck. I say "5 seconds." Some workman now begin rearranging the sacks and in perhaps a minute or two the truck is pushed out of the way. I venture what was intended as a criticism "about 6 seconds" and a black man remarks, in a half derisive tone, "Ain't he smart, though." I feel embarrassed and ashamed at myself for making such puerile remarks, and though Chester says nothing, I sense that he is half contemptuous. We pass on into the cafeteria. The menu, posted on wall, lists Beef, 15 cents; apricots, 15 cents (and I am surprised that the fruit costs as much as the meat); soup, 15 cents, but only 7 1/2 cents if you take it out of building in an attractive jug which is furnished by the cafeteria.
