I dreamed we were in this large building, and we were prisoners of the Germans or something. It was during the war. We had to finish these paintings. We're doing these paintings on these large canvases behind a curtain so that when anyone came in they couldn't see anything except a curtain there. We were prisoners of the Germans, and the paintings were these propaganda type paintings. The curtain was there so that nobody would know that we were there. There was an attack on the building, and there was an explosion. Playing dead in the rubbish. I recognized one of the guys that came in. He was one of my friends. I got up and I was rescued.
