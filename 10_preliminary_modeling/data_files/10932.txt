I dreamt that I was in a large auditorium where a large crowd was seated. Many of the women carried hand-made white cardboard lambs. We were waiting for a famous movie actor to make his appearance. A man came on the stage, and said there was an accident. A girl who danced had to be substituted for the injured actor. My mother and I had to leave early because I had to go to the dentist. When we arrived, we found that the building was being torn down. The dentist was dressed in dirty overalls, but he put on a white doctor's gown over the overalls and began to work on my teeth.
