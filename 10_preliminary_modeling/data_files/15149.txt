I went to a place which I think was university and they had this building where important stuff happened. I was with Dad and Ezra. On the way out, my phone beeped because some machine had screwed it up. They took it. I snuck back in to get it. It still turned on, but it was really slow. I wanted to get the photos off it, but it would take 30 seconds.
