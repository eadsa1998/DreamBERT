Dad gave me a pill that would make me pregnant, just as a practice run. And then I started having really bad cramps and stuff, and then I decided I really don't want this because it's not worth a practice run. And I was supposed to go to the doctor and get this shot to take it away, but instead they gave me a pill and it was a pill, it was like an olive and had been soaked in juice. All the olive juice went down my throat with the water and kind of made my mouth numb. But the olive wouldn't go down. I asked her to cut it in half. She was looking around, she didn't have a knife, so we had to take it home and cut it in half. And in the second part of the dream we were walking with Grammy to -- I don't know -- just around the neighborhood, and we stopped at this church that had a fountain and everything and I wanted to explore while they walked through. Well, I went around the back and I climbed up the back steps and I perched on this little ledge and grabbed onto the window and I could see the sound board and stuff. Everybody was in there, but somehow the pastor said hello to me. He saw me over there. [laugh] And there wasn't much more to it.
