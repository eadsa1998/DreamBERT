In this dream I received a letter from my girl who is a young nurse two years younger than myself. I was reading her letter but could not make out any of her words. I turned to the last page and the words became clear. She had written that she has met another young man who was a young doctor and had fallen in love with him. She said she loved him because he was so sophisticateed and that all the young girls were crazy about him. She realized that this would surprise me, but that she hoped that I would not be hurt and that we could still be friends. I felt very hurt and angry and the more I thought of this the madder I got.
