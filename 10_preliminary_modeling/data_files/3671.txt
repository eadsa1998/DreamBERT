I am at some religious healing revival meeting. Bonnie and Mateo are with me and some other woman. Behind me is an older woman and her husband. She is trying to talk to me and then starts repeating her words, like she's caught in a do-loop where she starts a sentence and can't finish it so she goes back and tries again. The husband cautions us not to interrupt her because that makes it worse. I have seated myself so I am near the aisle so I can wheelchair out if I need to. But as more people arrive, that aisle is filled up. I am given a huge syringe with a long needle. I watch another woman as she stabs herself with it and injects the healing fluid (which looks like water). I try it and make a stab at my leg. It goes through the muscle and out the other side (through the skin, really). The fluid leaks out I try and save it.
