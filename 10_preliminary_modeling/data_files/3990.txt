["Black baby is eaten."]  I enter a room. I see a plump, cute black baby lying there. He is sucking on a pacifier vigorously. He has it all the way in his mouth. I remove it but he wants it, so I find a bigger one, with a shield on it. He sucks on it so hard it slips completely into his mouth. I am worried he will choke. I take it out.  I pick him up and hold him. He smiles. I look in his eye. It has mechanical little squares in it. I am surprised. Is this an alien baby? I put him down. I look around the room. I look back at him and notice he has changed into a snail like creature. Another odd animal is beside him. As I watch in horror, the animal eats the snail. I am sick with horror. I try to grab the animals mouth but it is too late. I wonder how I can possibly tell the baby's mother he was eaten while I was caring for him. I am shocked and worried.
