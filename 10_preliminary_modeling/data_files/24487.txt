I am in Vietnam with the men who composed last night's group. They are talking too loud; I am anxious they will give our position away. We recon a small abandoned villa and examine an old foundation. Next, I am in a hospital corridor, walking with Steve M., a squad leader from my old platoon. He has been shot badly in the thigh. As we walk a doctor points out the injury, which is bandaged and bleeding. Recollection ends here.
