As we entered the church, C. H. asked where I wanted to sit. I indicated a pew two-thirds down at the side. She went inside the three person pew but he hadn't come yet. I went to the door to wait for him. Then I couldn't locate her. I sat on a chair at the side of the pews. Thought maybe he didn't know the way. A woman came to an empty seat in a rear pew and began to talk. Then a bus loaded with children came to the far side of the church. Then the building was empty. We were swimming. I swam to her when the water was clear blue with whitecaps at the side. It was shallow touching rough bottom; at last I walked out by a sidewalk leading to autos.
