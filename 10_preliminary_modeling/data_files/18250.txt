The dream had something to do with the electrical power and how in emergencies there would be emergency sources of power. And I believe that this was in the whole U.S. that someone was demonstrating this on a map and showing how much emergency power would be available if all the regular sources were. It was an awful lot. It was almost as much as the original amount. Then from being something very impersonal, it switched to being something I was very involved in, in which from someplace a huge flood was coming and everybody in the world, I guess, was going to be affected by it. We were making plans as to what to do and somebody who I presume was a Civil Defense officer, was in our house and saying how many people he was going to have to put in it. We were in our bedroom, which is quite small, and he was saying so many people would have to stand on the bed and so many other people would have to stand on their shoulders. So he was lining everybody up and we got a goodly number of people in the room, 30 or 40 people anyway, and the water was rising very fast. Before he had gotten all the people arranged in the room, it was up to right up outside the windows, so it was about 4 or 5 ft. high and it was at night that was happening, or at least there wasn't very much light. The water was real dark with this sort of foam on the top of it in places and it kept rising and rising and then it came into the room. Before very long at all, it was almost to the top of the little window, which was in my dream near the ceiling which was just about big enough to get out of. So when it got to that, we knew we would all have to go out. Then we didn't know exactly when this would happen, but about the time that it got there, we were preparing to go out.
