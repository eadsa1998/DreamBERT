I was in St. Joe with Matthew but at our house - not Mother's house. Matthew and I went for a walk outside. There was alot of snow on the ground. I started off through the woods at one point and Matthew stopped me. He said that was not the path, that if we went that way we would be in danger. I don't know if he said something about bears or if that's just what I thought. As we were walking we saw some children sledding. However, they were sledding down a stream of water. I thought that was a bad idea because I was afraid for their health. I hoped they would go straight home from there and get dry and warm. We saw another woman with children there. Matthew told me that he wanted to go home. Where we were must have been a separate getaway that I owned. He was only the size of about a 12-year-old. However, I asked him if he wanted to go home because he wanted to go up and see Ashley B. He admitted that he did. I was concerned because that would be alot of driving. It's an hour and a half home, then another hour plus to Lafayette and then yet another almost two hours to Ashley B's. I know he has driven that long at once before but I was still concerned. Part of my concern might have been because of the weather and the time of day, or night, that he might be doing the driving.
