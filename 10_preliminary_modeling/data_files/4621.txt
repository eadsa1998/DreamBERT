["Tap dancing with Ellie."] I am living in a small cottage. I am learning tap dancing. I cheerfully challenge Ellie or she joins in as I do a riff. She'd follow my rhythm and we enjoyed doing "dueling tap dance routines." We were doing this on a small narrow cement sidewalk just in front of the small cement steps and porch in front of the house. We were waiting for the arrival of relatives to a reunion we are hosting. Now I envision a narrow cement sidewalk up the middle of the lawn. We tap up and down that. I am making up new steps and rhythms. Heel, toe, flop flop, etc. I see an odd convertible sports car driving up the road and stopping in front of our yard. No one is in it. I am quite surprised. Then another car drives up and at first I think it is Patricia but it is her sister Suzanne in the passenger side. She is using a remote control to drive the cars. I am amazed. She parks the cars a bit crookedly. More relatives visit. I go into the house. One of my Aunts calls me over to a table with many small jigsaw puzzles laid out. She smiles and gently challenges me to try to put them together. My mother had been doing it and just went outside. I shrug and sit, looking at the pieces. They are white background with simple black line drawings of various zoo type animals. I find I can do this.
