I was at home. Dad was working late, till midnight or something. I called his work, but he wasn't there. I felt uncomfortable so I called Mom and asked her to pick me up because I felt nervous. She said 'ok, be there in ten'. I was playing music and I heard a baby crying loudly from in the house. I didn't want to get up, so I didn't. I heard people talking and about ten minutes later, some people went into Dad's room. I went in and there was a guy and two girls at his laptop. I was like "What the hell are you doing?" and I got the baseball bat and I was hitting them, but it didn't seem to do much. They went back to the games room and there were heaps of other people there. There were some twins who looked like Hilda (Ugly Betty) and they called me ugly and I said "Look at yourself!". There was a hole somewhere and a blue block had been put there, but they had pushed it aside and came through. They all went out but I was worried they were going to come back.
