I was with Lynn, we did a lot of things.  Sometimes outside, or in stores, it seemed like we were working with big appliances, washers or refrigerators.  Then we were four-wheeling in Dad's van.  It was hard to four-wheel the van, and it was the rockiest four-wheeling I've ever done.  Sand and big drop-offs, steep hills.  We came to a big drop-off.  I could see over it and eased the van, and it was going straight down.  I could look straight down to the path below.  The van went down rocky and hard, but made it.  I looked up the road, it went uphill, like we were going through a gulley or ravine, and Lynn was somehow already out of the van and walking up ahead of me.  I was surprised he was up there already.  Felt like - he is always one step ahead of me.
