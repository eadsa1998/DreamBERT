Another dream about being in a town where trains kept coming through. Then there was a series of boxcar-like buildings that became perhaps a train. A woman's league had one of these and used it in some way to help children. I went inside. There was nothing but the side opening, a door at one end, and a small trap door overhead. Children were going through this, but I knew I wouldn't fit, so I didn't even try, though I saw some literature on what a fine view there was from the top. Instead, I went through the door at the side, and began traveling through a series of boxcars in this manner, finding I was proceeding at a fast rate contrasting with another time in which I had gone through this part of town in the streets and had had a long time to do it. I came to more open country as I approached the end of the train, which now became a sort of barge on the bay or a large river. All sorts of heavy freight was spread out on the decks. I needed to get off, and saw a very shaky series of logs and planks which other people were going over to reach shore. I was afraid to try, but someone assured me it was easy, so I went over, and didn't really have any trouble. I got to the last log, an enormous thing, and sat down to talk to the old man who seemed to be posted there as a sort of guardian. I had forgotten, I think, why I wanted to reach shore, and didn't want to get off until I remembered.
