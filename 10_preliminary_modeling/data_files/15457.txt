There was a sickness going around. A guy said he thought it was spread through children. A young black girl sat next to me at dinner so I moved and ate somewhere else. Years later, it turned out that it had been spread from kids. A brother and sister who had been kids then were now teens/adults. This guy had worked for their parents and they were rich and he was now infected. His face was splotchy. The sister was talking to him and kissed him and then there were splotches on her ears. They had been secretly dating since she was 17/18 years old.
