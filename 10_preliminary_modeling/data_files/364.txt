I'm assisting at a "race" event in which Tree is running. There's a man - a trainer, I guess, who's in charge, and he's giving me instructions to do a "bleeding" - Tree is not in the best shape and needs a lot of tweaking to have a chance of winning. He's old and has been racing a long time - a real trouper. What I'm supposed to do is cut a short slit in his left front leg and then stop the bleeding. Actually in this sort of "garage", near the track, there are lots of Threes up on racks, and I'm supposed to do this to all of them. I'm very hesitant. I do a couple, but I really don't like it. Even though it's a normal thing to do - given that it's just a practice meant to win races or get a slow runner to go faster, I hate to think I'll hurt him, especially if I slip or do it wrong. I go back to the boss and tell him he'll have to do it himself, I can't finish.
