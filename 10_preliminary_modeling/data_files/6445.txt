I was walking through a "Museum of Human Anatomy" with a number of other people. We come soon to the skull display. There is one skull in full light, and another one beside it, indirectly lit, so it is mainly in the darkness. This skull has skin stretched over it, dead, straw-like hair, and eyeballs. The lips seem to be cut off. It doesn't look like he died a very pleasant death. Most of this is pretty well hidden by the obscure lighting, however. So we're walking along, and this idiot hippie guy bumps into the case, knocking the hideous head out into the full light. Everybody is very disgusted and turns away. The hippie guy says: "Whoa... sick." It wakes me up.
