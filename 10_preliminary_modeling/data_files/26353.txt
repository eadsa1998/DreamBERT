 I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. She may not look like Annie, but I know it is she. She gives me fellatio. Something is then wrong with her. She has a sickness. I ask her what it is and she says she has ____ ____ disease ( I forget the name). She tells me that blood will trickle out of her mouth and she will sleep for six to eight hours. I panic! I'm scared of her disease! What can I do to help, if anything? I think there is nothing I can do. I want to call Annie's mother Tamara to see what I should do. Then Annie communicates that she is joking: she doesn't really have a disease.
