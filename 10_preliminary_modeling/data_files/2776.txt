I am asleep on a chair recliner thing and some man, perhaps Ernie, but there is a feeling of Dwight also, stands watching me sleep. I can feel his sweet love. It's very universal, like deep friends. I wake and realize I haven't taken my pills this day and it's nearly evening, so Ginny brings me a pill and I say, "I want to take all the ones I normally take." I sort through white ones and pink ones and yellow ones. I set aside the yellow ones. Now we are at a conference of some kind in a house. I had wanted to create or host this conference and Ernie chose to use his house and organize it for me because I wanted it. I feel very happy and grateful. He does an excellent job. An older woman and her nerdy son sit on a couch and a man drones on in a boring way. Finally after they leave, Ernie is cleaning up and chuckles at how this man is so narrow-minded and only spouted off in one subject. I am helping cleanup and I'm holding a baggie full of pot roast or stew. I am squeezing the watery grease from a hole in the bag into a plate. I have to be very careful because the plate fills up fast and will overflow. As I do this, Ernie laughs and says, "He even managed to talk about 'A Horse Sex' from a Christian point of view." That was the name of a book the man was talking about. I see a book about Robinson Caruso or someone like that and comment that the woman gave it to me. I have one just like it in my collection of books from my childhood. It was an old favorite of mine. Now everyone at the conference is gone and I sit on a step with Ernie/Dwight and someone from our family - Ginny and Dwight? - bring a dozen roses and lay it a few feet near Ernie and we all applaud him like a standing ovation for his wonderful work. He smiles modestly. The applause is warm and loving.
