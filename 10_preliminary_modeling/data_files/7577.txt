I'm in the bathroom making up a "welcome home" greeting card on a towel. I'm excited because I'm expecting Mary to come home from the hospital and I thought it would be cute/funny to make a greeting card on a towel. As I'm busily writing out the message, I hear a sound and get up and go over to the head of the stairs. It is Mary. She has come home on her own and was laboriously climbing the stairs. I rush over and greet her just as she gets to the top of the stairs. I gather her in my arms and hug her. She looks fine, and except for her heavy breathing from climbing the stairs, she is OK. I ask if she'd like a nice cup of tea and she answers that she would like that. I rush off to the kitchen to put the kettle on to boil to make the cup of tea.  When I was writing the message on the towel I make some reference to one of her brothers.
