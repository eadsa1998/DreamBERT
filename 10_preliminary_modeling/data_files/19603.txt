Seems to start with something in regard to subspecies. I am working in shirt sleeves. There is to be reunion of the family, probably in my hometown. I am driving my car along a road that parallels a railroad line. There are 2 or 3 cars close behind mine, and I frequently glance into rear-vision mirror to keep posted on the situation behind -- as I doubt that I can get across tracks ahead of an approaching train, and I do not want to be bumped by car behind me. The train is unusual because the engine is about in middle. It soon passes and then as I start across tracks I see I see Charles (Mary's husband) and James (my nephew) in a car, so I turn off the road, as it now seems our reunion is to be held at a nearby railroad station. Next item recalled (and this may be part of a distinct dream) is of a group of people 6 or 8) standing in a yard just inside a fence, with a small house or cottage in background. It seems we are having our pictures taken. In one picture I am standing by gate, in another off to the left, but in both the extraordinarily large size of my ears overshadows all else -- ones eyes and interest are focused, from the first glance, on these great, protruding, sail-like organs.
