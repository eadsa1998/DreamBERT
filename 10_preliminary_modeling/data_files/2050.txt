Friday. I decide I'm going to take a bath. I start the bath water and remember I need a certain piece of clothing that is in another room. I hesitate about leaving the water running, but decide to chance it. It's not far and won't take me long. I go out and down a long ramp to a big room that has counters like in a business office. I go to the back of the room to the bathroom, but the woman boss (Ann Bacon) is very agitated. They are very busy and I'm interfering. She says someone else is taking a bath and I must wait. I get anxious, wondering if my bathtub is overflowing. Finally, she reluctantly lets me in. I nod my head to the old skinny guy in the tub and say, "Excuse me." I get a piece of clothing and a purse off the shelf and go back out. I pass rows of counters. I bump one. It's on little wheels and rolls a little. I try to get it back like it was, but it won't, so I give up and hope Ann doesn't get upset more. I'm now walking up the ramp and I'm slow and tired. I try to walk faster, now very worried about how long I've been gone. The water is probably all over the floor and it will be a terrible mess to clean up, and I'm late already for an important something. I try to find an elevator and I do. It's in the library, but it won't go to my floor. So I get out and see stairs only. They go up, hit a platform and an escalator, conveyor belt thing as sloped down the other side, only it's rolling me back up to the platform. I go back where I came and finally get to my bathroom. The water is at the very top and has spilled over just a little. "Just as I imagined it would," I thought. I take off my clothes and see two men in the room. I decide I have to go to the bathroom and pee. I say to one man, "See we're like brothers and sisters. I can take off my clothes and pee in front of you." I am a little uncomfortable, but feel trust that it's OK. [There's a real sense of trying to prepare for a special occasion and being late and many things going wrong.]
