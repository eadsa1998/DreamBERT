I was riding in a car with my boyfriend at D-------, O----. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were many 0--- W------ students walking around. We were going on a picnic and I was riding in the backseat while my boyfriend drove. We came to a steep hill which we couldn't get up. This hill suddenly changed to the hill at C --- P--- Theater, and fire engines were chasing each other up and down it! I felt as though I was still at D-------, and I was fearful that the dorm was on fire.
