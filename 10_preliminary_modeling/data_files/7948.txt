I was in Bev's house and they were having a problem with their roof. The construction company had to tear all of the insides out and rebuild it to repair the roof. They tore out all the inside walls and completely rebuilt it. When they repainted I noticed what a sloppy job they were doing. They really did a very bad job. I wondered if it was because they had a bad attitude because they had to redo all that work or if they were just in a hurry, or maybe just poor quality normally. I was just wondering what the deal was. I was going upstairs, maybe into an attic. I almost hit my head on a board that they were attaching. I asked them if it was attached that low before and so they raised it a little bit.
