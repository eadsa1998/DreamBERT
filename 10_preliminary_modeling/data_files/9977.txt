On a train with Frank and Marita, as a 4-year old. The conductor tells us to take a different train back along a more scenic route! I see hills and beautiful country side. Muzak plays Christmas carols and I carry a big bag of Christmas cards. I am singing Beethoven and then am told that I must pack my things for a plane ride home. Frank forgets several things, and a maid says: "I am amazed that he would forget to pack his shirt." I am embarrassed, but Frank is nonchalant and we catch our plane and leave....
