I dreamt I was on my computer.  The room was dark, and my brother Stuart was sitting on the toilet across the hall with the door open.  Something felt ominous, but I'm not sure what.  I was trying something new out, like a Winamp skin.  The screen splashed red, except for where the title letters left a vacancy.  The two halves of the screen turned slightly, forming two corners of cubes, protruding 3 inches from the monitor.  I turned and called Stuart to look, it was so realistic.  I felt as though I was supposed to succumb to the stereotype of trying to touch the 3-D image.  I reached through one of the corners, and once I penetrated the image, I felt heat.  My finger quivered.  High radiation?  I touched it again and got nervous.  It was too weird.  I wanted to back away.  I woke up with my throat and breathing constricted.
