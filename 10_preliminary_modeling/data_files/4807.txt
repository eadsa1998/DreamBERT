I live in a house with lots of clothes and things lying untidily on the floor and furniture. I am looking around for Fluffy. I suddenly realize I'd nearly stepped on Bootsie. I hadn't seen her as she was curled up on some clothes. Bonnie visits. I show her I'd been looking at some photos she'd given me in clear plastic frames. One 8 by 10 of an old man I don't know. I wonder where I will hang these. I don't want to hang the one of the man I don't know. I tell Bonnie I'd been looking at the photos. I feel a bit guilty. It's taken me so long. Then Bonnie opens the blinds on a back window. I am surprised as she had a movie poster and some little ornaments. I didn't want her to do that. But I look out the window at the back yard. I am surprised to see that there is a caged area full of chickens and sheep and a llama. These are my neighbors animals but obviously in my backyard. I had thought my backyard ended much before this. Then I look back in the room and see Bootsie curled up. I see her left back foot is very swollen and she is in pain. I am concerned. I feel terrible. I must have stepped on her and caused this injury. I pick her up gently and pet her, checking out the foot more carefully. I see her face is pink from loss of fur. I feel very badly for her and am determined to help her heal.
