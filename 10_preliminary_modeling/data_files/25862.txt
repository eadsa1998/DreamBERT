 I'm with some men hitting baseballs. We are hitting from the intersection of 1st Street and Slope Avenue in Oak Valley, from the top of the hill that goes down 1st Street. I have a bat, and am going to hit the ball. I wait for people and cars to move out of the way. It takes them a long time to move. A man parks near the houses on the southeast and the northwest side of the intersection. We're hitting balls down into the grass lot at Hill Park.
