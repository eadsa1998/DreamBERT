I was at school. We had an excursion. I wasn't wearing any pants because they were wet and I left them in the car. Calvin was with me. I had to go to the toilet so I went to the toilets in the Year 9 block. The last toilet had one wall missing and the door was low. This girl was looking over the top. This chubby girl did a dance. Some girls had been teasing me and pushing me and we had made a rule that they couldn't film it. I attacked them. I was walking to the bus and I told Ms Vickers that I forgot the key to the car (to get my pants) so she said she would take me home. Bradley and Darius were in another car. Jeremiah was taking stuff to the excursion. Eugene wasn't there. As we drove home, we missed the turn off at first. The house was different. Dad had a roller door at the front door. I couldn't get inside. I tried to open this window. I finally got inside, but grabbed two bars of chocolates and put them in my pocket as I had gone there to get food, not my pants. I went back to the car and Ms Vickers was now Ms Solomon.
