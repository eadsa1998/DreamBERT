An unknown woman in a bar yells at the bartender because they will not sell her beer on Sunday--and they had in the past. Suddenly the woman changes into Henry Miller who sits down with huge books under his arm. They bring him Miller's beer in a can without him saying a word. He is working immediately in the wide margins, giving "explication du text" to obscure and rarely played Shakespeare plays--Timon of Athens and Titus Andronicus. He works steadily with a black ink pen--script perfect. I'm impressed that his mind is clear at 88-90. He has galley proofs beside the books. I pick up one with circle of beer can on its edge. It is almost beyond belief that so much learning can come from that ancient mind of Henry Miller--and nothing there except the text of Shakespeare.
