 I am at home. I get out of bed. I have my black and white striped underwear on. It is early in the morning, and people are awake at my house. My friend Melanie McDyss and another woman are there. They are dressed in very skimpy see-through dresses. I say "Oohhh" and joke with Melanie about this. They leave with others. I need to take a bus or drive to somewhere via Circle Highway. I take the bus back to Brimson with a woman.
