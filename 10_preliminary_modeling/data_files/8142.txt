I was at lunch with Bill C. we drove back to the office and I saw Pam Ta. I realized she lived next-door. But at this point I am at my home instead of the office. I was going to invite her in to see my living room as I thought she would really enjoy the warm, comfortable feeling it provides. Before I could say anything she invited me in to her house so I went. The houses seemed to be attached and seemed to share a raised wooden deck on the front. I went in. Her decor was rustic. I liked it. I thought it very much looked like her style.
