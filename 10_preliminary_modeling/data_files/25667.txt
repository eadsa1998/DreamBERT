 I am with my classmate Bryan Beard. We're walking in something like a railroad yard. We talk. He spits a lot. His spit is white, and it has sexual connotations. We walk through Indian land. We are not supposed to be there and cannot pas through. The land is owned by one of the members of the Indian group.
