I saw a fellow worker and he came up to me and said, "You want to make yourself about $500. Put about $50 on Drummed Out," me and another horse. I can't recall now. He said, "I bet you $20 you will make that I said you will." I am not quite sure that the two horses mentioned are the ones, but it seems to register.
