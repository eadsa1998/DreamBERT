I am exhausted and tired. A lesbian, like Dwan, is following me as I walk outside. She is trying to talk me into having a lesbian affair. She is trying to tell how wonderful it will be and I would really like it. I am angry and tired and I tell her to leave me alone. She persists. I get into the back seat of a car, and she follows me in still talking. Now I am walking up some stairs. She follows, and others are there, also trying to convince me. I am very angry and frustrated. Now I am in bed and Susie S. lies in bed with me, on my left. She caressed my left nipple, trying to get me sexually aroused. I am disgusted and very angry. I tell her to stop. I am not interested in lesbian sex. I push her hand away.
