I had a job at 4.30am. I was telling Mom that I needed 'Aero Grad' and a thing to kill bugs. Darren was in bed and saying they would get some and I was like 'before 4.30am?'. Mom was getting ready to meet someone. I realized it was 6.30am and that it was too late now. Then I realized the job was actually next week. We lived in an apartment block and there was some dodgy guy on the roof and the police had the building surrounded.
