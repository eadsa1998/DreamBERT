I took my family and a miniature train and I ran it. We went around a circle and I kept on blowing the whistle. I was sleeping in bed. We were living in our old home on 68th Street. Mr. O'Korn was digging up his lawn. I was working on the coke yard, drawing coke, and I didn't like it. Then I was on the coal shanty shoveling off coal into the yard. Jimmy Clear was digging up the tree lawn. He came to a pipe and pushed it over with a crowbar and a fine stream of water came up. He called me to come up. I said, disgusted, "I'm not the landlord here and I have to fix it." Ann was nude and Grandpa was coming down the stairs. I yelled at him to stop for a while, but he came on into the room and I said, "Turn around and don't look," but he looked anyway. Ann just turned her back and he walked by. I found money, about $2 in half and quarter dollars.
