I was working in the dairy and Frank Lasko was the owner. He and the Fairmont dairy were in the same building. He had half of the dairy and Fairmont had the other half. I took down some pipes. Ed M. was a master at the dairy, but by a slight seniority or something a fellow was above him, which kept Ed from getting $3 an hour.
