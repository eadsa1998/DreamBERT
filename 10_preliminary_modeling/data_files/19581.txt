Inside the Hardy house I meet several children (5 or 6) who are about ready to go to a party. Among them is a slender girl whom I have often seen without knowing who she was. She had always impressed me as a sullen or spoiled child, but she greeted me cheerfully and I lifted her high into the air. We became very friendly. All of us walked along a hallway until coming to several low book cases (or perhaps only wooden boxes) full of books, and here I stopped to examine the books. Next, I saw Aunt Addie, very clearly, standing near by. She said, in a voice like nobody's but her's, "Faye wanted me to have _ _ _ _ _ _ _" and mentioned the name of a book. Aunt Addie, however, did not care to take the book as she had looked in her own library and found she already had a copy. Faye herself decided to take a book entitled something like "Raggles."
