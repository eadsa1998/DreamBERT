["Rescued and scared."] I am on a small box adrift in the oceans, having been abandoned. A man is out there also, on another raft or box. I have drifted away from him. I have been out there for days. I am in deep exhaustion and fear. A shark or something big and dark is following. All it has to do is bump the box and spill me over and eat me. I see a dark fin rise in the water. It is near. Then it becomes a dark submarine. I slither from my box onto it and pound on the door yelling at them to help me please. Finally a crewman hears me and opens the hatch. I am now down in the submarine and in bad shock. We are walking down the narrow hallway of the submarine and there is water flowing in it up to my knees. I am terrified of the dark fish ;like shapes I see in the water. The captain is now there, sort of Kelsey, the actor from Fraiser on TV. He soothes me and I slump up against him hugging him for security. He is tender and understanding. We end up in a set of small rooms. His rooms, but they are sort of cute and domestic, curtains and a tiny kitchenette table. I am warning him that something is waiting for him down there, maybe the enemy submarine. We are becoming friends, respecting each other. Romance is a possibility.
