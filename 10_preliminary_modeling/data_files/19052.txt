Something about writing a song and the job is to be as representative as possible in the words or rather the phrases that get incorporated into the song. I can see the sheet of paper with phrases and dots and pencil marks.  It has something to do with the 48 states. It's alright to show a little favoritism for neighbor states, but you shouldn't go so far as to overlook choice items that come from remote states or unfriendly states. I think Calvin's question where you dream got incorporated into this whole thing. I kept saying yes when I meant in terms of the dream, "I know I'm getting to it," meaning I'll get around to that item in a minute. I dreamt that I was awake and awakened by myself became I had been having a whole series of ideal dream-making experiences. I had so many that I just woke up by myself.
