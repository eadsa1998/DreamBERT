George-Michael and Maeby (both Arrested Development) were flirting. George-Michael was playing a weird game and was up to the boss at the end. This guy was chained up with him and his head was 'inverted'. Someone called up some movie guy and invited him to a party. Earlier, someone had died. They were a dog, but not. Lucille (Arrested Development)/my Mom cried. I saw Eugene's head (like in the Year 8 photo) rolling and birds were eating it. Mom was in a kitchen? Lindsay (Arrested Development)/Samantha hid behind something. There were two Maeby's. Ms Solomon was somewhere. Ezra was eating the shirt he was wearing.
