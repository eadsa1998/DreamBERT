I was in a big home. I was ours. I saw it being repaired. I looked down the street and elephants were coming up the street. People walked and paid no heed to them. Then all at once one of them started to run fast up Broadway Ave. and about three of them were coming up towards us. Then all at once the three elephants started to run up towards us and the people ran alongside of the elephants and they ran by us. A car stopped beside our home. I heard a voice of a man loud talking to a young girl in the car. Then the two men were colored and the girl was white. She opened the door and went outside and walked away. I looked at our bathroom. We had about four or five toilets. I looked under the walls to see if there was someone there because the water was flushed. I saw a young lady's legs standing in one of the booths, so I walked out of the room. I was cleaning a big wooden dish and a fellow beside me started to cry. When he stopped, I started to cry.
