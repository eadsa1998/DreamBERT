I was at a shop. There was this game where you run around this thing and win prizes. I ran six times but the guy wouldn't give me a prize. I took a balloon and this lady friend of ours took another one. We were running and mine was too hard to hold, so I let go. Then I was at this shop with Mom. It was called 'This Girl's Life'. Mom decided that we had to go in. They sold dresses and bags. I was running to get out. I saw these ads on the walls and they were of me and Tigger and I was little and modeling dresses. I was disgusted. I couldn't get out of the shop, but I finally did. I had these oranges. I went to the next shop and pretended that they were from there because they were cheaper to buy, but they looked totally different.
