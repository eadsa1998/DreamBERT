["Precious stones on my belly."] I am looking for a sore spot on the left fold next to my vagina. I see it and then notice a black fiborous tuft and pull it off, then I see more of them and then I see a Geod glued on to my belly and then more polished pretty stones. I decide I'll remove them as they must weight a lot and feel uncomfortable. By the handfuls, I scoop up the rocks and peel them off me and pile them on a small night stand next to me. More and more keep appearing!.
