I dreamed I was dying. I had all the symptoms, and was just waiting for the end. But at the same time, I was about and carrying on carious activities with friends. It worried me to be doing this, because I was supposed to die, and I didn't know how much gallivanting I should be doing. Somehow these activities my friends wanted me to participate in carried me to Albuquerque, N.M. though the town in my dream was nothing at all like Albuquerque. (I was there several years ago.) And also, though I kept waiting, I never died. I gradually regained life.
