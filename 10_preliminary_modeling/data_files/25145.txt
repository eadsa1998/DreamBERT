 My roommate Jens' uncle is sleeping on the top bunk in our dorm room. He is balding but has dark hair and is a little plump. The bed is turned so the top bunk has one end resting on Jens' desk. Here is a space between the bed and the wall. Jens leaves in the morning. His uncle is on trial in Wilmerton. I'm responsible for getting him there. Two others and I go out to a car in a ramp full of old beat up cars. The one we are driving is a station wagon. There is broken glass in the back seat. I brush it off. I say the quickest way to Wilmerton is Superhighway 100. A guy disputes it and suggests an alternative route. We back out, smashing into cars on the way. We break through the entrance/exit door and smash into a car in which there are two men trying to shoot us. We crush their car and keep pressing the gas pedal to smash it further. Then we speed off. The two guys are after us. I'm with Eddie Murphy in a long drag racing-like car. He is in front. They are shooting at us in a small forest and field, while we speed around in the car. I wonder why we just don't drive away to safety. I want to. Bullets are not hitting us, but they very easily could be. I am playing cards. I get 5-of-a-kind in the form of two 10's and three 6's, which are wild.
