I'm in a rectangular room. A man "Briggs" is the investigating agent to find out what had killed my mother. As I watch him, I realize he's actually the one that murdered her, and he's going to get me too. I am left alone in this room with him. He goes outside to get a huge black pig and brings it in to kill me. I accept the challenge and reach for a metal stick, like my brake lever on my chair. Then I reach on the wall for a white dust pan. He rushes me and I try to force the dustpan up his throat. As we fight, he becomes a tiny white piglet and I roust him out of the room.
