I am furious at everybody. I scream angry words at Howard. I threaten to throw out two little boys. I am angry at Dovre and her new boyfriend, a white-haired man named Sam who is 48 years old. Dovre is talking about marrying him and they've only just met and he's my age, old enough to be her father. (He reminds me of Dino.) I want them all out of my house, except Dovre. She can stay. But she is angry at me, hurt, and decides to stay with a dog-like animal who is very nurturing and nurses her babies for four years, much longer than most animals like her do. I see her nipples and feel some disgust. Dovre leaves and I sort of don't blame her.
