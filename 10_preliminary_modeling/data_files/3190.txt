I am seated around a table with some other people and I am explaining a conversational phenomenon. I am explaining like I am teaching a class, and indeed there are a small group of my peers (counselors) I am talking to. I say that it is very interesting because if you are a good observer, you can tell when the conscious mind is speaking and when it shifts to the unconscious mind. I talk about how we are influenced by both and the subtle shifts can be tracked. I talk knowledgeably and the group is very impressed with me. I feel confident.
