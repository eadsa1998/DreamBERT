I had my first stocktake job. It was at a supermarket and I was about to scan the first item and then we were told to evacuate because of dodgy people in the building nearby who might break in. We went out the back door and ran to hide under a hill. I went to another job and was scanning and I made a mistake. People treated me like a noob.
