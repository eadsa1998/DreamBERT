["Hasani dances naked."] I am sitting in the audience to see a performance. I am with Bonnie and another woman friend. Hasani comes to the performance area and takes off her clothes, except for a black shawl across her shoulders, which doesn't cover anything. She is slim, young, with small breasts. She is dancing the story she is telling. The audience is scandalized. Bonnie's mouth drops open. She is shocked. I hold a small package with a letter handwritten by Hasani. I am trying to read it. Then during her performance I move near the area she is at and start talking with her. I feel embarrassed I'd interrupt her performance. She doesn't seem to mind. We talk about what's happening in our lives. Now Bonnie and her friend and I are leaving in the middle of her performance. I turn to Bonnie and say I forgot my things on the seat. She goes back to get it, embarrassed to be so conspicuous. She grabs up the thin pillow Aunt Millie made for me. I point to some more things at another seat. She rushes through and grabs them too. I mouth, Thank you to her. She is annoyed with me.
