 I'm in a room with a keg, where a small party is going on. My roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens are there, drunk. My friend Stephen Ramos and classmate Becky Happs are there. I fill up with beer a brown wine bottle that had been filled with my rhubarb wine. I am reaching for something and bump my lucky lottery candle, breaking it. The candle is huge: about 2 feet high and 1 foot in diameter. It's a clean break. <br/
