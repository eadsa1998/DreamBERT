I was in class at a table. I was with Ezra and others. We were playing Monopoly. I was late there and then we started. No-one wanted me as the banker. We had to roll five dice to decide who went first. Then it was a movie. This girl and a guy got caught. This teacher guy said everyone else got today and six hours to prepare for the next test, but they had to do the test now. They had six hours to do it though. Then I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We took our time because we were waiting for this guy, who was called Marlowe. We went to leave and then he turned up. We asked if he wanted to stay over and he said yeah. Mom drove off and he was close behind. Then it was the movie again. The next day, the guy from before hugged the girl from behind. They had to go to a funeral and the test was supposed to be at 4. He mother was supposed to work but she wasn't going.
