["Beautiful Music Becomes A Chore"]  Whoopie Goldberg has wonderful musical talent. She plays a piano piece and impresses this group of people searching for the best piano players. She plays a piece and the judges in the next room behind the observation window count each note for duration and intensity. She is very good. They want her to do more and then more and then more. She sits at the piano in a tiny room and plays piece after piece. Then the people take this and sell it or do something with it to their advantage. The music is beautiful. After a long time, she grows weary of being constantly working and not getting appreciated. The people keep insisting she continue. She rebels and leaves. She finds a tiny apartment and sits in there looking out the window. She sees a cat and a dog, possibly hers. She throws a steak down to the sidewalk for them to eat. Then she decides to take her precious jewelry (three necklaces of black hematite pearls) to throw away into a river. She walks to the river, looking for a place where she can throw the necklaces away. But the sandy bank is long and the water out of throwing distance. A man playing a baseball game in the nearby field sees her. He seems to understand what she wants to do. He walks over to her and leads her to a rail where you can drop things down into a man's booth. If the stone or gem lands in a bowl of similar gems, you get more. He drops a pretty amethyst gem into a bowl and gets some back. She tries it too and succeeds as well.
