I was walking at night to the next street. I was on my way to see a prostitute. I met a small boy and another fellow. He was down on all ours like a dog. I was afraid he might try to rob me, so I was on the alert. He walked with me a ways and asked me if I had a few cents to buy a cup of coffee. I looked into my pocket and gave him 3 dimes. The little fellow also wanted some money, so I gave him 2 dimes. As I turned the corner of the next street, the fellow came into the street, honked his horn at me and made a stop. He had a passenger car. He got out and waited for me. He said, "How do you like my 1924 Pontiac?" I looked at it and now it was a big long truck. The body was new. I was hanging out a sign. I had a long board which I tried to put thru a window, then lean it on the roof. I was at the racetrack. I was looking for a good place to park in the parking lot so I could get away when I wanted to. Someone gave me a program and a lot of tickets they played and they were losers. I played the last race and played the wrong one and lost.
