["River and cabin dream continues.."] I am in the cabin again. The river is more normal now. I have a 6 or 7 year old daughter. My husband is gone and has been for weeks or months. Traveling on work, I guess. The daughter is cute and smart. She has two neighbor friends (male) over and they are playing. One boy is typing on a toy machine and asking interview questions. I think this will be good skill building for him.
