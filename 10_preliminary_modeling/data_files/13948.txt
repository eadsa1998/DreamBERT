I was at home, and it was in the morning before school, filling up water bottles and there weren't any in the fridge I could take to school. I filled one up with cold water but it had a dead fly at the bottom. Dad came to get a drink. I was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone and this guy and his girlfriend/wife lived in a small, stingy apartment thing. He kept his brother in a room behind his closet. He would only let him sleep when he had a bath and could only have a bath when he did. He wasn't allowed out of his room either. He had a brown rug to lie on. The other guy's wife was tan and had dirt on her face. Something happened with the police and so they all left. The brother who was locked away, dobbed his brother into the police for freedom and got interrogated by some guy who pretended that he was going to kill him. This black guy smacked him around for a bit. The guy's wife told him to hurry and said urgently, "I'm doing it". These insects came out of somewhere and they were really bad effects and there was also a bad effects rat. Some creature hissed. I was then at home and Dad was watching Gone with the Wind and the 'chapter' was 2.37. Dad was talking to Ezra about lynching.
