I was part of a team trying to catch a killer. He had killed a child in some violent manner. At one point we thought we had him, brought in a team, surrounded him, put him in constraints, etc. took him away. Turned out he had managed to substitute his people for our without our knowledge and it was his own people that had taken him away. preparing meeting to discuss everything that had happened from the first murder forward so we could plan how to prevent other such incidents. One member of team had prepared detailed report for the meeting and brought it to me, with multiple copies. I had to explain to her that the purpose of this meeting was not to take the next step or plan the next step with this particular case or incident. Part of my involvement was individual interaction with this killer. That was, at least in part, a conversation in a small portable room in the middle of a school gymnasium.
