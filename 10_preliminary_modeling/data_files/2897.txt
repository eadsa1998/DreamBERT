I am in a room and the scene keeps changing times and people. Now I am watching a scene of my mother's family when Millie was about 8 years old. I ask where is Millie and someone (my mother) points to the couch where she is lying down because she is sick with the croup. She has on glasses like I wore when 6 years old. I am handed Millie's old diary and I try to read it in anticipation. This will be very interesting. I keep finding printed stories and instructions on how to keep a diary, but none of her own words. Later, my father asks me if I ever do research on a general question for people and I say, "Sometimes." He says he's interested in "extroverts" and I say I have lots of info on that. He says he is particularly interested in it as related to rheumatoid arthritics.
