I walk into a supermarket and am wearing women's flat shoes and aware of the noise they are making on the hard floor and it embarrasses me that this calls attention to me. I note several women standing nearby watching me and looking at my feet. A bit beyond them I continue shopping very busily and wonder if it would be best to just continue on and all the way around the store to the exit or return and go past these same women. Later have gone up some stairs and first person I see is one of the same women. (All strangers)
