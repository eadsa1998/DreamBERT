I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. I was about to tell Dad a story about Gob (Arrested Development), when Will Arnett and Amy Poehler walked past. I was like 'what the hell?'. I had a newspaper and it had an Arrested Development crossword. I told Dad about Will and how I wanted to get a photo taken with him and he told me to ask him, but I couldn't. Then Jason Bateman walked past. Dad and Ezra went somewhere. I went into a little shop. Michael Cera came in and he said hello to me. He kept looking at me and talking to me and was acting nervous. I was trying not to walk off so I could talk to him. We ended up following each other. We were then sitting on lounges. Jason Bateman came past with some others and joked to each other that I was his girlfriend. His parents came and they were black and were also very strict. We were sitting on separate lounges, but his mother thought we were too close. Portia de Rossi came past and asked Michael something and left. Jason came past again and Michael said to ask (for a photo or whatever) and I said I can't. Then he got up and told David Cross that I wanted to get a photo, but his parents called him back. David was really funny and let me take a photo and stuff. I text Dad to ask if we could stay but I realized I had no credit and a low battery. Mom picked me up and Michael wanted to go with me, but she had the pickup.
