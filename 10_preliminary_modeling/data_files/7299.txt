[2nd dream] I told R. she had left the bathroom in a perfect mess with all those blue towels about. But R and J wouldn't leave and I wanted to use it. At last they were gone and I took my temperature but one thermometer was broken and I had trouble getting the other back in its case. It read 99.2. Perhaps I was getting sick. I started to dress but my girdle was already on. Had I worn it to bed? I looked at the clock: 7:30. At my watch: 7:10. Why, I was too late for breakfast.
