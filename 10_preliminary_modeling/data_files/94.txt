I've just come back to the "library" from being out somewhere and Bobbie wants me to fix up some displays on tables. She points out others and asks if I didn't do some of those. I said I had, sort of -I just fixed them up a bit. I wish she wouldn't ask me to do things like that. The room looks rather like an exhibit hall. The displays seem to be ceramic or porcelain - plates and bowls and colorful objects.
