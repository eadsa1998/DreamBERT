I am told I must drink deep of the river. I submerse myself and breathe in the water deeply. Small, white baby seals swim by. I stand up and a man comes by, taunting me, smiling. "You did the wrong thing," he said. "If you drink that water, you'll get dizzy and ill." I don't know who to believe, but I feel deep down to drink is the right choice. I look up river and see a life-size crucifix of Christ floating toward me.
