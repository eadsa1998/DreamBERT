I dreamed that I was running for a bus that was situated at the Public Square, five miles from my home. My mother was waiting for me at the stop and I was yelling for her to wait there. I was running and running for countless hours. Finally I reached the bus stop, and the bus was there waiting for me. My mother, however, was no longer there. She had vanished all of a sudden. I ran to the back of the bus and looked in. She was in the bus, so I ran to the front and got in. When I got in, my mother was standing outside waiting for me, and I saw a person running to get the bus, yelling at my mother. The peculiar part of this was that I was the person who was running. I then woke up.
