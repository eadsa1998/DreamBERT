[1997-06-12] I was having trouble opening and closing the bedroom door to my room. I checked and noticed that the hinges were coming off. The door was not straight on the hinges. These are new doors that we put in recently. I thought "These doors are really messed up, I don't know if I'm going to be able to fix them or not." I went down to the basement looking for a couple of screws to add to it. I was finding all kinds of screws but not the right size.
