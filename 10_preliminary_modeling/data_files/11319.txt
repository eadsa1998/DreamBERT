I was in the sitting room of a suite in which I lived 8 years ago. This was an apt. house in N.Y. I was I at the window for the purpose of telling my sister (27) who was on the opposite street (3 floors below) something which I cannot recall. However, I shook my head from side to side but my sister did not understand that I meant no to whatever matter was concerned. Whereupon I lifted the window, which was already partly open, to shout the answer and thus be understood. On the ledge (outer ledge) of the aperture were two handbags one of which (a green one) I recognizes as my sister's. In leaning out, I brushed this bag so that it started to fall to the street, but I caught it. When I had opened the window I still did not speak but shook my head as before.
