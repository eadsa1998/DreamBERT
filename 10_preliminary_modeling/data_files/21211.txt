I was playing baseball in Rivertown with the boys. I saw a pig running on a tree branch and came down. I got away from him and climbed a tree. The first thing I knew I was on top of the tree and the branches were few and when I looked down, I seemed to be up about 500 ft. I was up high and was a little nervous from the height. I looked down and saw the pig running around on the ground trying to pick up my scent. I thought of lying out from height and was a little afraid. Then I saw a picture of a young lady and I sort of let myself down and I couldn't see how I was coming down, but I sort of floated to the ground. I came into a classroom and the students were to write something on paper. I didn't know what because I was out at the time of the lecture. I played with Bob. I would sort of make a dive at him like Superman. I got hold of a little girl's hand and Bob's and I said, "Let's run." They ran and I had my feet in a running position and I floated across the room with them. I was loving my Ann. I pulled her on top of me and intimated her. My organ was very large at the time. In my sleep I heard a distant train whistle blow. This reminded me of my brother's death. I always seemed to get the chills or it seemed to me the distant train whistle was from the far beyond. I was going to a White's picnic.
