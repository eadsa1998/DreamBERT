 I go into a computer lab at Brimson and sit down at a good Power Mac computer. I am working. The person who was previously there didn't log out of the network, so I do so for her. She comes back. She didn't save her paper, and needs to get at it. She fools around with the computer, clicking on different things. She can't call up the paper. There are all kinds of advertisements on the screen in tiny squares. I try to find the icon that is the 2MB Mac Format, which is my disk. Eventually I do. She ejects a tiny tape-like piece of microfilm from the monitor and thinks she can use it to help her. There are some printed papers there, one of which is a cover to the work of a person I know named Eric. She thinks she is onto something when she finds this paper. She is dumb! She doesn't know what she is doing; she is incompetent! Next to the computers is a class of introductory level German students. There is a male and a female teacher. The male teacher is dominant. The students are reciting German and using sign language also.
