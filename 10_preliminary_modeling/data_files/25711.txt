 I'm coming back from the Rock Lake casino in my truck. I need to urinate. I need gas for the truck. I am then on a bicycle. I go through woods and hear the music of Nine Inch Nails. I think the music I hear is soft and mellow. I get to Super America in my truck. I put cash on my Brimson ID card, which I put into a machine to pay for gas. The machine is like a copy and cash machine. I start putting money it in. A woman hits the "change" button and I get it all back in coins. I put all the coins back in the machine. They are large coins. I don't know their value. There is an orange coin from the casino with a burning skeleton on one side. The larger coins are worth a lot. The coins add up to 19 dollars and change. I tell the next man in line to leave the card in the machine while I pump the gas so I can pay for it. I go out to the gas pump. It is already running. It stops at $16 and change. I go back inside. Fitted Minnesota Twins baseball caps are on clearance. My gas is paid for. My roommate Stephen Ramos has my ID card. I want my $3 change and don't know where it is. I go back to the cash/copy machine, kick it open, and take the change that is laying in it. Stephen and a man in the store laugh at me. The man is sitting at a table in a cafe-like area with other people. The hats on clearance are gone. Boxes of Mr. Freezes are on clearance.
