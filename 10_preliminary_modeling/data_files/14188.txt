I was at Mom's. I had a file on the table and I knocked it and it fell out and went all over the floor. I was picking it up and Mom got home. She asked where her coke was and I had chucked it in the in. I went home and she gave me lots of chocolate. Ezra gave me more. Dad was on my laptop getting a show off there. He said "I like your screensaver". I said it was my desktop. I looked at it and it was still Chris Barrie, but there were fewer pictures. I had a cube with all the guys from The Young Ones on it. I only remember Mike, Neil and Rick on it though. Ezra was complaining that Lost was different now and weird.
