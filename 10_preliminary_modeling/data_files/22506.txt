I was in a very elegant Arabian restaurant. Ann was in another room sitting on the corner of a round table. The bar was behind some curtains. I was there with Louie and he was hugging me so that Ann would be jealous. She looked at us with her big eyes. Joe looked at us angrily. Then he called Ann and hugged her so that I would get jealous, but he didn't succeed. When Louie hugged me, I felt something strange. Artie came and took Ann away and I stayed with Louie and couldn't avoid Joe's look, which followed me everywhere I went. I ran away from him because I got scared and then I woke up.
