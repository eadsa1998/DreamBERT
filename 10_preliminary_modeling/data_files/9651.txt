Drive with Father Andrew and Marissa and many children: see an accident; Father Andrew stops to get out; Wally runs down too: "they are all right"; they return and all come to my house: Marissa sits at my table and I make her something to eat; she shows me her "charm bracelet": I got her for Christmas; she complains of noise at the big party; says: "this is like an apartment... need a bigger place." She helps with the dishes.
