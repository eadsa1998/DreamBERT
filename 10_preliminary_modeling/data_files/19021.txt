I remember a feeling of hope seemed to be predominant in my dream. This hope was slated at the service of ______. The setting seemed to be indistinguishable not clear, a combination of airport and highway overpasses such as clover leafs and ramps and so forth that we would find leading to and away from airports. There seemed to be good movements similar to airplanes, however, not made by airplanes, but it was hard to detect exactly what they were, but they seemed to move in a pattern such as described earlier riding an overpass or something like this. There seemed to be a touch of he field of advertising involved whereas the different movements represented products. There didn't seem to be any people involved. Again, it was just these airplane type images of advertising products moving with a certain regularity and design. I took no part in the dream at all except just dreaming the dream. I didn't enter the dream or even consider myself present in any of it in any shape or form.
