 My dad cooks rice and sauce with chicken. Something about how he cooks it annoys me. I'm crabby and I snap at him verbally, caustically, and yell at him. I'm acting childish. He has me put the rice and brown sauce in a new pot. I don't like what he is planning with the food, and I think he doesn't do or get it right.
