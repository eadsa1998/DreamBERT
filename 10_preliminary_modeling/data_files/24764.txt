I was in the bathroom and I looked in the mirror and saw that half of my front tooth was chipped off and was sitting on my bottom tooth. I took off the broken part and went to my parents' room to show them. I wanted them to super-glue my tooth, but they didn't know how, so I had to go to school that way! Setting: In my house: bathroom and parents' room. Characters: Mom, Dad, grandma, me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I'm glad it was a dream because I'd DIE if that really happened.
