The dream has something to do with a disgruntled client who won't pay. My partner was driving me through an industrial estate. She was trying to do a three point turn in a rough area where disused factory buildings towered over us, and the concrete yard is beginning to become overgrown by nature. The concrete is breaking up in places - presumably due to roots underneath. I'm impatient with my partner who is not handling the three point turn quickly enough and I'm anxious to get out of this place.
