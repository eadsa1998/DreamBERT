I had moved into this huge house that was the same rent as here ($395 a week). I was looking for other people to move in because I could barely afford it on my own. There were three floors and I had chosen this big room with an ensuite as my room. There was also a kitchen per floor and about 10 rooms. There was another big room near the kitchen and also a smaller L-shaped room. I was trying to convince Tristan and Frederick to move in there and help find others but they didn't really want to. My room also had a door to this outside area with a private pool and spa. I was there by myself and I looked outside and saw a door was open and I was scared someone had broken in. I heard noises and realized there were people in the house. I locked my door and hid and told Tristan and Frederick to come over and help scare them off.
