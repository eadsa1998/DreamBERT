I was maybe looking. The clerk said, "Look in area 2" I was looking for Santa Claus in the department store. The guy who worked there said there were 2 left. And I said, "Where ?" He said, "Section 2." I looked all over the store. I could not find not one Santa Claus. After a while he said, "Don't you know Santa Claus is a puppet?" I still couldn't find Santa Claus puppet, life size or any form at all. I was suppose to meet Brian at the meth clinic. I was waiting in the park near by asking people, "Have you seen Brian, Have you seen Brian?" But we were in Chinatown where anything can happen. Then somebody came and told me Brian had been detained but he sent something for me and would I please hold onto it and refrigerate immediately for him. I said, "Sure I will," and the guy pulled out a bottle half full of meth (1/2 full by all other standards). I reached out my hand and the meth, it was all taped up with clear wide tape at the mouth of the small plastic bottle. Just then a woman came up. The way she reached her arm and grabbed the bottle and looked at me I knew she was an undercover cop. She slapped out her handcuffs. I smiled and said, "Could I have a moment to explain?" She would not have given me the time except the union rules said she must take her lunch break now, so I sat at the picnic table with her and explained. Then at night I followed her down a dark alley way and the metal teeth revolving door turnstile was the only way to leave Chinatown. She had looked hard at something... maybe I had nothing to hide? HA HA! There was a newspaper article about women in families who loved each other very much and one or both had been killed. It listed the ages and relationships (Michelle, 36, mother; Chris,6, daughter) I wanted a picture of Dora's hands--I could tell at a glance it was her from her hands. Her hands. Her eyes. There was a catalog with drawings of many soccer balls. Many different colors.
