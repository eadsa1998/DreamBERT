Looking for engagement ring, to buy myself.  Same store and woman and jewelry cases as when Jeff and I went to try some on (in reality).  Humor:  She shows me one ring that is for "people from Texas" (tiny star or Texas on it).  I wake up laughing.  I am aware that I'm doing this to show people I am loved, even though there's no guy, but I feel strong in this endeavor.  In fact, I'm strong, humorous, the whole dream.
