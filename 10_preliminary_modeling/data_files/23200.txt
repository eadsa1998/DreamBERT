Alicia Wanger was visiting us.  While I was talking to her, my wife Anita started a major renovation job in our house:  She was un-attaching the walls that enclosed the pantry and turning it around 180 degrees so that it faced into the kitchen.  I was upset that she would do that without consulting me.  There was a certain practicality to it-I couldn't deny that-but it made a narrow passage in the kitchen and besides, we were only renting the house and didn't have the right to make renovations.  I tried to enlist Alicia's support in opposing the project, but she didn't seem to want to get involved.
