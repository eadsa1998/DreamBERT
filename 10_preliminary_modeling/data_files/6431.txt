I'm walking around. On a sunny, sunny street in Puerto Vallarta. I was standing up against some kind of railing over a Marine-world type pool with lots of clouds floating around in it. Lots of Mario Bros Three type clouds. There was this really neat airplane flying around in the air at high speed and altitudes. It was doing all kinds of crazy loops and spins everywhere. So I ducked into the junior college library (!) and looked at the periodicals. Why these two events are related I don't know. I walked up to the counter and loudly demanded that they provide me with the latest issue of "Playboy". "I am sorry sir. We do not carry Playboy," says the really attractive redheaded librarian that I continually drool over whenever I go in. I am very embarrassed and I sneak out of a hole in the wall. <br/
