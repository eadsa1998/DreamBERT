I was at 'Ramona's house'. Her room had a little door that you had to slide into. I was staying over, as were Ezra, Charlene, Tiana, Gavin, Terrence and Cedric. When Charlene got there I told her that she was sharing a room with Ezra. I went to the toilet and Ariana opened the door and I started hitting her. Ramona was hiding from her father and I snuck into her room and we climbed out the window and jumped some fences and got to the gate. Her father saw us, and I couldn't get the gate open and I realized it was a dream. Ramona couldn't open the gate so we went back to her room. I was kissing someone earlier but I can't remember who.
