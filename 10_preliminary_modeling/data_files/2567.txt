Jock and I are talking. He is gentle. He says its time to go to Dover. I say, "Yeah. The only things holding me here are the playwright class and Ellie and Charla." Then I look in my purse for my pills. I have a hard time finding them. I had changed purses and they had fallen out of their bottles. I finally eat all the right ones. Now I'm crossing a street. A woman walks with me on the left (Kern, the stage manager of "Fame" at the community college). She gently pushes me toward the right in a curved line and points to cars coming down a hill. "We'd be safer on the right." I agree and move. Now I see a row of motel/apartment rooms. They are plain and small. I go in one and try to turn down the stereo so it won't disturb the neighbors. The knob is wobbly and nearly comes off. Ellie says to Samantha (her roommate), "You can have her old stereo," (or she asks me if Samantha can have it). I'm a little upset, I'd been thinking of selling it for extra money and didn't appreciate her cavalier appropriations.
