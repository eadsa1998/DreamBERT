I dreamed I was driving down town to get a book I had left in some store. One of the girls in my History of Art class rushed up to the car and gave me the book. (girl about 20) The next thing I knew I was in a large room full of people I seemed to know. An old friend that I had gone through high school with was telling everyone how to cut their hair.
