I don't know exactly where we were.  First someone had to come and take care of an alligator.  I was confronted by a python.  I wasn't sure what to do at first but I remembered they're not poisonous and I didn't worry so much.  I started flipping through and old history textbook, talking about the Hardy Boys- some of the revolutionaries.  After that, I remember talking to my father, I think about music.  I started talking in French.  I don't remember if that was before or after him saying he didn't like Maria Callas, "Oiseau Rebelle".  I was surprised by that.  His reason was that the pronunciation of some words were in an English fashion so it would fit the rhythm better.
