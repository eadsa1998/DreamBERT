I am attending rehearsal and they do a read-through and then Sunny wants to go home. I'm surprised because there's an hour left and I want them to do another run through and use the time. Peter B agrees with me, so we do it again. I go to visit the set. I see Sunny has a heavy, wooden square with windows that open and shut built on the stage. "How can the audience see the actors?" I ask. "Well, that is a bit of a problem," she admits. The oak paneling is old (like Shakespeare's time). I feel frustrated, so I go sit outside the structure, but on stage. Somewhere chair people in the audience start chanting, "Slyvie" as a joke and I call out, "No political announcements." They laugh with me. The play begins with the man in a chair dancing rock and roll. I decide to go up one level to see better. I go up an elevator, then it's time to go back down, and I come out of the elevator to darkness. I am afraid. I realize two men are backstage and one has a gun. I scream at the top of my lungs and run one over with my wheelchair. I force the gun out of the other guy's hands. He puts his hands up and says, "I'm leaving the gun, so you'll have to explain it and you'll get into trouble." But I don't fall for it and march him through the set and off into the audience. I notice its 9:00 and they are almost done with the play, over an hour running time, and that they use real food in the dinner scene at each rehearsal, very expensive. I don't approve. I apologize for interrupting and ask them to call the police. I am then talking to Andrea on the phone, explaining what happened. I hear a baby crying in the background.
