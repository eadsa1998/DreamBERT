 I'm outside near Tea Hall at Brimson near Brimson Street. A woman I recognize who attends Brimson comes up to me. [She is my friend Beth Mock's friend from the second floor of Wonkers Hall when we were sophomores. I also saw a photograph of this woman from this past summer in which she was at the Whitman house with my old roommate Jens Nils and others. The photograph was in the back of my roommate Jack Thigpen's car at the beginning of the year.] She says something to the effect that she hears I'm withdrawing, not being social, and not being interested in people. She says she wants me to let her into my life. I humor her, and allow her to walk with me. I'm barefoot. I see my classmate Chad Wheat and his father. His father looks much cleaner and more "normal" than Chad. I want to be alone. People can't need me. The woman is odd. She wants to be with me, and thinks she can change me to be more social. I find her annoying. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan walks by the woman and I. We walk by railroad tracks on campus. Garages are there. There is glass on the floor. We are in a tunnel to the dorms. Students from Brimson are there. We go downstairs. We have some trouble finding the tunnel, but then find it. I hear one of my high school basketball rival's names, Sam Henry, in conversation as I walk in the tunnel.
