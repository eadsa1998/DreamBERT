This dream was during a nap, taken after Thanksgiving dinner. In my dream I awaken on the bed to find my sister's cat hitting me in the face with his paw. He is not using his claws but I'm so tired I can't move. The cat keeps disappearing under the bed and then attacking. Then he comes up and hits me but has his claws out and scratches my cheek. I awoke and did not know it was a dream until I looked at myself in the mirror and had no scratches.
