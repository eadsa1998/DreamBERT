I had been reading or watching a long story about this pioneer man and how he was so upset about the bad treatment of Indians. He wants to go out and fist fight every one who is calling him squaw man. But a woman says, "Don't waste your energy. Ignore them." Now I am a woman and I walk up to a seated Indian man, who is wearing an 1890's kind of black jacket, like Wyatt Earp would have worn, white man's clothes. He's the foreman. He calls out the black woman I will have as a slave. He hands me the white, little plastic bag which has her documents in it. It's her "freedom" bag. I take it and hand it to her. I say, "Elizabeth. I give you your freedom." She doesn't understand. She thinks I'm firing her and she'll be alone and poor. I say to her, "You are your own woman now and I'd like to hire you. I will pay $6 a week." The Indian man shows me a picture. It has a bright spotlight in the center and a sidelight where he's standing. He says, "I'm in the side light because I'm an Indian. I've always wanted to be in the center spotlight." I say to him, "I understand. Believe it or not, I am in the sidelight too, because I'm a woman with a disability. We get the same kind of discrimination." [BL]
