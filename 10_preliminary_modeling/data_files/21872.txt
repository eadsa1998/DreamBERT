I was inside a building. It had a very high ceiling about 125 ft. up. I looked up and said that could be easily painted if you had a long tube that would reach up to the ceiling and spray it. I was like Hank Seegert's brother. We were looking around the house where we made repairs and touchups because we were going to sell the house. I was hammering on a sheet metal piece that was rusted thru to make the in even and look whole.
