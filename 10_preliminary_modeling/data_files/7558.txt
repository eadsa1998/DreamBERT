Mary has come back! She has had surgery and does not want to live with me right away. She wants to regain her strength, then go alone on a trip to Mexico before coming back to live with me. Then she goes to live with this young couple. I think they are Mary's relatives -- cousins, or something like that. But not long after, she moves in with them, this young couple have problems and split up. Mary tries to help them. But I am so concerned for Mary's welfare that I go to her and try to help her and/or prevail upon her to return to live with me. There is a scene where Mary is running after the young woman and trying to talk her into returning to her husband. Then there is a scene where I catch up with Mary and we embrace. She is crying. I talk to her, trying to convince her to come and live with me if she can no longer live with the young couple, or anywhere else. Mary tells me she needs more time to get her strength back, and that she definitely wants to go on a trip to Mexico. The dream ends where we are embracing and talking.
