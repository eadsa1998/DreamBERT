I'm in training with a group of other people, about 6 or so, more men than women - they seem to be mostly younger than I am. All of us are in excellent shape - we're learning special skills from an older man, he's a sort of guru. I think we're all training to be superheroes. I have a mutual attraction going with a couple of the guys, both very tentative and innocent. One was already happening, and just tonight in class this other one started making overtures, and I'm quite taken with him now, too. He's really good-looking: tall, muscular, long hair, sweet. (None of the guys are musclebound apes.) Class is just over, and we're getting ready to go home. We train in a private school, I think all boys. I get the impression they're not crazy about us being here, maybe they just want to get in and use the gym. I've turned to a table to pick up some of my things, and one of the girls asks if I'd like to ride with her and some of the others. I say no, because I'd gone earlier to get my car so I'd have it here, but I'm actually sorry I did that now because I'd really like to go with them.
