This girl was getting supplies for next year at university. Her teacher, who was a guy, told her to go a supplies place that was at the university. Then I was there too and we were both doing a science-y course. Her name was Izzy, and sometimes she was Quinn from One Tree Hill. I got a scrapbook and was waiting at the checkout. She and the teacher were having an affair I think. The teacher guy was hanging around me and she saw and looked annoyed. It happened again a while later. Then Elijah and a girl friend were there. The teacher guy organized for us all to stay there for the night. He was trying to find out if there were free beds at other universities nearby. Notre Dame was nearby and some other place. My eye was burning. As I went to cross the street to go to the carpark, I saw a bus coming and so ran across. It seemed to take ages to get across. We were all sitting around talking in the carpark. Calvin was there, along with Scarlett and some other girls and they were annoying me. There was a bed free at Notre Dame and Elijah took it (he was on the phone to them at the time). He called some girl's boyfriend that was in a race. Scarlett got on the phone and this other girl picked up the phone. The connection got cut. They discovered he had lost the race and was angry. Alek's status on Facebook had sexual, happiness (etc) ratings.
