 I'm working at Fishing Haven. It feels like my second summer there. I think of staying, or returning to work there. I load and prepare a towboat that is the width of a canoe. After I push the boat off the plug is not in, and water gets in the boat. Two men take rubber rafts into the Big Resort Area. There are some barrels that are used as floatation devices. I am waist deep in water. My old boss Phoebe Mills says I can't do the tow because I'll get the boat wet. So my old coworker Tom Olson does the tow. My other old boss Mike Hollow goes on the tow as well. The men have leeches.
