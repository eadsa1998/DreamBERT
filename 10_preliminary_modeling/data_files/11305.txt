I was playing football in a dusty lot on a hot summer day. I had on a terrifically heavy uniform and the temperature was in the 90's. Wet with sweat, parched from thirst, tired from scrimmage, I was on the verge of collapse. The other fellows in the team (can't remember who specifically) were also in bad shape but I paid no attention to them.
