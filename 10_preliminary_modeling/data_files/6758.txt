I was at an old Donna Hotel cottage in Aileen's room on the first floor. I said, "So you couldn't stay away from your old home?" She said, "There's an old diploma of yours in my bedroom. Do you want it?" I opened the closet door and asked her "where?" (The room seemed like my old one but I couldn't spot any cupboard, just a white chest and old drawers.) She cane to help me. Now the closet was a small bedroom. There was an old wooden box, much marked up names. I said, "I don't need that."
