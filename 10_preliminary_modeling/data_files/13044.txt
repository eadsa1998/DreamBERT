I was at school at the library, because I had Biology. Eugene was there on a computer. Calvin and Genevieve came later and sat next to Eugene. There was a new door for the library, which was saloon like, but in two sections. I was telling Ezra about it. Ms Solomon came in. During Accounting, we had to go get our photos for the yearbook taken. The Year 12's had to go to the library. Farrah was there, saying hello. Evelyn came. It was Lillian's turn and she was talking. The lady asked if she wanted a group hug and Eugene was like "Yeah, come on!". A lady said she'd videoed me at lunch. Later, someone was killing people. I was ok. Elana, Autumn, Madelyn and someone were in a car. They decided to separate. Autumn went into a hole. Elana and this girl went back to school and the killer was still there. They were on a horse and got shot. It was movie like.
