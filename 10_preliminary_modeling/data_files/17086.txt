I dreamt my crush Jose was mad at me, but wouldn't discuss it.  He fell in the irrigation system twice.  I tried to help him out the second time, but the current carried him for at least an hour, through tunnels so full he couldn't breathe.  I asked if he was okay when he got out, but he refused to talk to me.
