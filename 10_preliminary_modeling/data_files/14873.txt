I was at the train station but it was late. The next train was in "900 minutes". I went to the toilet and there were lots of cubicles and they were back to back. There was a toilet seat that was made out of like Play-Doh and bubblegum, so I didn't go. I told someone at the train station how to catch a train. The train came and I kept texting Mom to tell her when/where to get me. But when I got to where I normally went, something went wrong and I ended up 2 stations away. It was on the way to another one nearby though. The driver asked if we were all ok about it. It was still late and dark now. I said no because my Mom picked me up. This girl was there, whose online name on something was Nikki_08. Everyone kept saying her face looked like a foot. I was thinking that I had seen it written on IMDb. I was talking to another girl about it and she said it was for "Madeline Zahn", she meant Zima. She did the MUPC too. We went back to the station and waited. Jakob was there. I was repeating Communications and three other subjects. I had gotten a HD in all of them though. This policewoman offered to let the girl get a needle in her arm? But she missed and there was a bit of blood. I called Mom and she hadn't gotten any of my texts. She said she would leave now. Nikki was saying that her [something] was 20 and looked good and I was like 'ok...'. Darren had gotten a new car because of the bandwidth running out. I was watching Farscape and it was in an alternate reality so I was like "Yay! No Chiana!" But she was in it. I also remember seeing Aeryn and Darren.
