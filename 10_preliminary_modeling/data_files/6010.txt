I am watching the filming of a movie scene involving three or four fast-moving cars. The people in the cars are all young and crazy, and they are having a lot of fun doing outrageous things, such as sitting outside on the roof of the car as it speeds. One young lady leans out of a passenger-side window so far that only her feet are still in the car; her head is held up by a man standing on the hood of the car next to hers. Suddenly one of the cars bumps into a structure on the side of the road and catches fire. The car comes to a stop by a nearby building, causing the building to catch fire also. A big wall of fire jumps out and now several buildings in the vicinty are burning as well. I am standing outside and am now surrounded by the flames. I am not sure whether this is a tragic accident or a planned part of the movie.
