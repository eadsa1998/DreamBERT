Elvis, or a man dressed like him, and a bunch of my friends were all standing together. The Elvis man was trying to encourage us about something. Occasionally, one of my friends would slide down a tube slide that looked like it had sticky glue stuff inside it. Then I realized the Elvis man was trying to get us to do our homework - history. When the kids agree d, they'd go down the slide. Setting: In a brown room with a tube slide in it. Characters: Me, a bunch of kids from my school, and Elvis (or somebody dressed like him). Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, a little. The Elvis man was trying to get us to do our history project, but I'm not in that history class.
