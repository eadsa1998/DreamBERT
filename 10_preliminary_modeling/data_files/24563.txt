My dad had a friend. She looked like Cruella DeVille. She blew up my house while she was in it. She was all brown and she walked up to the couch where I was hiding. She tried to shoot me but I said, "Please don't shoot me," and she said, "I won't shoot you." Setting: My burnt-up house. Characters: My Dad's friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. It was really scary.
