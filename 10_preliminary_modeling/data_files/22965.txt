Mother and Daddy and my sister Nancy and my wife Bonita and I were riding on a bus.  Daddy called my attention to the fact that we were passing Carl Hermer.  He was an enormous guy, especially in width, from behind, and he was leaning on a white-haired man for support, one arm over his shoulders.  Apparently they were talking a long walk that was well publicized, like a cross-country hiker.  When we passed them, I yelled to him out of the back of the bus, which was open, and wished him luck.  He turned around and was very pleased and surprised that I knew who he was.  He thanked me profusely.  It made me feel good.  All this time he was fading into the distance at a very slow rate considering the bus was moving.  <p
