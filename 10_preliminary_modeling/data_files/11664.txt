In this dream I dreamt we were walking in the suburbs of a large city which I recognzied to be Rocky River. The group consisted of four other youths about my own age. We were walking along the sidewalks laughing and talking although I can't recall any words I was saying. There is a bridge in Rocky River by the Westlake Hotel which I pass on my way home. In the dream we walked onto the approach to the bridge and prepared to cross over it. As we walked onto it, the others dropped back a little and I was all alone. Suddenly it began to hail and the others ran into a gas station to escape the very large stones that fell. I was caught on the bridge and was undecided which way to go as I was afraid I would be hurt by the stones. the others yelled at me that I would get hurt so I rushed back across the bridge and ducked into a small shed in which was the colored gas station attendant.
