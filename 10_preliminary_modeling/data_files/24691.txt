I was at my friend Cindy's house with her sister (her name is Em). Cindy had moved her room and rearranged her Jonathan Taylor Thomas posters. This boy named Matt was here, too. Then JTT walked in. He commented something and we started laughing. Cindy left. When we finished laughing JTT left. Then Matt asked about sodas. We all had some then Matt spilled and Em and I laughed. Setting: In Woodside at my friend's house. Characters: Cindy, Em, and Matt are good friends of mine. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is on the TV show "Home Improvement." Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I was happy talking and playing at my friend's house.
