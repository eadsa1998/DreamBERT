I woke up and Sammy was in the lounge room. Mom made a comment about it being "a week" and was angry. I was playing World of Warcraft and I ran into a camp by mistake and they were level 57's. I tried to run out but couldn't find a way out. I saw a portal for Dalaran and to 'Galaran'. There was some cart thing. Selena and others were there. We had to pull ourselves up and slide along to a path. We let go and someone fell off too early.
