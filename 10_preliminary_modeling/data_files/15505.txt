A guy took his girlfriend and ran off and people were sent after him. Then it was me and this girl. It was night and we were jumping over walls and then it was day. We hid in a university but this cop came. The girl was sleeping and I told her to run. I walked out the door with an American accent and pretended to be someone else, but this guy stopped me and knew I was faking. There was an argument and the girl ran off and I followed her. We went to a park with a 'magical' forest and she was tired and saw elves, which carried her. The guy found us again.
