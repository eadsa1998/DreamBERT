I went to 'school' without my hair straightened. I was playing this game where you pick up sticks in this jungle setting. I was trying to pick the same colours as some friend of mine, hoping we'd get put in a group together. I was then sitting down somewhere with Calvin. Other people were sitting down too. Thuy kept following me and kept giving me some of her "cookie cake", as she called it. I couldn't find my water bottle and Thuy went looking for it. There were holograms. Harlan was being a retard like usual. There were lockers and mine was 22 or 23? Mine was above Jack Nicholson's. I was counting the lockers in weird ways, but kept stuffing up. Ms Rodrigues was there, except she was Bailey (Grey's Anatomy). Harlan found out that I had Myspace and was like "Why the hell do you have one?".
