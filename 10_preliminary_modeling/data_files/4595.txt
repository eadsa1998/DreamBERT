["Howard leaves me, angry."] I am married to Howard, we are in a large 1950's modern house. Lots of windows. Lots of small children around. Including Dovre and the other girls. Howard wants to start up sexual relations again. He gets in my face and insists. He tries to pull down his pants. I am annoyed. I am absolutely not interested. I go away from him. He is very angry and yells at me that he is leaving the relationship. I basically say good! He gets more angry. He packs up and leaves the house. I am relieved. But I regret that he wont be there to help out with the children. Now I have to do it all. I decide that's OK. I can handle that. It's a good trade off. I am fixing breakfast for them. It's messy. I spill things.
