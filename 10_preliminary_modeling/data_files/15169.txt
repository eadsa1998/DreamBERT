I was signing up to be a volunteer at Comic-Con. I was looking for Summer Glau on the list, but then I remembered it was Morena Baccarin coming. It started at 4.50pm. I chose the time slots for volunteering and some were already taken, but I picked ones around Morena's appearances so I would get to leave right after with a few little breaks.
