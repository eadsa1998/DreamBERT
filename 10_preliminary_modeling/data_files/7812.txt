I was in an office building at KATC, in a classroom. I was sitting in one of the seats listening to someone talk. I was making notes about dreams. This man and I were the only people in the room. I thought this was going to be a good room for me to use to teach. The man closed a window and I thought, that it will be nice that I can open the windows for the students for whatever reason. I was outside the building now with several people. Three of them were the final two survivors and the man who comes on for challenges and tribal meetings. One of the final survivors was Andy Williams. The other one was Colby. Someone said something about what if something happened to the host. Then one of the final two would have to fill that role as well. We were talking to Andy because Colby was asleep. We were simultaneously on the island and in the parking lot at the same time. Andy decided he would win by cutting Colby's hand off while he was sleeping. I didn't think he was serious until I saw him put this huge knife to Colby's wrist. I started screaming and saying, oh my God. He did it. Oh my God. He did it. I started to run but didn't know where to run. I saw alligator's in the water. I was covering my ears and partially covering my eyes. I just wanted to get away from this.
