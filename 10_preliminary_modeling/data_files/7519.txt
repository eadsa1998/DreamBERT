I am in my apartment, preparing to receive guests. We're going to play bridge and I'm busy putting up the bridge table and doing other preparatory things. I am a bit late and hurrying to get things done. The layout of my apartment is odd. It's OK in the dream, but after I woke up I realize the apartment had a strange layout, i.e., I had to go out into the apartment hallway in order to get to another room in my apartment unit. When I go into the hallway, on my way to another room, Mary gets off the elevator. Mary is wearing a yellow sweater and black stretch pants. The sweater does not flatter her -- it makes her appear pale. But I'm delighted to see her. I'm joyfully surprised because she is not one of the guests that I'm expecting. I rush over to her, embrace and kiss her. But she is aloof. I ask her if she isn't going to kiss me. She tells me if that's what I want, then she'll kiss me. I become annoyed and testy and say that if I have to ask her to kiss me, it's not worth it. Then I see that she is holding Adam in her arms. He is about 4 or 5 years old and has just awakened from a sleep.
