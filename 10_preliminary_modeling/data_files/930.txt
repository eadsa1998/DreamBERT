I am a teacher at a grade school. A man teacher follows me around teasing me to be in a puppet show (hand held puppets that are so heavy you wear part of it). He's funny and I keep laughing. He won't let me alone, so I'm laughing and saying no and telling him to go away. Then I reluctantly agree to do it. I play a lady horse. The wire and cardboard on my arm is very heavy. I sashay around and sing and shinny. I'm very funny. The guy is aggressive, sharp-witted and persistent. He likes me but it's overwhelming.
