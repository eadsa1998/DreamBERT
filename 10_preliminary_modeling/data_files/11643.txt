I and several other people were in a large field. The only other person I recognized was a colored boy who was in my high school class six years ago. (I haven't seen him since.) All of a sudden he started to run from me and I threw a long metal rod at him and missed him. (It seems that at the time I was glad that I missed him.) The next moment I was on our third floor at home. I heard him coming up the stairs and I attempted to hide in a small closet. (There is really no small closet on our third floor.) However I didn't get hidden in time and he came right up to me and shook my hand and smiled.
