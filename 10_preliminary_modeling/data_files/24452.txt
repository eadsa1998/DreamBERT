I am on another planet, caught up in a war. I am hiding in a cave. Attacking soldiers find me. The first one shoots me point blank; his rifle misfires. The second aims and shoots just as the atmosphere begins to freeze. It forms a protective shield in front of me. The bullet punctures the ice, then falls to the floor. The solider outside suffocates from lack of air. I am next, but the dream changes. A civilization on another planet is in the act of committing suicide. Soldiers have paired off in rows, they are separated one from the next pair by ten or fifteen meters. The distance between two soldiers is twenty or thirty meters. Armed soldiers advance against their unarmed partner. I am not paired up, but caught up in the fray and in immediate danger of being shot. Recollection becomes unclear at this point. I wake up anxious.
