I was watching the Come on Eileen music video. People were getting killed on this stage thing. Mom was getting a game for the Xbox 360 from the shop. It looked cool, but she was like "you're not allowed to play until I'm done". Darren bought chocolate and he gave me the one with nuts. I ate some while watching a movie. I realized I had eaten 25 rows and I was upset because I was still on my diet.
