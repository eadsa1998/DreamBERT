We had gone to a lecture, but previously we had made plans for it sensing that there would be disturbances. That is the way it was because the man we were afraid of came into the room and got out right away and left us amazed. We took advantage of the fact he was out to lock the doors, but once they were locked, some classmates knocked on the door and asked us to let them in. In that group there was a girl with revolutionary ideas and quite determined. We had taken those precautions because that man was already well known as an outside agitator, an upriser. He knew karate and judo and he had a group of accomplices to carry out his plans for the riot. We really were very few and could not put up a defense and that is why we took the precautions because we especially had to protect the lecturer, so we locked the doors.
