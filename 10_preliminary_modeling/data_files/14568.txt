I was at a school. I was with Autumn and Evelyn. I went off with Autumn and she was being all religious-y and good. I went into a classroom and went to do something and I realized the teacher was in the class (a lady) and I moved and sat on some chairs at the back of the class. They were close to two filing cabinets and other stuff. I moved to the front to fight? I pushed a desk and it hit a desk with a coffee on it. I did something that I can't read and then moved. The teacher complained and I said something back to her and we left. Our class was somewhere with Mr Reilly. Then we were inside the class and it was shop-like. I had 'broken' a chair and threw it. I was with Calvin and he was watching. Mr Reilly said the chair broke all the time and it was hard to hear him. He came to me and Autumn and asked what school we went to and we said "university". He said to not feel bad if we were the worst because we'd do better at something else. Her name was Jordan or something and my name rhymed with it. I said that I never noticed that before. There was a group of people for the Westland thing. There were two girls called Eevee and a black girl. There was a house and this lady was doing a tour. She said to "look at the ceiling and the fireplace". We went upstairs. Then it was a movie/TV show. Kenny Hotz didn't want people to know he was poor and from a poor area. Someone told these guys and they said to not worry about it. Then it showed Kenny like 'ok...'. But they came after him and these other bad guys. Then these guys took over the house. I was outside with Ezra. I forgot the names of the characters in some show and I said "why do I have to remember so many names?" and I mentioned Jack from Lost. There was a party in a house. There was a caterpillar on my foot and I called it a "moo cow caterpillar". I got to the front door and I was worried it was something gross so I flicked it into a plant pot.
