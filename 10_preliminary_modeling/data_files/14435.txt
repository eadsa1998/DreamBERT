I was at Mom's. Ezra and I were doing some computer thing with two of his mates; it was a puzzle game thing. It was hard, and Ezra kept shaking me and distracting me and I got a bad score. I went to dads and he did the game too? My thumbs were hurting, and I tried again and still failed. Ezra was watching channel V on TV. I was trying to fix the cord at the back of the TV. Then all these maggots showed all down the screen. I looked at the back of the TV and there was a big pile of maggots there. Dad grabbed a handful of them and chased me with them. I ran into my room, which was clean. He threw them at me. Tigger had kittens and they were on my bed. I was wondering how she had any, since she was sterilized. There was a cute orange and white one. There were some under a blanket in the cupboard. Tinkerbell had kittens too. There was a Smudgy looking one and a big one. There were some puppies too and they were quite cute.
