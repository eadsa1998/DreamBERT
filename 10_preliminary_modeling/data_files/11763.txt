Ezra and I were in the water. The only way to get out was to get over this platform, under which an octopus/squid lived under. We kept trying to get on the platform, but the squid thing kept coming out. It grabbed me and pulled me under and I couldn't breathe. I got up onto the platform and the squid thing bit me on the right side of my hip. I jumped up and got fully out of the water. [When I woke up, it hurt where it had bit me].
