Some one was injured. A child or a friend who was disabled. I was upset and frantic to find her. Minister had a speech problem. The angrier he got, the more he lisped and couldn't speak. He called on the phone to find out where the child was taken. We walked down a sidewalk. He said, "She was taken to the Monastery. Can you handle it?" I was explaining to him that I am a chameleon. "I have one basic personality but I blend in comfortably with lots of different people types." I said, "I can feel comfortable and make them comfortable, about Roman Catholics and about being conservative." He looked at me. "You are conservative." He said. I was startled that he knew. "How did you know?" I said. Then we're at a big palace, his home. People were talking about me behind my back. I awoke with the phrase, "A cripple for a Queen," being whispered. The minister was apparently the King of England.
