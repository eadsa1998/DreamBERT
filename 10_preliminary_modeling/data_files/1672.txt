I am holding a baby and we are at the ocean. The waves go way far back and roll up to where we are. I hold the baby and she leans back, submersing her face under water, and holding her breath. I am very proud of her and say, "Look Dwight, how she holds her breath and doesn't choke on the water." We get up out of the water. Dwight has gone on ahead. An inspector comes up and wants information about Dwight. We go to the pickup and he looks around. I say, "You won't find anything." He gets in the driver's seat and as he is driving, I calmly tell him, "We don't have any brakes, you know." He pumps the brakes and sure enough there aren't any. He drives up a grassy hill, telling the cars on the freeway to the left, "Look out, boys." They aren't helpful.
