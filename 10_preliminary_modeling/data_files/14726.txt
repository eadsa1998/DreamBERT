Dad had downloaded a bunch of educational stuff. He and Ezra were going to read it all. They started with human biology and I said "you'll know everything I know". Later I was at home and Ezra came into my room. I had Tigger. He pulled my door to when he left. I said 'thanks' and he looked shocked and then said something polite in return.
