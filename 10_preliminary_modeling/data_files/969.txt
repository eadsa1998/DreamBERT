Darryl calls me up. He's sick and needs help. I tell him a friend is coming to him right now. We talk. I then remember to ask him, almost as an after thought, "Should I send an ambulance?" He says, "Yes." I ask directions to his house. He says, "Up the hill, turn right on the electronics side of the building." I say, "Don't worry, it's on its way." I get in my pickup truck and drive to the hospital to meet him. I get there. Chuck drives himself to the hospital in a bright red VW bug. He looks sheepish because he didn't wait for the ambulance. We are leaning out of our car windows talking. He says he used to work for an ambulance and therefore was embarrassed to use it. He looks for a place to park. I realize I'm in his parking space but don't move. A car in front of me leaves and he parks there.
