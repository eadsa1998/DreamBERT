I had a dream about reliving a day at school. The people I remember in it are my boy friend and his/my friend and a good friend of mine who's a girl. We were at my locker and I was talking to my boy friend and our other two friends. I don't really remember what we were talking about, but it was a pleasant dream and I woke up feeling happy inside.
