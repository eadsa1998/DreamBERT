I was at school. I went into the library for form but it was different. Eugene was in my form and he sat in the seat next to me (we were sitting at computers). Calvin saw and pointed. Autumn was there. There was an announcement for physics students to go to the office and get something. Eugene and someone went to get one for everyone. Silas was handing out road map books. He asked me to describe A Clockwork Orange. I was saying that the future was 'bleak' and technology was really good. Then I was thinking about the movie (but it was totally different with different people in it) and the main guy's house had all these moving things in it. I did media. Mr Billings told us to make a movie and I was trying to plan it, but no-one in my group was interested.
