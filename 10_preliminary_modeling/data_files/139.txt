       Later, at my grandfather's house: I've come with some people (those others above?) to the street where my grandparents used to live and seen that it's changed a lot. There's a kind of upscale look to the neighborhood and there's a small lake behind some of the houses. I go sit on the back step and see that the lake is right up next to the yard and into it a little. Then I notice with a start that there are buildings in the back yard. No, it's not buildings in it, it's the backs of some condos jutting into the yard. Someone must have sold off part of the back yard and those places are using it crosswise as their back yard. I'm sorry - the end of an era and all that - it's not as nice as it used to be - all this artificial fun (the lake, boats, and all) and artificial class (the condos). Then I'm in my bedroom waiting for Lori. I hear flute music and it gets louder and I realize it must be her, coming up the stairs, though I can't hear the steps creak. I didn't know she'd learned to play the flute (or pipes) and wonder if she'd just learned and I figure she's playing them up the stairs to announce her arrival, like Lyn does. I'm going into the living room to let her in, and I can just see her head and shoulders through the window - she's wearing a cloak with hood, which is up - she looks different. But the music doesn't seem to be coming from outside and I look around. Then I can't see Lori any more - I can't see anybody outside. That bothers me, and I go to draw the curtains. They have drawstrings now, but I can't get them to work. I can't get one to go across without the other. The music is still going on.
