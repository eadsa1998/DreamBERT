I was looking out an upstairs window of the agency with Sonia Hamlin and I kissed her on the cheek.  She gently drew away, reprimanding me.  I was slightly embarrassed, but was able to change the subject by noticing several houses which were on fire and point them out to her.  Then it seemed we were on a bus or train or something, because the houses passed out of sight.
