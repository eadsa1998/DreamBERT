I was riding a bus with a female acquaintance -- from high school, I think -- possibly Nellie O'Riley but more attractive-who was more familiar with the bus route than I was.  She was giving me advice as to how much the fare was or where to get off or something-probably the former, since I made my way back to the driver to give him my fare.  He said 50 cents, and I fumbled with my change with one hand until I got two quarters isolated and dropped them into the fare box.  Then I made my way back to the rear of the bus, where my friend was seated on the rear seat.  There was just enough space left, and I squeezed in next to her.  Now that I think about it, I think it was Anne Panelli rather than Nellie O'Riley.  I think I even remember her name being mentioned somewhere in the dream.
