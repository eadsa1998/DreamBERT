I dreamed that I was part of a cast of dancers and singers in a show starring Tony Martin and wife, Cyd Charisse. After one performance some men and I went to Higbee's for dinner, only the restaurant wasn't really that of Higbee's. One of the men (who was my baby doctor) told me to get a job selling at Higbees, but I was very indignant when I told him I was a college graduate and wouldn't sell at Higbees. Then we returned to the scene of the show and bunch of girls and I were in a bedroom or dressing room. Tony Martin and his wife came in and Mrs. Martin had dull red hair and red lipstick on. Mr. Martin's hair was coal-black and I told him her really shouldn't bleach his hair black because men with gray hair, especially those gray at the temples, were very distinguished looking.
