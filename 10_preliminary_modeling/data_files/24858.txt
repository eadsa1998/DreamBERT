I was in an orange and I couldn't breathe. I tried to but I only could drink the orange juice, although it tasted good I still couldn't breathe. I finally got to a place where I could breathe but the orange started moving so I lost my place. I was suddenly outside of the orange watching a clown juggle my orange. He was also juggling a mirror and a remote control. Setting: In an orange, and outside the orange. Characters: Me (also a clown, but I didn't recognize him as someone I knew). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I'm not sure. It was weird.
