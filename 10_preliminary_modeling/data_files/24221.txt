Sue, the co-worker from my college newspaper I was attracted to, lived with her parents in the town where we went to college even though she's really from another town. I went over there after class to then go out to lunch with her. We were about to leave, then her boyfriend came over. She made fun of him for being shorter than me. Put her arms around him, then put her arms around my neck to see which embrace felt more natural. She was having trouble in economics, with a new professor. I wondered to myself why she was doing this.
