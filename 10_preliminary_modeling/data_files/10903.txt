I was in Mather administration building, but it resembled my high school somewhat. I recognized a girl coming down the hall as a girl my boyfriend used to date. She went up to him and asked him to carry a load of books for her. They went into a room nearby, but I could still hear them. She asked him to a dance and he finally accepted. He came and told me about it and I said we were all through. He was very upset and confused, so I turned and left him.
