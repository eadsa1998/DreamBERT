 There are octopi eating other dead octopi on or near the shore of the ocean. I'm swimming in the ocean in the shallow water near shore. Several small octopi eat a larger dead one. In another situation, they don't eat a dead octopus, though they are all around it. I swim with others towards shore. There are many round wood pillars submerged in the water. I swim above them touching their tops as I swim over them. I avoid something, which may be an octopus, as I go to shore, and climb out of the water quickly. I walk up to a restaurant or building while I dry off with a towel. My high school friend Tammy Jostens walks out of the building on her way to a parked car. I recognize her though I haven't seen her in years, and I say, "Tammy". She turns and knows it is I. She says hi but continues on with her life, not interested in talking to me. She goes into a care with other black people. I think she is more comfortable with them, and doesn't want to see me.
