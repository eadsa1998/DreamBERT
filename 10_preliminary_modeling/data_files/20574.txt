There was a blind on the floor, and my mother said to put it back on the window. There was an artificial clump of bushes nearby with stuffed animals next to them. One was a tiger. I went up to one of the bushes and it seemed alive. Then I saw some live squirrels behind it. A web wrapped around me. It came from the bush.
