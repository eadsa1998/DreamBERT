I dreamed that one of my buddies who was in the army was wounded in action in Korea. When he came home he found out that I was engaged to the girl he used to go with. He had one arm shot off, one eye out and his right leg was cut off at the knee. He said that he had been cut down by a mortar shell. After finding out that I was going with his girl he killed himself. The whole town thought it was my fault because I was going with his girl. After this the girl and myself broke up. The next day I was drafted into the army and after my training I was sent to Korea where I got shot up in the same way as my buddy that got killed. This is where my dream ended.
