Dream about starting school. I was looking for a locker to put my padlock on. I kept trying to put the lock on but then it would turn out that the lockers were all connected -- one door would open all the doors of the row. I wasn't sure where to put my locker -- I was thinking that maybe it would be more convenient to have it in the psychology building because most of my classes would be there. Then I was with Lisa and some woman. It was the last semester for all of us. Lisa dropped me off by some lockers near an athletic field. There was a chain-link fence. It was on the outskirts of campus. These lockers didn't work either and I was worried that I didn't know how to get to the other school I needed to go to. I had to attend kindergarten and get through primary and high school, even though I was almost through with college -- I had to make up what I missed. I thought that my experience as an art teacher's assistant would help me. I hoped I would get to do a lot of art. I didn't like the class. I went into the hall and tried to explain my situation to a woman. She thought I was only 9 years old. I said, "No, I'm 34." I was frustrated.
