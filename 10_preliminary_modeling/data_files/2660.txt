I'm walking down a hall, going to a meeting. The meeting is in a room where students lounge. It's crowded and noisy, so we decide to move to a meeting room at the men's PE building. I get up and start walking there. I'm wearing my Katrina birthday outfit. I see 25 dollar bills clinging to my skirt. I pick them up and see money lying on the floor and pick that up. It might be $80.00. I can't tell and I decide to keep it, even though I feel dishonest and worry that the student who lost it will need it and will be miserable about it. I see Mateo who is still 8 or 9 or 12 years old, but he's taller than I am and I think about kissing him like I would a man, but feel guilty and dishonest so I don't. He wants me to visit his classroom. I'm in a hurry, but agree and follow him. He sits and I sit in a back row and wave to him. I listen for a minute as his student teacher is unorganized and then I signal to him that I have to go. I see how fat he is and feel sorry for him. I walk down the halls and see a young woman, disabled, seated on the floor with her dig in harness. She says, "Hi, you and Sebastian were great." (We played in a band together.) I say, "Sebastian's my cousin." She says, "I know." She knows Bonnie also. Then she tries to pick up her dog and says annoyed, "He always thinks I'm going to pet him when I do this." I go on. I find the men's PE room which is under the stage. Jerome says, "You guys aren't going to throw us out, are you? This is a meeting about student success." I sit on a couch and take a moment to look at the money I found. It's 500 dollars, but it's in traveler's checks made out to Morris _____ from British Columbia. I realize with relief I can't keep it and I'm now concerned about how to get to the lost and found office to return it before it closes at 5:00. Our meeting will last until 5:00 and the student will be very worried.
