I was looking at the selections of the daily double and I saw 5-3, then I moved over and looked at it closer and it seemed to change to 3-4. I think it also changed to 5-1. We were walking in the country. We walked into a field and there was a plum orchard. Couple of my friends took some plums and the farmer ran around the fence and was throwing plums at them.
