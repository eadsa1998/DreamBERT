["Weird bugs; weird men."] I am standing outside talking with the local TV weatherman. He is extremely tall and I tip back my head to be able to see him. He asks me what I do. I list Counseling, writing, and then I list types of things I'd written like 1 novel, lots of plays, poetry, etc. I tell him I performed. Then I remember I teach. I taught the 3rd grade. I say. I hope he is impressed. He says he is busy right now but would I sit in the cafe and wait for him there. I agree. We go into a cafe. I sit at a table alone. As I sit there, another man at another table watches me. Another man walks over to talk. I decide the man at the table is a red neck and the one talking to me is very good looking but not very intelligent. I decide he's be OK as a Shakespearean actor. I feel conspicuous and uncomfortable. Suddenly I see a big ugly cockroach walking across my table. I am disgusted and nervous. Then I see a huge bug with very elaborate antenna curling above and around him. I stand up, moving away from the table hurriedly. I feel squeamish. A woman waiter comes over and ridicules me for being afraid. She sys its just a squirrel. I get very angry at her and punch her out. We fight, rolling around on the floor. Now I leave and rush home. Charla is there. We go in and I look around, afraid I will see more of these bugs. I see a sort of ordinary cockroach or black bug on the wall. I peer anxiously up at the ceilings, afraid they will drop down on me.
