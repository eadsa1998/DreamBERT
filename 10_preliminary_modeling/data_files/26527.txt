 I'm on ice and snow with a snowmobile. The ice is a lake. I think I could fall through: the ice is thin. I'm worried. I move slowly and cautiously. I'm in the field to the west of my friend's, the Ramos', property where we deer hunt. I am not able to get up. My friends Norman Noman and Hank Anderson are there, walking along the fence line. I yell for help. They say it is just hard to get up. Norman has a small bow and some arrows. I shoot at something and come close, but don't hit it. I say if it were a deer, I'd have hit it. There are cows in a pasture near where Jose Ramos' deer stand is.
