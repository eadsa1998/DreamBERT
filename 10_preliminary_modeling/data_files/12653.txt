I was at a Royal Show place. I was looking for a friend. I went into a shop and was looking down the aisles. Some guy looked like Daryl. I went to the toilet. Classmate-F-16 was in there and she asked me what happened to Roger Moore. I said "I don't even know who that is". I left. Calvin was there and we were walking. I found this thing I made years ago. People had to throw in one thing of theirs. I had written an introduction and stuff about Terrence was in it. Someone had crossed out my name and had put Kyle. I accidentally got rid of it all and rewrote it.
