I was going to get a babysitter for the girls for the night so I could go to work. I walked in a restaurant to use a phone and I hear a man's voice, loud and angry. I looked and it's my dad. He's at a table with two of my aunts and uncles and he's reaching under the table with his fist drawn back. I rushed over and said, "Hi, Dad!" This distracted him. A little boy came out from under the table and I told him he'd better sit down and be quiet. My dad was obviously drunk.
