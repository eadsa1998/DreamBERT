 I'm in a cabin which has two rooms that are separated by a wall. The room I am in has a door leading outside. The other room has a door connecting it to the room I am in. I wonder if my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is staying in the other room. I looked through the windows earlier but didn't see her. Now there are more people there. I look, and Annie is there. I am excited and nervous to see her. I want to make a good impression. I really want to see her. She is in a class in the room. A woman from my economics class named Tamiska and Zack Morris from Saved By The Bell are in the class also. I want to knock on the door, but she is in class, so I don't. I have a bed in the room I am in. I could wait and see her in the morning, because she has to come out of the room sometime, but then I might be sleeping when she comes out.
