There were bees in the house.  I was going upstairs to look at Legos displays.  I went home on a 3-story bus.  Had to climb up on the outside.  My best friend Emma was there.  We went to the first floor of the bus.  My former friend Jenna passed barbecue chips to me, and I passed them to Emma.  They came around again and I took one.  We finally got back up to campus after a long drive.  Everyone got off but I stayed and talked to the driver.  He asked about the air conditioning and indeed it was uncomfortable on the way home.  I ate ice cream with my fingers while we talked.  I got off the bus in a big grassy field like at summer camp.
