We had seen pictures of some snowy place in Switzerland so had gone to the place in the picture. Then I knew Alexander Skarsgard and we had sex. It was very vivid and he was on top of me and close to me and going slow. It was my first time. I also knew Benjamin and I was thinking that I felt like I was kind of betraying him. Mom had to get a passport for her course and they asked me about my holiday and I said I had passports for two countries. I was part of some secret thing. There was an elevator that went really fast and you had to rate your experience before going down. If you chose something wrong it could sometimes go wrong and you could be killed. One day this guy was near it, eating and it hit a 7, so had heaps of time. This guy was Scottish and we got talking and joking about the guy eating near the elevator was spooky.
