I was having a birthday party and my friends started to arrive at my house. But before I knew it there were hundreds of people in my house who I didn't know. I was trying to get them to leave, but it was so crazy and there were just too many of them. My mom was going insane because the house was getting trashed, but my friends weren't helping, they were just partying away. Setting: At my house. Characters: All my friends from school, my mom, and hundreds of other strangers, mostly adults. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, frustrated. I just read an article about how parties can get out of hand, and my birthday is tomorrow and I'm planning a party.
