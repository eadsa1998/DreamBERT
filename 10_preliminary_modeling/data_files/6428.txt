I remember driving on a country road in winter. We're in the Rockies and it's very dangerous. I almost get hit a few times. I park my car and walk for about four miles until I get to the place where the "concert" is supposed to be. It's this huge snowy field. I go out into the middle and look for Laura. No Laura. Eventually a wall grows up around the sides and the people begin to chant the performer's name. I realize that Rhonda is with me now. She changes into Laura and then Laura changes back into Rhonda. She keeps oscillating this way as they chant. By now there's literally millions of people in the auditorium, and I'm up near the front. Then the announcement: no performance. The people immediately stop chanting and crush out the door. We get trampled. <br/
