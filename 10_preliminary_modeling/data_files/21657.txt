I was in John Bicon's house. He lived up high on a dump. I looked thru the window and said, "You sure are living high." He was planning on having a fence built around his home. There was one part of the way. My sisters were setting and had the tables set with food for some kind of party or wedding for someone. Marty was up in John's house also. I had 4 horses from 1 to 5 written down and wanted to know which horses would win, and I heard or said S. 4 and I seemed to come to me.
