I was playing a zombie game except it was playing out in real life and went back and forth between a game and real life. I was at a college type place in a library or gathering area. I walked to the front door and saw a person all zombied with like teeth showing and bloodied and didn't look like a movie zombie, but an 'actual' zombie. I ran and went down some stairs and zombie action started happening up there and people were getting bit and killed and I ran into a hall and ducked into the toilet, then it was a game and I was crouching in a cubicle and I was thinking of Stalled. The door to the toilet had a gap and a zombie face appeared underneath snarling and wouldn't go away. I thought it was a glitch so I restarted. The next time I with another girl called Maree and she was one of the main characters and had either lost a child or had an abortion and was haunted by the memory of the child (a girl). We ran into the girl toilets this time as it said there were levels in there but all the cubicles were locked and we went into an open one but it wasn't really a cubicle and had room for zombies to get in. I put my feet up on one side of the wall of the cubicle and lifted myself up with my back on the other side.  One came in and I paused the game and went to customize where you could edit the look of the characters etc. The option I selected caused the zombie to leave when I pressed play. Another time I reset I play ed as Maree and she was underwater but not, climbing up this ladder thing where it showed zombies next to her in another pipe climbing. It was very quiet and ambient and creepy. Then she swam through this underwater room. Then she was in a room which like had destroyed stuff and grass and puddles. I heard the zombies coming and ran through the door into the next area.
