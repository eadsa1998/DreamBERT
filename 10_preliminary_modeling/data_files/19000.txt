In this dream I was observing this girl that I have been dating for about the last 6 months. She was in some kind of a play, I think it was a musical. It was kind of a happy thing, and she was dancing around, going from one side of the stage to the other. Another thing that I was noticing about her when she was dancing around is her legs, which are beautiful. They were particularly beautiful when I was looking at her. They were sort of a main focal point of my eyes. <br/
