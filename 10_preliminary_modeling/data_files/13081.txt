I was at school. The day before, we'd been given a list of the Top 250 on IMDb. I had scribbled on mine and the next day we were told it was required, so I asked Ms Newberry for another one. I was watching 28 Days Later... and Cillian Murphy looked like a cross between Tom Welling and Ian Somerhalder.
