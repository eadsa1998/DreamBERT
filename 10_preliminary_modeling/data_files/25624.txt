 I'm on the Spirit of Tasmania ferry with my friend Niles Zelling. Each of us recalls a dream. We plan on interpreting the dreams together. Someone else and I each grab a bag of cans to take to room F. Then we are on a bus or a plane. I see some open seats so I go there and lie down, but I can't get comfortable. I move because people come to sit in the seats I am laying in. My boss Carly Lunch is there.
