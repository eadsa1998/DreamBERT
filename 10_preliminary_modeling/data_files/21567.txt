We cut a hole though some wood top that we thought was covering a secret in India. Indians were lined up with their bows and arrows. They let go with the arrows and then ran in flight and the arrows missed us and we kept on running. We climbed up and over buildings till at last we were safe in some friends' home. We had a dog. He started to urinate at night. I took down on the pail and held my hand over cause it was splashing out. She urinated till the pail was full.
