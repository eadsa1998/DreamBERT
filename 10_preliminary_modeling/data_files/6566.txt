Coming with R. to Fargo. Begin to unpack. There are two closets and two wardrobes. R. uses three leaving me only one closet. I object. We had been asleep and wakened. R. having begun to unpack the night before. See clearly rug and paper of my present room. Much confusion of furniture. Again displeased because R. has taken desk with desk lamps. Miss. La comes in. I call her attention to room so much nicer than we were here before. Try to move furniture about. R. says to wait for Jo. She remarks she doesn't want other relatives to visit. I object. Call to supper. Mother says to hurry. Down long confused stairway. (Strong emotional tone throughout.)
