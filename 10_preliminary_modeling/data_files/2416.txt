Lydia has a restaurant and I'm helping her out. It's crowded and she's overwhelmed. I ask, "What do I need to do?" She says, "Wait on tables." I do. There is a snooty couple that I don't like that I wait on. Somewhere in the dream there is a baby girl I take care of. I change her diapers and talk with her. This is somewhere in the beautiful mountains, maybe in a Rocky Mountain state. I ask if the new train route can be got from S City, no, from the Coast, N City. Now it's near the end of the day, about 5:00 and I have a few "set ups" to do for reserved. special requests. The instructions are written on the placemats. The first is an airline pilot. He needs a glass of water at table 63A. He likes to be called by his name. Another is a couple who pay by Visa. I add up their bill and it comes to $1,000 dollars. We have to give $100 change and Lydia is concerned it's a scam with a bad Visa to get cash. Then I go to a young man's table. I lay down on the grass in front of it and hug the grass lovingly. This is a way of telling him I understand and accept his beliefs. He responds by hugging the meadow grass on his side. We talk. He asks me out, says he'd take me to town if I wanted, after work. I accept, and confess I'd like to see some of the tourist thing like the Paul Bunyan monument. He grimaces, but agrees. I have one more table set up, for a prom. Another woman says, "It's going to be hard." I take a pretty blue cloth that has velcro across the top and try to get it to evenly cover a board. It won't go on evenly. I keep trying. Then a blue pin (see drawing) [square] sort of a square (see drawing) triangle. It makes a hole in the lovely cloth. I feel frustrated.
