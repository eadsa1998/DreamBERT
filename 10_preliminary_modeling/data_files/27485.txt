I saw a big house on top of a hill. It had great big glass windows with no curtains at the windows. As I went up the hill, I was wondering why there were no curtains. Then I went inside. There was a man (about middle-aged) who lived in this house. He was very ominous-looking. He had dark hair and a heavy mustache. Many young girls (about 20 years of age) lived in this house. The man seemed to dominate all the girls. He painted all the time. Maybe he used the girls as models. They would do whatever he said. The man reminded me of Orson Welles. The furniture in this house was oversized--extremely large. I disliked the man intensely.
