["Registering for classes."] I am at a college, standing outside the building in a long line. It is time for registration. The doors open and the people rush in, I manage to be third in line and would like to be first because I only have a quick question. But I am asked by the woman teacher to wait over at another table. I sit and wait, watching the masses of students milling around frantically trying to get registered. I wait a long time. Finally it is my turn. I try to ask my question but the words are confusing and I am frustrated, Now I go to another room. I am looking through cupboards and seeing food things people had brought. I see three different kinds of bread. Nothing I am too interested in eating. I decide this isn't the right place for me. Lots of milling students. I ask a woman there something. She shows me a weird expanding cane, walker. She suggests I use that. I say it's too big and complicated. Then she shows me a more regular cane, I hold it backwards, She shows me the "right" way to hold it. I walk a few steps. Every time the cane touches the floor with a tap it is echoed through the clock. I say this doesn't work for me. I decide to leave the classroom. I go the bookstore. I am thinking of taking some classes and want to see what the books would be and how much they will cost. I am in a corner of the bookstore looking a shelves of books. Math books, science fiction. I almost buy some and then frustrated, I put them back. I feel really upset because I remember I've done this a number of times, taken classes and then not finishing them. A frequent dream motif but it feels so real I wonder unhappily if I've really done it again. I find one class in linguistics and am genuinely interested, thinking it would be a good class to take. I look at the description a weird word, looking something like division department or something. It would be too slow and tiring.
