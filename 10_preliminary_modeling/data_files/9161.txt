The main scenario kept repeating. It seems that everyone, or maybe just some of us, knew it was going to keep repeating, though we didn't realize it was a dream. Certain elements would change each time. Sometimes things would change because people would choose to do things differently than they did the last time. The basis for the choices varied between personal reasons, right and wrong, good and bad, socially acceptable or not, and morals and ethics. Most of the choices seemed to be about relationships or the choices were made recognizing the impact on some relationships or to avoid impact on some relationships. At times, it wasn't until after the fact that the impact on someone else was brought to someone's attention. Sometimes this resulted in them choosing differently the next time and others times the same choices were made. At least once the choice was simply to have a different attitude. Following that, the people involved were discussing how positively it impacted the entire scenario - something that was considered threatening, a monster, was now non-threatening and helpful. The entire planet was being wiped out by water in a flood type event. The water was dark, murky, and muddy. All of the survivors, most of the time, seemed to be on one ship.
