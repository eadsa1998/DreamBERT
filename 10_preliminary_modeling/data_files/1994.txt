Howard and I are at a graduation. We are seated in the audience several rows from the front. I look up the aisle and see the aqua green-gowned graduates walking down the aisle. I shake hands with one and talk with another. He introduces his wife. She sits in front of me. He says, "I'm finally graduating." I say, "I graduated several years ago." Then I notice our seats are changing into a bus and the wife is a bus driver and I say, "Wait. We had good seats. I don't want to go." She ignores me. I feel kidnapped. I feel annoyed. I look out the window and see huge hologram-like pictures or maybe the figures are giant balloons. One figure is a gorilla with a woman dressed like in the circus sliding out of his mouth. Another figure was a woman/bee hanging in the sky (shades of Macy's Parade). A third group are like Amazon women fighting something. I comment, "Tough neighborhood we're in." It's an understatement. I see the freeway stretch out before me. Howard and I are talking and it develops into an argument. He says, "Why do you get upset and hysterical over little things like 'the wood in the morning?'" I say, frustrated, "Because you don't listen to me." He interrupts and I put my fingers on his lips and say, "Shut up and listen to me." I sound hysterical like he'd described. Howard looks like he's laughing at me.
