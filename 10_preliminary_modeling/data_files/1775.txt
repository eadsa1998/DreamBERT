Arthur and I are in a room with other people. A woman is giving him a massage. He looks over at me and smiles warmly. He says the massage is good, but he remembers better ones, meaning mine from the past. Later, I am sleeping and he comes over and kisses me gently on the face. I pretend to be asleep. He knows I'm pretending. I murmur gently because it feels nice. Someone comes in and says, "Look at that plane!" I go to the door and see white powdery stuff coming out of the sky. Nuclear radiation. I stay under the porch roof. A man comes in; his face is covered with this stuff. We are concerned. He comes in and we help him wash it off. We hope he doesn't die from it.
