I fixed my plate with rice and meat paste then began to play cards. One person was missing. "Whose turn?" I am No. 8 so it must be one's. "She's gone." A baby calls her mother. "You play this hand and I'll take her turn next." The older woman sits down and begins to shuffle cards, two decks together. I call her attention to that and go to look for my plate. Can't find it in the refrigerator. Take out a slice of cold ham. Hear some one say she wasn't a star so I remind her that when she and I got ready together, she combed my hair.
