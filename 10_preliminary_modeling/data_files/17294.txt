There was a competition at my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  Something of volleyball at first, and I was the line judge.  My mother's uncle Bert and my brother Stuart were said to be dead.  It turned into Mission Impossible- search the rooms before the other team.  Something happened upstairs, and I was Sam Beckett, I guess.  I remember clouds.
