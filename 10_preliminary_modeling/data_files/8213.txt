I was at the SAID conference. There was going to be a parade. I was headed to the place where I was going to help create a float. I was wondering where everyone else, where all the other groups or organizations were creating their floats. The people who were showing up later to work on our float didn't even know what the people who started it intended for it to be. Then we were having a race in a swimming pool. We weren't swimming. We were in small rafts about the size of an inner tube because our legs hung over the edge. There was a brass bar all around the inside edge of the pool. When they told us to go I used that bar to help propel me around the pool and stay in the front of everyone. I came in third in my group - they had divided everyone into groups and then the winner from each group was to do the final race. Well, I thought I came in third but when I got out and went to stand in third place they told me I came in fifth. I still knew that I was going to have to compete again because they were going to take the top five of each group to race again. But they didn't. We now have our clothes on and are dressed up. Like most of the other women I had on heels. They told us to line up along the edge of the pool, facing the water. There were too many of us - we extended beyond the end of the pool. So they told some of us to stand on the ledge right inside the edge of the pool. I was one that had to do that. I was very nervous about doing this because of my heels and because the ledge wasn't as wide as my feet were long. I was afraid I was going to fall in so I had my feet angled a bit. I was thinking about the shoes that I was wearing. It seems that I always wear the same pair. I have another pair at home that would have gone very well with my clothes. I thought I should have worn those. I know that Samuel K was there. He was saying something about how to do this more successfully.
