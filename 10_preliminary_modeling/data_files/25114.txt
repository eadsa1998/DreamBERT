 I'm in a house where a party is going to start. It may be Nat Miller's house. My friends Sharon Hearth, Tammy Matthews, Nat Miller, and the red-haired woman from my economics class are there. There is a bunch of older people with little children. The older people leave soon after we get there. There is a window overlooking the back yard. There are four or five crocodiles out back on the lawn. More seem to appear. One or two crocodiles come up right next to the house. They try to smash the window with their heads. One looks like a hippopotamus. We go upstairs. No one has a gun, and we think the crocodiles could have broken in. A kid named Eric and I go down and check it out. We get to the second floor. There is a man and some women with three guns. I get a gun from them. We load our guns. I get a big black revolver. I want a lot of bullets, but I only get three. The bullets are oval, and have two holes in them. (See notebook for sketch). You put the bullet in the gun sideways. We are going to shoot the crocodiles.
