A big gathering at our house; Father Andrew wears a black cassock, is enjoying himself; we all have a great time; As Father Andrew leaves I am holding and hugging a baby (not mine); I help Father Andrew with some silken suspenders over his cassock; we shake hands and he kisses me lightly on the cheek.
