I was a member of a family and the father was the actor Michael Douglas. He had a large butcher's knife. He was trying to kill one or some of us. There was a struggle between him, the mother, the son, and myself. We successfully, or it seems that I successfully knocked the knife out of his hand, and I was trying to get the son to grab the knife but he didn't. The struggle went on. He would get the knife back and we would knock it away from him again.
