I have moved to another house and visit my old house, which now is lived in by Harriet. I see the Saturday newspaper on the porch and I say to her, "I'll take the paper." I pick it up and start to leave. I then realize that it is her paper. She pays for it. So I go back and give it to her, apologizing. I just wasn't thinking. Now I am going to my new place and I go through the college. I ask directions and the young woman says, "You go to the back of the building, take the elevator up to the 4th floor, and then return to the 3rd floor." It seemed an odd, out of the way to go and I only have three minutes to do it in. I start to run, but it is very difficult for me. I end up laying on the sidewalk, pulling myself along. I struggle. I know I won't make it. I'm not sure which path through the fair will get me there the quickest. Some paths meander or dead end. I find a sign and hear circus music and follow that. I get to the elevator area, but now there is a man I am in relationship with and he is playful and loving and wants to have fun and make love, and I laugh and say I have to do these things. I think I am picking up clothes and cleaning things. A little girl like Charla is around somewhere. It will be fun to get the work done and relax into the lovingness of my partner. I look forward to it. He is very desirous of me letting go of the work now and just having fun with him. There are tough guys like bikers somewhere in the background. They like me too.
