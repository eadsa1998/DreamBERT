[1997-06-04] My daughter called home to tell us that our son had spent 100 dollars yesterday that he'd gotten from selling a snake that he'd owned. He actually had owned a snake and it had just been sold, he was supposed to go out and get the money yesterday and in the dream she said that he had spent the hundred dollars because he didn't want to give it to us. And I was saying "what in the world did he spend that much money on? Was it drugs or what was it?" And she said she didn't know.
