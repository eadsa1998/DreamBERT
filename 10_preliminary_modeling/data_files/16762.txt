My guinea pig is thrown or falls all the way down the stairs. I'm surprised she's ok, and runs all the way back upstairs and into her cage. I see a fairly big "scratch" on her body, but I get the feeling she'll be ok. Then I remember being with a group of people from school. Eventually we file into this auditorium and I sit next to somebody, who asks to borrow my watch. Then I go on talking forever about how much easier it is to take the SAT when you have a watch with you. The girl I'm talking to moves back a seat, probably to get away from me.
