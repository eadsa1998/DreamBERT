I was watching Gossip Girl. It was Jenny's birthday. She was going out with Dan and they had an argument the day before. She was sitting on a bed talking to a friend and wondered what he was wearing -- the theme was 'modern love'. She heard a scream and went out to see and Dan was there wearing dreadlocks and normal/baggy clothes. She was angry at him and told him to change. Then I was there with some others and we were just hanging on this 'balcony' up the stairs (inside). The TV was on and this old movie was playing. Her father and a guy were there and I suggested we pull a prank. One of the pranks we sometimes pulled was called the 'oh by the way I'm Elvis'.
