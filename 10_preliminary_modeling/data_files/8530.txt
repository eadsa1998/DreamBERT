I was driving on S.R. 46. Whenever I was on a section of the road that had no homes I was driving about 75 mph. When I came to places where there were homes I slowed down significantly. I realized that there might be cars pulling out of driveways without looking, or more importantly, that there might be children that run out into the road or across the road without looking first. I was out of my car in the grass and was watching two men playing together with their children. Each of them had one child. One child was a boy and the other a girl. They were hiding behind trees, pretending to have guns and pretending to shoot at each other. I found this very disturbing, that men in this day and age would participate in such play activity with their children. The one man and his daughter looked at me as though they wanted me to play along and I refused. I was talking to some other people, one in particular I know was a man. I was talking about something positive about my drive. I was holding a paper cup in my hand. He told me to watch out for something but now I can't remember what. I was skeptical about what he said. I was probably 95% sure that what he said was not true. As I was driving again I encountered what he had warned me about and realized that I should have been more trusting of what he said. It wasn't that big of a deal. It was more like something that was just an inconvenience as opposed to something that would hurt me, upset me, or cause me any kind of significant mental or emotional turmoil.
