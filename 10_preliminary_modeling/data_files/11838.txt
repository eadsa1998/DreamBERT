I was at some place with Christopher Ryan and Adam Levine and some strange girl. Chris and I liked each other, and Adam liked me, but I thought that Chris liked the girl (I think she was called Christine). Chris, Adam and I were at a pub. Chris kept looking at me and when I looked at him, Adam got annoyed and left. Were somewhere else then and Chris and I were fighting about Christine, so I stormed off and ended up at the pub and I said "Now, she'll turn up here" and she did. So I went to leave, but I punched her (not slow!) and went to this beach type place near some water that was rumoured to be home to an evil fish. I sat down at the edge and this wave came and I fell under. I got to the middle of the water and then ended up at the other side. Chris caught up with me and tried to get me to come back because it was dangerous and he said he loved me. Then this rope landed on my foot. I grabbed it and I was pulled under water and I saw the evil fish and I managed to get to the first bit of water but some rope got around my foot and the fish tried to get me. Chris was pulling me up and I finally got up (after Chris had been pushed away). Then I went over to him and we had this nice romantic kiss and then the Christine girl came and saw and decided to give up. I'm not sure what happened but we ended up at this place in the olden days. Widget was there and was all evil and hissy. I met this girl who believed that I was from "my time". She gave me a note one day and told me to read it that night. But for some strange reason I didn't and something happened and she got in trouble and the note went missing. I can't remember much more, but I ended up at school and the teacher told me I had been away for a week and Cedric was in the class and said his real name was James.
