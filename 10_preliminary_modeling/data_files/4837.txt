I come to visit my mother who lies very ill in her house. I go outside to get something from the camper van. I go in there and a small boy is napping in there. Paulina's boy and Paulina is off doing something this morning. He wakes up very glad to see us. We go outside and walk in the thick snow. He runs and laughs and falls on his back. I help him up and a yellow dog rushes up to us playfully and the dog frolics around me. I pet it. Then Valerie comes up. We go to the back of the van. I open it, looking at the piles of books and dream program notes. I go into the van camper with Valerie (sister-in-law). I start to sob about my mother. I reach out my hand and we hold hands sympathetically. She says I'd go visit her but the house smells. I say my mother's so ill and my father never does that well cleaning and Sally doesn't come very often. I think to myself that Valerie could come over and clean it up if it was so bad for her. But I don't say it. Now we walk back to the house the snow is gone. I ask where it went. It melted away so fast. I am near the door and am happily shocked to see my mother up and smiling and laughing. It is wonderful to see her like that. I wonder now she can do that as she is very ill. She darts around manic happy. Then I see her vomit blood into a long slim glass vial with round series of bubbleglass in it. I realize she is still very ill but somehow is managing this energetic happiness. She says we all need to move in with her because then she will be happy. I hesitate and say No. I can't move in. It feels like a no win situation. A trap.
