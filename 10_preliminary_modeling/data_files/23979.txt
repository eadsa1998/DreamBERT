Last week I had a weird dream about being a butterfly and chasing a kite that also looked like a butterfly. It was super strange because I kept on waking up, then going back to sleep and the dream kept on coming in where it left off. It wasn't scary, it was just strange. It finally stopped when the kite ripped in half and started to rain. The butterfly flew away home sad.
