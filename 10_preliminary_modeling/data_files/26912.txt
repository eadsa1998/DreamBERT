 I'm flying. There is a jet fighter plane flying near me. It is loaded with missiles, some of which have writing that says "Aniston" on them. I think the plane may be attaching someone or someplace soon. I'm flying above a layer of thick white clouds. It is perfectly calm and still, and very pleasant. I dip down through a hole in the clouds. Below the clouds it is stormy, with much electricity and tension. Something on the ground may have caused all the chaos, maybe a bomb or a missile.
