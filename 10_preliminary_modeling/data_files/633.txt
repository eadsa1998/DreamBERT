It is a snowy day in my hometown. There are accidents all over. I am driving on the highway and see a truck go up a ramp and over the edge of the bank. Where the road turns to my mother's house, a new turn has been made, but I have to go back and take the old one as I can't get through the new one. In another part of the dream, I am going to different places trying to get a haircut. Then I am at work in the newspaper where I used to work and there is a lunch counter. I need to write an article about myself riding a horse. I thought the article was to be about a cowboy entertainer. AT the lunch counter I get a huge roll and as I am trying to write I go back for a huge piece of cake that has one layer of chocolate and one of white. It is a very tall cake.
