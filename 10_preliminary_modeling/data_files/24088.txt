I am walking around in some unfamiliar city and I am wearing purple wristbands and some other strange clothing. I feel like I am drunk or on drugs because I am walking around all weird and I feel like I am out of control. I walk up to a car and inside are three fat girls about my age. I am talking to them for some reason, but as we are talking, the girls notice that I am looking down their tops. They are not very happy about it and I walk away. Soon I notice two good-looking girls walking on the other side of the street. I realize they are about to walk right by a house where all my friends are sitting o the porch. I walk across the street and right as I am in front of both my friends and the girls I do a somersault like Willy Wonka (basically act like you are falling but actually turn it into a forward somersault, it is not easy to do and looks pretty cool). As I stand up, I look at my friends and the girls and no one seems to be very impressed with me. I just sort of shrug it off.
