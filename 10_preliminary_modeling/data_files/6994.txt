I know I should be in another class. It's 1:30 PM, but I can't find my schedule. It's not in this bag. As I am about to go upstairs, two children are playing on the cement flight with an iron railing. A 3-year old gets on the railing despite its spiked slides down it. I try to warn him but he falls and cries. His mother comes and I try to explain.
