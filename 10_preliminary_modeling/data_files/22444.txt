I was walking through a street in Miraflores with a group of friends. It was in the afternoon. We arrived at an unknown cafe and we started to talk. Two gentlemen came over to our table and started to make questions. We were a bit afraid. Afterwards, I was with my family in a balcony (also unknown), teaching my nephew how to speak.
