I was watching True Blood. Sookie and Bill (who was a werewolf), were sometimes me and Eugene. We went to this patch of forest. There were some trees, flowers and a lake and it was a pretty place. This cop was there. We had a picnic blanket and we started making out on it and then had sex. I told someone that he was very violent sometimes (because he was a werewolf). Sookie was in trouble at one point and Eric came to save her -- it was during the day. I was in the car later and there was a fire. I was then in a deli and they had Lite Mars Bars for 90c. I put money in this box and started eating one. I told the guy behind the counter. I realized I left my wallet but was standing next to it but my money was gone. I asked the guy about it angrily and tipped some coins out and he insisted there was no money in it, but had taken the coins. Then some people came in and we suspected they were going to do something. They had taken my money, which was $300 and these guns that I had.
