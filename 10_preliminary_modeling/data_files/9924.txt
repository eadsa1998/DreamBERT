I am at the home of Marissa Camden- PRAYER GROUP: Marissa glares at me and is angry because I did not show up at another meeting. I tell her I had a conflict - I had to go to a Jungian meeting.. Then Marissa and I go downstairs together and it is very windy. I tell her I cannot attend a board meeting, because we, the Jung group, are going on a cruise; I wonder if I will need a sleeping bag?
