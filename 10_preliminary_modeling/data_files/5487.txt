I dreamed that my mom and I went to an Easter service of my church and LS drove us. We got there and it was the auditorium of a local high school and we sat down in the upholstered chairs of the auditorium. There was no one there yet and I thought "Why isn't anybody here?". LS went to find out why there wasn't anybody there and when the service would start. So she went off to find some information, and while my mom and I sat there I took out a box of Snackwell's crackers, that were spiced with pepper and we started to eat and I thought "Why are we doing this, these are supposed to go to my dad for Father's Day" and I felt intensely guilty for bingeing on the crackers that were earmarked for a present. And then, as I sat there eating, I heard at the back of the room on someone's boom box, an evangelical broadcast and thought to my self, "why aren't we doing this, we're supposed to be having a service and we're not doing it, here I am listening to the radio and its got this religious broadcast, and we're supposed to be doing this and why aren't we and why aren't there anybody here? Where is LS and why hasn't she come back?"
