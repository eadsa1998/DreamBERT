["Disabled people not quite as good."] I am talking with a man sort of like Mitch T. He is explaining that he doesn't have an equality problem about the disabled. I chuckle and gently point out to him that he does have a superiority problem about the disabled. I tell him the words he used that indicates a subtle discriminatory attitude. He is surprised and embarrassed.
