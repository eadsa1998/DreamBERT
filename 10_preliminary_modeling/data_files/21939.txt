I was going to be laid off or thought I would be because there was going to be a cut in the help. The boss brought a bag of work with about 300 pieces of swivels for me to mike or sort out or inspect. He said some are tapered and I should keep the pieces separate as they are sorted out all of same dimensions keep together as they mike. I was in the locker room changing my clothes and the girls were using our room. I took off my pants and shirt and was in my gym shirt and shorts and was embarrassed that the girl would look my underclothes over and think they were soiled. Bob won a daily double. He said it was $55,000. I said no, it was $5,500. There were two people on a board or bridge like which was about four ft. wide. I went on it and all over. I went over the side of it and I hung on the side of the board. The two fellows helped me up on the board.
