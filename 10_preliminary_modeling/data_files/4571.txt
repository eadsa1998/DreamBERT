["The test."] I am taking a written test with a class of younger people. The teacher says it is an open book test, so I am lying on the ground with the textbook open and writing down a paraphrase of what I find in the book. The teacher comes around and sees this. He smiles at me and says you can do better than this. Just let the answers come from yourself. I don't feel confident I have the answers as well thought out as what the book has. I can't seem to let go of using the book. Then it starts coming more easily. The answers won't be as thorough as in the book, but they will be my own.
