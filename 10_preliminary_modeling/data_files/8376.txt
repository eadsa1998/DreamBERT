I was at the CAS office sitting across from Bill Cro's desk. Bill C was leaning against the table. We were talking. I think I was trying to narrow down a time when he and I could meet. He was saying that he wasn't going to be available because of family things. While we were talking, three or four times, he was adjusting the buttons and zipper on his trousers. He was reaching just inside the very top of the zipper. It was as though the zipper wasn't closing completely and he was trying to fix it. I found it very distracting and quite odd behavior for him as well. When he said he wouldn't be able to meet because of family time, I said that was very commendable because a lot of people don't have that dedication to family. I said it is also nice for his family that he is so dedicated to them. He looked at me kind of odd, as though I had some kind of hidden meaning to what I said or something - perhaps being sarcastic or critical. I didn't. Subconsciously I may have been feeling that I wished I had someone in my life so dedicated to me.
