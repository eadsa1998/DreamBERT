 I'm in a bed at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's house. My friend Hank Anderson is there and he sits on the bed and starts urinating. He's like a little kid. I quickly get up and usher him to the bathroom. I'm in the kitchen with my friend Nat Miller. A van turns into the driveway. It's threatening. We go over near the washer and dryer to look out the window above them. I say something about the van breaking the quiescence. I go onto the porch and grab a crowbar to hit the strangers if they come in.
