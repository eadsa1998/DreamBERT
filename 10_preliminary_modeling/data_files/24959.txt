 I'm sitting in my basement, which is larger and more open than it actually is. My friends Nelson Eastman, Simon Naver, Tony Kramer and Lyle Zeffman are there. We're talking. My friend Edith Sherman is coming home soon and is coming over to my house. Linus Doman calls. The guys and I all talk about what divorce is like. Nelson talks about his father's heart attack. He says the symptoms and the heart attach appeared all in one day, with no prior warning.
