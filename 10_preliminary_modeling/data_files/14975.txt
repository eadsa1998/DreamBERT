I was at university. There was an online activity and most options were full and it had a bar to show how full they were. There was one on Tuesday from 8.30-5.30. Then I was there. We all sat in the first row of the class. Charlene was there. There was a picture of a bulldog puppy. There was a female teacher. The next class had more people. I got Mom to get me after and I was in the car but then realized I had one more class and then another class which was somewhere else.
