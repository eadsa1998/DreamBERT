I have a camera that looks like Valerie's tape player. I pour grape juice in it to make it work better. I get up to go brush my teeth and use the camera juice to rinse and then wonder if there's nasty chemicals in it. Now I am holding a "sister," a young girl/woman, in my arms and I am very intense and upset. I must help her and the only way is to repeat over and over, "I believe in you, Sharon" no matter what she says. I'm trying to help her overcome sexual molestation trauma and I explain to Arvonne we have to help her build trust, so no matter what awful thing she says, we accept it and love her anyway. Arvonne frowns and won't cooperate. I tell her angrily she's a bad woman and a lousy psychologist! I pace, saying, "I believe in you, Sharon" over and over. She mumbled, "Owaha, Hawaii," and, "I don't go to San Salvador." This is considered progress.
