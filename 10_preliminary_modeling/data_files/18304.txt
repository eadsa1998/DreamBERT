My husband and I were looking for houses. One right uptown for $150/month. At first we thought we couldn't possibly take it, but it was very nice inside -- all white and cool, with some teak panels or something. In back was a large patio, some trees and grass, and a large, cool lake with some artificial islands in it. I was showing this lake to my daughter and we were walking around it toward a large rock, when suddenly a wave like an ocean wave broke over it and swept us up toward the house. My daughter was scared and I decided it was too dangerous for the children to live there, especially since the house -- the patio, anyway, was now completely surrounded by water.
