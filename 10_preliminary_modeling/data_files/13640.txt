I was at Nana's in a garden. I went behind this shed and there was stuff growing so I went to run but Poppa and Fido came and Poppa was then some shifty person and I called out something. I was then at a table in a room with Milo Ventimiglia and Hayden Panettiere. They were sitting close together doing some Heroes thing. I was thinking about stuff and Milo and I were having an affair. Dad and I went to go to this place to watch House but we missed it. There was a killer at this place and it was Tony (24). He killed someone then the alarm sounded and he left. Then I was the killer and some psychologist was talking to me in this house about when I killed the person and why.
