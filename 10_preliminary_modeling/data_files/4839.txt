["Paulina's bookstore."] Dovre and I are in a room of Paulina's Bookstore. It is a mess and we are trying to help her clean it up. We are picking up books off the floor. Dovre finds two of them she wants to keep. I take them to another room where Paulina is and ask her if Dovre and I can keep these books. I feel guilty because we aren't offering to pay her for them. She nods, but I decide to put them back on the table to be sold. I ask her which table. She says the "B's." I look at one table. She says no. I look at the next table. She says no, then I see they are in alphabetical order and find the "B" table. I straighten up some newspapers laying on the books and find a place for them. They are slim volumes and are almost covered or lost next to the larger books.
