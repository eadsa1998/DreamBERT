We were practicing on the steps of a fountain-like thing, and it was after school, and we were just having all kinds of bad luck. Mrs. Dougherty thought that if she got, she went home and she got her other shirt, then maybe we would behave better, and so she took her shirt off and she was in her slacks and her bra, and she goes home, then comes back with a baby shirt. And then her CD player won't work, and for some reason she had it connected to a TV. I didn't really understand that. [laugh]
