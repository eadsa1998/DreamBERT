I was in school again, in those regimented rows of desks, as the teacher (old P.E. teacher) blabbed on about the usual nothing, and then forced us to take one of those standardized tests. In my dream I resisted everything passively but passionately; I somehow managed to lose my test sheet, for instance. And the whole time I felt that sharp adolescent despair, as of a trapped animal, without even words to express himself.
