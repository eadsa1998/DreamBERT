 I'm in a car with my acquaintance Rita Fosters. She is driving on the wrong side of the road! We're in the United States. I'm frightened by her driving and tell her this. I am then driving. I get up the nerve to say to her, "Will you or do you want to give me a blow job?" This is a big step for me because I feel I'm exposing myself admitting to her that I'm attracted to her. She reacts in a surprised manner.
