I went to a movie with my online friend Starla.  There was a cat in the movie.  We were sitting, touching a little, and someone (I don't remember which one of us) acknowledged the tension between us and we said we might as well try to get comfortable and enjoy it.  So we tried repositioning ourselves to sort of cuddle, and be more comfortable.  We started to kiss and make out.  I started to enjoy it.  Then a couple came into the theatre, although the movie we were watching was nearly over.  I realized they were waiting for our movie to end so they could put their tape on.  Starla and I arrived back at my parents' place after the movie.  I went to the bathroom and found chunks and mush and large seeds of Asian pears inside my pants.  I went back to the kitchen and confronted Starla about it.  I assumed she had stashed it away because she didn't like it, and I told her it was immature; if she didn't care for the pear she could have just said so and gotten rid of it rather than making a big mess in my pants.  I thought it was sort of weird though, because I really didn't feel anything disturb my pants or waistband during the movie.  She told me she put the regurgitated pear in my pants to bug me.  Outside the theatre in the lobby, I watched her play her bass.  The amp wasn't hooked up but she was hooked up to some sort of recording system, so her playing sounded weird, but I was surprised by her skill.  Her playing was interesting.  The top string was thick and hung loose at the bridge.  She used the end to pick the other strings.  After that she played a guitar, which was also recorded; then both parts could be played together.  She was much better than I had expected.
