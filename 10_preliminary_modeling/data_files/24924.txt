It was a really windy night. The wind blew my back door open. My cat got outside. (Once outside, she gets scared of people.) I went out into the backyard to call for her, but it was really windy and whenever I would call for her the wind would carry my voice away. Then she was sitting on the garden gate laughing at me, and I couldn't move towards her because the wind was too strong. Setting: My house, and my backyard. Characters: Me and Lucky Blue, my cat. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared, worried, frustrated. My mom had told me her dream last night which was very similar to this. Also, it was very windy, and my cat was sleeping curled up next to me.
