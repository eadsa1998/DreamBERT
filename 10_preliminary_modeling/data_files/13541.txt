I left this place with some friends and I was driving this car. It was American though, and I kept getting confused. The brakes weren't working well. Then it was this weird Segway like emergency vehicle. The traffic was stopped. I managed to get onto the road I needed to. I was then with someone who was either Kiefer Sutherland or Will Arnett. We were walking down the side of the road and then it was closed at the end. We had to climb over this thing and there was a door and he went through and I asked "Haven't we gone through this door before?" and he said "No". Then we were in this garden and there were two little Chinese hut like things on each side of the garden and each side of the garden was exactly the same. There was a black couple and they wanted us to marry their children. First, they gave us food and we fell asleep. We then dreamt and he was trying to work out who he was in love with. There was a midget called Denis. This lady told him that she thought it was me (that he was in love with). So we had sex (in the dream) and he realized that he did. He owned this video shop and they had Flatliners and two other movies with Kiefer Sutherland (looked like him, but wasn't him). Then it was real and the cops were there. We had been killed and found together in a bed. I was then discovered to be alive and sat up. Then whoever I was with was alive too. I was watching something on TV -- Will Arnett was in love with a rat. He put it in his pants and it climbed out from the bottom.
