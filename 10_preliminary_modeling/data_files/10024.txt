One of my clients is pregnant; I make a drawing of a white horse on a large sheet of paper for her; She is delighted and hangs it from their mantelpiece. I find out that I too am pregnant: feel the fetus pushing against my ribs; I call the doctor and he gives me assurance and instruction. He says that I have plenty of time before I start labor; I am holding a box of new plants with green shoots in black earth. He tells me to water the plants.
