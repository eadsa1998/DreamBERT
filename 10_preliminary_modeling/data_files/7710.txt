I think it was nighttime. I went into a hallway. The door at the end of the hall was closed. I thought I saw a shadow through the crack at the bottom of the door. I hesitated but decided to open it just a little and see if something or someone was causing the shadow. There was a man there. It was too late to get the door shut again. He pushed it the rest of the way open. He had a gun and pointed it right at my face. He was not much taller than I. Very short blonde hair, very thin, a start of a beard perhaps, maybe just had not shaved for a day or two. He grabbed me with his one free hand while keeping the gun pointed at my face with the other. I was walking backwards down the hallway. I tried to strike out but couldn't get much force behind my movements. He was going to rape me. I just kept thinking that I didn't want him to kill me. I also remember thinking that now I will know how it feels to be raped. Twice he took a deep breath and then moved as though he was going under my shirt.
