I am at home and standing on the patio outside our hot tub. Two people are in the tub and one man puts his hands on my "parts". I can't say anything because if I do people will notice. I see some people in my neighbor's yard. One is a woman and one is a large man and there are others. I think something about the woman being the sister of someone, maybe the sister of the man in the tub. Suddenly the man next door turns into a monster and attacks the girl. He is like a big gorilla. She runs next door to my house and I know I have to risk someone seeing the man with his hand on my "parts" to get a gun. There is so much excitement no one seems to notice and the man in the tub, who seemed to be a threatening figure, doesn't mind because I am able to keep the monster away.
