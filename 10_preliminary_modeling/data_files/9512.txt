I come to Service early. See Father Andrew in lobby, standing - wearing red robe (he wore at my confirmation). I go into Church for service, but halfway through (or afterwards) consult him about dental work. - With my mother and my grandmother, very beautiful. Then he said it would cost 6 or 7 marks.
