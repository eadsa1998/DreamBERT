I had a boyfriend. I was sometimes with Mom. She left at some point and a guy was after me. I changed my shirt and I was then with Mom and some others. Then my boyfriend looked like Adam Baldwin and there was another guy who looked like a young Kiefer Sutherland. I heard something coming from a shop. Someone shot at me and Adam Baldwin shot back. I looked up and saw Kiefer. I snuck in. They ended up confronting each other and each other laugh. Then it was a girl and someone else. They both took their clothes off to see which one I would go to. I looked away. Someone went on their knees making a retard face and the girl saw and laughed.
