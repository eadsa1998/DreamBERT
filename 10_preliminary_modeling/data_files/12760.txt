I was at school. I had cooking. Ezra, Calvin and Eugene were also in the class. There was flour and something about prey. Someone said something about women handling pain better. I was making some alcohol thing for this girl. I was talking to Ezra and he said "You're only doing this class because of Swamp Boy!" I was then at a computer and Calvin was sitting next to Madelyn. I was sitting over the other side. Calvin and I went somewhere. There were really high trees. I was holding this long branch thing and swinging through the place. I freaked out and I got off, leaving with a fear of trees.
