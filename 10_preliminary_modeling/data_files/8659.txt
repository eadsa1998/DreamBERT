I was in Rome at the funeral for Pope John Paul II. It was packed with people. You could hardly move there were so many people. We were walking in a funeral procession. We left one area and were headed to another area. Everyone started moving but when we got to a certain place some of the people went to the left and some to the right. I followed the group to the left. Some people walking the same direction as I was kept turning around and looking back and questioning if we were headed the right way. I was relatively sure that we were and tried to assure them of that. We kept going on the direction that we had been.
