I dreamed that my father was having dinner with Matthew, Albert, and Anthony. They were going to a sleepover later. I wanted to shower before they arrived. Halfway through my shower, I thought I heard them, so I got out and went downstairs. For some reason, Camilia had come and wanted to shower too, so I let her shower while I watched TV. When she was done, I remembered that I hadn't conditioned my hair or anything, so I went back in. When I got out of the shower for the 2nd time, all the boys were there. They began rolling out sleeping bags and mattresses, preparing for the sleepover. Then I must have woken up and started a new dream. This dream I can't remember exactly, except that Hannah, Sue, and I were mad at this other girl.
