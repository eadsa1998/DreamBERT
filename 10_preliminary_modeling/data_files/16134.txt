First I dreamt that there was a Rolling Stones concert on TV and that Dad kept flipping channels and we weren't able to see it. Then, we finally settled down, and we could see it. And he wanted me to be careful of turning up the volume on the amplifier because one of our speakers was out already. And then I was on the porch and ___?___ had shipped us this big piece of furniture by accident. [laugh] And so we had it setting around and we didn't know what to do with it. And then we were at a park. Then I was writing a current event, and I was writing something about the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in my head. And I just remembered she'd heard that already. [laugh] I don't know what she's going to think when she hears it again. And then I was at the park. We were having a picnic, a picnic with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and Quinn, and Clark and Marilou were there too. And we were all sitting around, and I was sitting far away at first, but then I heard where they all were and I came with the left-over bowl and joined them. And I thought that they were singing the Westport High School alma mater, but that was some other group of people. And the thing that Sound &amp; Vision shipped to us by accident was sitting behind our table and was like, it was like what do we do with it, and not related to the fact that that's not where it came from. And then I woke up.
