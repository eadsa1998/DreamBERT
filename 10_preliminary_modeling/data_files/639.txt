I am young, probably in my teens, and am working at the newspaper in my hometown where I used to be the editor. I have worked all day. It is about midnight and I am ready to go home. We put the paper on a flat elevator and raise it to the ceiling so vandals will not be able to get it while it is waiting for someone to take it to the printer. My old boyfriend and some boys are there and it is Halloween. Some other girls are there also. The boys want to scare us and freeze themselves so they look like they are dead. My boyfriend does that and I am very upset. At some point here the scene changes and we are in a house and he comes in frozen and scares me but he turns out to be okay. Also I hit him because I am angry about something. He is upset about that and I am afraid we may never make up.
