I go to visit someone for a while. The woman asks me if I think the style of her house is Western. I walk around looking at the outside of her house. At first I say, "Yes," but then I reconsider. I say, "No, a western style house would be more open. It would have large windows and clean, simple lines." At the back of her house I see flagstone siding and a small square enclosed porch with a high peaked roof. She says, "I never even use this space." I say, "I think your house is more Cape Cod." I then decide I want to take the day off to go home and relax, and to go swimming in the pool. I try to gather up my belongings and the people I came with. I can't seem to carry all my belongings, a basket of dirty laundry, some books and papers. The woman tries to help me. I call to Ellie who is up high on the tower roof of the nextdoor castle. She's starting to climb down the outside wall like repelling down a mountain. I am concerned for her. I think, "That sure is like Ellie, taking risks!" Dwight comes down and gets ahead of her so in case she falls, she'll land on him. She takes the last jump and does land on him. He is hurt. His foot might be broken. I go to them, concerned, and check out his foot. Now, we're on an airplane to go home. It's time to board and I'm still juggling all my stuff. She says, "It's time," and I say, "Well, I'm not on board yet." She says, "We have all the PhDs. Are you the one with three masters?" I say, "I only have one master." She reluctantly lets me on board.
