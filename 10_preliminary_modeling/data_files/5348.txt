I dreamed that for final exams at my high school, we all had to ride this train. It was horrible. The driver was crazy and kept saying, "This train will not crash," but we were all still horrified. Then I had a dream that all of the kids on my Spain group went to the same high school I woke up on the first day and tried a million outfits, but ended up ruining them because I'd drop mascara on them. Then finally I put on jeans and a pink shirt and a jean jacket, before realizing that I shouldn't wear a jean jacket with jeans. On the bus to school, I saw the Chloes. Mr. Chloe was really happy about their new baby. It began to rain. At school I realized I had no makeup on. Then I woke up.
