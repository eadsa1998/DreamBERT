We were at a hotel thing for school races. I was sharing a room with Tatu (the band) and Katherine Heigl. School races were on bikes or foot. It was really hot. Outside there were these rock things and a little tower. I won each time (3). Tatu, Katherine Heigl and I snuck into some guy's bedroom (I think it was Brendan Fehr's) to find something for Katherine. I got bored and left. Tatu hid under the bed. I left and saw Brendan coming so I knocked on the door. Katherine got caught. Tatu got out after he left. Tatu and I got an ice-cream and we were riding our bikes. The next races were at some lady's house. They were water ones. We had water masks on. I won again. She had a blowup pool and on the second race I got stuck with someone and so we could move I said something about pools and slid into the pool and everyone clapped.
