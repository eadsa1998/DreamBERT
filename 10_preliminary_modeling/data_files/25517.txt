 I'm in a truck with my friends Tiny Combs, Stephen Ramos, and Kristy Puffy. We're driving to work. We are by Kristy's mother's house in Oak Valley. A tornado is near. We take shelter under the overpass where Main Street crosses the railroad tracks. I am then at home. My family is there, as well as my friend Kevin Simpson, my uncle Rusty Redding and his family, and a kid from my high school, Ben Thompson. I bring Ben out through the garage and open the old yellow garage door from the inside. There is a nice brown truck outside the door. I go around to the back door and knock. My uncle Rusty lets me in. We see a funnel cloud drop and open up. I yell for everyone to get to the basement. I run down stairs, and fire alarms in the house go off. No one comes downstairs at first. In a little while the others come to the basement. They huddle in the pit room and cover up with a beanbag chair and two mattresses that are sewn together at one long edge. My cousin Melvin Redding, aunt Sheila Redding, and sister Ramona are there, among others.
