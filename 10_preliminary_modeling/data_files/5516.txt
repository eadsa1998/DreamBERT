I dreamt of a young man who used to be a very close friend of my son's, his name is R. And R and my son and my daughter were in an automobile accident, it was my son's fault, unfortunately, this is not the dream, this is real unfortunately, and R's eyes got hurt. In the dream I saw my son and he said that "R and his wife have split up" and I said "oh my. Why?" and he said "She couldn't stand his drooling." And I said, "R drools?" and he said "yeah" and I said "Well can't something be done about it ?" and my daughter jumped in and she said "he's having electrical treatments but they don't seem to help." And I said, "well, that's really too bad". And from there I went into R's mother's bathroom which was just filled with Loreal products, every conceivable product you could think of and I picked each one up and looked at it. They were all in pink bottles, and the bathroom was very lovely, I can't remember details, but these Loreal bottles were very pretty.
