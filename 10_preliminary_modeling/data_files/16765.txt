I felt during the night that the night's dreams held an important meaning. I feel very free, as if there's no consequences for anything I should decide to do. I just want to be crazy. I wouldn't mind if anybody called me a freak- it would probably even be a compliment. I'm not sure if I saw Cindy or if I was thinking about her, but I wanted her there, just the same. I think I'm by myself at this point, in this building (although I don't remember it well enough to describe it). I start dancing fast, and I think I'm dancing well, too. Then Cassandra is here and starts dancing right with me. Then I'm downstairs (or at least in another room) and see a rug on the floor, possibly from the Amazon, and there's writing on it in Spanish. I read it out loud. This native Spanish woman begins to describe the rug to me, in Spanish. She seemed happy I was speaking her language.
