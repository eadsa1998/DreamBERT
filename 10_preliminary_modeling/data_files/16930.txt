In the dream I live in a scruffy city which is similar to London - possibly the East End. There are large railway arches and tower blocks. But the place seems to be filled with public art. At the end of every public corridor there's an abstract painting and at the end of a tunnel there's a large construction of some conceptual kind. I'm in an expensive restaurant with my partner, who is in a bad mood. We are sitting in an empty room apart from one other occupied table - it feels as if the restaurant is closed to the public. On the other table sit four art critics (although they also might be artists or politicians). Their table is covered by a white cloth. They drink expensive wine, and are waited on by an attentive waiter. Some of the other empty tables have their chairs on them. The room is partitioned off by curtains. I can't see any windows.
