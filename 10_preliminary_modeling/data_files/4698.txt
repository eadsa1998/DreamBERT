["Bill Clinton and energy power grid problems."] I am on a sidewalk in a downtown city. I have a wonderful big black keyboard box with many complicated buttons. I have no idea how to play it but experiment and make some beginning strides toward simple melodies. I am teaching myself how to be more proficient on it. Somehow this box has something to do with electrical power in the city as well. I must drive down a highway to get to the ocean's edge and fix the power grid problem. I am picked up by Bill Clinton in a black car. He is on the same mission. We somehow get past a narrow gate across the road and reach land's end. A restaurant is there, we go in and see they are remodeling so that they will grow the fish in pools there outside the restaurant for the people to eat. I also see a large group of Asian workers in their slickers working the ocean and moving in lines as a group toward shore. Now Bill and I are back in the car backing up that curvy road back to the city. He decides he wants to make out and starts to lie on me. I grab his face and hold him back from a kiss and say. No way, guy. I don't care if you are powerful or could cause me problems, I don't want this. He is annoyed with me. I force my way out of the car to walk back to the city. I am a bit worried he will try and run me over.
