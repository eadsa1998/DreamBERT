["Audience is bored"]  I am reading one of my plays to an audience. They are quiet but restless. Not very interested. I keep reading hoping that they will finally get excited. I finally stop reading and the audience wanders away, glad to be able to go. I feel uneasy and insecure, thinking that my play should have caught their interest, if it had been written well. I am unhappy.
