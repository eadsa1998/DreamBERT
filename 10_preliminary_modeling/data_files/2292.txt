I'm on a boat with Ellie and it goes into a cave. The current pulls us deeper and deeper into the darkness. It's scary. We are literally "going to hell." We enter a huge cavern with fluorescent phosphorous lighting. There are bats in there. They flutter near our heads. Around the corner is the center of the earth. We hope we'll go through and go out the other side to daylight and fresh air. The only other choice is to paddle hard against the current.
