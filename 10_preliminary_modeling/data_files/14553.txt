There was a Kenny vs. Spenny movie. First, Spenny and I went for a walk and we went down the street next to North Midvale Primary School. It was night and dark and spooky. He was with his kid (or someone else's). I said it was dangerous and he said he had a 'scythe'. This black guy walked past us and I could only see his clothes because of the contrasting darkness. Then, Kenny, someone else and I were running away from Spenny, or all of us were running away from someone. We ran into a toilet. The three of us went into a room with the toilets and closed the door. I tried to lock it and it was a switch lock (like on the front door), but I couldn't get it in time and he burst in. They were yelling and then Spenny reached into his pocket and this guy fired his gun and killed him. The guy said "he was reaching for a gun". Kenny checked Spenny's pockets and there was a pack of chewing gum. He said "a tic-tac? You shot him because of a tic-tac?!" Kenny was like 'he's my best friend!'. Then there was a second one (like that was the first way the scene was shot), which was what had actually happened. There were teenagers talking in a room. One said "that was how we were originally going to shoot it" or they were going to bring in a twin of Spenny to keep in, but it wouldn't have worked.
