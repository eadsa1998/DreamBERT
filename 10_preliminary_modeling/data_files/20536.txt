I was a patient in a bed in a dormitory. The patient in the next bed became friendly and I felt uncomfortable because I suspected that he was making a sexual advance. He became annoyed when I did not respond, and he moved to another bed. I felt that the other patients thought we were perverts, and that made me uncomfortable.
