In this dream I was with some friends at the University of Miami. We were kidding around, joking back and forth. The only particular occurrence that I can remember is that a classmate of mine was kidding around with another guy and the other guy called him a Jew in a sarcastic manner, all in fun, though, because he, my classmate, is Jewish. All the people in the dream were males, around my age and seemingly attended the University.
