 I am canoeing. I have a little bit of food left and I am tired. I have a camera. My hands are black from the gloves I was wearing. I am down by Hill Park, still in the canoe. My uncle Rusty Redding and his son/my cousin Melvin Redding are there. I throw a stick up at the park shelter. It goes over the lily pad-covered water between the shelter and I and lands on the roof of the building. Melvin is surprised. The stick hit something that nearly landed on him. I go clean up the garbage on the park lawn, which is then my front lawn.
