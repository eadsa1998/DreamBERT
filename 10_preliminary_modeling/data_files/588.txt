I am in a train depot with my son and nephew. I tell my nephew to be sure and buy a gift for his mother. I learn the money is all gone. There is a story behind this and I am about to hear it when a huge glowing train goes by very fast and we are all looking at that when another train, an orange one, hits a vehicle on the track. The vehicle is a Bronco type thing with a snowplow. We are surprised to see my husband was in it. He gets out and is dazed. Just minutes before the crash happened he was sitting with us and was making a remark that men as well as women are good cooks.
