Pedro and Bob (?) are on a trip, riding on a low-bottomed trolley car or bus, something like a hover craft. I put my hand out and can feel the sand pass by my fingers. My fingers move along and I feel the shallow water as we approach. Was there a floor or is it a shallow river? A thunderstorm threatens -- big raindrops start to fall. I hear the raindrops on the roof of the trolley; we ford the stream just in time to be able to take shelter from the storm... the storm passes....
