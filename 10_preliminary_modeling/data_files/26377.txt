 I'm relaxing on a couch without a shirt on a warm summer evening. My classmate Erica Klein is there. We talk about the party. She says her dog knows about it, and means a lot of people know. I joke, "Then where is your dog? He should be here!" My housemate Stephen Ramos and our friend Jimmy Youngman arrive. It's a little bit after 10:00pm. I realize I forgot to get a keg for the party! Jimmy says all the liquor stores are closed. I wonder what I'm going to do. I think just by chance that Stephen may have gotten a keg, so I go downstairs to look. The basement is the basement at home. The keg is not there, but the old half-empty keg is there. I scramble to find beer, thinking of my options. My brother Wally says the outpost store may be open. My friend's father Dick Zates arrives with a couple pounds of ground venison. I greet him and take the venison from him. People are playing cards in the living room. I ask if I can play a hand quickly. They say no, but I still have cards. I have two Queens, two Aces, two Jokers, and some other cards. They seem to be playing a progressive poker game, and one has to have a full house to open the betting. I lay down my cards when they're done. I've got four Aces.
