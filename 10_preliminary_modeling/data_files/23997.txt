My dream had me, and I was at the beach. No one else was there. I was wearing a sundress and a hat. When I looked out at everything, it looked a little fuzzy. I could feel the wind blowing through my hair, and I could smell the salty ocean. The ocean water was really clean, almost like a blue color. When I looked at it, it was very shiny. I felt very pleasant because I was free. I was all by myself. It was very peaceful. Also, while I was standing there, I could hear faint music, it was very soft. A huge wave was building up. I could see it very well. I felt like I was right there. It was a tremendous crash and there was water everywhere. Then I woke up.
