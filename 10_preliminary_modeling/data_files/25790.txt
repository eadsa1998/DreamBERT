 I'm re-elected president of the Honor Society in a bus. I play tennis, and am number two. I was upset by someone ranked lower than me, and then I upset someone ranked higher than me. There is an interview of me ion the news. They say I've never played someone. I see the interview on television. I think I have a flat face. During the interview I talk about me lobbing the ball over and then having it smashed back at me. I make noises during the interview to illustrate this.
