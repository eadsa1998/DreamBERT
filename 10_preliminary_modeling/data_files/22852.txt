I am at the top of a steep cliff, like a sand dune, about 30 or 40 feet above a beach.  The path down is very steep and covered with sand ; in some places there are roots poking through.  I have already been down it once and am with someone different this time.  I tell whoever it is to follow me.  It is necessary to run down the slope, and I have to be careful not to trip on the roots.  The sand beach at the bottom is very narrow, and part of it is part of the slant of the cliff.  It is at some body of water, perhaps an ocean.  It is night, and pretty dark, but there are quite a few people there, many of them lovers.  It feels very romantic.
