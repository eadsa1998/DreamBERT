Some people and I went back in time to the 80's. Most of it was the same (hair, clothes and DOS), but there was a train which went pretty fast and we had to use it because we couldn't go outside. This lady was on a computer and it was kind of spiffy. We had to sit in the seats. There was a guy outside and the train place's gate. This monster came and ate him. There was an interview with Colin Farrell on the TV and I was thinking that he looked like Tony (24). Then we were sitting at desks. I sat next to Jeremiah. Darius and Eugene were there too.  Something hit me and I squeaked and they thought it was funny.
