I am aboard a ship. The admiral is a disgusting, somewhat filthy old man who approaches me and I show him my teeth, partial dentures. Someone puts the teeth in the admiral's mouth and I say, "You have to have places empty between certain teeth so the plates will fit." But the teeth strangely enough fit his mouth and he looks a lot better. Later, still on the ship, I see him dressed as a woman. I am completely amazed, since I know it is the admiral, yet now he is thinner and beautiful. His wrists, I note, are thin and clean and his hair is quite stylish. In fact, he is the center of attraction among the passengers. I can't believe it is the same person.
