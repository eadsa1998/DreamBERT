This dream involved another person of similar, another male, and the setting was like a place of employment, but it wasn't anything really specific. I remember saying, him saying that his family had been in the Miami area for 96 years. I didn't think this was anything particularly extraordinary because my family had been here for a couple hundred years in this dream.
