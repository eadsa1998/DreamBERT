I was in my house and got kidnapped by a lady and two guys. They took me to their house which was across the street. My family was really sad and occasionally my dad would come over and talk to the people to see if I could come back home, but they kept telling him he better stop coming over. I was really scared because I didn't know what was going to happen. I only saw the lady a lot, but barely ever saw the two guys. The lady was kind of mean, but occasionally she'd compliment me on how well I was coping with the kidnapping. I got out and walked across the street to see my house. It looked awful. It was half burned down, like it had been bombed. Everything was trashed and it looked abandoned. I was scared. I think I saw my parents. My house was deteriorated. The house across the street looked different.
