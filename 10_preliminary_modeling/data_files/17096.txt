I was in a classroom, I guess.  There was some sort of activity going on.  There was a projector with desks beyond it.  People were coming in and sitting down.  Someone came in and sat directly behind the projector.  It was my old freshman year crush Stan.  He seemed to be leaning to see around the projector.  Someone neighboring told him, "Madeleine is here."  He seemed to look more anxiously.  He stood up and moved to the side to try and see.
