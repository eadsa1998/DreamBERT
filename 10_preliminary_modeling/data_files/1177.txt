Friday. Nate follows me around. I'm vacationing at the beach. He wants to be with me and push me around in my manual wheelchair. I am exasperated but permit him to. As we come to a steep hill that ends in the sand, he lets go of the manual chair and stands and watches me. I make a decision to help myself down the hill, although it will be difficult. I make it safely. I am amazed at Nate but realize that I knew it would happen. I half-push, half-crawl through the sand. I go into the surf. A huge brown wave comes from the shore side. I am nearly drowned. I am afraid and tell Ginny, "I'm going onto shore. This is too rough and dangerous." I struggle back to shore. Ginny and two women are supportive, emotionally.
