I was dreaming of my ex-husband (from a long time ago). We were trying to have some kind of sexual experience and I managed to give him a hard-on which surprised him, but then it didn't go anywhere. I realized I was going to have an orgasm and I wanted to get away from him and go have it in the bathroom in private, but I realized I wasn't going to get to the bathroom before the orgasm came (which it did). He wanted me to go on a trip with him and a female friend of his. I asked if it was his girlfriend and it was. Ultimately, I decided it didn't matter.
