I have to catch a train, although I want to stay with a warm person who is admiring my feminity; My bags and purse are already on the train, but I have no ticket, no money, no I.D. I ask the conductor to hand me my purse which is on a high rack and when he hands it to me, a paper falls out and disintegrates.
