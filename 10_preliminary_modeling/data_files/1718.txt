I am in a play. The rehearsal went fine. I'm in a manual chair, up on my knees. I'm wearing a pink straightjacket and must get out of it before I can help the injured woman's shapes lying on the gym floor. I struggle with the jacket, telling myself to relax, I will get out, don't be embarrassed. The other woman goes out and gathers up the shapes as I continue to struggle. I rear back to get the jacket off and fall back in the chair. I get up quickly. The jacket is off. I say to the audience something like, "It's OK."
