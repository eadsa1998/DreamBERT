First I dreamt that I was operating a little RC research car on the planet Mars. While the car was going around collecting samples of minerals, etc. I was sitting in a station somewhere on the planet. I screwed up somehow at some point and the little RC car broke open the door of my station, allowing the zero-atmosphere of Mars to rush in and destroy all life inside, including mine.
