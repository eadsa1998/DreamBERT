I was on the side of a wooded mountain with Mother and Daddy, looking down at the valley below.  It was very green, and we were up very high, because the buildings below looked tiny.  I decided I wanted to go down to the valley, so I carefully worked my way down.  After a while, the valley looked very close -- like just a few feet -- but the nearest building still looked very tiny beneath me.  It was very old, and I called back to Mother and Daddy to tell them about it.
