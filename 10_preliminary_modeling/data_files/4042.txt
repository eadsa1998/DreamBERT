["Cat hats"]  I am in a room. I guess I am at Rochelle's house. She is coming on to me. I am annoyed and tell her to stop it. She persists and I decide to leave. I am angry at her for persisting. I walk down the street. I am carrying some glass art objects that are blue colored and shaped like fluted clam shells. They are very pretty. I see an art gallery and walk up the stairs to the entrance. I feel adventurous because I know Rochelle wanted to go here later and I don't want to run into her, but I think it will be fun to be here for awhile. I go in. A woman who works there comes up to me and is interested in my art objects. We walk down a wide hall to another partitioned show room. A man is selling cloth cat shaped dolls and hats. I start to rearrange them and as I do, they are sort of alive and moving. He likes the new way I placed them. Now I return to the entrance. I want to leave before I see Rochelle. I am carrying a long pretty blue dress with a small pin on it that has a price tag of $29.95. A young woman comes over and watches as I spread the dress out on the floor and we look at it admiringly.
