["All the king's men."] I am a part of a band of rebels. A handsome man is the leader. We are rebelling against King George. We sneak into his bedroom. He sees us through a window and rushes in to arrest us with his red coated soldiers. We sneak around to his throne room next door. He rushes in there. Soldiers grab me and harass me. I stand my ground, declaring the King is wrong and this is wrong to harm me. I call out to the crowd in the hall to gather around me and fight with me. They watch and are sympathetic but don't come to my rescue. I call out to them to wear blue coats. As the soldiers drag me down the hall, I see lots of people in blue suit jackets. They are wearing the rebel colors but still haven't the courage to help me. After a while, 4 or 5 join me. Soon we will overturn the soldiers and the rebels will win their cause.
