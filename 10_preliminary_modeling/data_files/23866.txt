I knew a waiter guy, he was really cute, handsome.  I was attracted to him, quite a bit, like I felt with Richard or Rob.  I wanted him to be mine, but was so attracted I was a bit self-conscious or insecure, or felt like I would never get him.  He was very appealing, in looks and personality, someone everyone would get a crush on.  He was a little older than me.  He seemed not to be making it, overloaded with work, or frustrated at his position or making no progress or something.  Or like he was capable of so much more.  I really wanted him, wanted to make him happy.  I was wondering what kind of block or limitation makes such a great guy lose out on life.  I was at his work, and some girl mentioned he had six tables, like that was a lot.  I wanted to help him with that, or get him out of this work.  Then he and I had a date, I was happy sitting beside him in a nice restaurant.  Then he was hiking through deep snow in the winter with another guy.  He said "I am so fucking cold."  I came to him and said,  "I have your cups and your gloves, right here.  Here let me put the cups in your pack."  (They were plastic.)  I did.  Then I asked if he wanted his gloves, and I slid them on his hands, one at a time.  I loved helping him out, getting him the thing he needed most right then, making him warmer.  He was really appreciative of the gloves, that I had them for him.  Then he was a teacher.  I think he had us write essays.
