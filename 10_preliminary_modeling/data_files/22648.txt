I dreamt that I was arranging some books on my desk and a friend of mine whom I like and have affection for came. I continue dto fix the books with him, and at that moment I felt a desire to hug him and touch him, but I couldn't do it. My mother arrived at that moment and told us that tea was served. We went down to the dining room and I was wearing a summer dress with big flowers. The telephone woke me up and I couldn't finish the dream.
