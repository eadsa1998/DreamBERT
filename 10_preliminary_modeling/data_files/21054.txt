Al Lasko was going to Russia as an American soldier. He marked a card and gave it to Ann in case they tried to hold him. One man had a shmoo and the shmoo talked to the people and they followed it to the American zone. Stalin was with Ann and me on a road. It was the boundary line between our country and his. His banks were high and ours low. I noticed in a  distance a stone cliff. The water started to gush out and seemed to be breaking the wall of rock down and came out in more and more volume. I could see Stalin's trick. He had that sabotaged and his banks were higher so that the water would overflow our land. Ann was nude in the clear water up to her neck. It was clear water. I pulled her out and then I saw her under water again, so I reached down and pulled her out. She was drying herself and I stood in front of her to shield her. I climbed over our shanty on 72nd St. and there was a string of barbed wire strung across it. I saw Ray Lasko. He had a long coat to his shoes and he was a little man. Then I saw a couple other small men with long coats. They were about as tall as our Bob.
