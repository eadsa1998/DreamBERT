["Powerful man addicted."] I enter a large house and walk through the rooms. I admire the huge beautiful furniture. A lovely hutch with a blue glass vase on it. I wonder if I could take it home. I'd like to have it. Then I saw a creature like a demon crouched near it. I move on. I see more beautiful furniture, and I also see other demon like creatures, that are mostly human in form with odd shaped ears and evil eyes. One of them owns this house. He is very tall and large maybe 6 foot nine inches. He is addicted to some silver beverage. He is scary and angry. I try to avoid him. I look at his face and one eye transforms into a large scary eye. I am not really afraid of him. In fact I decide to help him. I destroy the silver beverage. I fight a mean "friend" of his who was threatening me. He laughs at me. I take a broom and use the handle to smack his genitals. He is in great pain and leaves the house. I tell the addicted man to lock the doors. The man is afraid to because it was a family rule to keep the doors open at all times. Finally I convince him and he shuts and locks the door to keep the mean man out.
