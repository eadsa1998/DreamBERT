["Mom leaves, injured."] I am packing and reorganizing Charla and my clothes in a chest of drawers. I pull out several articles, a nightgown for me, a pair of jeans for Charla to be packed for the trip. Then I go into a kitchen. My father is there, cooking his meal. I look in the cupboard and find several old hotdogs in bread like a folded sandwich. I ask him if one is his. He says it is. He says I can have it. I decide to throw mine away as it is old and probably would make me sick. I am being sympathetic with my father being alone now. Then my mother comes in and falls. I go to her but she has already gotten up. I am worried because she fell like that already this morning. She says, looking bleary eyed, a bum head. Then she pauses and rethinks. No, she says, a bone hip, meaning a hip joint giving out on her. She stumbles out of the kitchen. She is going somewhere. I am worried, but see that Dwight is following her everywhere. He will take care of her. My father is sad.
