I wiggled my tooth and it was loose and then I found a few more loose teeth. One of them came out and there was a tooth underneath. I made an appointment for 6am the next day. I got to the dentist and they said because my regular dentist wasn't there it would cost extra. I mixed up the time and I got there an hour later than I was supposed to. It cost $2300 for the exam and $3000 for being late. I was depressed to see my bank account down to only $3000.
