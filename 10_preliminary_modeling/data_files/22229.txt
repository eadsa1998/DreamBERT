It was about a "knife" crime. This is what happened: A black man had frequently threatened a bartender with killing him. One day the black man, named Charlie, was drunk and he went to the bartender and wanted to force him to give him credit. The bartender, named Joe, refused, and due to this he killed him by thrusting a knife in his heart and blood ran all over the bar.
