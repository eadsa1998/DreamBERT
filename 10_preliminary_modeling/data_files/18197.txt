I was going with my mother and my little brother, who's about 9 or 10, into this hobby shop in the shopping center here to look for some sort of present for my daughter for Xmas. What I especially wanted to look at were these wooden puzzles and we went into the hobby shop and looked around at these various things, and then we saw these wooden puzzles. They had on them the age level that would probably be able to work them. So I saw some that I thought would be too complicated for her to work, the age level on them was such that she should have been able to. So I was looking at them and thinking I would come back sometime and get them. Then as we kept walking around in there, I saw several tops for my daughter, sort of little glass tops that I decided to get. I noticed that they must not be doing too well because they were setting up sort of a children's shoe and clothing store along with their toys and educational things and hobby stuff. I was disappointed because I enjoyed going out there and I knew it wasn't going to be as much of a hobby shop as it had been.
