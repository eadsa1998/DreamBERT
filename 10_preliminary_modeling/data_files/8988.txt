I am with a group of mothers. We all have elementary age school children. They are all participating in a play, all just bit parts. They each have a few minutes tops. I made a suggestion for improving something. We went to pick up our children. There were a lot of people around. We all arrived at about the same time. As we entered the building I headed to the left and everyone else kept going straight. Someone told me I was headed the wrong direction. They said I need keep going straight. There was as woman sitting at a table. We had to sign something to be able to pick up our children. The thing that she had for us to sign was a line-notepad that was approximately 3 x 5 inches. The pad was attached to a holder that was made of blue plastic and shaped somewhat like an isosceles triangle. She had all of our names listed on it and we just had to sign by our printed name.
