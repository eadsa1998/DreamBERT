As I sat at the table, there were no dishes or utensils at my place. I took a piece of bread to spread with potted meat. There was no one at the place next to me. I started to remove the setting to my place, then thought perhaps they wanted me there so mother wouldn't be alone. ...No food. I call to F. at end of table but it is hard to make him hear but finally he passes me a heaping dish of rice sprinkled with red peppers, etc. As I eat large pieces of red and green gelatin appear.
