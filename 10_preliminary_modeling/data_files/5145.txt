I am in a living room, apparently mine and my new boyfriend and his 4-year-old son are with me. I am seated in an easy chair trying to clean up the area around me. It seems that lots of Charla's toys and junk from Ellie living there are piled up in the corner. The boy wants to play with his toys, but there is no room until I get the other stuff picked up. Now Ellie comes in and wordlessly starts picking up things. She pulls down the Christmas lights from the wall and other old decorations. It is way past Christmas. This is encouraging. I say I want to talk with her. The boyfriend realizes we need privacy and says he'll go to the other room for a while. Now Ellie and I sit side by side on another couch and I am very angry at her and I am slapping her face, only now Ellie is a tiny baby and I slap her face over and over. Now we decide to go upstairs to my bedroom for more privacy and Ellie leads the way upstairs. It is hard to walk up the stairs and the entry way is a cubby hole, not a door, which makes it physically hard to even get in. Then after we hunch down to crawl through, we have to step on a rickety ladder of sorts built up with like video or CD cassettes in a wooden rack which my boyfriend had built for me. That angers me too. Why did I choose such a difficult entryway to my own comfortable and nice room? [BL]
