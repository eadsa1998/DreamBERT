Me and my sister Lori were driving a van that belonged to my dad. We went to this old apartment complex, that we lived in with my mom when Lori was a baby. We were in the back area where I used to play when I was a child, but it was different. There were 3 swimming pools, 2 for adults and 1 for children. It was also more garden-like instead of all concrete, as I remembered it. The grouchy old apt. manager came out and screamed at us. She threatened to call the police. We were in the apt we used to have and a boy that lived in the apt. across the way was peeking through the window blinds. It gave Lori the creeps but I told her to relax. After all, he's just a kid. Then the grouchy manager woman came in screaming again and asked us how we got past security. I tried to explain to her that I just wanted to show Lori where we used to live, but the grouchy woman wouldn't listen. She had a gun. It was a bad neighborhood and she was convinced we were hoodlums. We left. We tried to get out of there as fast as we could. A black guy was driving the van and a bunch of other people were in there. I didn't have my seatbelt on and I went flying backwards. One of the back doors flew open and I was hanging on to it for dear life. I was dangling above the pavement. The van was moving pretty fast and I was screaming for the guy driving to stop. He said, "Just hang in there baby. You can climb back in." I shouted, "No I can't; my arms aren't that strong." The van came to an abrupt stop and I went flying in. Everyone was laughing (except for me).
