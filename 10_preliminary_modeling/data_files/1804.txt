I come to a Halloween party dressed as Marilyn Monroe in my hot pink dress, wig and mask. A man is waiting impatiently for me to arrive. I slink into the room, very sexy. He looks, but then glances at the back door and says, "Where's B?" He didn't recognize me. I feel pleased that I'm hearing him pine for me. Then he points out the window. There is a river out there and a tree. A branch has been carved to look like a horse's head with the branch continuing out of its mouth. (You have a drawing here.) It drops a black package into the river. The man wants the thing, and without thinking I dive into the river and get the package. The woman thinks I'm brave. I get out of the river and go to a room to dry off and fix myself up, only I'm not very wet which is surprising. Now I'm doing some dishes with my daughter (Paulina). I get a steel wool coil caught in my fingernail. We work at removing it. Then I'm lying on a couch and my "favorite" baby is laying on my tummy and we are talking.
