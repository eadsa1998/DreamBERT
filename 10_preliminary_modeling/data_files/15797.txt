I forgot I had a job on and ran around to get ready for it but was already over an hour late, and it was at a place an hour away. I was really stressed and annoyed. There was then another job flying out across the country. It was quite late and I had this little bike thing (that was near on the ground) and I was driving Mikhail, so he was on the back. Hector pulled up next to us in a van and said it was too dangerous to drive it and then I wondered why I had it in the first place.
