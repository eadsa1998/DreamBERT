["Nate in the photo"]  A woman has taken a photo of Nate and I and another woman. She shows it to me. It is already printed up in a newspaper. I like the picture, but I am uneasy. I say to her that Nate and I used to be lovers and maybe his wife will see the picture and put it together. Nate comes in and I show him the picture, explaining what I told the woman. He smiles and says it's probably OK to print the picture. Since the other woman is in the middle between us, the wife won't figure it out. It looks perfectly normal and explainable.
