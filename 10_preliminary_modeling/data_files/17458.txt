A movie.  For some reason, after it was over, we stayed.  My longtime friend Kip climbed over from the back and sat a few chairs away from me.  I tried to encourage him to sit closer.  He got something ready and made it look like he had huge eyes, with plastic bags, or something.  He went down 'on stage', as it seemed they were now performing a play.  A black army man flying by deflated his eyes.  I moved closer to see better and had to worry about blocking the aisles- they had them closed so the performers could move through.  I was about to move but someone told me it was okay.  Then, they brought out two guys from Dawson's Creek.  They were allowing some people to come up and get their 'prom kisses'.  It seemed many guys wanted to as well, but they objected to that.  One of the guys turned around and said I should tell him if I wanted in.  But I wouldn't cheat on my boyfriend Jeremy, although I guess there was some slight appeal.  Then a little black kid nearby asked me to meet him somewhere outside, he'd bring his one-inch ball, and we'd play something.  I did my best to decline, and told my mother as we were leaving.  I saw him again, so I asked him a question.  We got in an elevator.  It went forward and back, and side to side, then one side opened up.
