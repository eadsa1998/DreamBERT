The setting of this dream was in a woods on a late summer afternoon. I was walking down a path through the trees seemingly as I recollect, with some sort of problem on my mind. As I was walking along I gradually became aware of a scantily clad girl walking a short distance ahead of me. As I was looking up at her with some degree of surprise at her attire she turned around and smiled at me and began running on ahead. I started to give chase running faster and faster but never quite catching up to her. The dream ended with this little game of run and chase with an emission. The girl in this dream is not recognizable although I remember that she had blond hair which may or may not be representative of an acquaintance.
