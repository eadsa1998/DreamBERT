The dream took place in a place that was familiar to me but I couldn't tell what it was. All of the people in the dream were friends of mine, close to my age. It was a pleasant feeling. It was something that could happen in real life, but probably wouldn't. We were all just hanging out and talking and one of the guys pulled me aside and started telling me how much he was attracted to me and how beautiful I was. I got embarrassed and turned away. Then he turned my face back and kissed me. It could happen but considering the guy in the dream it probably wouldn't.
