I'm in a religious parade in Peru and am hungry and thirsty, and see dried tomatoes nearby and each has a speck of moisture. Parade goes by an abandoned city like "Macchu-Piccu" with buildings--pyramid and sphere and rectangle. I leave the parade and go into last big square. It is dark and dust is 3 feet deep. I walk slowly and go past an empty throne and see golden glow at far end. It is magic-scientists who wear white jackets like TV MD's and they turn pennies into gold on lathes. I go back to a queen on the throne and she says to me, "Rescue the royal crowns." She hits a lever by her throne and a cube of water rises in air like green jello and below the quivering water in the air is a rectangle hole about 8' deep. I must obey the queen, so I jump in and as I touch the gold and silver crowns, the water descends over me and I know I have died again. I took sides as the Guru warned, and I had only 24 more hours of life when I was promised immortality.
