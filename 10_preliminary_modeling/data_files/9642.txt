       Father Andrew enters with a group of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergymen; he is wearing his blue/white robes. He rushes to close the doors and I try to help. I try to repack a package of food, eggs, chickens, etc. for the poor. Nevena (his daughter) helps me. - Later: climb up a LADDER with Frank to show him the Church. See a pocket gopher nearby.
