I am in Russia. traveling. A mountain blows up, fire comes out of its frozen sides. I go to investigate. Multi-colored blobs of lava come out and fire sprays up. It's a volcano and it is melting the ice cap. The water is rising very quickly. I decide I need a boat. I conjure up one and row. The entire world is now nearly underwater. The water is smooth but deep. I row up to Moscow. The buildings will soon be covered with water. There isn't anybody or anything around as the water covers the earth.
