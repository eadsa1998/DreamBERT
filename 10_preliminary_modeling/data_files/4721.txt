["Sharon's mother."] I am outside a house. Preparing for something. We'd been making decorations and signs and so on for some meeting. I need a little break from all the noise and people. I pace back and forth in the drive way. There is a pack of nuts. I want to eat them all. But I only eat some, so I don't mess with my diet. I realize Sharon's mother is coming to help with the preparations. For some reason, I don't want to meet with her, but I must. So I put the nuts down in the garage and walk out to the driveway to meet her. She is going to create a thing that will go on the roof of the house. It will incorporate a boy who created a special dance step.
