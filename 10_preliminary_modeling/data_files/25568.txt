 I'm at senior at Armstrong High School. I go to school late at 7:45am. It is raining outside. I take the Pantown Metro Bus. It costs 30 cents. I borrow a nickel for bus fare from a woman with many facial piercings. I am taking the school bus. I think of how I am a senior and am still taking the bus, but also how I can get off the bus first then, to avoid the embarrassment of being seen taking the bus. My friend Niles Zelling is on the bus. My sister Heather is on the phone at home. She is late too. One of the people at the bus stop asks if they can store their coins in Tea Hall at Brimson. I say I think that would be okay. Our bus driver is black. We get to the place we're going, which is a destination like on the Australia trip, rather than school. I eat apricots and cookies. I eat two cookies at a time. My friends Nat Miller and Kevin Simpson are there. Kevin and I wrestle. He kicks with both legs at once! He is aggressive, and tough. I leave my jacket, brown hat, and backpack on the bus. I need to have the bus door open to get them.
