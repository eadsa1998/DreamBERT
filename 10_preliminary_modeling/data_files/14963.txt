I was at Dad's new house. The doors had mesh and were very weak and weren't attached properly. I went in with Rover and found his penguin toy. Three worker guys were at the front door. I went 'blblbl' loudly and scared them. We laughed. Then I was at this place which had quests. I got one where I had to make some pot. I asked Mom what to do and Darren did it for me -- it was created on a nail file thing. It burned quick. I was almost at the place to hand it in, but I failed as I was on a time limit. The next quest I got I had to get a stylish outfit and got to some restaurant. I got a white men's shirt. Mr Stevenson was outside. My shirt had buttons on the side and he said that for the buttons on the front, I was allowed to have the bottom button undone. I saw Samantha around. There was a 'baby' Bart Simpson (The Simpsons) and everyone was like "Oh my God, he's so cute!".
