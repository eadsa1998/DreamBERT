There was a monkey crying to be taken on her lap, but the lady who had acted as its mother was gone. I had asked him to type my manuscript or he had offered to and he was reading from handwritten copy to check. I told him to insert 'the' in one place and why. Then I saw the typescript was _ inch thick but alas it was single spaced with inadequate margins. I was trying to decide whether I should ask him to do it over or take it to a professional typist and feeling quite annoyed when I realized it was a dream and awoke.
