I dreamed I was standing on a dock when my friend Bill Randol came up with a brown inboard runabout that he had found for me to buy. He said it was $3500. I said it was more than I wanted to pay for a boat, but I bought it anyway. Bill and I were going to take my mother and grandmother for a ride. They both got in and Bill and I were standing on opposite sides of the boat in waist deep water. When I hoisted myself up on the side of the boat it catapulted my grandmother out into the water on my side. I pulled her back and got her back in the boat. This time I let Bill get in his side first with the result that my mother went overboard the same way my grandmother had. We tried it again simultaneously, but I was heavier and my grandmother went over. I let go and Bill's side went down and pitched my mother out. It was getting to be a nightmare of frustration and I woke up.
