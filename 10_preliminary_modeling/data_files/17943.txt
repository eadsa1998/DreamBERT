My friend Ray took me to a class with him, as they were watching a movie.  The movie had already started so we had trouble getting in, but then the woman was nice enough to even back up the movie for us.  I was supposed to meet some people for dinner.  Ray wanted to go out with some friends.  I was trying to decide which way to go while we were leaving the theatre when I realized I'd forgotten my purse and had to go back for it.  Then there was some event with pictures being taken- perhaps a wedding, as there was a couple as the focus.  I was looking at the picture with someone.  They were asking about people in the picture, one being my mother's old bowling teammate Glenda.  The person wasn't able to recognize people like they should have, people they knew.  I discovered my English online friend Ron in the picture, wearing an orange wedding dress, I think.  I was on a walk with my mother and maternal Grandma Jane, and we passed Ron's house.  It was across from a water's edge and we decided it was 'appropriately hippy'.  I was somewhat upset, though, that he and his friend Mary had come to town without telling me so we could visit.  Later back in the house I was looking at the picture again, trying to identify Mary.  She had black hair and looked something like Christina Ricci.  Off to the left through a window I saw her with a friend, waving at us.  At some point I was pretending to play an invisible guitar, as realistically as I could.
