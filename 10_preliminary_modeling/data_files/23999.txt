I had a weird dream. I was living in a small, tiny, old house with my family. There was this Victorian house next door. My mom's best friend and her family decided to move in. My dad wanted to move in next door to us. There was this big fight about it. My dad became extremely angry. My mom's friend ignored him and moved in next door. That made him so angry, he became violent! He wanted that house, and would do anything to get it. My mom became worried, thinking that my dad might try and do something to her friend and her family. So we moved in, sold our house. We were living with them for about a year when my dad decided to move into our old house, still trying to get back at my mom's friend for what she did. He wouldn't leave her alone. He was obsessed with her.
