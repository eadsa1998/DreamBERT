I was in my house getting ready for bed with my mom and I heard the door open. I ran to the front door and saw four black figures. The four black figures walked slowly closer to me. Each foot they put forward, I put back. Then the alien - one of the four black figures -tried to grab me. I pushed them out the door locking it right after I closed it. I ran to the telephone and the phone was dead. The next day at school a kid (and a man) came up to me talking, and one said, "I am an alien, too. Don't be scared, I won't hurt you because you are an alien too!" I backed up and ran. Setting: The first setting was in my house in my room and the living room. The next setting was at my school, My school. Characters: My mom; I have no idea who the four black figures were, the kid at my school was a boy named Bob, I did not know the other man who came up to me talking. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, surprised. When the four black figures came into my house I was scared and worried about my mom. And when the kid and a guy told me I was an alien, I was surprised.
