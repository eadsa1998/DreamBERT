I dreamt that I entered a room and met my good friend (m, 20) at a table. I think there were other fellows sitting at the table. Maybe they were playing cards. As I sat down my eyelash fell to my lap which caused me great excitement. I think I screamed. I was met by a great deal of laughter from my friend which infuriated me. I immediately jumped up and ran to the mirror where I saw that my eyelash had not fallen out, but it was only an imitation eyelash that had dropped to my lap.
