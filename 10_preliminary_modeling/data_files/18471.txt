I was suppose to go to the psychiatrist office and there was a maze of hallways. The hallways were shaped like stiff angular letters of the alphabet. Some were dead ends. I was leading a horse down the hallway and sometimes he didn't want to go so I just had to wait for him. I was too early for the psychiatrist. I kept peeking into the offices on the hallway. There was a door about every 5 feet. A lady was at the desk. She handed me this big cup (like a big gulp cup) and said, "We're going to test you for 3 chemical deficiencies." I knew she meant for me to pee in the cup. I didn't say anything. I just kept looking at her like I understood what she meant, but when I opened the door to go to the bathroom, I walked away. Fast. I thought, "Well, that certainly wasn't the psychiatrist office." I walked back where I came from to find the psychiatrist. I was still leading horsey. I saw this office door and there was a second little doorway in front of the desk. Newspaper was taped 2/3 or 1/2 down over the doorway and you could see somebody's feet. I hadn't seen him before but I knew it was him.
