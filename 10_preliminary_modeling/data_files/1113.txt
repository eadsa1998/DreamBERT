I'm going to a series of interesting classes and movies. Raul and I go to a movie. A woman directs the movie. I say, "Hey, this is live acting, not a movie!" Someone pulls a movie screen down so part of it is a movie, and part of it is live. Hank comes out to play the piano. I'm surprised. I didn't know he played the piano! The director asks me and the audience what kind of monsters we want. "Creepy crawly crabs or supermen monsters?" I say, "Oh! The crabs." I don't want to see supermen monsters! Raul and I leave and go to another movie. It's on the women's side so I have to sneak him in. He says he realizes that I'm right and he has much to learn. I feel glad he finally has stopped ignoring my worth. We are great friends and I help him. In one seminar, there is a discussion of nutrition. I ask them to repeat it. I missed it. Then George has to go to a class at an earlier time. He's upset at first and then agrees that it's a good learning experience. He laughs and says, "Well, think about the elderly people. They have to get on the train and go and they don't complain. I guess I can." The class is over and I am trying to read many interesting books on fascinating subjects. One is about the French psychology. I try to read two books at once. I feel sexual excitement and I try to button up my jeans. I feel an orgasm.
