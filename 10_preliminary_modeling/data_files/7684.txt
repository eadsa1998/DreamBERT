I was walking with two other people. I don't know why or where. We entered an empty or closed business. The man I was with went to the kitchen and made us all sandwiches. I felt bad that we were stealing but ate the sandwich anyway because I was very hungry. This time I was with a different man. The other 2 people I was with before shot and killed four people in this building because they had found us there when we weren't supposed to be there. This other man and I were trying to escape over some hills. I kept thinking that even though I didn't kill the people I was guilty by association.
