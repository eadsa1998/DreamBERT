I went to use a bathroom. There were three stalls. Two of them were in use. I didn't go into the third one because I could tell it was pretty unkempt, very unclean. I started to leave. Someone saw me leaving and asked me something. I didn't want to say anything about the third stall so I just said that I was coming back in a little bit.
