Mrs. ? says she has invited us to stay. I think she thinks I'm trying to ? her. I explain about N.D.'s cake and then she's really hinting about our paying. I go to bathroom picking up a cake of white soap. Lock door but a girl enters. I ask her how. She leaves, others try to enter. I push one out, find doorway has two doors, bolt the other but others keep crowding in. Much trouble pushing one out. Then I wonder shall I bathe or sponge as Doctor said last week.
