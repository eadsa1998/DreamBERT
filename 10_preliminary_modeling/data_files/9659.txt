       We are waiting for baptism to begin: see huge vaulted ceiling: looked like Sistine Chapel... see paintings in color: see figures of CHRIST, like Michelangelo's Last Judgment... see huge white hand, left one, rejecting those who rejected His teaching; I say to myself: "Why create fear in the worshipper? Why not base it on LOVE?" I imagine CHRIST with outstretched arms! <br/
