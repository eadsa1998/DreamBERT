It seems like I had given a nutrition test and one of the girls, who is about 20 yrs old and a physical education major, had taken it and had not passed. She asked me if there wasn't some thing she could do about it. I told her that if she could give the seven essential food substances I would pass her. She had a lot of difficulty trying to list them. I was really very surprised and couldn't understand why she should be having so much trouble. She named "buttermilk" and I asked "what is wrong with whole milk?" She finally did name every thing.
