 There is a fight between Americans and Mexicans or Spanish people. There is a Mexican boy. He has two emaciated brothers, dying of AIDS. The boy can't help them, so he learns bravery and fighting, and helps his father break out of prison. He uses a long light bulb as a weapon. He kills several prison guards. Everyone is dying. A woman from the Food and Drug Administration tries to break in. The boy catches her and takes her gun. The gun holds two bullets. The woman had three clips of two bullets each. The boy's friend points the gun at the woman's head. The father of the boy, who may be me, holds his hand on the arm of the boy with the gun, so as to not make the boy shoot. But the father doesn't push the boy's arm away. The boy fires the gun. The bullets pop out of the gun and drop to the floor. The woman is scared to death. The boy who fired the gun thinks this is funny. I am the father, and I am enraged! I beat the boy, who is my son's friend. I nearly kill him. I pick him up by the feet. He is very light. I swing his body into the wall, which seems like the arch between the living and dining rooms at home. I kick my son and his friend out of the house. They may go to live with the other boy's mother. I am mad! There is a piano bench. I move it, slamming it down. Someone calls me Taco Bill. The woman from the FDA is my friend Norman's friend Sunny Pile. She is there. I am in a bad mood. We quickly take the lights off the Christmas tree. The tree is sparsely decorated.
