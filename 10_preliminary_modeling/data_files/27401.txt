I am sitting at a long table similar to those found in T living. The room appears to be one found in SBL. I am working on my English Source theme. There are a few people at the table, but I'm not sure of their identity or sex. One of them has some cards which contain information for a source theme. I look them over, thinking that perhaps I can use the information, when someone tells me that it concerns E. (My theme deals with the A C) I see a woman and her little girl approaching. I remember thinking there was something very odd about the little girl. Her face was very different looking as were her clothes. I saw her features and those of her mother very clearly, yet they were totally unfamiliar to me. Her mother addresses her as The Princess. The little girl goes to put out a book, but a man enters the scene. I think he prevented her from taking the book. I remember that the little girl kept smiling. She appeared to be about seven or eight years old. The dream gets confused here. There seems to be a conspiracy to see that no one leaves the library alive. But, without speaking, there seems to be an agreement between the librarian and me to see that I leave unharmed.
