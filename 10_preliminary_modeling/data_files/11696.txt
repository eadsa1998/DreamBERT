I was at Mom's and there was a video camera hanging down from the balcony and the screen was playing a movie with Quincy and a girl having sex. Evil lepers came like zombies toward the house. We ran inside, and my class from 2003 was there. We were all trying not to get touched, because the lepers broke in. I got touched, as did Devin and two others. We went on an excursion, and Devin and I had to sit out.
