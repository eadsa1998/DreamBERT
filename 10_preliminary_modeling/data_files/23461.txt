This dream involved Alex (a man who works next door to my workplace) and had a lot to do with time and work for me. It was early in the morning. I was at my parents' house, leaving for work or just stopping there, I'm not sure, on my way to work. I worked in a mall-type place. I was upstairs in an office -- an attorney firm -- and I was talking to a woman about a party or a plan to have a party. It was 5:50 am. I felt there and walked into Alex√ïs shop. It was a huge place, like a restaurant, I said hello to him and he said hello, "Hey, you can go get some espresso since it's 10 to 6," (because we were supposed to have lunch). I realized then how early it was and I felt good about being up and out so early. Alex was working on an elaborate structure (he's a sculptor) and it was to be a party of the party or event I was discussing earlier. It was actually hung outside his shop in this mall-type place -- it was huge -- two rows of gigantic musical notes and clefs in sliver, blue and white enamel. I was impressed with it and was surprised by how much work had been done since I last saw him. I told him I thought it was great and we were discussing it in greater detail -- he was telling me how he had to strip it, then glue it, then paint this enamel on, etc.
