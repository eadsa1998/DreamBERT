Ronnie Engles was coming to visit Mother and my sister Nancy and me in my hometown.  I met him somewhere, and he and I were walking along the drainage ditch behind the Riles Bridge Apartments on the way home.  I remember telling him how he wouldn't recognize Nancy. It was either him or Bonita with whom I was riding to my hometown, in a car driven by Aunt Wilma or Aunt Aimee or Bettina May Rawlls.  We were supposedly coming from a long distance, but it turned out to be only MixJunction-and the trip was awfully short even for that.  In the course of about a 10-minute conversation we found ourselves in a familiar neighborhood in my hometown.
