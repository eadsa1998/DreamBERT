I win the Academy Award for a movie I'm in. Afterwards, I rush to the library to do research I'm interested in. I feel quite proud that I choose not to join my well wishers in a fun party, but go right on with my work. I am questioned at the library why I've parked my wheelchair in this one spot. It's not allowed. I tell the woman that I have permission to park there.
