Calvin and I got paired up for something in Biology. Elijah and I were paired up in something else. We had to create what our kids would look like. I don't know what Calvin and I had to do. I went to my room to get textas. I don't remember who, but someone said "Who's that noob on my bed?". Dad was in his room. Mom was in the games room.
