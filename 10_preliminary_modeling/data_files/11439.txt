There was a reunion at my high school just before finals. It was announced that alumni would be allowed to take the high school finals as practice for their own finals. This was explained to me and a friend of mine by two female students who were in my high school graduating class. We were standing by the men's room near my home room. I entered it and suddenly discovered that the plumbing started flooding. The dream then shifted and I saw water flooding out of Mather administration building. I then seemed to have a blank period and shifted to another unrelated dream. I may have awoken at this point. I'm not sure.
