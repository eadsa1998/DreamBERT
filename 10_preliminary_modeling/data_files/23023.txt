I was somewhere with Gil Arnaldo, in a new house, unfurnished.  There were some other people around -- maybe other former classmates -- but Gil is the only one I remember.  His wife was there too, but I only saw here for a short time.  Most of the time she was in the bathroom getting ready to go to the airport.  I remembered her name as being "Rusty," but in the dream it was "Gail."  She was taking Gil to the airport, or he was taking her, I'm not sure.
