I had a dream about doing the Maori exercise with my CRHP sisters. I don't know where we were. We were in a large room and we were sitting at a table formed in a circle. Rosalie C was there and so was Scott S from church. He was baking things like popcorn and muffins for us. I have no idea why he was there. He and Rosalie C said we were all getting these coupons for a store at the mall. We could use them to get things free- over and over. Popcorn and muffins. So we. I explained about the Maori drawing. Then started drawing with the lights very dim. I let them go too long. When we got done, I suggested we take a ten-minute break because the next part would take ten to fifteen minutes per person. When we got back together from the break, I noticed how elaborate some of the drawings were. I had forgotten to tell them to draw a circle first, yet many of them had done that and drawn the symbols in the circle. I started to give them the rest of the instructions, but they wanted us all to hold hands and walk in a circle while I was doing this. I stayed outside the circle while they did it. I told them I needed to stand still while I was reading it. When I got ready to pull my own drawing out, I told them they could share as much or as little as they like. I said I would show them mine from a distance and point out some things. God, toys, children, family. When I spoke of specific things in mine, there was a basketball game on it. I said it was there because of the large audience that I felt represented ministering to the public. Karen E made a joke about the game, I think asking me who was playing, and I said I didn't know. Then I realized it was Naphoo vs. Yahoo playing at the Plantation Bowl. Cliff S was also in the room but was sitting on the floor along a sidewall.
