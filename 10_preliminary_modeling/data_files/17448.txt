A wide elephant sale.  I looked around the gym at some old colonial dresses.  Thought about buying a raincoat with a large clock in it that would talk when you hit the shoulder.  I moved on to look at the toys.  My Littlest Petshop, on a farm.  The animal poops and you use it as fertilizer.  I thought it was gross.  I went back to get the coat and all the clothes were gone.
