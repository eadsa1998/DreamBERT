I am walking on Rosary Avenue in San Isidro. I am going to some specific place. I encounter many obstacles, which leads me to cross the street (two dogs, tree branches, mud). I meet Armand and he asks me to accompany to his home for a while. He lived in a building on that same street on the sixth floor. But on the first floor there was a record shop and people start arriving to shop. I feel impatient to see Armand's house, which I did not know and to go and do what I had to do, but Armand is delayed with the records. I try to go alone, but he asks me to wait for him. Facts: I awoke suddenly with the noise of the vacuum cleaner. Armand lives on Choquehuanca and I go to his home often.
