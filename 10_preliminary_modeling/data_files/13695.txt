This guy had a little apartment. His friend caught up with him and then he left. The friend and I went back in. The guy was coming back and I hid in the shower. His friend tried to distract him and I had to move under this thing (that was like a bed). His daughter and her friend heard me and took a box that I was hiding behind away. Eventually the guy got distracted and I ran out. Then the guy came out and the daughter had told him I was in there. It had happened once before. I think the first time, Christopher Ryan was in the shower.
