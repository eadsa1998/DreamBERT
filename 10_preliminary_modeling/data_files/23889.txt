Many little dreams.  I was moving in Chatsworth, moving out, it was toward the end of my stay in L.A.  It was hilly, narrow streets, tall houses, looked like Chatsworth, my street.  John F was there, helping me move.  I ran errands and wrapped things up.  Still couldn't find my way around too well, too new there still.  Madison (my second dog) was also present, as a responsibility only, I didn't really see her, but there was a need to take consideration for her needs during my move errands and work.  At one point, John was driving me on an errand.  He went a new way home, in the hilly area like Chatsworth, it was a way I had never known about, didn't know I could go that way home, so I was glad he found it, because I was a little lost.  But when we got back home, I realized that he had made a figure 8 around town and back to the house, it seemed more confusing than a shortcut then, like inefficient, or just surprising, a waste of time after all, when I thought it was a shortcut.  I didn't say anything to him.
