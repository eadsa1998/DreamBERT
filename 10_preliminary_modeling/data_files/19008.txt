Just before the second awakening I dreamt that I knew I was going to be awoken, so I said to myself, "Remember or start remembering everything that happens." Well, the only thing that occurred was, right off the name was said, I can't remember it now, but I heard a name and I started to remember names. I said it to myself. Then I was awoken and was not able to remember before this point. Things vaguely come back like I recall seeing people flying in two-seater planes. I vaguely recall shooting pool with somebody else who I don't recognize or remember who. Again, prior to awakening, it seemed like the setting was confined to something that was closely recognized as a green in golf like my first dream.
