I was at my birth home. We were playing in the woods near the trees with the swings. I don't remember everyone who was there. Bruce W was there. I was getting ready to swing and Bruce W warned me not to get on that one. The chain supporting it was about to break. I went to one of the other swings, a plastic one, and began to lie on my stomach on the swing.
