In daylight, I am with a group of people walking along a road or trail. It is as if we are refugees. I walk next to a woman who is old and smelly, who has a heart condition. I do not want to be near her and move on. We finally arrive at our destination. At a picnic table I sit with a young boy who is looking through a thick book about war. He is reading the section about Vietnam. I look at the pictures with him. Several NV A soldiers have dragged two dead GI's into a street and are castrating them. Then the images become real, and we are caught up in an NV A attack. It is dark and difficult to see and they are over running our position. I hear screaming and bullets and a grenade explodes near me. Moments later an NV A comes over the berm and bayonets me. I wake up.
