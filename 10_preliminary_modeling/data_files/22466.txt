In my dream I remembered the previous day in which I unwillingly hit a friend at a picnic, because even though she betrayed me as a friend, I didn't hold a grudge against her. I felt badly because when I went to apologize, although I had done it by chance and without thinking about what she had done to me, knowing that she meant to harm me. She refused my apologies. I thought that these are things in life which I have to accept and that I don't hold a grudge against her, although I am proud and that if she comes and speaks to me first and accepts that I didn't do it on purpose as a revenge, we could continue our relations without my taking into account the things she did to me.
