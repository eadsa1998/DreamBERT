 I'm in Carter School with my friend Stephen Ramos and my acquaintance Eve Nichols. Eve wants to go up to the roof. Stephen and I walk down several flights of stairs to a door. We walk by some people from Brimson. At the bottom the doors are propped open: they are being worked on. There is a yellow caution ribbon hanging across the hall before the doors. We're not supposed to touch the doors. We leave. Eve catches up with us. She didn't go to the roof, but the roof door was open, she says. I sit in the snow with Stephen and Eve near the entrance of the school. A suburban slowly drives by. I think my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is in it. I pretend not to see her, pretend I don't recognize her. In the end, I don't think it is Annie.
