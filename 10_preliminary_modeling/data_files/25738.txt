 I'm in Carter School. My mom and another woman are at the entrance of the school. My mom plays a Red Hot Chili Peppers song on an acoustic guitar. It is played well, but it seems odd to me because some sexual words or feeling in the song. Each of us needs to pick out a small child from the day care to take with us or to have. I go to do this, and forget the name of my child, a boy, and can't find him. My psychology professor Marianne Stash is in one room with some kids. I feel stupid because I can't remember my boy's name. My friend from high school Marybeth Neumann is there. I don't want to talk to her at all. She shows me the boy that I chose was myself. She shows me a piece of paper with my name on it, among other things. My grade school classmate Tiffany Maples is there. My sister Heather talks to her.
