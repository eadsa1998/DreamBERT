I was atop a mound or plateau of some kind, about 20 feet high.  Connie Hutchinson was at the bottom, and I hauled her up with a rope.  I asked her how things were with Will and she said just the same as before.  I saw Linda Goffman down below and asked her to come up too.  My wife Bonita said it would be rather awkward for her since Linda had dated Will before her.  This came as a surprise to me, so she showed me a fingerprint on a dark place on her hand and said, "Whose fingerprint do you think this is on my proud flesh?"  It was as if to prove her point-although it would have made more sense if the fingerprint had been on Linda.  I guessed correctly that it was Will's, and I wondered at her use of the term "proud flesh"-I had to think about what it meant.  Anyway, I had already invited Linda up, so I hauled her up.
