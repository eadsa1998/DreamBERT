I was in Piura with a friend and we went into a church. The girl's family was there, but they weren't the same; they had different faces, I don't know why. We sat in the first pew and instead of Mass starting, there was a discussion, a debate going on. Suddenly this image disappeared and I was in neighborhood street going to visit a friend. I was sitting at the door because they had put chairs up and I saw that some men were coming to talk. They were from the girl's family, but I didn't know them, and -- I don't know why -- I was scared by the surroundings. I don't know how, I sent for a boy who had been my boyfriend to come and pick me up. When he arrived, he came in a taxi and I immediately asked him if he could take me home. He said he didn't have a car and he wanted to stay around there to have a drink, and if I wanted to, he would find a cab for me. Then I went looking for my friend who was inside the house. I was angry and asked her if she could take me because she had a car, but as she was having tea, she told me to wait a while. Then I became angrier and went out. He was standing at the door and I said something to him, and then the dream became blurry and I don't remember any more.
