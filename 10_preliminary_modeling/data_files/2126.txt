I am hammering a mailbox thing onto a house and only get the left side affixed. Someone (Hank) asks if it will have to hold much weight. I say, "No, only a few letters,"so he gets a belt buckle like platelet and hammers that on. Then I'm going to a two-day workshop and I see lots of people I know coming for the Sat. eve session, former students and relatives. I'm a little embarrassed because they know me. Then the husband of the workshop presenter, who is an older woman in a wheelchair, says he doesn't think she'll come. She's annoyed we haven't set things up right. I know she'll come, and ignore him. Then I open a package that has five packets of pills and lots of miniature things. I take two of the capsules and can't seem to swallow the third, and I have lots left to take. I ask the man how to do this.
