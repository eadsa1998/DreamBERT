I felt like someone was touching me, stroking parts of my body, and stroking my hair all night.  Felt like someone was in the room, walking, at one point.  I felt two women, one on either side of me in bed.  One was younger, one was older.  They were there to give me support and love and wisdom.  There was also a male in the room, further away, and shy or reluctant to come closer.  I felt this stroking all night, different parts of me, mostly my hair.  I kept wanting to wake up fully or discover what it was, but I also didn't want it to stop, it was so unusual.
