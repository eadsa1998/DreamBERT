I am in a room with other women like a dorm sleeping room. One is very large with generous sized butt and breasts, an earth mother of the ancient type where cherubs were chubby and beauty had folds of fat. One woman helped me stand up and then went off to do something. I was upset and told her not to do that because I can't stand up very long before it hurts. A woman says to me, "I am not gay." I say, "Neither am I," feeling embarrassed as though I am "protesting too much." I continue to explain that I have enough trouble with isolation and being held apart because I'm different with disability. I sure don't need to add any more with being gay too!
