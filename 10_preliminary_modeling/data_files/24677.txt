I was skiing on the best slope. It was called PINBALL and it was covered with powder. (My dad, Helen, and Helen's dad were all skiing and having fun.) It was so fun. But then my skis started sinking into it. I kept going until finally my dad pulled me out. Setting: Northstar at Tahoe. Characters: My dad, Helen, Bill (Helen's dad) and myself. They were all skiing and having fun. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. It's sort of scary because I will be skiing at Northstar, in powder probably, and probably on that slope.
