Derek and I are like counselors for two groups. He's with one group and I'm with another. I want to spend time alone with him, but that's impossible. I try to get our groups together so they can help each other out. I see an old man/tiger wandering around a bit lost. I call Derek over to see him and enjoy the pleasure of watching a human struggling with their process. He comes over and we both look down a flight of stairs. The tiger lies on his back and I see he's becoming sexually excited by a young woman. Several strings come out of his penile sheath. I encourage him to go look for a woman to have sex with. He then decides to look around and find one. Now I see Derek and move him to a room where we can be alone. He and I are both standing and I lean on him and hug him, wanting to make love. He stands tall and distant and it is clear he is not interested in me sexually. I am very hurt and run from the room crying. I want to run far away where he'll never see me again and I will cry and cry. But I choose to go to the house next door where his group originated. Both these houses are rotten and old and in bad disrepair. I go in, careful to step so I don't fall through the floor. I know he'll find me soon. I cry.
