We are driving in a car with the family and Jonathan (friend of the family) - we approach a bridge: John does not want to ride across. We can't talk him into riding; he walks away. Then Frank parks car: jumps out, but the car falls into the water. see grey car in the water; it is fished out and all our things are rescued, including a large doll for M; the doll is in a carriage and on the doll is a tag which says: "I AM A SINNER" - we continue our ride; happy.
