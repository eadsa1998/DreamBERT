There was one other brief, very sketchy dream that occurred and I don't know if it was after the last dream or before, sometime during the course of the evening I dreamed of myself going down thru some sort of a tunnel or going through a subterranean door or something and entering a cave or an open cavern. I don't know why I was there. Something proceeded my going in there. Some sort of a story, but I don't know what it was. I can only remember the scene of my being in there and little holes in the floor, four set in a square as on 4 corners of a box. Candles were inserted into these holes, and I had been instructed by someone to light these candles. In the scene was I there lighting these candles. I know that this wasn't a religious celebration of any kind, but rather I was told to do this to keep the animals away. It was some such idea. There was color in this dream. A good deal of it came with the yellow light. I could distinguish the color of the walls, the color of the candles, the color of the light of the candles coming from the candles. I can't identify any emotion or there were no other characters that I can recall, but this one scene which occurred sometime during the night.
