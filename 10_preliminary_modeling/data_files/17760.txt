My boyfriend Jeremy and I were moving in with a necrophiliac family.  Jeremy's friend was hanging from the balcony as I got my granola.  The phone system was set up with extensions; one of the boys complained about being 'everything else' as he didn't have a particular extension; his line was the default if the extension wasn't used to reach someone.  My thought was that at least they would be a quiet family to live with.
