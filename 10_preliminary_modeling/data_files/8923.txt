Time with Taylor. I was attending a very large social event. It seems that I at least knew some of the people there. Taylor Hicks walked up and began talking with me. We either knew each other or had met before. I was just slightly bothered by something that was going on. Taylor was acting as I think any friend would. I don't think he was actually trying to comfort me, because I don't think I was that upset. I suppose I could best describe it as him being very supportive. He was standing to my left yet turned slightly so he could easily see my face. He slipped his right arm around the back of my waist. Even as we walked away together he kept his arm around my waist. I don't think I have ever felt so totally and completely comfortable with someone. It was a feeling of total trust, trusting that he would never judge me no matter what. It was a feeling of complete safety. It was a feeling of genuine love, caring, and acceptance. There was something about the number 600. Going down a gravel road that ran along the right side of a house, when facing the house. I can't get a sense of whether I was in a car or walking. It's almost as though I'm looking down at it from distance, as though I'm floating in the air, and thinking that it is the road I need to go down with Taylor. Along the right side of the road, opposite from the house, there is a wood fence made of 2 x 4's that form an X in each section. The wood is dark brown, just like you would see a picture. It's not a color of natural wood that you would see on an outdoor fence in waking life.
