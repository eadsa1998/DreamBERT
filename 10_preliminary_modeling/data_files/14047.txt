I was playing Runescape and it played out live. I had to run south to this place, but I wasn't totally sure of what to do. People from school were there, including Calvin and Eugene. I started running, but realized I'd forgotten my stuff, so ran back to the bank. After, I started running there again. I saw Eugene, Autumn and a girl go a different way than the guide said, so I followed them. I went down a hill, but I didn't know where to go and Autumn and I went the other way. I later realized that the other way was a shortcut. I got to the place and this girl was there and I think she had some weird disease. I think she tried to have sex with Eugene.
