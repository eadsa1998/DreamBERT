I am in a large meeting room. The dream group is there and we are sort of reading a handout about dream work. I find it very interesting. I am on a bench. We are all seated on this bench against the wall. I am on the left end. Tony comes over and squats next to me on the left side. We talk. He is saying something about a woman he likes or is considering for relationship, but there are some things she's going to have to learn if it's going to work out. He hopes she learns it because he is lonely and would like to have a relationship. I commiserate with him. I let him put his hand on my arm and am aware that I feel fairly relaxed about this close contact. I feel empathy for him as I would like a relationship also. I make a comment that I've had some dreams that are pertinent to the material we are reading and would like some help working them. The group calls on the writer of the material to come and work with us and my dreams specifically. He comes. It is Jeremy. He sits on the bench several people to my right and I realize that he has made a special trip over just to work on my material just because I requested it. I feel some guilt around that, taking up all the attention and the time. He and the group seem just fine with it. It is my problem that I am feeling guilt. So I stand to start telling some of the dream material. I turn to face the people on the bench and see at the far right end (now the left as I am facing it) a double door, open to the church area. I see a huge black spider on the door and feel queasy. I look in and see an identical spider on the yellow sign on the curtain behind the altar. This seems scary, perhaps that means there are more and closer to me. I look around and see a third one in the room with me. I see a large set of holes in the stone or cement wall at the base of the wall where they can come in.
