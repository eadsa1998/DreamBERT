 I'm in a basketball game. The game is very sloppy. It is largely unorganized. I get fouled, and a man gets in my face to argue. The referees call a technical foul on the man. I shoot some free throws. I line my feet up unevenly, and miss the first free throw. The referee calls me up add tells me to keep my back straight and upright, and to follow through. I re-align my feet. The referee says to bank in the free throw. I do what he says, and bank it in. I narrowly miss the next free throw. The game is suck sloppy confusion and disorganization.
