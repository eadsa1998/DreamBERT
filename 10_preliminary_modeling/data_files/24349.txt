I was in the lobby of what seemed like the police station I cover, with the turnstiles and security check-in counter. I was waiting in line, like at the post office. Take a number and wait your turn. Though the people there seemed to all know each other, and I was new to it all. They were part of an almost cult-like summer job program. I didn't care much because I felt I was above the program, that they were likely getting scammed. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and believed all the great things they had to say, if only so I could get in and find out the truth. I was let past the turnstile to see the program's bearded director, who reminded me of the deputy commissioner of the police department. He said I could go ahead and join the program, if only for a few days a week, if I wanted. I said sure, why not.
