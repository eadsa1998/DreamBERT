["Manna from heaven."] I am hungry. I see Bill Clinton's face in the sky. He is doing a spell to pull fish from something. I see a long line of fish coming out and falling to earth. They come near where I am. I wait eagerly for a fish to fall near me so I can eat it. As I watch, the fish turn into seals. One lands on a tall white church on a ledge, then 4 or 5. They will get away. If I don't hurry and catch them.
