I was in bed and I heard a weird scratching noise, then this grill next to my bed opened and Mittens came on to my bed. I was wondering where the grill came from and I told Dad. He did this spiffy thing to my roller shutters and checked out the front to see if anyone was out there. I went out to the family room and Mom was there. She was going to go outside to clear a table for something she was going to do. I saw a guy in the dining room and he pointed a gun at me, then at Mom. I said "Why is Aragorn [something I don't remember]?". Then Dad came out too. The guy made us put these shirts on, then he was Ezra and it was the future or an alternate universe. He was a bad guy. We were on a space ship. Ezra was watching 24 and I realized that I'd missed two episodes of season four. There were faces of characters on a computer screen. I saw Tony and Barry Landes and was thinking about The Hitcher and "I can't believe that's creepy dude!". Dad and I were saying "Yeah" like Tony. Then it was third person, and there was this big room. Betty and Daniel (both Ugly Betty) were there and he got shot and all these flower petals were falling from the roof.
