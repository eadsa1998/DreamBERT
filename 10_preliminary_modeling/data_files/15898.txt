I can't remember why, though I kept thinking it had something to do with Big Brother, but Tristan and I ended up in this little hallway with 8 rooms that were 'mirrored'. I chose #4 because I 'liked the number' and Tristan chose another on the same side. We wondered what the mirroring meant. Frederick went to Russia and we wondered why, but he had been in this movie and his leading lady was Russian and we deduced he'd had an affair. When we jokingly mentioned it to someone, there were apparently rumours about it and this had confirmed it. I was in New York or something and staying with these people. I was given a room close to everything, but then this lady moved me to the end room. She was trying to rush me but I was trying to log off the computer and she was like 'oh, you have an account' and I thought maybe she was planning something dodgy but this ruined her plans. The room I went to and the house was similar to our place in Parkville. The room was big though and had three different curtains and I was trying to pull them all to cover the window. I could see the city and it was a dark night, so I could see all the lights and it looked similar to my town. Then it was like a movie and this young girl was looking after this old guy in bed as he was coughing and having pains. I think it was her father. Later, she was in bed coughing as he looked after her. It turned out they were 'emotional vampires', though actually took blood from people using these sucker things and they were immortal. I was sitting on a chair somewhere and there were these starfish. They moved really slowly and would like put one of their 'feet' up and stay there for like 10 seconds and then move it. One started climbing up the chair and touched me and I freaked out and jumped up.
