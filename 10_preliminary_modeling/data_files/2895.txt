I watch, and sort of am, a wife with a 2-year-old toddler who gets into everything, messes up her toys and refuses to help pick them up. The wife is angry and tired and insists the child help clean up. I/her pick up the child and carry her screaming to a day care center or a time out place. She is throwing a temper tantrum. The husband, sort of Nate, is annoyed and unwilling to help out. I act as a mediator and am very tolerant of his traditional male views that women's job is in the home and man's work is outside the home. I try to reason with them both. Someone cries and cries in grief.
