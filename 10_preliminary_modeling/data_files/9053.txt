I was Aunt H and Aunt P's house. Aunt H's health had been declining and she was having more and more trouble doing things herself, especially getting around the house. They told me that she mostly just stays in the one room anymore. While I was there she became much worse and apparently wasn't expected to live much longer. She was in her bed. Her children, their spouses, and Aunt P were all in her bedroom and had the door closed. The grandchildren and great-grandchildren were all there but they didn't want them in the bedroom. Someone said they were calling Aunt J so she could come. I asked if anyone had called my mother. At first no one answered me. Finally someone said they hadn't called her and didn't intend to because they didn't want her there. They didn't want to be around her. I was very upset by this. I understood them not wanting to be around her, but was still angry because Aunt H, Aunt P, and Aunt J are her sisters, too, and I thought it was disrespectful and selfish to not tell her or include her in this important time. I debated whether or not to call and tell her myself. I decided to call BJ and tell her and get her opinion as to whether we should let mother know ourselves.
