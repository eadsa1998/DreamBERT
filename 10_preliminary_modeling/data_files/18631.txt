There was a lady in the vegetable section of a grocery store. There were Chinese vegetables there. She was picking at vegetables and saying awful things to her son, "Jack Anderson." Her name was not Anderson and she was saying awful things about the name. I told the little boy in the stroller, "Jack Anderson, be proud of that name. Anderson's a great name." A lady was standing on a hill saying, "Dick Anderson [my father] cusses all the time." She was emphatic. I said, "No he doesn't. He never cusses." She said, "Oh, that's what I meant."
