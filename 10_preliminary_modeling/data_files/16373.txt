This doctor had to come out and examine Mom because to prove that she was not medically capable of playing real drums because one of those ____ drums not really accepted by the music community very well. They were kind of frowned upon like artificial or fake. So and one of the _____ really accept the fact that this was necessary. And they had the doctor come up and prove that she couldn't really do it the right way, and then they would let her use a key-based knee (?) type of thing. And there was this one particular type of drum set that you had to lay down on the floor and like kick your feet and use your hands in order to do them. Oh my gosh [loud noise on tape], in my dream she was like 70 years old and couldn't even try to do that. That was odd.
