I wake up and go through the bedroom door into the living room - I realize that someone has broken in and stolen everything. Even the bookcase is gone, the one on the right. I'm stunned - I can't believe it's happened, even while I was here and didn't hear anything at all, I'm scared and feel violated, I've been so stupid to think I was safe, and it's happened again. Gradually I realize I'm still in bed - I don't think I could have gone from there to here and not remembered it, I must be dreaming the robbery. That's quite a relief. I feel a whole lot better. I wish I wouldn't dream about break-ins so often. I get up and go into the living room again, just like I did before, and I see that the bookcase is still there just like it should be [it's not like my real one, it's plain wood with closed sides] - except it's been pulled away from the wall somewhat - it's at an angle. That's weird. I look around and see that everything's here, but I realize the only way for the bookcase to have been moved is for somebody to have moved it. It wasn't me, so that means somebody's been in here. Somebody must have broken in after all - maybe something's been taken and I haven't noticed yet. Oh dear. Now I'm getting nervous.
