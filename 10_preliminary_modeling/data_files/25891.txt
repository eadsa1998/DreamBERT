 I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos in a room. The KYCK radio station from Wilmerton is playing, and says something about a thumb contest. I have the tip of my thumb, which has been cut off, in my hand. I have both thumbs intact. But I know the piece of thumb I'm holding is mine. I think I'll use the piece in the contest. Stephen doesn't recognize it as my thumb when he looks at it. It is kid of smashed. There is a gas stove. One of the burners is lit. All the burners are then lit. I can't the burners shut off. They don't turn off, and when they do they turn back on. Finally, I think I may succeed in shutting them off.
