On One Tree Hill, Haley walked into a room at school. There were three guys around. She was pretty far along in her pregnancy and had a photo of her and Nathan on their wedding day. This guy said she should be ashamed of her last name. Lucas came and attacked the guys. This other guy came and took down all of the guys. They took down a ladder. They were then in a grassed area with benches and people around. Lucas had blood around his mouth. Some other time, Haley and Nathan were talking to Dan. She blurted out that she had feelings for him. It was awkward and he left. She told Nathan that it was true. Later, I was Haley, and I went into a room which was Dan's. He said "West bank" and I said "that's helpful" and then said "city bank" and he said "good one" and we laughed. He said something about Deb. I had Mom's phone and it had nice buttons.
