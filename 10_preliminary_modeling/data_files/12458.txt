Ted (Queer as Folk US) was in a movie. His mother was really excited about it and was promoting it. There were different versions at different cinemas. I wanted to see the one at a place called Sealord, because it was the only one with Ted in it, but it was really far away. The movie ended with him and this girl having an argument.
