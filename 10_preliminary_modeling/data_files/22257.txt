I dreamed that I was in a house together with my family and my uncle was playing cards. There were some liquor glasses on a table and I wanted to take one and my uncle sternly told me not to. But I told him that I would take what I please and that he had no right to tell me what to do, and he remained silent. Then I was in a forest with animals, a goat, a dog, a cow, a bull and different kinds of birds. Suddenly I heard a cry for help in the distance and I went towards the voice, but couldn't find it, and started to search for it, but couldn't find it until I saw a cabin. I went to it and went in and there wasn't anybody there. Then I stopped hearing the voice, but I heard the birds whistling, the dog barking. In the distance I saw that a person was coming, but I couldn't see the person well. Then I got scared and woke up.
