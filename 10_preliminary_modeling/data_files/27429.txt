My cousin, who is two years younger than I, and I were getting ready to visit my married sister. My brother-in-law was going to drive us. When we went out to get into the car, however, it wouldn't start and he had to fix it. In the meantime, my cousin and I went over to our mail box to get the mail for my mother. There was a letter in the mail from my sister. She sent us a copy of a newspaper in which appeared a picture of her with my little niece who is five. Then all of a sudden my sister was there with us.
