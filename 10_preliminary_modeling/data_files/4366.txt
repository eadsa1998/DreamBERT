["Anastasia my roommate."] I am seated on a long bench/couch the blue and white patterned fabric is the same as the carpet. This is supposedly Anastasia's house. I am visiting. But something happens about my daughter Ellie and suddenly it is decided that I shall be living here with Anastasia as my roommate. I am surprised. I look around the big room and realize this feels just fine to be here.
