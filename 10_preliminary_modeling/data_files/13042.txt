We were participating in a Battle Royale thing. There were two groups; the sickles, who were bad, and swords, who were good and also my group. A sickle and I were having an argument. This girl came and helped. Charlene came and gave a sickle to each of us, then joined the other girl. I saw a girl bleeding and went over and checked for weapons and said "I'm not going to hurt you, but she is" and pointed to Charlene. We got away and met up with others. I went off by myself into this big place inside. Bradley was there and he had a sword. A sickle attacked me and Bradley tried to help. The sickle said something about hurting Eugene. We escaped. I saw Alejandro and he had a sickle and I said "Not you!" because I thought he was a sickle, but he was a sword. We saw Jeremiah later and Eugene was standing in the background. Calvin and Samantha joined up with me. We went to a playground and there was a fishing thing. Teachers were coming and I saw Mr Reilly. We had to hide, but couldn't in time. I went to hide, but I fast-forwarded it and a girl saw me, so I rewound. I realized that I was going to get caught so I paused it and told the people I was with to stay there because they would be safe and that I had to leave. Calvin was like "why not take us?". He was supposed to be paused too. Later, Mom and Ezra were watching Battle Royale II, which was what just happened and at the 'time' part, I said "This part sucks, but it was a dream".
