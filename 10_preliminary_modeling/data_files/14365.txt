I was at school. There was an assembly in some room. I was with Calvin and Samantha and we were sitting near Daryl, but then we got moved off to the side and were a little bit closer to Eugene. This boy (around 6 years old) was on the stage reading something. He could barely read. Later, I was planning for an exam/essay for English and I needed to think of romantic comedies. I put down You've Got Mail since it was the last movie I watched but couldn't think of any other romantic comedies that I'd watched recently, thinking they were all 'science fiction and horror!'. Dad suggested Notting Hill and I said that I didn't really remember it and wanted stuff I'd watched more recently.
