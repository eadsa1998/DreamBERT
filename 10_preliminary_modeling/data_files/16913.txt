I'm in a large furniture shop - a very expensive one on several floors. The staff are aloof. There are some amazing old oak doors and panels. My partner and I would like to have them but we doubt we can afford them however. I try to get the attention of the shop assistant, with no success. Meanwhile, a pushy hyperactive middle-class woman comes barging in and grabs a shop assistant and demands to have all the oak doors. I step in, angry, saying I'd already decided to buy them. She goes crazy. A fight ensues. I recall her digging her nails into my flesh. I give up at this point saying no doors are worth this, and I walk out of the shop. I visit my neighbor Len in a large house. I have a conversation with his teenaged daughter who is sulky. I try to cheer her up. Later Len gives me a pile of generous gifts including a digital watch.
