Leonard Nimoy and I are climbing a snow covered mountain. There are dangerous avalanches high up. I see them as small and far away and feel some anxiety about it coming too close. I stand on a large bridge high up over a huge and deep river. I say, "At least here I am safe." Then I say, "Unless of course, there are earthquakes." Someone says, "You don't have to say that!" Leonard and I go on. I see a room. It is a secret room for Leonard. I look in the window and I see metal boxes and things. Leonard is married. I follow him into the room. I think, "He is a renaissance man." I am drawn to him because of his excellent skills in thinking, creativity, art, etc. As I go in, Leonard has placed himself in a metal thing which clamps his head painfully. It's small like he has to curl up like a baby to fit in it. I watch and feel sad for his pain. I turn to go out the door. He says, "No! Shut the door and lock it. Make sure the cat doesn't get out, a large black cat." I hesitate and then do so because his need for me to do that is very strong. I wait wedged into a corner near the door. Then he grows long legs that pop out of the machine. Then he gets out of the machine. He is very tall. He leans over to embrace me and then shrinks as he falls to his knees and places his head on my breasts and hugs me closely. I comfort him. He stands up very tall and hugs and kisses me. We go lie down to make love.
