I was staying in a hotel with Laura and some other people. My family, her family, and a bunch of weirdoes. I was playing with this mechanical grabber thing. The kind you use to pick up repulsive garbage. We were all on the roof of the hotel, and I was playing with things down on the sidewalk with the grabber. It was very long, obviously. Suddenly, quite without meaning to, I picked up a tree and accidentally flung it into the road, where a little baby was standing. I almost killed it. I immediately slumped over onto the railing, not able to believe my stupididty. The mother, or one of the women down below, began to complain about me. She pointed at me and shook her hand and said in a hysterical voice "Well, ARISTOTLE over there just keeps playing in his happy world, he almost kills my baby!" <br/
