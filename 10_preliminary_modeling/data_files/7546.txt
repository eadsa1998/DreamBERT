Mary and I are discussing Old Age Pensions. She is complaining that she has not yet received her Pension -- that she is 70 years old and is owed 5 years pensions. She can't understand why she hasn't yet received hers. As we talk about this, I learn that she had not applied for her Pension. She was under the impression that at age 70 years the Government would automatically send out her Pension. She is surprised to learn from me that she would have to apply for her Pension. I said I'd help her get the application form so that she could complete it and send it in.
