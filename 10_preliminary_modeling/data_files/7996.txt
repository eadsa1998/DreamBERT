I had series of nightmares. Every time I was trying to call out to Matthew and trying to wake myself up and I couldn't. Sometimes I would think I was awake and that he was sitting by the bed and then he would not be there all of a sudden. The last time I didn't think I was dreaming. I thought I was just half-asleep. It felt as though someone was pressing on my mattress or sitting on it. I couldn't open my eyes to look and I also couldn't speak. I tried to say Matthew's name and I couldn't. I was getting more and more frightened. I kept trying to call out to Matthew and I couldn't. He was home from college during this time. I was trying to bang on the bedside table to get his attention and that wasn't working. I was having trouble controlling my arms to do that effectively. I actually thought I was awake at this point. I grabbed my clock radio and tried to turn the volume all the way up. I couldn't get it to play very loud because I couldn't get it tuned in clearly to one station. I kept trying and trying to call Matthew. I was finally successful. It came out, in waking life, as a shriek. He said it sounded like a ghost and at first he was afraid to come out of his room.
