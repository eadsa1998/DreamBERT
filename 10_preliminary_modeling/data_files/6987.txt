We have been visiting at Coales on the other side of Oahu. Dr. C. asks me if I were going to Miss A's funeral. I didn't remember her. He said she was on the faculty and responsible for ending faculty concerts by unfavorable criticism. I said I wouldn't go but if he wanted to return to town for it, I could be ready in a few minutes to go. He could drop me even if I had my red suitcase to carry. But no, I can't drive a horse. We were riding in when I remembered I hadn't said goodbye to Mrs. Coale. I'd have to write her a thank-you note.
