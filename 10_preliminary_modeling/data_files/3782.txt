I am talking to a man who owns a turquoise '55 Chevy that drives like a boat. It's a convertible and when you are in the driver's side, it has a rectangular piece with a forward and a backward gear lever. I start to drive it and catch on very quickly how to drive it. I go fast and laugh, thinking maybe the man is worried I might not be able to handle it. It is fun. Now I am inside some man's house. The car man is with me. I like him, but he isn't paying any attention to me. I hear a lot of noise and go to the back of the house. I see a stable outside and peek in. Three nuns are screaming and crying and very concerned. One of them yells one of them is having one. This means one of several different animals is giving birth now. I go back into the house, the man with me, and it's a party and I want him to dance with me and kiss me. But suddenly a huge elephant rampages through and we have to move quickly to get out of the way. We jump to the wall and squeeze between the wall and the refrigerator. We are face to face and I turn my face up, hoping he will finally kiss me. He starts getting the idea and tentatively and shyly starts to kiss me. I am very happy. Now the nuns are screaming it's the other animal giving birth. We go to the door and look. I wonder if the nun's are OK there or if we need to rescue them.
