I was in accounting and we did a test and then I left to do something. Something of mine fell off. I told Ms Bigwood. I was then eating with Calvin outside the classroom. Abukar was telling a story of something to some girls and they were crying, but Geneva was laughing as it was a joke. Some boy asked me if he could have my sandwich. I said no, but then the siren went so I gave it to him and said "go to the toilet and eat it quickly". We went back into class and we were on computers. Calvin and I went on Runescape. Darius was behind us. On IMDb it said it was Alejandro's birthday, although it was the 19th. Elijah was in the class. I joked it was a dream and did a reality check and realized it was a dream and looked out the window and it looked really vivid out there. I tried putting my hand through the window a few times, but couldn't. I went outside and ran a little and put my fist into the air and flew up. I was sort of floating about and it felt weird, but then I fell out of the dream.
