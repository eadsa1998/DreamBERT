I lived in another place, maybe even another country.  It was night and there were other people there.  I could see between tall structures, but I did not know if they were haystacks or adobe buildings.  It started to feel like Mexico.  We were up high, like on a plateau or high desert, in a little town.  I asked one Mexican man if he wanted to become foreman or manager of our farm.  I looked over beyond him and there was some smoke.  But it looked too far off.  The other people were not concerned and we kept talking.  Then suddenly it was clear that that fire was bigger and moving quickly toward us.  We all started moving between the haystacks or adobe structures to run from the fire.  Either I had trouble running, like it was like swimming, hard to get moving fast, or else I felt like I was moving fast but upon looking around saw that everyone else was barely poking along.  I got more scared, and turned off on a side street, to find these tanks or barrels of water.  I was going to get in them and hide from the fire.  Later I came out and asked if anyone knew where a lake was near there, in case I ever needed to jump in it to get away from a fire.  Yes, they said, there's a lake up at the cemetery.  I felt funny that I did not know about this lake, like I should have known.  I pictured the lake in the cemetery in my mind.  I did know about it, I think, and had just forgotten in the scare.  But right then the place felt the most foreign to me, like another country, like Mexico.  It was more humid than Utah, greener, higher.  I was conflicted about whether or not I should have known about the lake.  Like how new was I to this place?  I was reminded of how [in reality] me and Jaroslav wanted to move to Valparaiso, Mexico.
