I am blind and discover my family home has been destroyed and I break into frenzied tears. I sob and my mother is quite surprised at me. I didn't cry when I went blind and now I'm mad with grief over this. I say, "A house where we all lived together will never be again, and I was going to get married in my father's physics lab."
