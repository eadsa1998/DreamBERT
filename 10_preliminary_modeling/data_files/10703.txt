I was sleeping and felt a body next to me. I thought it was Donald. He snuggled with me and placed his dick on my leg. I thought that was unlike him. When I kissed him, I realized that it wasn't my boyfriend Donald. He did other things to me that further strengthened in my mind that it wasn't Donald. I told him I wasn't having sex with him because he wasn't Donald. He got mad and said, "If you love him, why are you with me?" I told him, "I thought you were him, dumb ass." He picks up a guitar. He plays really well. I ask him where Wanda is. He says, "She is in the kitchen chopping peppers with your mom." I go into the living room and realize that I am at my mom's new house. I have a new room. I go in and close the windows. I go into a panic and try to throw up. The weather is very stormy. I realize that I am late for my psychology class. I gather my stuff and realize how anxious I am. I head for the door.
