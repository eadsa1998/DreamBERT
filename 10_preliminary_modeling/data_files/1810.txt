I am swimming across a huge expanse of tar, and if I stop to rest I will sink in, so I keep swimming even though I'm quite tired. Finally, I reach the shore and lay upon wet, soft grass, as soft waves of the clean, clear ocean lap near me. I clutch the grass to affirm I am finally safe and can rest. Just then I realize I'd spent all summer swimming and now it was time to go to school. I had no time to rest! I get up and now I'm dressed in a red plaid pleated wool skirt and a brown corduroy jacket. I am dressed different than all my peers. It is the beginning of the senior year. No one likes me. I dress and act differently. As a joke, they had invited me to be their class president. I go into the auditorium. I go up to the podium and tell them I know they don't like me and I don't like them but I am their President and I will make it work. Some guy in the back throws spit balls and is noisy and rude. A guy in front stands up and is rude. I walk up to him and nose to nose (he's very tall) I look up and say, "Look here, you little punk..." the crowd backs me and he quiets down.
