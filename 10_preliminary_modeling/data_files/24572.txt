George and Elaine were in my science project. George and Elaine got together, but I was also outside of a humongous house and there was a party going on inside and out. I have these notices and they were magnetic in my dream and they were in my science project. I watched Seinfeld last night. George and Elaine are in that, and I was doing my homework in bed. I was doing my science project in the bed in the dream. Setting: My house and Beverly Hills houses. Characters: George and Elaine (characters from Seinfeld), and me, and my dog. Feelings and Thoughts: Fine. I think that George and Elaine (word missing?) but otherwise I think it's pretty cool.
