The dream started out in my hometown in the house my family lived in when we first moved there. It seemed to be in the summer because I and my younger brother seemed to be outside in the driveway and it was a real bright and pretty day. We were doing something, but mainly we were waiting for my older brother to get back from town somewhere. He had taken the car and gone uptown and he was going to bring back something that was connected with some hobby of my little brother. So he did come home and there is some confusing stuff. I was with my parents and some older couple at this cafeteria again somewhere getting lunch. I had gotten a rather strange lunch, a strange assortment of things, all sorts of vegetables sort of jumbled up together. And everybody else had gotten something quite different from what I had gotten and not as much, so I was embarrassed that I had gotten more than anybody else. But I decided that I had some excuse that I was pregnant, but that didn't seem like a very good excuse to me. So we were getting ready to sit down and start eating and two confusing things were happening here at once. For one thing, something was on my chair which I had to wipe off before I could sit down, and there was somebody else in the cafeteria that my mother wanted me to go talk to or something. So between these two things it was taking me a long time to sit down and everybody else was eating, but finally I did get to sit down.
