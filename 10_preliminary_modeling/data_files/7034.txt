Some people come to me re teaching position. I tell them it's my brother not I they should see but he is now in conference with some man re finances. Probably they'll soon be thru. But it is quiet hour so they mustn't go thru the halls. There are several in my room. I think I hear someone outside and peek cautiously out the door. See the other man coming from the conference. But he is now the school superintendent. Very softly I ask him the result. He tells me he was much impressed by the Marslands. I tell him she is one of my best friends. He tells me she was accepted. I tell him "I once taught in your school, back in 1907 I think. My aunts and uncle lived there once." Then I turn back to my room and tell them the news.
