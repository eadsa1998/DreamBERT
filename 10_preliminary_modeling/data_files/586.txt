I am planning a class party and one of the games is searching for an object. No one can have it at their house. They come to my house and want to practice having it there. I try to lock them out but decide to let them in. They start to search. My parents aren't home and I know I'll be in trouble. My daughter is sleeping upstairs. One other person, a female, I think, is with me. People keep coming back asking questions. I go upstairs to stop the search. Someone has gone into my daughter's room and they are in a cubby hole there, but they didn't wake her up. My daughter has a funny red hairdo that reminds me of a clown. I tell all the people they must leave now. I am not going to allow this game at my house.
