I drove up to my ex-boyfriend's house (we're just friends now). He was smoking a cigarette with this girl Judy, who he liked back in Highschool. I asked him what they were doing. He said "We're working on competition # 1." I gave him a look like I didn't believe him. Then he said "We're just recording some songs together." I said "Yeah right Mike, what are you really doing with her?" I was really angry. And he said "We're just fu..ing." I was so angry that I kicked him where it really hurts and said "You won't be doing that for a while, will you!?" Then I had a baseball bat in my hand and started hitting Judy with it. I beat her up, then got back in my car, drove home and wrote my parents a note saying they would never see me again. I got in my car, drove 100 mph to NYC and sold my car. I bought a plane ticket to England. I took the bus to my host family's home in London, applied for citizenship, changed my name and colored my hair. I met a gorgeous man at a pub and lived with him. I got a good job and my own apartment and never spoke to anyone in America again.
