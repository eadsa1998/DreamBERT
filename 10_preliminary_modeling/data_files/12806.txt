I went out the back with Dad and Vivian. I was talking and then I realized that they were preoccupied so I looked over and noticed that they were reading my diary. One entry said 'Dmitri is very hot!'. At the start of the diary I had written stuff about Daryl. Dewey was there too, but his last name was spelt 'Kirchs' but had Kirsch next to it. I looked away and looked again to check if it was a dream but it didn't change. I got up and ran inside. That Japanese guy from Alias was there. Then we were outside again and he was chopping us up. I said "I'd rather do that [getting chopped up] than face people now!". I was then at Mom's and she had a coconut roll. Darren knew about what had happened with the diary.
