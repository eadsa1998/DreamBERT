I go to see my brother Dwight's bedroom. It is his special place. There are lots of books about plants. His room is next to mine and a partition wall is between the rooms. Over the partition you can see shelves of bright, pretty books. I think, "So that's how he sees my room. It's an interesting perspective." I think it looks nice and he enjoys seeing them (the books). I am glad I can share this for him.
