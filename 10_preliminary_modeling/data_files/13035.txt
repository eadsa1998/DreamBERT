I was at an airport/plane place. I was quoting The Fast Show and I saw Paul Whitehouse's name on the floor and a picture of him as Suit You on the wall. There were other celebrity people too. Martin Balsam was one of them. Some guy complained about a Colin Farrell impersonator. The creepy guy from Idiocracy was there. I was looking for Paul Whitehouse. This weird dude was annoying Dad.
