I was in a canoe with several people. We were shooting arrows at a women's clothing store which was on a kind of an island. We had a store on the mainland, and they were our competition and had forced us to close. When we had each shot three arrows, we were all out of arrows and had to stop shooting. I got out of our canoe and went into the store. It had heavy glass doors. I told the woman who owned it that we had lost the fight, and I wanted to pick up our arrows. I began to pick them up, and as I did so I picked up some of her arrows. Most of the arrows were hers, but they were not marked. The arrows were all different colors, and all the green ones belonged to her. Mine were red and purple, but I could not find many of mine. Instead, I took some of the arrows that could not be identified.
