I decide to stay over nite at Chloe's; I put on my BLUE nightgown and lie down on a single bed next to her double bed; I try to phone home to tell the boys that I am staying at Chloe's but I get no answer. So I RUN HOME, in my nightgown and feel the WIND in my face; I am out of breath when I get to my home (Chloe only lives 3 blocks away) - I see Reynaldo fixing something in the house and briefly talk with him and WALLY; I return by BIKE, and then park my bike in a NARROW room near the bedroom. I feel a bit out of place, but go to sleep after brief talk with Chloe; Eventually I go back home and meet my mother (?).....
