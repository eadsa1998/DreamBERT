I was in a crowded elevator and in the center was 3. man sitting down on a chair with big arms. The man was one I have only met a few times that works in mother's office. He has recently been promoted to the chief of a section. He had his hands spread out in front of him with his finger tips together. He had a very executive air in his appearance. Everybody in the elevator was moving around but I was standing relaxed and still.
