Something happened to me and I kept seeing those ghost people (it was something similar to It Follows, where only you can see them and they'll keep coming to you and you can pass it on). I was in a room at one point when one appeared and I tried to scream but nothing would come out. Later I was with some other people and there was an old guy there but I thought he was one of them. I tried to cover myself with a blanket and was fiddling around with it and then in real life, my hands must've moved and touched each other and I woke up in a panic - in the dream I interpreted the touching as the ghost guy touching me.
