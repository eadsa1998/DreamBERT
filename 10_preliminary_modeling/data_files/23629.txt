I am in a very ordinary room. I know that there is a room behind it. But the fear begins to come up. It overwhelms me and I begin to scream. I have had this fear before but never in such an ordinary room. We have been taken to a lower place on a dreaming track. The dorsal fin of a land shark is following my wife. Very scary. A longtime student of mine is very upset about the changes in the way I work. "Everyone can do with their work as they please," I say. Then we have dinner. I sit with a very attractive woman. Have to tell her that I'm married. She is very disappointed.
