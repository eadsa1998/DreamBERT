Mom gave me a __sheet of ten cities _ that we were supposed to fly to. And she had an art thing set up in Albertson's, and it was on a plank floor that I could hardly stand on. And Mom and I and Aunt Kristin were supposed to go to these cities, and so we did. We went to the airport, and we were still walking on that same floor that I could hardly stand on, and we were walking like pigeons on top of this security thing instead of __turning?_____, and we stepped in and walked through the things that the bags go and before we knew it, we were on this people mover car thing that was going 60-70 miles an hour. And then I found myself on the steps leading out to the parking circle at school. Then I woke up.
