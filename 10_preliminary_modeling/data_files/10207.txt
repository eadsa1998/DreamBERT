I see my woman analyst CHRIS SANTELLA wearing a white gown with a high collar; I hear that she is ill and that food has to be brought to her on a tray; we don't know what the illness is; Mitchell (my other analyst) lives upstairs and has the flu. -- shift: I go swimming with my friend Chloe; complicated rules about getting a locker; I have to wait and finally get my locker and go to the swimming pool.
