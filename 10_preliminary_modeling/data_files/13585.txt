I was watching Roswell and Tess said something indicating that she was bad (she said it away from the others). She was telling Max, Liz and the others (but it wasn't them) that she was meant for Max, and they had all been matched up according to their hair colours. They were like transformers and they were going to use their powers to save the world.
