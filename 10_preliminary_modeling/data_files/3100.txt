I am on stage, talking with a talk show hostess. I am seated in an armchair. I am parallel with the audience, rather than facing them. As I talk with the hostess, the audience warmly applauds my remarks. I am talking about disability awareness, people not seeing me for who I really am, but responding to the image of disability. As I realize the audience loves me, I turn a bit more toward them. The show is over and I stand and walk to the edge of the stage to take my bow. They are wildly cheering. I have to work hard to get around the posts and curtains to get to the edge of the stage. Even then the audience seems seated far back. There is lots of distance between them and me. I go off stage to the wings. Richard L and his younger brother are there, sort of my managers. One on each side, we walk out, talking about our next gig, and am surprised at the warm response of the audience.
