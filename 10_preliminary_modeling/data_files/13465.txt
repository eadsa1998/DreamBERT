I looked out the games room window and saw Kiki with her kitten. She skulked away behind the shed, so I quickly went outside. The kitten was near the cage, which I'd left unlocked and two other kittens (including the black one) had gotten out. There was a hole in the cage and the kittens were climbing out. I put them all back. Mom came later and I took everything out of the cage and Mom put clean carpet in.
