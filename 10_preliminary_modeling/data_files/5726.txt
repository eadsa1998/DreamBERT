[1997-05-11] We were on a trip somewhere and we made a stop to go to the restrooms. I went into this huge place and was trying to find the urinals and I was having trouble finding them and I think that at one point I had no clothes on, and I didn't quite understand that. I was wandering around in this big square room. At one point my wife came to the door and asked if I was ready to go and I said "I'd be another minute" and I went back in and tried to find a urinal, and I couldn't, and finally some man inside there helped me find it and I went to the bathroom and went back out and got in the car and we went back on our way to wherever we were going. And then I remember the reason we were at this place was to take a urine specimen which I was supposed to bring with me and didn't. So I tried to make a joke I kept calling "I forgot my pee! I forgot my pee!" and everyone was laughing but they weren't going to go back there for it and I thought it was really bad that I'd left it there.
