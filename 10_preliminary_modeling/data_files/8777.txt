Dancing With the Stars. When one of the couples names were announced as either being the winner or staying in the contest for another week, the man leaned over and gave his partner a long, serious kiss on the lips. This really surprised me because I thought he was a married man and I knew his partner was not his wife. Maybe others were surprised by this also, because somehow I learned that he was, in fact, single and this kiss represented feelings that had been growing for him towards her.
