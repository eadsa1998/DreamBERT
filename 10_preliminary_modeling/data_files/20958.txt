I was flying over fences and I noticed vacant homes. I looked at the street numbers and it was around 138. Barbara had a job at the White's and I came to see her and there were a lot of pencil erasers on the floor. I was picking them up, then I saw one of my time slips made out in a new system which I didn't understand. I was operating machines. I made an aluminum pin. The snap gauge I used was left over from the previous setup. I got the right one, and I noticed it fit the piece and I was safe, no scrap.
