I was at home and Mom, Calvin and this guy were there. Calvin found this stuff of this dead girl's and one of the things had Stanley Tucci and his phone number on it. This guy was in the room (and we suspected him of killing the girl) so we called the number and someone said to hurry up and get him. Before we could say anything, he left in my car. I accidentally got in the passenger's seat. The guy left but Mom went to talk to him so I left quickly and went down a side street. People started coughing and I realized this was the disease "from Runescape". Then we were in a little house. We had to keep duck blood to keep the diseased away (they were like vampire zombies) and keep lights off, etc. It was a game too and I had to get skills up -- farming, health etc. The internet was really slow. We had these ice things to stab the diseased with. They were going to break in.
