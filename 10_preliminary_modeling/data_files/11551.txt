Was in a hotel with seven floors. My suite was on the seventh. Can't remember the room itself, but I left to go down to the lobby. Used the stairs, took the wrong door at the bottom and ended up outside. Walked around and went back in entering the lobby first. I think, because of my attire, I had to make a fast exit, so headed for the elevator. Got in and the operator talked and talked. We kept going up and up, past the seventh floor and it puzzled me to feel as if we were still moving up having passed the top floor. The door opened eventually and the operator and a colleague waiting on the roof tried to roll me. I said I only had two bucks on me. To show him I pulled out a bill which was a five. That startled me and both of them pounced on me. With this I awakened.
