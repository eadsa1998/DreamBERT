I was at dads. Some stuff was still there, including my computer. I started watching Supernatural and I told Ezra later it was a funny episode. I watched The Big Bang Theory too. John Noble was in a previous episode with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Jared was like a Goth in the episode and I read on a forum, "Jared paints his nails black". Dad was at the door and Mom told him to go away but then realized who it was and I let him in. I was about to play Guitar Hero. I asked Dad if he wanted The Big Bang Theory and he said he would download it later.
