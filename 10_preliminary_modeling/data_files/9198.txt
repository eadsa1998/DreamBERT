There were a group of people, mostly men, in a room. They had co-written the theme song for Grey's Anatomy. I have a visual of only one of the men. It's not that the others are faceless, but for some reason only this one stuck in my mind. He was sitting in a chair with his left hand at his head or face, maybe with his head resting against his hand. He had dark-colored hair, almost black. It was not thick, very straight, layered, parted in the middle, and a little longer than most men wear their hair. In the front, it hung down across his forehead, like bangs.
