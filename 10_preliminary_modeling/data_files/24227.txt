I went back to the town where I went to college, surprising most there. I went to the college park office, and then back to my old building. I went inside. I saw that Ramy, behind my back, had rented the place out to one of the Joe-crowd rabblers. (Ramy is a former college roommate.) My room was being lived in by a timid, younger kid, the sensitive little indie type who cries when people bash him on xbox live. His name was like Corey or Derek or something like that. I told him he needed to pay $200 per month, and I'd throw in a free cordless phone, because that's what he said was "being in the future." Later, I visited Michelle and Neil (neighbors who were my friends). As always, they were happy to see me. They let me stay over. I watched Desperate Housewives, but the episode cut off at a really dramatic point. I had to go, but also really wanted to see the conclusion. Neil had put that, and a lot of other books in my backpack. Good guy.
