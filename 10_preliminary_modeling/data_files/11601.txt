My date of the evening and I were sitting in a theater restaurant when she mentioned the fact that the fellow on the stage at the moment had insulted her on a previous occasion and severely beaten her escort. For no good reason I climbed up on the stage and attacked him. He was about 25 and very formidable-looking but catching him by surprise I succeeded in knocking him down. The audience thought it was part of the performance and applauded.
