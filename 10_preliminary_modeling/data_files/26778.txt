 I'm with my friend Sarah Reed. I kiss her. She says, "No!", and tells me not to kiss her like that, not to kiss her at all. She kisses me in her manner, and then stops, indicating we're not to kiss. I am embarrassed, like I've made a mistake: I've crossed an uncrossable line. I've ruined a friendship. Later, I realize that I kissed her in a dream, not in real life, and I'm relieved.
