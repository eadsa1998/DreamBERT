["I play baseball."] I am an 11 year old girl. I am walking into the park. I see a group of boys playing baseball. I see a girl playing with a hockey stick down the sidewalk. I have a hockey stick and challenge her. I keep winning the puck away from her. She is frustrated. I walk on and see a group of girls getting ready to play baseball. The coach, a man, sees me and asks how old I am. I say 11 years old. He walks me to a clear spot and throws a baseball at me. I hit it with the bat and it is a long good hit. I am now on the team.
