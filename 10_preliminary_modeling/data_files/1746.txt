I am being introduced as a performer and the guy is teasing me. He says, "I know what I'll do. I'll announce your age. I know you are 55 years old." I laugh and tease back, "Then I'll just not respond, so there. If you say, 'So, you are 55 years old', I'll just say, "Yeah." I walk away from him laughing. I then ask who's going to sing the song. The doctor says the name or names. I say, "Oh, I thought maybe I would. Oh, well." Then I go out to find a bathroom.
