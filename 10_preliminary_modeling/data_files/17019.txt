I'm round at Jude's house. He is in his late 30s now, but has new parents - perhaps he's recently been adopted? His new parents are rich and foreign - perhaps Russian or Eastern European. I'm upstairs in his room. He's agitated, excited. His new mother comes up with a present for him. She's very proud of him, and has a sickly expression on her face, as if she spoils him. Stuart looks pleased with the gift but doesn't waste time; he's straight into the box. It's a new electric guitar - and it looks exactly like mine. He hands it to me and asks me to play a new song he's written. He wants me to mimic certain chords, but I can't quite get them right. I realize afterwards he's trying to get me to play the exact same chords in a song by Teenage Fanclub.
