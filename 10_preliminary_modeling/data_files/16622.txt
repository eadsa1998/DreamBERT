I was at the supermarket looking at __________. Actually _________________________. Before that I was _________ with Mrs. McBride, and she was teaching a lesson at Terri's house. And it was dark and it was dingy. Actually, wait. Before that, See, when you think about things remember more of it. I was playing the piano for Mrs. McBride's choir and we were in a school room. And I was playing these simple little songs like "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" and different little carols and __________________ __________. And I was playing them all in the key of D, and I probably shouldn't have done that.  But I guess the ones that are in penta chord form I should play in D because that's the range for a young child's voice; it sets the best in their head voice. And in my dream pretty much all these songs were in penta chord form, so I guess that's why I played them all in D. And I was just sort of [tape goes blank]. For most of them I was able to fudge my way through in accompaniment style, and then I said we were in a classroom while we were doing this. She had this Irish song that was a more complicated arrangement, and it had a recorder solo. And she had a little organ in the music room. It was like the one I practiced on at the college. It was a little, little bitty, bitty, bitty pipe organ with a free-standing case. But she made it play really loud with mixtures and a full chorus and everything and a recorder solo was heard above it. I don't remember which song it was, but it was something. And that little children's choir was able to sing out above that loud organ. And then next thing I know, she and I and her kids were at Terri's house with some bizarre reason. And I don't even remember what we were doing. I think it was some kind of a lesson, but I don't remember what it was. And then there was this book, and it had this story that like went on forever, and it was all supposed to be sung. And I was just flipping through it and reading the words and glancing up at the staff every now and then to kind of see what the melody was doing. And I couldn't really understand it. It was like chant or shape notes or something wacko like that. And I was thinking to myself, "I hope Terri's alarm doesn't work any more and I hope she ____________ whatever." Because Terri wasn't home and we were just like crashing in her house _________. And there was something more to this, but I can't remember what we were doing. I don't know. Then suddenly I was walking to the supermarket, and I was roaming around, I had all these bags like Mom brings and I was trying to look for groceries. But I couldn't find anything. I wandered through this part of the store that had a wood floor _____ table, and some people were having like a banquet there, you know like those catered things sometimes. And I was hungry; I wanted some. But I wasn't invited, so I couldn't barge in. And I was wandering around and wandering around and looking and looking, and I was able to find a few things, but it was not really near what I had come for. And then I went out to the parking lot because I thought somebody was going to drive me home. Somebody had talked to me at one time that they were going to drive me home. And this Grandpa truck was in the parking lot and I had the keys and I opened up the door, and I turned the ignition to run position so that the accessories would run, and there was some jazz, 98.7 on the radio. And I loaded up the one or two bags of groceries that I had and I was sitting there listening for like a half an hour. And nobody showed up to drive me home.  And this time in this dream, I didn't even want to drive. And so I turned off the ignition and locked it with the key, like it was a car. And I locked up the door and I took my groceries, and this time when I got out of the truck, I not only had my two bags of groceries, I had like bazillions of water jug bags, just like Mom has. They were all empty. And I was going back in the door, and I came in like a back door, and I was standing there like blah. And some lady said, "Oh, I'll take those for you because I'm going to go and get water myself." And I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, and then as soon as I gave them to her, I realized, "Well, gee, what are we going to use when we go to get water next time?" And then I woke up.
