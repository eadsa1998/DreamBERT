["Neal visits and I'm not prepared."] I am preparing to do a presentation on dreams this weekend. Neal comes to visit. He arrives a day earlier than expected. I am not ready yet. I am trying to greet him, make the preparations for potluck and friends and get the presentation finished. A large group of my female friends come by. I am glad to see them. I need to ask some of them to help out. I look for one called Jennifer to help. As she is one of the more helpful ones. Neal sees a spill of dried food on the blue shag rug. He goes over to help clean it up. I am pleased he seems helpful. I want the presentation to be well done. I want Neal to enjoy the potluck party. He seems to be having a good time. We like each other.
