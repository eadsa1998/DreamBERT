I was at school and Teresa, the others and I were getting along pretty well. Mr Nixon said that I needed to talk to others more and that after school I had to go to his house. He drove me there in silence. His house was in the middle of nowhere and it was huge. It was all Timezone like inside; there were games everywhere. Some person was shooting. There was some letter and someone read it and it was something about Mr Nixon and some park. I got McDonald's.
