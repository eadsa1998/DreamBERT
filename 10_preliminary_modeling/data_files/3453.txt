I am living in the old M City House. The recreation room has been remodeled to my bedroom. I am moving things in and organizing the drawers. I look out the open door and see a giant man with no head walking with ponderous steps backwards. I am a bit afraid of him and remind myself to not get in his way. A man now comes to the door and I see that behind him is a huge buffalo. I try to shut and lock the door against him but he forces his way in anyway. I am also a bit afraid of him. He asks if I have any spark plugs. I say, "No I don't, but I'll ask my father. He's outside. You ask him." He goes out. Now, I see my bookcase outside the window with tall large books in it. Dwight then comes in and says he has a room off of my room. I see a door and go look in. My bookcase is in his room. His room is very small. He says it's OK to keep the bookcase in the little corner of his room. The giant man walks by again, only this time he has his head and is attempting to walk forward. Now, a man and a woman are talking. This is supposed to be a meeting I am involved in with another person, but they take over and I'm so tired, I let them. Finally I say, "Look, let's stop this meeting because you two aren't including us and I'm too tired now to change it." I say, "Let's set a time to meet next." The man says, "No, we can do that later." I say "No, it's easier for me to do it now because we're all here together; otherwise, I'd have to call and recall everybody." Now we have to find a calendar. No matter where we look, we can't find one. I open drawers and take out old wallets from long ago, noticing I'd left in small change. I am messing up the organization I'd so recently spent time fixing. There are lots of wallets and no calendar. I am very tired and sleepy and give up.
