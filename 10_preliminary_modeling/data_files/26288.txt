 I'm at a deli. My high school classmate Mary Rogers works at the deli. I buy some strawberries for $1.05 per pound. Mary puts some strawberries in a plastic container until it weighs a pound. There is very much in the container, it looks like only a few ounces! My friend Bubba Hacker is there. I pay, and the bill is $2.56. I think that this is too much to pay, and I ask if they are not $1.05 per pound.
