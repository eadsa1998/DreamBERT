I don't remember the first part of the dream but I was with someone.  My right ear was not working well.  Supposedly this was from the previous night's problem of ear pain.  In a small storefront like at the airport, I was looking at a jar of hearing aids, trying to find one for the right ear, but they were all for the left.  There were a lot of Asian girls around.
