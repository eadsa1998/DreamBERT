I was out in public, maybe in a restaurant, and saw Jane C somewhere. She sat down on what might be something like a barstool to my left. She asked how I was doing. She seemed genuine in her concern about me, rather than to ease any guilt or second thoughts Bill C may be having. She wanted to know if I was doing okay. She said that every now and then Bill C thinks about calling me, or emailing me, and inviting me to have coffee with him. He always decides against it. She asked me if I ever intend to call him for the same reason, or if I have thought about it. I hesitate. I'm not sure how I want to answer her question because I'm not sure that I want either of them to know that I have thought about it. She asks me again if I will be calling him. I still don't want to answer. There is a part of me that wants to call him, but a bigger part of me that wants to resist that temptation.
