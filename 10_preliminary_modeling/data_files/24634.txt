I was at a pool show with my friends, and we were sitting in benches, in front of this big, blue pool. A white-haired grandma rushed up to my friend in the first row and said, "How do I do a flip?" My friend put her in a seat and watched her do a flip. Then she did a flip in the pool. Melissa, our science teacher, wanted me and my friend to go with her to this house-looking place. She made us do flips. My friend could, but I couldn't. I asked "What if we can't?" Melissa just laughed. She said do the flips into the pool when the announcer said, "Uke Wattle." We waited, but the dream ended. Setting: In a big blue pool with benches in front, and a house-looking backstage practice place. Characters: My friend Amy, a short-blonde haired girl, my friend Rochelle, a brown-haired short girl, and Melissa, my science teacher. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I was scared to do a flip, and when I woke up I was surprised at my dream.
