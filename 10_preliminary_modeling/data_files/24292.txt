I was in a back yard that reminded me of my old bungalow in the city where I had my first newspaper job and perhaps some house I visited many years ago. My high school sweetheart Cindy was there. She was doing something at a table. Setting up for an event, or a craft or something. She and I were talking, and she was friendly and nice. I could see it in her eyes that she was still attracted to me. I could tell through her body language too. The fact she was acting like this, and the fact that she made no mention of the guy she was marrying, made me think something was possible. But when I started coming on to her, she said. I'm married. I said, I don't see a ring. She said, well, I'm engaged. And I said, well, who is he? My tone was condescending, with emphasis on the "he". She said he's an assistant something or another at Nintendo. I thought for a moment, and realized the "assistant" part meant he was nothing. Instead of dropping a litany of how I'm better in every way than this other person, I said: "He'll never be Eric (meaning me)." And she said: "Nobody could ever be you."
