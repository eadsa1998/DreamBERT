I am helping a professor work out the UNIFIED THEORY of Relativity (Einstein). It looks like a pie and chart: each segment - a science, e.g., geography, geology. There are "strata" - lines of a graph where test result show radiation and disease entity. Also a WHEEL EVOLVING IN TIME. At the same time I must earn my living as a grocery clerk.
