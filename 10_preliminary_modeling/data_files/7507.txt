It is winter with a deep snow on the ground. A large group of people and I are coming out of a place of worship where we had a memorial service for Mary. Just before the service ended, I realize that I had not arrange for refreshments for the people I had invited to attend the service. Then I heard someone say (or said to myself) that the refreshments don't matter -- the most important thing is the memorial service itself. If I'd forgotten to arrange for refreshments after service, I'd be forgiven. We left to go to the cemetery, which is located right behind where we had gathered. There were many people milling around, but only I went to Mary's grave. I have difficulty finding the grave under the heavy snowfall. I have a shovel and use it to clear the snow from off a plot which I believe is where Mary is buried. There are no headstones on the graves. As I am shoveling the snow, trying to locate Mary's grave, I realize that I'd forgotten the words  to any memorial prayers. I decide to just say what is in my heart. I burst out crying and talk directly to Mary through my tears, telling her how much I miss her, how much I love her, that I will never stop loving her and missing her.
