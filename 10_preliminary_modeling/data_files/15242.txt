Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop. Ezra saw this spiffy Snorlax figurine and wanted it. I went to the back of the store with Rover and Mom and crawled through this maze of chains. I went back and Roland was there talking with the Indian guy who worked there about something. I had forgotten my socks so went back to get them. I went to the old house for a pizza delivery. There was a half dead magpie lying flat out on a branch on a tree near the garage. I said we had to take it to the vet, but it started flapping and squawking and scared us away. There was blood on it. We left and later Ezra was on MSN at the old house with Roland and others. They were making fun of me.
