Mom was babysitting a baby. It had no teeth and was chewing on something and crying and screaming. Ezra was like 'is that how our screams sound when we are older?' and I said "all babies sound the same". Mom had been in a movie with Brad Pitt, called Children of Heaven [Deepak had commented on the real movie on Facebook yesterday]. It had a low rating on IMDb and it was supposed to be from the 30's. At the start, they all turned into weird plant monsters and were talking about weird alien stuff. They realized they had squashed someone and they came out of the form (caused by drugs, I assumed) to help him.
