We are living in someone else's house with a KING and QUEEN, but we don't have enough food. A friend of Wendy's brings us some JELLY BEANS and I laugh as we pass around the jelly beans... I call out the window: "Frank, we have people coming to the house" I can't find my shoes; in the meantime the King and Queen are all dressed up to go to entertain children for Christmas. I return to the house and watch a cook make small doughnuts and glaze them; I am thrilled. happy to have help in the kitchen like we use to have in Vienna. --I go back home in a rowboat.
