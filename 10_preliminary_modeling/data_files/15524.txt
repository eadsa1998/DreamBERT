I was at Nana's and people were after us. I was outside and realised bad guys were coming and I went inside. I went to a room at the back and hid in a cupboard. I heard them tell Poppa that they had everyone and he said 'what about the dog' and a guy turned into a dog and sniffed around in the room. They found me and pulled me out. Later, I was on my computer and I had sent an offline MSN message to Benjamin and he had sent a weird reply. He said his uncle did it and suggested we talk on this game via inbox instead. He had two messages from his family and one of them was from a cousin in France. Nathan Fillion added me after seeing that I was a fan of him on Facebook.
