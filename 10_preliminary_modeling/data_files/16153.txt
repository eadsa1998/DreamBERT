I can't believe that I had this -- well, yeah, I can because my head comes up with stuff like that. [laugh] I dreamt that I was by the Christmas tree and we had this angel with a music box. and she had these fiber optic lights that would change different colors and bright and dim depending on the strength of the signal. We were just cleaning garbage out from underneath the couch, and then I woke up.
