I was watching 24. Chloe's ex-husband was Josh Weinstein (Entourage) and Jack didn't like him. Chloe kept talking to Edgar in her head and replaying certain things he'd said. She was like "Stop it!". The terrorists had planted fake information on the attack and suddenly all of CTU was gone except for Josh. He called the terrorists and said he had embedded the real information for them on Maeby Funke's (Arrested Development) site. He said that she was "a little toughie". She worked it out, though and did SOS signals from the fridge. Jason Bateman was sitting in a car outside the hotel Maeby was at. The terrorists realized that Maeby had found it, so sent off the missile early. I was then looking at pictures of Michael Cera. There were pictures of him young and his eyes were different.
