It was the first day of university. I realized I had forgotten to go. It was like 2pm or something. I got Mom to take me, but I forgot my lab coat. I had time to spare so I went to the bookshop, which was different. I asked if I could borrow a lab coat and it cost $5. They only had large and 4XL, so I took the large. Elijah was there doing a similar course. We had the math tutorial at the same time but in a different room. His lab was on Wednesday. This girl asked for help with math and she had an equal sign with three lines. She had asked some 'smart' people for help but so far had had no luck. This lady had to interview me and she said I was a survivor since I was a "little bit fat". I was like "uh... what?". I said that it had never bothered me. I mentioned that I had lost 12kg in the last year. I passed the interview. I had to wear the coat for the lab even though we were just watching some football. Eugene was there with Bradley. I was filming and Bradley and the others were being silly. There was a movie thing and this bad guy died, but then crawled out of a lake as a different person. We threw some slug things?
