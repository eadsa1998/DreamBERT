The setting seemed very comfortable but not necessarily familiar. One of the people who kept coming up in the dream was a male, age 22, whom I've been involved with on a couple of occasions but not many, and whom I think about fairly often. The dream involved around getting ready for a performance at the theater. Many familiar faces were present (people from my hometown who I've become friends with since coming to school as well as people I was friends with in Highschool.) People I know and associate with on a daily basis were present. I was going to be in the performance but my major preoccupation was with how this male was associating with other females and I wasn't concentrating on what I thought I should be, the performance. I saw some famous people who seemed to vaguely know me and be aware of my altered focus.
