The dream began when a friend of mine came and told me that a boy whom I had dated a few times and whom I haven't seen for several weeks was pinned to another girl who was supposed to live next door to my dorm. (The only person living there is an old woman and a few servants.) Then the dream shifted and I imagined that a good-looking young man in a naval lieutenant's uniform was cleaning the outside of the windows of my room. He entered the room and we began talking. I remember him admiring my ring and I told him that it was a gift from my parents, etc. He told me he had tickets to see Romeo and Juliet and asked me if I would like to go. I accepted and the dream then shifted and we were saying goodbye on the porch of my dormitory. I told him I didn't even know his name so he told me what it was. It was a long name and I couldn't understand it, so he took out his billfold on which his name was stamped in gold. The first name was Avilo as near as I can remember. It doesn't mean a thing to me. I was hurt that he didn't ask me what my name was so I told him that he didn't know it. He said yes I do and he told me what it was. He was correct. I remember that in my dream I deduced from this that he was a friend of the original boy in the dream (the one who was supposed to have been pinned) and that he had told his friend to call me and ask me to go out with him.
