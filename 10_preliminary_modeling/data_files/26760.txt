 I'm with several friends from home. We walk up to the top of a tower or cliff. My friends Kevin Simpson, Stephen Ramos, and Tiny Combs are there. When we get to the top Kevin goes up to the edge and jumps off without hesitation. I look out through the small door-like opening where he jumped. There is a river hundreds of feet below us. There is a train bridge crossing the river below us. Kevin free falls for about six seconds while the wind blows him over the train bridge below us, down river. I watch as he falls and am afraid he'll land on the bridge: splat! But he blows over it. He gets close to the water. I see white water below him, and am worried he's going to land in a shallow, rocky area and be killed. He lands, and I see him surface, alive and well. Others also jump. I don't jump because it's too high: I'm very scared of jumping from this height. We're in the river water below. There are many people swimming and floating, playing in the water. I see one body in the water, face down. I think the person is drowning, and pull their head up feeling panicked. The woman turns her head and moves so I know that she's okay. I'm nervous about this whole situation: very high jumping, people swimming about. I think someone may get hurt, and that concerns me. Four men in their late 20's, beer-drinkin', cigarette smokin', cut-off wearin', long stringy-haired guys, jump off the lower train bridge into the water. They joke, are careless, carefree, and silly. Others see his and go to jump.
