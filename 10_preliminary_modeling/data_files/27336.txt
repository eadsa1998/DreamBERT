I dreamed I was in the upstairs of a double house visiting one of my girl friends. She is 20 yrs. old and I've known her about 10 years. The house was strange. I was afraid of some Indians out in the back yard who were after me for some reason. I was frightened, but solved the problem by having my father (who was evidentally with me) back the car out to the front, and I sneaked out the front door without being seen by the Indians. Next I found myself walking through a department store on the way to an offlce. I stopped and looked at clothes and talked to someone I knew, but can't remember now. I was all dressed up and seemed to be there for an interview for a job. I wore my fur coat, a square fur hat--which impressed me for it was so stylish; and also I wore a silk scarf which I remember. I sat in the office as if I was extremely confident. I talked to a young girl and an older woman sat to one side observing me and taking notes. I seemed to be on a higher social level than either in the office.
