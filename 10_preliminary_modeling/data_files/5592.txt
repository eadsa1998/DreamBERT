[1997-05-09] I was with some of my women friends from our Lutheran church's ladies group and we were at this big convention somewhere, probably in a church but I don't know. I was with my friend and we were selling little folders about sleep and sleep disorders. In the dream, I asked a female friend "What's on this paper?" I didn't have my scanner with me its too big. She said "Its all about sleep disorders and everything."
