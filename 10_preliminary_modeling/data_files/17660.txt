A dream of Armageddon or something. I don't know what was going on, but supposedly the world was going to end, so my boyfriend Jeremy and I were supposed to have sex. My dad was in the next room backing up my computer, somehow trying to protect it from Armageddon even though we would all be dead and not care, and I was searching for a certain Oingo Boingo song. We also put some program on the computer that was supposed to protect the files, like a watchdog. The dog was physical, though, and while Jeremy was out of the room, I was holding and petting the dog, which was, at first generation, blue, and then turned natural-brown after that.
