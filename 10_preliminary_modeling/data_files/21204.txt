I went back to 1100 E. 68 St. We were to move back there. Ann had to put her washer upstairs instead of in the basement because that was for Princer's washer. He was the landlord. I went upstairs and Poline was sitting on a chair. I helped her off and raised a trap door and the toilet was there. She stood there as I pulled down my pants and pulled out a plug of flesh from my rectum and held it in my hand. I didn't seem to be embarrassed. I picked her dress from the rear, then from the front and I could see it all. She had filthy underclothes as I did that I looked up and her two children were coming down the stairs. John Tesar shot 4 people. He said, "I'm going to give myself up. I killed 4 people." I noticed he had a gun holster around his neck and a small pistol in the holster. I razzed him what did he do with that, shoot flies? Then he told me a tall story how the bullet would travel miles by the wind changing its course. We had a sort of party. Someone passed shot glasses, then we drank and I had an awful tasting highball in mine. Steve, Mike and I were shopping on Superior Ave. We had an express wagon and it was loaded, so the food was falling off.
