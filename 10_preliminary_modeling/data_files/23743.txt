I was in a courtroom.  I was an attorney in the dream, but was not trying a case that day.  Suddenly an armed man came into the courtroom and threatened all of us.  Some people hid or screamed.  I noticed a way I could escape the room without him seeing me, and I went around to another door.  I got out the door, and went to the clerk's office to report the man.  The clerks knew about him already, but seemed unconcerned.  I was still shaken up.  I left the clerk's office and walked down the court hall.  I turned a corner, and I saw Robert G [One of my law professors. After law school, we had a short love affair. He is about 20 years older than me].  I was wearing the light green shirt with short sleeves that I had in reality bought but had never yet worn.  By some strange markings on the front of my shirt (it looked like white powder on my shirt), Robert knew without me telling him that I had been involved in a hostage situation.  His eyes questioned me, asking me if I had been in a room with an armed man, but without either of us speaking.  I nodded.  Then he took me to have dinner.  We went to his house or the supermarket and he microwaved a frozen lasagna.  I said, "Robert, are you really going to microwave a frozen lasagna?" because he always makes such beautiful and careful food, and I couldn't believe he would microwave a lasagna.
