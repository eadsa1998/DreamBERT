I am going to a bookstore and start walking, hoping to catch the bus. It's two minutes until the bus is expected. I'm on 14th street and am headed for 10th. The walking is hard going and painful. I get there. It's a conveyer belt of canned goods. A woman helps check them out. They are packaged up in plastic crates with an identifying tag so you know what's yours and where one stops and the other starts. Now I'm watching couples at a "butt watching" fair or gathering. Three couples, all dark, straight hair, dark complexion (Italian) are together. One woman is very upset and a man is trying to help her. He holds her quarters for her without taking any. She doesn't trust he has done so sand asks another woman to check for her. The other woman counts the eight quarters and the one silver dollar and hands them to me to hold for her. It's confirmed and she hugs the man. They are very close, cuddling. His arms are around her as she leans her back into his chest, then feet out in front of them, intertwined. The other woman says, "You can't do that if your not going to get married." This makes them think because they were intending to be just very good friends until she was cured and then she would go on and marry someone else. She looks over and sees the man's best friend and decides to marry him. This causes the man to turn and look long and searching into her eyes. He now wants to marry her. I think she wants it too and was using a ploy to get his attention. [BL]
