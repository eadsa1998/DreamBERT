I was on Runescape and they changed something and I got attacked as I was going out and ended up on 0hp but I was still alive and out of food. Ezra was watching. I used the ectophial and got food. The banks were different. In 'real life' I was at these booths at the "Jagex headquarters" and some guy was in one near me. There was funny graffiti. This girl came. Then I was walking up these stairs with people following. Some guy was having a party. I waited outside and then left and joined these two guys. I was at school and I had text Mom earlier to pick me up because I forgot to have shower and straighten my hair. I had six messages. Genevieve was in a room and this guy told these people he was single and she said 'really' and he admitted that he was going out with her. I went outside and Mom was there.
