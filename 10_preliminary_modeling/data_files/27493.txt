I was over at the apartment of a newly married couple. They were decorating their apartment and were in the process of painting their kitchen. They were painting it gray but were having a difficult time getting the right shade. Five friends of the husband came in and offered to help. They were to paint the living room which had cheap-looking furniture in it and a parlor which was furnished in a very old fashioned way. The friends started to paint over the varnish with gray paint until I told them that they would have to scrape the varnish. They grumbled at this but finally went ahead to do it.
