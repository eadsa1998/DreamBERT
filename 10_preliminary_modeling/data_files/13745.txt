Eugene and I were dating. We went to the ball and were waiting outside for the main room to open (it was at 'school'). We were both wearing casual clothes. Ezra was also there. We kept sitting down on lounges and Eugene would sit right next to me so we were touching. I kept looking at him, amazed that we were together. We were also at this other place at one point. The walls were all concrete and the windows were just square holes in the wall. The people there were acting weird. I thought they were going to say something bad about us, but they said that I was pregnant. Eugene jumped up and we hugged excitedly and then I was like "How am I pregnant? And how do you know?".
