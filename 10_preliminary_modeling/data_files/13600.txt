I was watching Entourage. Turtle's girlfriend (Lauren London) was coming over. Ari wanted to see her, so he hid in the apartment and his wife was behind the door. Turtle and his girlfriend were lying in bed. Later, Turtle was saying how all he did was complain about his father. Then this girl was married.
