I was in a diner eating eggs. I was talking with my acquaintance, Joe. We were talking about raves and the punk rock scene. I was telling him I really used to be into raves. He is big into punk rock, so he didn't really agree, but he was being polite and pretending to agree. I told him you can't really have any fun unless you do drugs. I told him that at a handful of the ones I went to, I did drugs and had a great time. The other handful of times I went, I went sober and had a horrible time, which was kind of a lie, because I still had fun at those. He agreed with what I had told him, because he was being nice, even though I knew he hated raves.
