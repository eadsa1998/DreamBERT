I was in some kind of warehouse, some huge hardware store, preparing for a trip with a lot of other people. I keep seeing all kinds of people from the Middle School, and I get fond farewells from Jasmine and Amanda in particular. I go into my trailer, feeling touched, and I find Jimmy there. He's toying with my computer -- he's added a soundcard and speakers. I try to play a game but the sound effects just slow the computer down so much it's useless. After talking with some of the people who'll be taking the trip with me, I realize I'll need two double-A batteries for the device in my hand. I try different batteries that are laying around; no luck. So I go back into the hardware store. I find a large backroom with lots of batteries. But, I've got to take a leak, so I stand in front of a urinal and decide to piss on the orange wall above the urinal next to me. Halfway through my piss I hear a stall door open and I turn back to the urinal. Bob, who used to work at the Music Center, comes up next to me. "Real cute," he sneers. "People have to clean that up, you know." He turns and leaves the bathroom, muttering 'Pissing on the walls...' I leave the bathroom when I'm done and find him and a few other guys sitting around a table, eating. "Is this where I find the batteries?" One guy points and says: "Over that way, see?" I see, and I go where he points, but on the way I'm distracted by a large table with all kinds of stuff on it. The item which really catches my attention is a huge magnifying glass. I magnify various things on the table and consider buying it, for fun, but then I see it will cost $56.74. I think of a picture I once saw of James Joyce holding a magnifying glass. I set down the glass and wake up.
