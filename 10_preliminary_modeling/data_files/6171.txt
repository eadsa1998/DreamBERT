I dreamt I was on a river that had rapids across it. I was with like five men and we had to cross the river across the rapids. One of the men got swept up and died (the first one). Then I was at a big cliff with a girl and we were running from something. So we started to scale the cliff. We got to the top and couldn't go anywhere. Then it turned into the top of a building, when I looked down, with glass windows. We were both hanging from the ledge by our fingers. I tried to get down but I was really scared and I couldn't move. Then my mother was on the top of the cliff. I was crying 'cause I couldn't get down. I was asking her for help. Then I realized I was standing on a table in my living room with my hands stretched out to the ceiling. She told me to get down.
