We went to Nana's. It looked the same with a few small differences. Ezra was on a laptop outside and was sick. Mittens was on the swinging chair and Tigger was sitting below it. Mittens kicked Tigger in the head. Ezra said Spaceman was under a chair. Mom made me talk to this Asian guy on some site. She said she was trying to find an old friend of hers and her daughter was now 20. I was on the computer in Dad's room at home. Darren was there doing something. Austin came over looking for him.
