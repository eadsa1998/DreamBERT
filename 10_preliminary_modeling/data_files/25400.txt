 I'm with my friend from Brimson Jill Banks, at a party at our friend Scott Botwright's house. I buy cup for beer. Jill buys two cups. The man gives me $2.00 in change after I give him $2.00. He thinks I gave him a bigger bill. The keg of beer is in the kitchen. The beer is really pale, like water. I spill some beer. I fill Jill's class. No one else is in line for beer.
