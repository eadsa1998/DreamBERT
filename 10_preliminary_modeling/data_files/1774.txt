Bonnie is upset. She has a Japanese "niece" that lives with her and a Japanese man is moving her things out. I suspect that he is lying to us and really is taking the niece away and won't return. Bonnie is crying and saying, "I need my niece to help me. Please don't take her away." I say, "I knew when he first came here he intended to take her away." I go to the living room. I see Uncle Wilbur lazing on the couch. He wears a Hawaiian shirt.
