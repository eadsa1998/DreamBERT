I was at Mom's new house. It was different and I had a bunk bed with a double bed underneath. This girl was sleeping over on the bottom. I was thinking that I'd take the bottom soon. There was a fan and light right above the bunk. I was really hot. I went to the kitchen and opened the fridge and Mom and I were trying to get cool. She was cooking.
