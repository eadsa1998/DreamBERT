I met Javier Bardem and he had been interested in me so I had sex with him. We had also spent a bit of time together. Some people and I were hiding out somewhere. Someone else and I went to a police station to check a file. A policewoman came into the room and was like 'did you check the conversation in the file?' and we said no and she saw paperclips in the wall and knew we were lying, but she was friendly towards us so let us go. Later, we were near a school at home time and got into a fight as kids streamed out of the classes. We called a hospital and there was a code we needed to get an ambulance. A guy and I tried to swing out legs around this tree but we couldn't. The guy pulled a log thing out of the tree and hurled something down this hill and a car almost hit it. Four of us got onto a bike.
