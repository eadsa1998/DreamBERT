Anita and I were on an elevator going down.  A couple of well-dressed guys got on, and one of them, apparently a lawyer, started telling me that he could represent me in some kind of case that I wasn't even involved in; I didn't even know what he was talking about, and I assumed he was joking, so I said, "I assume you mean pro bono."  He just smiled cryptically.  By the time we got to the bottom floor another guy had gotten on the elevator-a tall guy named Kyle, whom I apparently knew, at least by reputation.  When the elevator doors opened, the elevator was 8-10 inches above the level of the floor, and I warned everyone to watch their step when getting out.  Also, just in front of the doors was a square shallow pit in which a number of dead bodies lay.  We had to be careful to step around that too.  Kyle, however, whom I knew to be an obnoxious and disgusting lout, walked right across them, even stepping on their faces.  When he got out, I wanted to slug him in the face and knock him back into the pit to lie among the bodies, but his back was turned to me and he was too tall for me to reach around and hit him in the face, so I punched the back of his knees with my knees so that they would buckle, and I pushed him into the pit.  Well, there was a narrow but deep trench around the platform where the bodies lay, and Kyle fell into that trench.  He hit the bottom and lay still, and I worried that I had killed him and wondered if it was justified for what he had done.
