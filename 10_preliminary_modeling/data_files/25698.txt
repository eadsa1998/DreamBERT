 I'm at home with either my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas or my girlfriend Jackie Hunter. We're in my room making out. I fall asleep. Later I wake up. I am supposed to baby-sit at 9:00 pm. My mom talks about me making out with a woman like it is no big deal. I'm in the kitchen with Jackie. We talk about what is going to happen with our relationship this summer. It is mutually agreed upon that there will be no commitment. We hug, and hold each other for a while. I get a phone call from a woman I am babysitting for. I tell her I'll be over in a minute: it's now 9:15pm. She is going to be at the house working or studying, but she needs someone to watch her kids. I get my winter clothes on. My winter jacket isn't on the hook by the front door.
