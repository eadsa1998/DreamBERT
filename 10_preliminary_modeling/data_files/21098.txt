I had a dinner bucket and there were a lot of oranges in it. I think I saw Canasta as a horse. I went out to get a paper and I heard the newsboys say who won the big race. I can't remember it. I saw one of the boys with a newspaper of some kind. I asked him if it had the entries in it. He opened it up and there were none, so I said, "I don't want it."
