The predominant background for the dreams practically throughout the night was a scene of little activity in the sense of, well, you take like a block in a city and people just sitting. There are just a few here and there together as if, well, baseball season is over so we'll just sit and wait for next year or something. I guess there's no activity. This seems to have been present for dreaming for a whole night. Upon awaken, I was talking or saying something to a young girl. I have no idea who it was. It was jus as if it was someone who just happened to be on this sort of block. She was turning off as if to leave the area. I do not recall what I said. As I said before, I don't know who it was. It seems as if in most of the dream I was talking with someone in the sense of different people in different towns. There was hardly any activity as I said earlier, just talking as if someone had come across on this inactive block or street, like a square, with nothing in the middle, just grass. Like I said, people, a lot of people, just a couple of people here, a couple people there, sitting on benches. It seems as if everybody was just waiting. Again, I had the feeling that now that season's over, just sit here and wait, and it seemed like the predominant thoughts were of sports and baseball. Most of the people waiting seemed to be old men. The benches were white. Again like I said, there was very little activity.
