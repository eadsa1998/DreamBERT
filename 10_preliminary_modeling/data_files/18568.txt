I had made a gingerbread cartoon for Dora and Rudy. I rolled it paper thin so when it cooked some huge thin pockets of air raised the base of the very, very thin gingerbread cartoon. The gingerbread was rolled as close to rectangular as I could get it on the metal cookie sheet. The gingerbread was rolled between 1/32" and 1/64". Very thin for cookies. The air pockets were 1/8" to 1/2" of air trapped between the metal pan and the thin gingerbread rolled out. The far right frame of the middle row (2nd and 3rd rows) had a picture of Ned Flanders on there I had made. He exclaimed, "Who, me?" I was excited to show Dora what I'd made for her and Rudy and to tell her who Ned Flanders was. We had to sit by the fountain and wait for the big flat cookies to cool and then we saw my father in line, real comfortable, with his arms folded across his chest. It was raining. Dora got a call over the intercom to unlock room #316 but she ignored it. She got called several times to unlock the door for this teacher of 316, but she knew the teacher was not sincere. So she politely ignored the repeated requests. She looked at the cookie cartoon with me and it started raining and I said, "That's OK." I know you've got people to take care of ," and I went to see Rudy. Rudy was in the schoolroom checking out the (spelling) test results. He had a copy of the teachers' key. A guy had copied the teachers' key in her handwriting exactly, and in his own writing too. He made 100, twice, but he cheated... personality... personality... personality... Dora was showing me the infinite microorganisms in water, in the floaty moss growing on a submerged rock. So many microorganisms. So many macro organisms. Endless.
