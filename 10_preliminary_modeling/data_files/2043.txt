Elliot is at the beach. He's written some stories. I offer to read them and give him feedback. I worry that I'll hurt his feelings if he isn't any good. Then a woman comes over to me and says, "Pardon me. I think you should know that in mid-August the seas will part." I see behind her the seas parting and then a tidal wave rushing in. She says, "Those who go to church will go to one side, the others to the other side." This man is very arrogant and so we won't get married. An older woman steals Fluffy by putting her in her purse. I hear her crying and open the purse and let her out. "Is that you Fluffy?" I murmur. People keep trying to steal her. I say to someone, "That's the third time." Now the man goes up a long, narrow chute. He is not afraid. Men come sliding down the chute yelling, "Look out!" Rock slides are coming down in a rush. Suddenly, the man realizes he's in danger and slides for his life, the roar of danger loud in his ears. He escapes with his life and is now humbled and wants to marry me. He follows me around, kissing me.
