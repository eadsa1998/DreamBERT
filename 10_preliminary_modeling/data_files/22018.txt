I dreamt that I went to Brazil to study and found my friend Victor and that he took me to the house where he lived where his sister was (she was the girl I used to like as a kid). I also knew his parents, so we stayed there talking about old times and school and making jokes. We had studied in the same school before I left. I awoke after having told a joke.
