I was at the old house in my room. Cuddles, Gizmo and some other cats kept coming into my room, then Ezra's. I went into his room and he had all these old shirts in a rack from Brookland and they all had a patch of bright colour on them, there was a blue one and a green one (that I remember). I took one off to look at it and then put it back on. Ezra woke up and I said that a cat had knocked it down.
