I am very tired; sitting on the couch; Father Andrew in bed behind me: lifts me and raises me with his legs, puts on a robe, and asks for water; I get specially blessed coffee 3 times.... Father Andrew holds my hands and walks with me to other room: talk about Lent and repentance; asks if I have mourned Mother and Father dead; "Oh I forgot"; I take his head in my arms and he says "but you cannot remember everything!" Then he asks me to go shopping with them on Monday.
