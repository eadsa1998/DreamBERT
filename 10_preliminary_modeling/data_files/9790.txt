       - Father Andrew in sandals, robe; walk across front of Church, set down a dish. He looked very Greek. Then he knocks (!) on a wall to give a message to men behind the wall. They don't hear him. He hangs on to parallel bars and gets pulls up high into loft - like scenery being lifted in a theater; see him go up - (Ascension!). Then they put on a movie for kids called "Making Church Relevant and Fun." I say to Marissa... we walk hand in hand.
