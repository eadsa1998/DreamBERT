I was at a party composed of female relatives whom I hadn't seen in a number of years. They were apparently celebrating the birth of a new cousin born to a second cousin of mine, though the baby itself wasn't in evidence. One of the cousins, actually quite young, went around looking as old as her mother who looked younger than she. There was much noise until the door opened and an auburn-haired girl walked into the room. Then there was silence.
