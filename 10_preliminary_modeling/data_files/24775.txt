Bob, an enemy of mine, became my really good friend. He even kissed me on the cheek! Bob doesn't do any homework and always gets F's. I tried to talk to him about school work but he went away. The next thing I know I'm going out with a bunch of my friends to Hawaii. Abby is going too, but she is taking the Concorde plane instead of a regular one like all the rest of us. Setting: No immediate identification. Characters: Bob, Abby (group of people familiar - no immediate identification). Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. This was a day residue from Bob and Abby.
