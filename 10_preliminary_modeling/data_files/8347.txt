I had called Doctor C. He suggested we get together for a drink and to catch up. I was talking to someone and telling them that I was going to do that. I'm at home now and preparing for him to come there. I had called the maintenance men and asked them to come and work on my chain lock. I needed to get it fixed before he got there. I stressed to them the importance of them getting it completed before Doctor C got there. They made a comment about why it was so important. I said something about him being a pulmonologist. They made a comment about doctors thinking they are so important. I said that he is a pulmonologist and a lot of time he does save people lives. If he gets paged the hospital expects him to show up immediately. He showed up. I greeted him at the door. The door reminded me of the back door of my birth home. I opened the door and greeted him. Before he walked in he leaned in and gave me a little kiss on the lips, but kind of like you would with family or a good friend. It wasn't at all romantic. We were both sincerely glad to see each other again. There was a woman intern with him. They wanted to change clothes. Doctor C didn't even ask where to go he just went ahead like he knew where he was going. I directed the intern to a second bedroom where she could change. They came out. We were sitting in the living room talking. This is my home but it's not familiar to me at all. Doctor C was saying that there was something different about me. I told him that I had lost 35 pounds. He said something about it being in addition to the 23 that I lost four years ago and I said no. I told him that unfortunately I had gained that back plus some. But I'm back now because of lifestyle changes so I can keep losing and keep it off this time.
