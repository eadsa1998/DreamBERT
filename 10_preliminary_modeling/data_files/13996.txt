I was at school in the common room. Lorelei was standing up and had some bits of paper in her hands and she was talking to someone and they asked her how many she had. I realized they were dreams. She had thirty something. I told her that I had 2300. She showed me a dream she had written and it had two sentences and a bunch of pictures, including one of Jared Padalecki. I told her it was better to write full sentences rather than put pictures. I said I had five books full of dreams and I was typing them up. She asked why I was typing them up.
