I had a really dumb dream last night! I dreamt that Leslie lent me a guide dog for a few days to try it out and see how it worked, and it was this little tiny like the size of Carmen's little Chihuahua, and it was on a regular leash and just running all over and just not any good for anything. And then they replaced that one with Krystal, that was a black one, that was only a little bit bigger, and I was feeling guilty because the first two days I had forgotten to feed her. And then in a day or two it turned into a chicken, and it was a chicken and I was feeding a chicken and stuff. And somewhere mixed in to all this I dreamt that my receiver's power switch was going to heck, and at certain indiscriminate times in the middle of the night it would just turn itself out and just blast. And I had to unplug it to keep it from doing that. [laugh] And then the plug was starting to come apart and stuff and I was really having a problem.
