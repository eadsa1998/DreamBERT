A baby is packed in a box with other things. I become concerned for it's safety and open the box. I see that it is very hot in there and the baby has sweated so much it is lying in a pool of water and is in danger of drowning. I try to pick it up. Some green leaves fall in the water and I try to scoop them out before they melt into the water and choke the baby. I finally get the leaves out. I pick up the baby. He changes into a tiny little baby, deformed like Merle. I hold him in my hand. Now the baby changes again into a small kitten who hungrily sucks on my thumb. I being a mouse or some small animal to it so it can get some milk. The tits are brown and the right size for the kitten. It drinks.
