I got on Facebook and Benjamin was back on [yesterday he said he wasn't doing Facebook anymore], saying that there were so many hot girls at his university, but he was worried about the other guys still. He was saying there was one girl he really liked and he was in the same class as her. He was rating them and I was really annoyed and asked why he was telling me.
