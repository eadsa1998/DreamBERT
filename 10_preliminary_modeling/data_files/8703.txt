I was with a group of people. Something had happened that was going to cause each of us to lose some of our teeth. We had been sitting and watching TV. As I was sitting there I was tapping on one of my teeth with something. It was shaped like a pencil but it was longer, larger around, and heavier. Suddenly the back two teeth in the upper left quadrant of my mouth began to crumble and fall out in pieces. I was catching the pieces with a napkin as they fell. They were discolored and bloody, but not messy bloody. You could just tell they had a little blood on them but the blood wasn't transferring to anything else, not dripping, not leaving a spot on the napkin. The others were watching and began to get upset knowing that this was going to be happening to them. A bit later I lost the back two in another quadrant. This happened to more times in the lower quadrants. Everyone was talking about it and upset that it was going to happen to them too and what it would be like and such. I was clicking my remaining teeth together to test how it felt. I told the others that it really wasn't that bad. We just wouldn't have those back teeth to chew with anymore. The more I paid attention to how it felt when I clicked my teeth together the less okay I was with the whole thing.
