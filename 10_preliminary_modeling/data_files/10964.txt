I was with a group of kids from school including a girl and a boy who have just begun going together and his mother and younger brother. We were going on a trip in the car and the boy and girl were planning to elope and be married. We were going along with them. Next I was standing in a room which represented my bedroom at home and my sister opened a large box to show me an engagement and wedding ring which my fiance had bought for me. I examined the diamond and then began to lift the wedding ring from its place when the scene suddenly shifted. My sister and I were standing in a driveway next to the house where we used to live. There was a beautiful brand new green Lincoln sedan standing there and I got in it and drove away.
