Something about a soup with a prize in it. If you can find the little plastic container with white stuff in it in the soup and balance it on your nose, you win a new white mountainbike. I tried to win but I was not actually allowed to because I had helped to make the soup. I remember finding a little blue container in the soup and holding it in my mouth.
