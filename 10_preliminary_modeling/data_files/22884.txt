There was something like a basement full of water, the entrance to which was very narrow, and you could only squeeze through on your belly.  Randy Creagar and his dad were there, and so was Judson Schinn.  I saw some fish swimming around and decided to go above and try to get a knife so that I could spear one.  However, when I started back, someone would not let me take the knife; they thought someone would get hurt.  However, I found one just as good below, and while I was hunting, someone told me Judson had already gotten a fish.  I got out again and climbed the rise along the railroad tracks along Acorn Pl.  He had the fish, a pretty nice-sized one, cut open and was cleaning it.  (Another note about the "basement": from the outside it was like an aquarium with the water and the people in it like an underground canal with a cutaway view.) I went back down the rise and some kids were sitting on a blanket and some newspapers.  One of the newspapers was open to the movies listings.  It seems that maybe Jody or Peggy were there, and some girl who was "Charley's" (Wallers, I believe) girlfriend-a rather young girl.  I don't remember whether Charley himself was there.  I liked the girl very much.  I asked how long she had been going out with him, and she said one (or maybe four) months.    I wanted to ask her to kiss me, but I don't remember whether I did or not.
