["The spy sandwich."] War is going on and I have in the basement of my home a secret sandwich which somehow is important to the war effort. Actually the sandwich is a sort of camouflage of whatever I am creating. I have a young female roommate. I am in the basement working on the secret project wondering if I should let the military know about it. Can't be the air force because they are the enemy, but maybe the Navy. I am trying to change channels on a weird TV and having trouble seeing what is on each channel. I then look out the window and notice the shallow end of the ocean is practically up against the house. No extra safety space if there is a storm. I see the area really close to the house is sort of a tide pool area. A friend of my roommate is coming to see my project and I try and hide the sandwich. Then Dwight and even Jake comes in. Apparently I've called a family meeting.
