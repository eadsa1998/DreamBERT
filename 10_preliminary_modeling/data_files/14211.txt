There was a big dark green shed in which medical stuff went in. House (House) usually worked in there and didn't allow others by themselves. He was standing outside a fair way away, so all the doctors, myself included, ran in and tried to lock the door. There were two latches and I tried to lock them together but they just kept swinging around. I couldn't work it out and he was coming so I just ran back. He came in and pulled a lever to make this stuff pour from the rood, which was like animal insides. Before it got to me, I ran out. Then I was behind the big shed at home, which now had a fair amount of space next to the fence. I had gotten clothes from the second storey of the shed. The shed three storeys, but they were tiny (not high enough for a person to stand, just to store stuff). I was going out with Eugene I think and he was out the back too. He had clothes in the shed too. I was getting dressed and I heard him coming around the shed to see if I was there and I banged on the shed so he didn't come and he jumped and didn't come around. The shirt I had had a picture of Pikachu (Pokemon) and me on it. I put it on and came out. He was sitting at the table under the patio thing with Mom and some others. There was a chair next to him, so he stood up and moved so I could get in. The pool was clear and we were going to go in. Later, I was at Mom's old house. I left with Eugene. I needed to go the toilet so walked up the stairs to get there.
