Ezra and I went to see Battle: Los Angeles and it was directed by Michael Bay. I said that I hated him. It started off boring and then it started to turn into a disaster film and it had ok effects. There was a big tsunami thing and buildings were collapsing. This girl tried to make a guy stay with her and drown. He grabbed this thing and survived. There were lots of wooden boards floating around to save people.
