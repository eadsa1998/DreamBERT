I was in the reception room at M______ S______ hospital. My aunt was with me and we left with a group of people. Most of the group consisted of cleaning women. As we walked down the stairs from the H______ Ave. bus I noticed that the bottom step was very high and two of the women were afraid to attempt the step. I helped them down and then saw the street-car. My aunt and I ran for it. She got on but just as I was about to get on I noticed that I didn't have my over-the-shoulder bag. My aunt tried to get off but the conductor wouldn't let her. The street-car started up and I ran back but I couldn't find my purse.
