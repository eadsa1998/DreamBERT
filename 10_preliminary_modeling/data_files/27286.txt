Two girl friends and myself, dressed in bathing suits, entered Hotel C. by the Public Square entrance, and crowded into a self-operated elevator to go to the 10th floor. There was already another person in the elevator, who wanted to get off at the 8th floor. There was some difficulty with the push button, and, after going up, we started to descend again. There was a moment of confusion after which the elevator began its slow ascent again. I had a sensation of claustrophobia.
