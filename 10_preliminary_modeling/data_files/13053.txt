I was at a fair. Presents were floating around, like in Animal Crossing, and I also had a slingshot. People fell from the sky with lots of presents and sometimes holidays. I went over to this lady, who was near a Ferris wheel. As I was walking under it, it fell, but I was in between all the bits and pieces and so was ok. This lady who had fallen from the sky had stuff and I traded a lump of Quikeze for it. Adam Sandler's father's name was 'Boney Boney'.
