Dad and I were doing something and the TV was on in the background. David Lynch was announcing music. It sounded like Killer Klowns From Outer Space was going to play, but they tricked us with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head but then it did play. I was in a shop with people later and someone did something naughty and we all ran. I saw a bunch of police, so I started walking and slipped into a food shop. They walked past me. I had no money, so I left. I was watching some movie. Someone cut off a small pigs head and a girl was convinced that we had to put it in a container so they wouldn't die in vain. This guy pretended to be another guy to get close to the girl. She saw the real one and realized he was dodgy. Alan Tudyk was in the movie too. There was a Joss Whedon show with Lee Pace playing a soldier. It was about this girl was actually a guy called Beverley. I thought the show looked lame and most people wanted him to do a show based on Lee Pace's character.
