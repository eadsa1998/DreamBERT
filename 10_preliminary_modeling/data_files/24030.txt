It was at night in a parking lot, and this guy was trying to kill me and my dad, and I think my old dog was in it too. I'm not sure, though. And the guy killed my dog. My dog was hiding with me and my dad behind cars in the parking lot. Then she ran out and that guy either stabbed or shot her. Then he was chasing me and my dad. Then he killed my dad and I'm not sure how, though. But somehow me and my dad got separated and I was alone hiding behind cars, trying to find my dad. Then I saw him all bloody behind this one car. Then the killer jumped out behind the car and I got all scared and he pointed either his gun or knife at me. Then I woke up all shaking like it just happened.
