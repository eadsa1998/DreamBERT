I was getting ready for Sandra's wedding again, and I was picking out my dress and my shoes and all that stuff. And I was also picking out an outfit to go out to dinner with Gram and Grandpa afterwards, and it was all out on the picnic table. And Samantha, Sandra and Derek were around, and so then Sandra needed to go back somewhere and get ready, and Derek and one of his friends started riding around on their little mopeds. And next thing I knew I was sitting with this girl just talking and doing a little bit of studying on the picnic table, and, oh yeah -- then I just totally forgot about Sandra's wedding until Derek rides up on his moped and I said, "You're just riding around on your old moped while she's getting ready." And there was this slide over this, that went over the back fence and right into the duck pool [laugh] and so his friends rode his moped down the slide and then jumped off of it and landed in the pool. [laugh] And I never gave the _______ away.
