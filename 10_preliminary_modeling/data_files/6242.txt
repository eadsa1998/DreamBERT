My dream was that I was at a soccer game at Foxboro Stadium. I was eating popcorn then a riot broke out in the stands. Thousands of people got into the fight and police from everywhere had to come and break it up. Hundreds of people got hurt when the roof collapsed and they were taken to the hospital in many ambulances. I had a great seat so I ran across the field and hid in one of the team locker rooms. The game never finished due to the riot, and I got all my money back. The fight was over fans from both sides arguing over the score. Lots of people got arrested and I wasn't one of them.
