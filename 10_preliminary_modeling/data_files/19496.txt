A row (4 or 5) of soft maple trees -- perhaps the row in our back yard in my hometown. Several birds fly by and seem to alight in last tree of row -- tree "D." One of the birds is of a reddish color and I wish to get close enough to identify it. I therefore carefully sneak along, keeping a tree between me and the bird. There is another tree, "E," off to the right, which has a single long limb projecting over toward tree D, but I am confident the reddish bird is not on this limb. Though it seemed that my stalking was done skillfully, and I saw no birds leaving, I was unable to locate anything except a single robin. I lay down on my back and stared up at the tree until the sun made my eyes smart.
