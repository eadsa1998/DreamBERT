Mabel, Orville and I are picking berries. I am picking some whipped cream. Mabel says she's done. "Let's go." I'm not done, but say, "O.K." Then someone suggests we buy some more; I think that's a good idea. Mabel laughs. We go to a deli. I see Parmesan cheese, so the clerk asks me if he can help me, although he only works on alternate Tuesdays every 5 years. Mabel and Orville turn away to go. I say I want whipped cream. He changes into a red devil and says, "Then I can help you." I call M &amp; D and they turn back. All they see is a regular clerk.
