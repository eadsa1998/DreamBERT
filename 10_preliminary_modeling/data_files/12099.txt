I had 8 kids. Their father, who I think was Michael Palin, lived in a little house with all the kids. I barely saw them and didn't remember giving birth, being pregnant or having sex. I went over one day and all the kids were toddlers. I didn't like them because they had gay names, one was Deshantal and another was Michelle. Michelle somehow remembered me.
