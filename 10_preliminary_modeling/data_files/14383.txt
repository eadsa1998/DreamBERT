There was some chocolate and it made this guy giggle when you ate it. I went to university later where I had to show my ID card, but it wasn't enough ID. I went back and got some stuff that the girl showed me. Mom got a new cat. I was on the net and I found this huge site on Daniel Cerny, especially on Eli, but the character was called "Eherence Eli Porter". The nickname of the character was "Ehe" (pronounced E-hee). It said he hated Children of the Corn 3 and liked producing them and mentioned his first movie. Then it was something else and there was something about his third (also his latest) movie which was in Japanese.
