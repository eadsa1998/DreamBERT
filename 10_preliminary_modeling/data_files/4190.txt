["Scary dream conference."] I am at some university at a dream conference, seated at a table. I am working on my lap top computer. I call up some program and now can reach into the screen and pull out real money. Mostly pennies and some square coins, some Canadian coins, and a few dollar coins. As I do this, a man comes by, behind me and is showing some people some aura images on the wall behind me he can see. He says he has some evidence of the murders that happened here sometime ago. I feel a bit skeptical. Then I look and see the image of a woman on the wall and feel a bit frightened. Maybe that is the murderer's spirit. Ellie is somewhere in the background throughout the entire dream.
