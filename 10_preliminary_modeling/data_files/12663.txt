I was in a room with Clark Kent and Lana Lang (both from Smallville). This thing kept happening where one of us would write "This is mine and if you touch it, I'll hunt you down and kill you". They also kept writing and saying 'ICIC'. Lex Luthor (Smallville) kept checking in on us. I was asking him about the others here. There were other people who were disabled and stuff. I was then at Nana's talking to Lana.
