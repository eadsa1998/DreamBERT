I don't remember very clearly, but it went like this: It turns out that I was going steady with a boy named Richard (who is a classmate) and we had gone to the movies, but it was strange. There was a long sofa. It was rather dark and it was as though we were waiting for somebody, I think another girl, I'm not sure. But anyway, I was nervous and afraid she wouldn't come because I didn't know how to behave with my boyfriend. He turned to look at me and hugged me. I was nervous and then told myself, "He is my boyfriend," and so I kissed him and he leaned on my shoulder like a little boy. I was hugging him, but continued looking to see if she, or whoever it was, was coming, that person who made me feel insecure at being alone. I don't know if I loved him, because I waited for her with much anguish.
