 I'm at home in Oak Valley. My dad, my brother Wally, sister Ramona, and my mom are there. My dad needs a ride somewhere to repair two wheelchairs for his wheelchair repair business. We are trying to make ride arrangements. Ramona wants to go to her friend Muriah Ahmed's house. It is really cold outside: freezing. I dropped off and envelope with a note in it for Ramona. I dropped it off at a friend of my dad's a long time ago. I walked in without knocking. A topless woman is in the kitchen and her greasy, weird husband is in the living room. The woman leaves and returns clothed.
