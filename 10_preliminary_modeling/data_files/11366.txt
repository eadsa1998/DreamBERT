As the scene opens I seem to be balancing a while sitting down. After a few minutes I decided to stand up and balance it from a standing position on the edge. All of a sudden, two large boats came into the picture and I tried to go around them. Then everything turned into large boats in a sort of a maze. At first they were all friendly toward each other, and then the first two large boats became hostile over something. I tried to tell the captain of the first boat something helpful about the other boat, but he refused to listen. I had a feeling of disgust and anger, and turned to join sides with the other boat. I was refused here also, but another man who resembled a casual friend of mine was welcomed aboard. He laughed loudly and boarded the ship.
