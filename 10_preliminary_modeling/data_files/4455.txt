["Running in the snow."] I am looking for a special blanket made for me with special sewed in inserts for my misshapened feet. I am walking through snow along a long building. I think it is a museum. I am amazed how much bigger it is now with the new additions and exhibits. I decide to run. I decide I need warmer boots on. The mukluk type boots. They appear. I am surprised I can run as well and as long as I do. I see a woman and ask for my blanket. She says these aren't mine. I take one, a small one that is like a bag. I put it on, as I am sitting now, perhaps in my wheelchair. I pull it up over my feet and legs. It is cute, in the shape of a whale, with a side pocket area for my foot. Now I shall be very warm and comfortable, even out in the snow.
