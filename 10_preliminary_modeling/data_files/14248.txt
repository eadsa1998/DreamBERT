I'm not sure where I was. Eugene was there with some other people I knew. There was a game and we had to battle some weird monsters. In real life, went to a 'chemist' and no-one was there. From the door we came in, there was a shelf of chocolates to the right of the counter. This old lady came and was talking to them. I got two packs of M&amp;M's -- a peanut one and a normal one and put them behind a small statue at the front of the counter. The lady went out and we saw her through the window talking to a guy and a friend told us to run, so we ran. We got to this pool thing, which had flat seats to sit at (like they usually have at pools, going up steps, except this one was just by itself) and as we ran in I hit my leg on the edge of one, which hurt. I sat on this ledge with a guy friend of mine. I had a dream in my pocket, which I was worried was going to fall into the pool, so took it out and put it in my book, which I put somewhere safe. It was hard to balance. Later, I wanted chocolate so I went back to the chemist. No-one was there again. The peanut pack of M&amp;M's was torn open. I grabbed a normal pack off the shelf and threw it so it skidded across the floor and out the front door. No alarm sounded so I figured it was ok. Later, Ezra got in trouble for stealing a car. I was sitting down with headphones on. No music was playing, but it made everything a lot harder to hear. Mom was talking to me. She then said that she had been told I'd stolen a smoke from the chemist. I said "What? I took a pack of M&amp;M's", she sighed, upset that I'd stolen, but then I said "I left $3 on the counter because I figured that'd be enough" she nodded and said it would've been enough. I said since no-one was there, that was all I could do.
