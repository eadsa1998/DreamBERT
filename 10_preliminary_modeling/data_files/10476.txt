Pedro and BOB and others and I are walking for a long time somewhere at a Retreat place. We have fun, as we walk and come to a place that looks like St. Benedict's in Madison. I have a room upstairs and take the elevator. I push the wrong button and the elevator goes down first, then takes me up to my room. I remember getting the key and going in saying to Pedro: "I'll meet you later." Frank is in the room, eating. I worry about him being there, eating without paying, but the portions are so large I can share them with him. I return the dirty dishes all wrapped in white paper.... No one seems to worry about Frank. I get ready to go on a hike with the others. I put on my knee highs, my new tennis shoes and go out on the green lawn where Pedro is waiting. (happy feeling)
