I am playing (sort of) with a Komodo dragon, a baby. We're in the living room or hallway of a house, near the stairs, and I'm sitting on the floor. It's a cute little thing, and I'm patting it, trying not to get it too excited, because if you get too involved with them, and especially when you try to get away or stop playing, they may bite - and their bite is poisonous. It really wants to stay close, though, and I'd like to get away, but it crawls around to my back and parks there, curling up to take a nap. If I get up, I'm afraid I'll disturb it, and it'll snap at me in reflex. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do. [As I wake up, I'm imagining what it would be like if I did disturb it, and had to fight it off. I envision whirling around and pulling back to keep away, and feeling frantic. This is not what I meant to do - I'm losing control here.]
