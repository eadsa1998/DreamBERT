I remember very little about last night's dream, only that the professor of "Man and Society" was reading the grades of the people in my class. He read a lot of 75's and 78's and at the end he read mine, which was 93. All this is explained by the fact that I got a 93 on the test for that course and that same day I had been given the grade.
