 I'm going by Carter School in a car. A couple men are near the doors of the school. One of them fires a gun repeatedly. Later I learn that a bullet has hit my friend Sam Crimson. I think he is dead. Later I see him. He was hit in the head but appears to be okay. A large chunk of hair and flesh on his head is missing, and there is a big scar.
