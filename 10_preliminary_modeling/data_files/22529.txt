In the second dream I was in a hospital. I had gone to see my father who was there. Suddenly I saw that he was inside a closet in the same room and his face showed sadness, sorrow and depression. When the doctor saw him like that, she started to talk to him (I didn't understand what she was saying because I was a bit far). Then the doctor came over to me and told me that my father was scared because they were going to try some shots that had been brought from another country on him, and that these cured Parkinson's disease (it's true that my father has the beginnings of this affliction). Just last month he went to the doctor and the doctor told him about a new drug to combat it that they have in France. Afterwards I went over to him and tried to calm him, because he was crying. I was speaking to him very calmly and telling him that he shouldn't worry about his hands shaking or about people and what they would think  when they saw him like that. He told me that he wasn't worried about that, but about the fact that if the disease progressed, he wasn't going to be able to write. Then I gave him a notebook and made him practice with his left hand so that if the right hand didn't work well, he could write with the other. I was also telling him that the disease became more pronounced at the age of 70 or 80 and that he shouldn't worry because he was still young, and that he should enjoy life and see it from a different viewpoint; that is, I was trying to raise his spirits. When I came out of the room, my mother's sister told me that what my father needed even more than medicines was to take a trip, go to the country and relax, because that disease had a nervous origin.
