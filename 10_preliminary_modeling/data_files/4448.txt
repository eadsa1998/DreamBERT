["Tired and Ellie needs my help."] I am tired and want to rest. But I get a phone call from Ellie who is somewhere near T City. She wants me to come pick her up and bring her home. I keep asking her where she is exactly. She is vague and names a few small town places and says they are just past T City. I tell her I am tired. I sigh. I tell her the van isn't here yet. I don't want to drive all that way to help her, but I say I will. I arrive. I am walking. I don't know how I got there. I suddenly realize we could bus home. That would make things so much easier. Why didn't I think of that before?! I could have saved myself a long trip and told her to bus home.
