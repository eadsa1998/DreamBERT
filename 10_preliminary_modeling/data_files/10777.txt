My father was driving me up a very steep hill in our car, and my young brother (15) was with us. When we reached the top, we got out of the car and parted for my father was going one way and I the other. I was very worried about leaving the car parked on the steep hill because some little fairy like creature (male) was playing with the controls, so I told my brother to remain and guard it. As I turned away to go on my way, I faced a huge and peaceful lake that sat right on the summit of the hill.
