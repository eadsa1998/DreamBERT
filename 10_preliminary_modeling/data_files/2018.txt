I'm in a gym, like at a graduation. It's time to leave and the crowd is moving very fast, especially the freshmen. I go slowly and carefully so I don't get knocked down. Across the way is this good-looking guy. He watches out for me. I see him outside and pass several friends as I make a beeline for him. I'm very happy to see him. He's glad I chose the safer way of walking out.
