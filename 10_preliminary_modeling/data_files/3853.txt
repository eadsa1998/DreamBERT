["Alone in a spaceship."] I am alone in a space station for 300 days. A man, Howard, really, comes in. We kiss. I am chewing gum and we French kiss. I feel his tongue but the kiss doesn't feel good, or complete. I feel alone and isolated. Now I leave with Howard, I am a bit disappointed it is Howard again, but we leave. We go to a funeral. It is for my "dad." As I am walking down some steps to the room where my "dad" is laid out in state, I hear people exclaiming in wonderment and people crying from surprise and happiness. I realize my "dad" isn't dead after all, or came back to life. I go into the room and try to hug him. When I lean down to kiss his face, I notice that his face is covered by a plastic box like a take out sandwich would have. He looks tired but glad to be alive.
