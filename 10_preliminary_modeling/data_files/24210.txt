Exploration of a ruin. Ancient evil stuff there. Another strong, beautiful female went into the submerged place... and then a curse came upon her. The air in her tank disappeared and she had to live for a day on the scant air in the dungeon, which had filled up with even more water. In the dungeon with no air, I went in to help. There were doors, inside were creatures -- venomous, toothy, dog-like beasts that were like hairless, slimy pit-bulls, but evil. I had a sort of map in my head of my abilities. Acid spray, fire bolt, disable, life drain -- that sort of thing. I selected some, and then blasted one of the creatures when it came out at me. It didn't do much. It was more powerful than my abilities. I beat it to death with my hands. The girl survived. She remained calm. Opened a passage, and used the air up in each one, slowly.
