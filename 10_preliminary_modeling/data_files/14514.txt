It was Battlestar Galactica like. There was a ship and it wouldn't let me on -- it had to get to know you first and it wanted me to have experienced something 'horrible'. I was made to do labour work. I was on platforms that were floating on a liquid. I had to pull up rocks from the liquid. I fell in and I saw something scary and got out. Raquel was in a kids section. Robert Downey Jr. was there and we were friendly and we were all talking to Mom and Dad. He was talking about an ex of his and he said that she said, putting on a French accent, "If you love music, then I hate music!". Ezra was around somewhere too and he was pulling down people's pants. Later, Ezra and I were doing stuff to get citizens on MyCity.
