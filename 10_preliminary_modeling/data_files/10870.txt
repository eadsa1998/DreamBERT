I was living on a third floor suite of an apartment with my husband. A family of three ITALIANS lived on the street floor. I remembered that they were to be feared as they always carried knives. The dream skips around and I am next across the street from the apartment in a park and the three Italians are throwing (from their apartment) knives at me, only when they land on the grass and when I go to pick them up, they become darts. One of the thrown knives becomes a shining long saber knife. I believe the Italians were all males. The older one, the father, the other two, his two sons (or perhaps one was a daughter, can't remember).
