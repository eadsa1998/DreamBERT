There were these fork/butterfly things which you breathed into and it erased your memory for a while until you breathe into it again. You could also 'explore'. I went behind my wall and there were all these pictures of guys.  I went down this hallway. I found a door to Tiana's room. I went in and was talking to her boyfriend on the phone and invited him over. I was then at school and Calvin and Madelyn left for a minute. These retards were sitting near me. This lady came up and thought I was a sad loner. She was asking me these questions about being sad and lonely and I was like "I'm fine, what the hell?" Then Calvin and Madelyn came back.
