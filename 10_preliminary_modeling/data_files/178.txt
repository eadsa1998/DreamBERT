I'm supposed to be at an exercise class but I'm late and I also have a doctor's appointment - I think I can still get in on the class, though - it's 9.30 now and the doctor probably won't be ready right on time. But it's cutting it awfully fine. I've been into the gym changing room and back out to my car already, now I'm changing my mind and I'm going to pull on my leotard here in the car. It'll be awkward but I think I can do it. But no, really I think I'll be in a mess if I do that, I'd better not. I go to the doctor's office and Sandie is standing on the porch. She's a bit serious about something. [We interact, but I don't remember it now.]
