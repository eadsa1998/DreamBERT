We had strawberries, blackberries in our house. They were growing and some were large and getting ripe. I saw Grandpa with a roll of bills, money. He went to a car to pay off someone and a small truck came by. I was in the garage a little way off and I saw Grandpa put up his hands and walk to the truck. I knew it was a holdup. I yelled, but the truck took off and sped away. I lost him by the time I got gone with my car. A bunch of kids ran towards my car. One kid ran in front of my car and I bumped and knocked him over, but he wasn't hurt. Grandma was doing dishes. I left a pile of money on the table. I went to the sink and I saw my money mixed with. I picked up a bag opened it and found a nice bunch of bananas in it. I took it out and bawled Grandma out for not watching what she picks up and throws into the sink. I walked thru the streets up one and I saw 3rd street one #3115. A colored man brought in a load of big bar stock steel. He parked way back and I had to lug the big bars about 75 feet and slide them on a pile. I was reaming some finished stock pieces. They were larger than my fist. I saw one with a slot thru the side. I showed it to Carter and said, "I don't think I did that." The reamer does not put slots on the side. We were on a hill and someone started a smoke signal down below. The smoke came up like with force. I was watching a daredevil diver. He seemed to dive anyway, including just a feet-first dive and it was about 200 ft. high. A colored fellow came off his truck. It was near the lakeshore. He went into the water where the white people were swimming and he dove and he would swim. He was walking to shore and he turned out to be a colored lady. She had her breasts uncovered. I looked at them and her nipples were like a pair of colored lips. I had a steel bar about 5/8 inch thick and 12 ft. long. A small hawk flew down from the sky and was coming at me. I tried to hit him with the bar, but he was too close to me and the bar was long.
