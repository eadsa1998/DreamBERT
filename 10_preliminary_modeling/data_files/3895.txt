["Teaching and Counseling stopping a father's incest."] I am substitute teaching for a history and an economics class. I am walking around the tables answering questions and checking on student's work. As class is almost over, I am talking with one young woman. I realize she has been sexually abused by her father and it continues even today. Several of her siblings are in the class as well. I go to the father (who looks like that short plump man who does the Lions Duck Run fund raiser to stop abuse) and tell him this is sexual abuse and it is wrong. He denies it all. I go back to the woman, feeling I had let her down because I had said I would counsel them and help them. I feel sick about it. But the father comes back to me and says It's ok because an angel comes to him and says it is the right thing to do. I say, Ah, but that is your way of making it seem ok so you can do it. I said, You are basically a good man. You have a moral conscious and you know the difference between right and wrong. He is gratified to see I understand that. He changes his mind and agrees that I can counsel the family.
