The kids and I were in a house. Howard came to the door. He was going to hurt me and rape me. The kids started to go to him to open the door. I yelled, "No! What are you doing to me?" I ran to the phone. I dialed the police. I yelled, "Quick. A man is going to hurt me. I'm at XXX." I repeated the message. He came in. I ran. I was afraid (I can't remember the rest).
