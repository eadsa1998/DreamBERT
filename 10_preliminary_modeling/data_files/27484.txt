I dreamed I was wearing a white uniform and was lying on a bed at the place where I work. Dr. G-- (about 30) came into the room with an enormous hypodermic in his hand. He gave me an injection in my right arm. He stood by to see what effect the injection would have on me. I became more and more drowsy. Soon I became aware that Danny Kaye was singing "Anatole of Paris." The record repeated itself over and over again. I wanted desperately to get up and turn off the record. But I could not lift my arms or legs. I could not even make my eyelids go up--as much as I wanted to open my eves. Even though my eyes were closed I knew the doctor was still standing at my side.
