Roxanne K. comes over with David and Andrea - she helps me clean up; I apologize. She takes care of Zena, feeds her pancakes and a big dinner; I am in a room with artists; I make some marks on abstract art piece: looks like +++ in black ink; cannot be erased; I feel scared and guilty. Then I go into a larger banquet room: Father Andrew arrives; wants the children taken away; I go up to carry them to the car and while I carry Andrea, Roxanne carries on a conversation with Father Andrew; he is cool to me.
