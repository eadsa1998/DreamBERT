I was shoveling some dirt from a ditch along side of the road leading to my home town. As I was shoveling a car pulled up and some of the bosses of the construction job got out of the car. One of the men appeared to be the personal manager of Sterling and Welches. When I saw him I thought I better look as if I was working hard. The man with him was the president of the fraternity. He and I went across the street and we discussed the building of a new fraternity house. I was ill at ease with him when he realized that we had exhausted the topics of conversation, he walked away and went into a house that was his home which far off in the distance.
