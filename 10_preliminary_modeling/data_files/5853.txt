I am in a large room with many people, some soldiers, all strangers, and am attempting to buy a painting from a soldier. Suddenly an officer shouts that he will shoot any soldier giving money to anyone. This sounds odd and I decide to leave, but first I give my calling card to soldier and promise to pay him later. In departing, I say, "I still want your painting."
