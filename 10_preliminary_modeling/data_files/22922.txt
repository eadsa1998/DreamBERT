This dream may be related to the previous one.  My wife Bonita and I were in either a house or a store, and two women were on a mezzanine which was more like the overhead storage space in Mother's garage, except that it had stairs coming down in front.  The women were apparently stealing things, but openly.  I think they had guns.  I picked up some baseball bats one at a time and threw them at them while they were in the upper area, hoping desperately to hit them on the first try so that they couldn't retaliate,  I missed on three tries, but they didn't seem to pay any attention to me.  So when they came down again I bashed first one and then the other with all my might.  To my horror it was just like hitting a tree trunk-just a little give, a little bounce, and no effect.  I yelled this chilling discovery to Bonita, and the women started advancing on me.  One of them opened her mouth, and a short, sharp fang glistened in each corner.  [At that point I woke up, moaning loudly.  I pulled the covers up around my shoulder and drew closer to Bonita.]
