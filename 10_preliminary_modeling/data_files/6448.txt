We had the corpses of Saul Bellow and "Nathan Zuckerman" (Philip Roth) in caskets in our apartment. They were dead and we were to bury them the following day. Roth had a cheap casket, made of paperboard, and Bellow had a fine ebony one. I was to deliver the eulogies. Laura and I decided to put them outside because they were beginning to stink. Only problem was, it was raining. We stacked them on the porch, Bellow (who was tall) on the bottom and Roth (who'd been short) on the top, and covered them with a blue blanket to protect them from rain. The subjects of the eulogies were to be "Seize the Day" and "The Ghost Writer". I was rereading both of them late at night to think of something to say. We were laying in bed. This is when Laura noticed the corpses were stinking. We then moved Bellow off the kitchen table with his dark black wooden casket and Roth with his blue paperboard ex-musical instrument case (with metal reinforced corners) off the stool, and moved them out. Then we laid our own blankets back out. I thought I spied a spider in the blankets, but on inspection, it turned out to be some orange lint. I menioned to Laura: "Roth must have been really fucking cheap. I'll bet he wouldn't pay a dollar fifty for coffee." There was something earlier involving buses, but I no longer recall.
