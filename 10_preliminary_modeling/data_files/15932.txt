I was staying somewhere with a bunch of people from the Technical College (some real, some not). They had triple bunks and I was staying in the same room as my friends. We were messing around somewhere and I leaned in close to Frederick and he said 'I thought you were going to kiss me' and he kissed me on the head. We were later in the room and some girls came in and wanted to stay in there and I angrily snapped at them and said 'no, this is our room' and they left. I had a middle bunk and Frederick had the top bunk. He was teasing me through the wiring of the bed and we were taking photos of each other. At one point I climbed up the side into his bed and he was like 'what are you doing' and I said I needed to hide. Someone came into the room asking for me and she stood right over the bunk sniffing it and he said I wasn't here. She said it smelled like I'd been in his bed and he just shrugged.
