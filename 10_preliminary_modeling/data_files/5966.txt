I am in a room looking apprehensively at a blank wall, knowing that something is about to happen. Then I see it and I exclaim, "It's the Blue Hand!" An ethereal, translucent, dark blue right hand, cut off at the wrist, slowly rises up the wall. The hand does not gesture, but is always in an upright position. I find the sight both frightening and intriguing. I dare not approach the wall, yet I want to know more about the hand, suspecting that it wants to tell me something. As the hand reaches the top of the wall, it thins out and then disappears.
