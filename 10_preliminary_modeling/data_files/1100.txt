My Aunt Elaine and Grandma Agnes are the first of a number of relatives that are visiting me. I am wondering what I'm going to feed them. I look in my cupboards and find not quite a pound of hamburger. It won't be enough to make my old stand by, spaghetti. I am chatting with grandma who looks years younger. I ask her, "Don't you go to the United Methodist Church? We have one here, in my new neighborhood. There are lots of old women that have the same disease as me,  but no one my age," I say sadly. Grandma starts walking to the store. I run after her, shouting to her and then haven't the courage to ask her to get me some more hamburger. I decide I'd better go get it myself, rather than ask for help. I am annoyed that I have to. It takes so much of my energy.
