My parents and I were having dinner with Bill Gates (more like Scott Adams).  His grown son had a hook for his left hand.  Bill told us how he raised cattle, and let them roam free.  Our cat Nina sat in the cattle's cage.  There were penguins and kids in a large wading pool, designed somehow for filming Chicken Run.  There were some wires suspended above.
