 A man and a woman are in a mall. They meet there for a movie. The man loves the woman. The woman doesn't care about the man. The movie with her is an important event for him. The movie with him is not important to her. I have an image of her walking in her business suit, very self-righteous, and the man running along trying to catch her and keep up with her, holding flowers, as if she is careless about being late or missing the show.
