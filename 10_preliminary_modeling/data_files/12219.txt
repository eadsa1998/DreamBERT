I was in this spacecraft which was like a plane, but wasn't. It happened twice -- once was real life, and the other was a The Outer Limits episode. The first time the computer had taken over and it kept going higher and higher and we went past clouds and the danger zone. When we past the danger zone it started beeping. We smashed the computer and regained control. The second time, there were two groups of people. One group was good, the other was bad. The bad people got control of it, and they were smashing the computer up.
