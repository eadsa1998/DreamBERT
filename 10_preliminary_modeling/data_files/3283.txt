I am at N City. I am given a plant, or rather several plants transplanted into one pot. There is room for one more plant in the pot and we look at different plants to find one that uses the same environmental conditions so it will be compatible. We find one sort of a tiny, ivy-like plant with small white flowers. It is very pretty. We put it into the pot. When these baby plants get growing they are going to be very beautiful. Now it's evening and time to go home to M City. Shall I wheelchair it to M City or take the Greyhound? I go for a while in the wheelchair and realize I'm lost. I ask this man for directions. He's very tall, towering over me. He tells me he is partially deaf on one side and I need to get used to his speech. I say, "I am too." So he starts trying to give me directions. I can't decide if I should wheel it or bus it. I try to call the bus depot for information but can't seem to get through. The phone book is buried behind papers and the man on the phone is unclear. He does finally say I can't get there directly from N City. I'd have t bus to Dover and then transfer. It will take lots of time and is difficult. I feel tired.
