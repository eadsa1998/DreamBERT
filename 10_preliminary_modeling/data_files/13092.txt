I was watching Doctor Who with Ezra. Mom later said that Ezra hated it, but I didn't think he did. People were doing an assignment on Rose, on why she cried at the end. I was like "They can't put that in there!". The Doctor was at this poor place and this girl liked him and followed him. I realized later that he didn't have a companion. This doctor was before David Tennant, but after Christopher Eccleston.
