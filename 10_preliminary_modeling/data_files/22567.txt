Then I dreamt a different thing, very complicated. Instead of living in a house, we lived in an apartment (father, mother, sister -- 17, brother -- 13) and my father was already very old. He didn't look like my father, but I had the feeling I was the daughter of that man. Suddenly I saw myself sitting in the car with another person. I don't know who it was; I only remember I felt I was with somebody. But at the same time, I felt I was his daughter. I felt like a friend of that family because I was asking my father about everyone's health. He told us that his wife was in her room with arteriosclerosis and that he was taking care of her (my mother is a young and healthy person). Then he touched on the problem he had of a daughter who was very much in love with an indecent doctor and that she didn't know this and couldn't say no to him. He also loved her, but in a very peculiar way. I remember I saw both of them in a hospital. She was crying and scolding him, blaming her own weakness. Then I saw them going into the apartment and she had made up her mind not to see him any more. Everything was very confused because at the same time I identified myself with the friend in the car, with the daughter, such as I am, and with the daughter about whom the father was talking, but the things he told me were like things in a movie and she is physically different from me and older. After this I awoke.
