 I'm in my friend Kevin Simpson's truck. We are by my dad's little old house. We're going to the Big Resort Area. Our gear is packed. There is a pack on the floor of the passenger seat of the truck. I'm sitting in back on top of the truck with a wheelbarrow wheel and axel in my hands. The truck is on a larger truck or on a ramp. In a nearby big truck are some track and other equipment like that I used to catch chickens. We touch the stuff and get grease and dirt on our hands. A man is mad at us and tells us to leave. We ignore him. We drive away when the man comes towards us. My large photo album is under the passenger seat in the truck. I wonder if the truck will be safe while we're gone. We are on a three-wheeler. The man who is mad at us follows us in a large caterpillar bulldozer. He drives it pretty fast. We try to outrun him, and go fast. We get to a fence, lift up the three-wheeler, and toss it over the fence. In order to follow us the man would have to break down the fence, which the bulldozer could do.
