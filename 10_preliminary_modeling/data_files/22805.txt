At the far end of the midway, like Bayview Beach, is a large showroom, exhibit hall, or something, and there is a man swinging through a hoop outside.  Uncle Jack, Joe, daddy, grandpa, and I are together at about the middle of the midway, in a little corner off to the side.  Joe tries some sort of machine he has evidently tried before.  You're supposed to hop around on one foot while licking a round lollipop.  Joe does this and finally gives Uncle Jack a bite and then me a bite.  It is light orange inside.  Then we go back down to the end again to meet Patty, Aunt Thelma, etc., and ride some of the rides in the building.
