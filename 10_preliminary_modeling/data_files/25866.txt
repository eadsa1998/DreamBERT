 I'm in a small plane with three men, two of whom are good and the other who is bad. The bad man tries to push a good man out of the plane. We save the good man from falling out. We push the bad man out of the plane. The door to the plane is like a trap door in the bottom of the plane. We drop the bad man's bottle of Aunt Jemima syrup out the door after him. One of the other men starts to fly the plane. We are going to land. We have sort of a crash landing. We live. While we are spinning around in the plane once it has crashed, I say to the other men, "Hey, we lived!" Two men are at the airport where we landed. I ask them to keep a pack of Trident gum.
