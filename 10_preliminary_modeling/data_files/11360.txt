I was sitting in a drug store eating a sundae with a bunch of young people whom I don't know. I began to talk with one of the girls who was interested in going to Israel. While coming to the drug store we had passed a huge building that was in the process of being built by the most modern methods and I made an aside that I wish we could build as quickly in Israel. The girl started to talk about this when we were in the drug store, and I mentioned to her that we didn't so much need skilled engineers and contractors as we did good fast workers, bricklayers with experience, etc., and also modern equipment. She agreed with a me and said she would try to learn bricklaying.
