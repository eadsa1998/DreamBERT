Paulina is upset. I want to hold her. She resists and I say, "I want to hold you because I need it." She says impatiently, "OK, but let me turn around," and so turns her back on me to be able to cuddle spoon-like. I put my arms around her, being careful not to touch her breasts. I accidentally brush them. I hug her and rock her to soothe her. I like our position because I'm not face to face with her emotion. I see her/my face reflected in a window.
