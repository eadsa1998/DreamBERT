 I'm in the Big Resort Area with my sister Ramona, a man, and a woman. We're fishing in an area of small rivers. The woman catches a small northern pike. I try to help the couple get a photograph of it by holding the fish for them. I drop the fish! It is in the water. We are in the water up to my chest. I pick the fish up out of the water. It is a good-sized pike: between seven and nine pounds, I estimate. I lose the fish again, dropping it in the water. I'm using my friend Kevin Simpson's telescoping fishing rod. I feel guilty that I dropped these people's fish. I case into the trees, in the woods, and on shore. I don't do this on purpose. The handle on my rod and the crank on my reel are broken. The man tells me to not open the bail all the way.
