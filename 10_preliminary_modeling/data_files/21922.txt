Steve Potosky and I were in a shop. There was a big machine. I didn't know how to run it. Steve Potosky put a piece of leather in it and it went into the machine. Steve walked on top of the machine, which was low and flat and about 20 ft. square. He walked about three quarters of the way, then came back and the leather came back out with a perfectly built shoe. I looked at it. It had soles and heels and was a high shoe that covered the ankle. I put it on and it fit perfect. I had no tongue or facing, just like a bedroom slipper. I held it up and felt the soft leather. I was by my mother's house and we watched Frank Fledich across the street doing some repair or remodeling on his house. He looked at me and said, "Look at that guy, how he is relaxed." The sun was shining and it was a beautiful day. His small boy was on the tree lawn and was stepping around making off. He was measuring or planning how to lay the pavement or some other thing. Audrey came by me and I noticed her underpants were dirty from a bowel movement. I told her and she said, "Will you come and wipe me off?" I said I would. Then I told her, "You better wash yourself off. You are smeared with it." I picked up a couple bolts and nuts that were lying in a bushel basket. I was driving or steering a streetcar. There was track and there was none and the streetcar ran on the street. I came close to buildings and had to steer it away not to hit them. Then there was traffic coming and I had to stay out of its way. There was a big rail on the street. I steered the car over and across it. I wiped my wife off and some fleas fell on the floor. I had a hard time picking it up. I was embarrassed that Frank F. would see what I was doing.
