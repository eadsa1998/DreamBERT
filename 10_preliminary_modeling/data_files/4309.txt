["Captain Janeway is exhausted."] I am Captain Janeway and I am extremely tired. But I must continue my duties. I give orders and check up on things. My first officer, Chacotay is concerned about me and wants me to rest. So does another woman. I keep on doing what needs to be done, feeling near the end of my endurance.
