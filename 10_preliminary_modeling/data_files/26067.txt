 I'm camping with my friends Kevin Simpson and Tim and Niles Zelling. I put some little stickers near the handle of a fishing rod. We are leaving this place to go to another place. I'm getting some wood wrapped in plastic in case it rains. There is long and short wood wrapped in plastic. I walk with this wood. There is a large steep cliff about 100 yards from where I am. Rocks are falling down the cliff. I think I'm safe from them. More rocks fall as I get wood. There is a big log, like a tree trunk that is leaning up against a log entryway shaped like an upside-down U. A rockslide starts. I hide among the smaller rocks on the side of a smaller cliff ledge. I hope the big rocks will tumble over me and I'll be safe. I realize that the rocks are going to pile up on me, and they may wholly or partially crush me. I won't be able to get out of the rock pile: I will be buried alive, or maybe dead, by the avalanche of rocks. I feel scared, and doomed.
