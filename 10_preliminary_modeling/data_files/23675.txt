I am in bed and the phone rings.  When I answer it I say something unintelligible, like "Channel 13, oops, I mean uh, Tara", because I'd just woken up.  The person on the other line is a child or two children, sounds long distance.  I can't understand her, she sounds young.  While listening I go to the apartment door, it won't seem to close, the deadbolt is too far from the frame.  This worries me.
