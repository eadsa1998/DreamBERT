When I got to the clinic, a woman doctor in a light green smock asked me what else I wanted. I answered that I had forgotten to tell Dr. B. I wanted phenobarbital. She gave me a bottle of two kinds of white tablets. I told her he had given me enough other medicine and couldn't take these. They might not go with his. "He will be gone all February," she said. I asked for her bill since the K. D. Home wouldn't like my going to the clinic so soon. Finally she said that the sailor would give me phenobarbital and he did. I went down to pay the bill but they hadn't received it yet so I left my address and told them to be sure to mail the bill to me not to the Home. When I got back to the Home, the doctor came in. We tried to talk in the living room but the other ladies kept interrupting. I showed her my room. She asked how much I owed her and if she could borrow money until that was settled. I demurred thinking I didn't have enough but looked in my billfold and found $3 for her.
