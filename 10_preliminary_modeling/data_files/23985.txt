This dream occurred about a week before Halloween, the night after a friend of mine was kidnapped. The dream took place in my brother's room. My grandma and I were talking about how my sister would be moving out of her crib, and sleeping in a big bed. I asked my grandma whether or not it would be a nuisance if my sister might accidentally hit the wall in her sleep. Suddenly, I heard a banging sound, but it wasn't my sister. There was a man banging at the window and holding a knife. Then I woke up.
