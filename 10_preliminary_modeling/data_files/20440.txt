I was in a house with my mother and sister. I was fixing a stopped drain. I almost dropped the rubber part of the plunger into the hole. After that my mother put some plates of food on a table over another drain about 12 feet away. A plate began to spin. I reasoned that the suction from the drain was causing the spinning. The drain was much stronger than the one I had just fixed.
