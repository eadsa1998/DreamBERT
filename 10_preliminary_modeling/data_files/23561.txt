I was working in a clothing store. We had to arrange the clothes in a certain way or we'd get in trouble. Suddenly I was in the auditorium at my grammar school and this obese woman chose me to be the cook. It was like a cafeteria. We were supposed to cook shrimp and duck. I refused to do it because I was a vegetarian (which I used to be). They were going to make me to it anyway.
