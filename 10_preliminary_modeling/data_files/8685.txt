Matthew and I were doing something in his closet here at home and I noticed what appeared to be an opening into what might be an attic. Neither of us had noticed it before. I pushed the piece of wood that was covering the opening up a little bit and peered in. It was very dark. I decided to climb up there and see if there was anything up there. As I got further up there I realized that I had known about it. that I had forgotten that I even put a lot of stuff up there to store. It was a very large well-lit room and there was a lot of stuff up there. Lots of furniture and boxes and other stuff. I noticed several different antique pieces of furniture. There were some other people up there with me. I pointed out a couple of the antiques and said we could take those back downstairs and I could use them instead of buying the pieces I had been thinking about buying. At least two of them could be used as a dresser in the guest room though that was not their original use. I realized that I could also enter this space from ground level outside. maybe through my garage. I was going in and out this way now.
