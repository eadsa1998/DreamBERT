A person with a British accent is supposed to see me about something. I want to fool her so I make up a plan to use an accent. During this time a cop comes to the door with a question and I pay her "back" 25 cents for having a dog at large or some small crime. I think I have fooled the British person and he/she goes ont. Then another cop shows up with a little girl with the same problem and I pay the bail. (I don't know what the "problem" was.) by now I have forgotten about the British person and the doorbell rings and I am not putting on the accent and it is the real British person arrived to see me.
