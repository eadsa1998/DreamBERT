I dreamt that at one point, I had had an older brother named Simon, who died when I was twelve in a motorcycle accident. One of the things that made this dream so wierd was that I had vividly *re-imagined* old family photographs to include this third brother who had never existed. He looked sort of like a cross between myself, Andy and Brent.
