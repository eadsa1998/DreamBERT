I was visiting John and Lois, and the order of things is confused.  Whether it came first or second, I'm not sure, but one episode found John and me and Ellen Wall lying in his back yard at night when a huge dirt clod in the form of a cloud whose shape rather resembled Austria floated by directly overhead.  It filled me with a sense of foreboding, and I suggested we run for the house.  Just as we did, it began to break up, and the dirt began to fall, spattering a couple of houses behind John's the hardest, but a little fell in his yard as well.  Not much hit us, though.  John and Ellen jumped into a small pit in the yard, and I followed close behind them.  When it was over, we went to the houses which had been hardest hit, and they were a horrible sight-the entire upper story of one completely destroyed, and the other badly damaged.  The owners were surveying the damage; one of them was a carpenter or architect.  The two houses were connected in the front by a wall, and the carpenter was explaining where they could put joists to provide mutual support for the two houses.  I didn't know for sure what a joist was, and I didn't understand his plan at all.  <p
