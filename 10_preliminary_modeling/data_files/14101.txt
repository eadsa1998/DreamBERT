I was at school. I had planned to sign out. I went to the office at the time I wanted to leave. Calvin was there to sign out too. Ms Atkinson was there and she was going to eat lunch and told me to fill out the slip. I asked the other office ladies if they would sign it and they said "you're just going to put it in your pocket" (accusing me of being a liar) and I said "What am I going to do, eat it?" and they laughed. I went. I started walking and then saw Ezra and Emery. Mom's car was behind them but I didn't see it behind Ezra. Then we were at a shop or something with Granma and Mom and they were in a relationship I think.
