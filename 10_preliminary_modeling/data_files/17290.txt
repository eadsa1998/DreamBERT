Dreamt I was living on campus.  I moved in with my dorm roommates Sally and Chelsea once again.  This time the three beds looked more like hotel beds and were all on the left wall.  A patio with a balcony.  Opposite the beds was a glass closet.  I opened it. Inside were little sticks with hamburgers on them.  I was surprised to find that it passed all the way through, into a kitchen and dining area.  The carpet was a light dull blue.  Off the kitchen to the right were some stairs descending to a bathroom.  We had an apartment!  It was then I realized wait- I already have a place to live.  I started debating.  An apartment, on campus.  But with Chelsea, who's difficult to live with.  I tried making a phone call but couldn't figure out where the star key was.  I ended up dialing a 2 and got Sally's father.  He was somewhat angry.  I left and found my dorm friend Peter.  We looked for the copy machine.  Went through dorm mate Michelle's room, there's a way to get through the middle of the building 'inside' the walls.  It comes out into my dorm mate Leann's triple, but the copier is right next to it.
