I was at the track and I heard a fellow announce a horse. He said Brownser or something like it in the 2nd race ran 6th in the last race, but was going to win this one and the odds would be good. I played $5 on him, then won and paid over 20 to 1. I was going to be a conductor and a passenger train. I asked the lady what the fare was and she said 40 cents. I got a couple books of tickets. I put them in my shirt pocket and they were heavy like lead. We were in a lady's home whom we thought made counterfeit money. Fisher, Ernie and I pushed on a new brick wall of mortar and we tipped it over and down. Then we pushed it back up.
