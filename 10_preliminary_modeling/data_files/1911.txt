A woman is mad at me and complaining. I'm in a bathtub and looking for my toothpaste. I can't find it. So I get out and go to my apartment. I see Hector and his friends. They'd been partying and are drunk. They're fixing food and I'm in the way. I say, "I'm just trying to get my bowl for breakfast and I'll be out of your way." They don't help or care. I try to find a bowl in a tall pile of dishes and platters and plates, almost knocking over the pile and breaking dishes. I find a shallow bowl. One guy comes back to half-heartedly help me. I leave to go to a house. I'm going to baby sit for a while. I see the baby, who is sleepy, lying on the couch. I pick her up to rock her to sleep and then I hear another baby. Someone brings in a tiny miniature baby, which is cold and blue. I touch its skin and leave a white imprint of my finger. I'm amazed. Then I hear more babies crying. I go in, followed by the complaining woman and see nine babies in cribs. I say, "I didn't know there were other babies." The woman decides to stay and help me. She is gruff and doesn't give freely. But she will stay and help.
