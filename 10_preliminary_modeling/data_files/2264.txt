I'm in a car feeding french fries to three children, feeling selfish because I ate them first. The driver says, "75 cents for a cup of coffee! Oh, well, my mother wanted me out of the house for a while, you know how it is." I nod and then she is a woman that looks like Patricia and I think, "No wonder you (Lydia) don't like her." We come to a house and see a child bathing in water coming out of a broken pipe. "Oh look," says Patricia, pleased. "Yeah," I say, but that means it's not fixed yet.
