I was an alien or at least, I was friends with some aliens. We were in an outside area surrounded by fences (there were lots of areas and they were all joined together). Sometimes I was inside. We had people in one of the areas to keep them safe. One of them and I went two blocks away. He had an alien gun. I said "don't I get one?". He said no. People were coming. We then found a gun buried and he gave it to me. I couldn't remember how to use it. I was now definitely an alien. He showed me how to cock it and told me to aim at something to hit a mask to practice my aim, but then we heard them coming. I went behind the other guy and then they came in and we started shooting. The gun shot out a liquid which exploded but it had to recharge; so there was lots of 'bang' but then a five second pause. Then they came from the other side. There were only a few left on the first side. Jennifer Carpenter wandered in from that side. I said "Jennifer, go through that door" as she was friendly with us, though she looked really confused and lost. I aimed behind her and started shooting again. Then I was inside somewhere and there was a round counter in the middle (like in bars). There were a few people around, including Bill Clinton, who was the president. I shot liquid on him and he exploded. Everyone seemed shocked and I said "is that bad?".
