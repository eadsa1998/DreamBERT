I've been taken to a supermarket to meet a woman there who has won a competition to meet me (I've no idea why that would be a prize for someone). She's about 16. I get shown around the store. There are turnstiles at the entrance. The store is enormous. There's a PR woman and perhaps a film crew with us. The girl introduces me to a friend of hers who is working at the tills. They giggle. I'm confused.
