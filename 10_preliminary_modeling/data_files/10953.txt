I dreamed that I was walking about in a parking lot with another person, a man of about 40 years old, and it was our job to hurry around to get all the cars parked in certain places. I remember that I saw many of my parents' friends driving in, and I had a hard time finding room for them. I also saw several Walt Disney characters such as Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse and others. It was my job to chase around after them and tie a yellow ribbon on each one. I had a terrible time finding all the animals and was worried that I could not get all the ribbons on in time. I was still hunting for the animals and then I awoke.
