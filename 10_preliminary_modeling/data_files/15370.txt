Some guy was going across the USA to different motel. America was in the shape of a square. There was a place with a big shop called Northtown. He got to his final destination where he had a prostitute waiting, who was played by Megan Fox and I was like 'urgh, she's ugly'. Her boobs were big and there was stuff like tea towels between them and then she took her clothes off and then there was a montage of them having sex in various positions. Then he left with some drug people. The cops stopped them and found drugs and I was sad because he was a nice guy, but he had been aware that they had drugs.
