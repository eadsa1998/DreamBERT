I'm in a big city trying to commute to work on a bike. There's traffic and people everywhere - it's awful. But my bike is efficient at cutting through the jams. Then I have to lock it somewhere. An old colleague Kevin appears to advise me how to adjust something. I have to use two keys - it is fiddly. I arrive at a band rehearsal room - it has a low concrete ceiling and is fairly large. My old band is there along with some others. I end up playing a couple of our old songs on an acoustic guitar - perhaps there's a backing track playing. It appears that we are going over the old material to try to make it better.
