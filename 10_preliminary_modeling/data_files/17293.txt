I dreamt of being in a dorm room.  I don't know if my good online friend Del or my boyfriend Jeremy was there, telling me he had to leave.  Then, graduation.  My old roommate Sally was there, but it was high school, not college.  My gown was yellow.  For some reason after the bathroom we went off to the left of the gym.  I tried to hurry and get there because they were filing in.  I tried to fill out the card they read names from but my parents were there and for some reason I couldn't write.  Hurrying and nervous.  Finally I gave up and ran, but I was too late.  People were leaving.  Few graduates were sitting on the bleachers with their parents.  I didn't get to march.  I sat down and listened to a girl talking about being sexually harassed; the guy had touched her breast.  I felt a hand on my back and prickles on the right side of my neck.  I turned.  It was Jeremy.
