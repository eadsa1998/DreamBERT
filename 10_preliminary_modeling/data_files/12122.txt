I was at home except it was like a mansion. The main Saved by the Bell characters were there and paired up. The blonde one said something about having both guys. I was with Ryan Cartwright. We were in bed in this room. Mom kept coming in and telling us not to do anything naughty. We had wine and we tried to get the cork through the window, but it missed. We started drinking it, but then Ryan kissed me. While we were 'asleep', these ghosts were buying dresses and other girls clothes. I was at some place and I was trying to get out, but there were all these snakes in the way. I fell and a big snake licked my face. There were 'space' games at this place. Ezra went on a cart to get $100.
