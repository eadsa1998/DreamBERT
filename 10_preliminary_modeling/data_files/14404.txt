My computer had been screwy for a while. It ended up getting smashed. It was mixed in with a pile of sand and other bits of stuff. I was going through and picking out important stuff -- files etc. I went somewhere and had a lame mobile phone. I text Mom to get me a new computer. She said ok. I called her and said I needed to be picked up. She said no and to not leave yet. I then realized I was outside of Cat Haven. I explained to her I quit. I was then at Nana's and I was showing her my phone, which was big and a weird shape. It had a tiny screen.
