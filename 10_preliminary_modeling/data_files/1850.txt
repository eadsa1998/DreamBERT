I see a house. Each room is up a flight of stairs. Each child will have their own room - lots of bunk beds. One room had birds, some memory in it, and when I poked my head in, I could hear the bird song. The next room was scary. I could feel it, but I opened the door anyway and a cute yellow plastic ghost rushed up to the door on a string. I laughed. I saw a bathroom with two tubs. A door opened. I saw a flight of stairs to a cocktail bar. I see the arm of a man on the banister. He's leaning over to see me. I shut the door quickly.
