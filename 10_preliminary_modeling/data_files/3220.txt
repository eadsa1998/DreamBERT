I am in a house and two young married couples are there kissing and hugging and I feel like a fifth wheel. I smile indulgently remembering there are lots of bedrooms here and stroll on out to have breakfast. I go outside and see Charla. I am dancing in an exercise kind of way. There is lots of good energy; it's time to move again. I pick up my mail and open an ad for the new Mobil station, which has just been remodeled and open for business. Charla says, "What did I get?" and I say, "This is just an ad. Let's go get breakfast." She picks up a glass of milk from a table in a cafe where people are seated and drinks. We smile and go on to fix breakfast.
