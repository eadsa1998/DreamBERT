["Carrying the cat."] I am making a clay figure of a head. I put two of them in a cup of water. I pick one up out of the water and find the strands of hair from the back of the head (clay hair) have come off. I am trying to clean up my work area. I get out of the high wheelchair and sit at a regular work chair at the table. It is more comfortable that way. I walk outside holding a cat in my arms. We are walking up a street and I see the beginnings of the parade lining up. We are going against traffic. I go too far. I was looking for the street that turns left to go get breakfast. I turn around and retrace my steps to the correct street.
