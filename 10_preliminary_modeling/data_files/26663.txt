 There's a large black piece of paper on the floor with small dots of dried glue on it. It's a map of the stars. My classmate Phil Crusan is there. He says something about being in some kind of a jam because he didn't see a magazine cover, and something resulted from it. I connect the dots: the stars. I use a pen at first. Then I use a high liter marker, maybe pink. I'm then using paint. I connect the dots according to another piece of paper that already has the lines drawn in. There are three men in a room. Some of them have guns. They attack me because of the way I paint. One may fires his gun and almost hits me. I fight with the two men. I have a .22 rifle, and am out of bullets. They seem to be out of bullets as well. I use a gun as a weapon for hitting. I jab one man in the throat with the butt of the gun. The gun is then a metal bar I use as a hitting weapon. One of the men is hit repeatedly on the head and may get brain damage. His skull is soft and mushy: beat to a pulp.
