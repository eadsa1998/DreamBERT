I was at Mom's. Ezra said that Samantha and some others were trapped in my room as the wind had shut the door closed. I went up and he got the door open and I was like "What the hell are you doing in my room?!". Samantha came out, holding a baseball bat, worried I was going to attack her. I had a metal pole and I hit her with it. Adelynn was hanging around my computer. I was worried Samantha had read my diary and knew that I liked Dmitri, but remembered she already knew anyway and I was thinking 'She knows about Eugene! No!'. I told Adelynn to get away and get out and I hit her with the pole. She slowly waddled out. I had been making "breakfast, lunch, dinner, whatever you call it" in the kitchen. It was cereal and in a black garbage bag. Samantha had put bottles in it, which ruined it. I pulled them out and some had stuff still in them. While I was facing the sink, Samantha splashed me with a little bit of it, sort of spitefully/bitchy. I wasn't supposed to have noticed, but I did so I splashed her back with a little bit, and then I found a bottle half full and poured the whole thing over her. I pushed her out the front door. Adelynn was in the hallway and I was closer to my room. She was teasing me because she was "going to get work" and I said sarcastically "because you did well on your IB?" (She didn't do IB). Then she said I was fat and I said "look at you!" and she started running out of insults and I pushed her with the pole and whacked her with it. I got her outside and she kept trying to come in. We had this barrier outside the house, which was in the middle of a field and the barrier was a fair way away, but she managed to pass the barrier.
