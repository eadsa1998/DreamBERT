Ann, Bob and I walked up a hill to a park. The race track there was a fight of gangsters shooting at each other. We watched. Then Bob and I walked for a phone booth and Ann went into the park on the other entrance. We met Tommy Lasko in the park. We walked thru where we buy the tickets. The track was closed for racing season. I heard someone say, "What are you playing?" and I looked and saw John Lasko (deceased). I knew that he was dead, but I just went on with it. Then we were looking for Ann. John wanted to see her. I looked way down the park and I thought I saw her in the crowd, but it was not her when we cane to the lady. Then we sat in the car with John, Mary (wife) and Tommy was outside talking to his dad. Then we met Ann. She got angry at me and came at me. I backed up and fell backwards over a small fence.
