I was watching an old movie about dinosaurs. Humans played the dinosaur parts. I was with friends that I'd never seen before. There were waterslides at this place. We were going to go down on our knees, but didn't because it would burn. We were looking in this house and this guy came and said "What are you doing?!". I said "Uh... checking the stairs". Then we tried to explain. Some female friend of mine came and was saying that I was bisexual and I said "Really, I didn't know that?" and then she kissed me and I was thinking 'Well, I've already had my first kiss with Milo (Ventimiglia), haven't I?'.
