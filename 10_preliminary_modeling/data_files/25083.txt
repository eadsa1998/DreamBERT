 I'm at Armstrong High School to play a water Polo game. I think there is a winter storm outside. We hop in the pool and start fooling around. Among the people there are my friends Thad Templeton, Stephen Ramos, Sam Kingsley, Annette Gollum, Melanie McDyss and my girlfriend Annie Thomas. A basketball teammate from high school, John Kulik, may also be there. A group of kids and their leader arrive. We are restricted to the deep end of the pool, then. Before we start up, we all gather around the side of the pool. There are bunk beds there. The kid whose bed I am sitting on is on vacation. My friend Tom Napper talks about how he has urinated while on a cordless phone. I laugh and say I've done that too. A man named Hal and his mother are there and they laugh at that comment. <br/
