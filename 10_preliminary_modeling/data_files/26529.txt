 I'm walking through a forested area. I see something move, pushing the brush apart. I think it must be a moose because it is so big. It comes out from the brush and I see it's a large bull moose with a big rack of antlers! It is the first bull moose I've seen with a big rack of antlers. I don't have my camera, but I'm not far from the place where my camera is, and seeing how moose usually move slowly, I can probably come back and take a photograph of it. I walk on, into a museum-like area with stuffed animals. I see a sow bear and two cubs. They move, and I realize they're alive! I hurry away from them: they may be dangerous. I make it back to a group where I talk with the others about the animals I just saw. Some of them have seen the animals too.
