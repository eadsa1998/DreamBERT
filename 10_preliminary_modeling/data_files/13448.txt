I was at school to finish uncompleted work. I was in the old S+E classroom, but it was different. We were doing math work. People brought in these books and it said something about "physics mark" on the front. Eugene was there, as were Elijah and Autumn. I had the Intro Calc book without the cover. Autumn wanted to look so I sat next to her. I was also eating cereal and had my laptop. I was listening to Shake the Disease. Autumn said she loved Queen, and I said I didn't have much Queen stuff on my laptop and that I had all the albums on my computer but it died. This book had stuff about the sun and the core. There were pictures of the sun in the middle of the Earth at night and day.
