I needed money and sought to regain money which someone owed me. I went to the man's house with my parents. I got the impression of luxury. The man was there with his wife. He was in his middle ages and a small man. He explained that he had a special cleansing or sterilizing bath for his guests (for his and our protection I thought). When I asked about the money he was willing to lend it to me (about $1,500) for a couple of months at 50% interest. I felt very outraged or rather unbelieving. I wanted the money to finance a play which I felt had the makings of a drama or a musical.
