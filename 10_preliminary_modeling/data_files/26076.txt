 I'm in the Brimson recycling room, which is different. It is smaller: a tiny basement-like area. There are stairs running down to it. There is a kit there for a "very effective snow-removing machine". Many recycling employees are gathering in their crews. I talk to a first-year student named Mary, who has short, dark hair. She may be a lead worker. She is bossy and assertive. She doesn't really know that I'm the head of the recycling organization. I don't let on that I have any authority, I just relax and stand around. Jim Suds and Mark Samson are there. My friend Nat Miller is there. He has $6.00 and gives me four quarters. It's about time to go so I whistle and shout and in a moment people are filing up the stairs on their way to work. I feel like I may be abusing my power, but I get no hassle from anyone. Everyone just goes to work compliantly.
