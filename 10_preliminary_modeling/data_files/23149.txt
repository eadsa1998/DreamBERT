I was giving my first class of the semester.  It was a very large class.  When time ran out, everyone got up and started handing in bluebooks in which they had apparently done some in-class writing.  I realized that I had failed to ask for them, or to give them an assignment.  In the midst of their leaving and another class entering the classroom, I shouted that they should turn in their bluebooks, and I frantically looked for the syllabus to see what the assignment was.  I remembered that there was an article to read about Education in the Soviet Union, and something about reading "the campus poster."  I thought the former was outdated, and the incoming teacher said they were to read the latter, so I shouted that they should also read "the campus poster," although I had no idea what that was and realized that I would have to find out myself before the next class.  In the midst of all this confusion, my students were laying their bluebooks on a low wall at the front of the classroom, and some of them were sliding off.  I felt very unprofessional and was filled with anxiety. Later, I was in a faculty office.  Mary Kodd was there preparing something.  I thought she was going to be there only a short time, but it seemed she stayed several hours.
