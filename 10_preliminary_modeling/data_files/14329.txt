I was in a shop. I had instructions from some bad guy to go to some shop, but I can't remember what it was called. I was on the phone to the person as I tried to find it. I found it and went in. It had wedding dresses on both sides of the shop, therefore obscuring the view from other shoppers outside the shop. I was told to knock out the person working there, so I kept hitting him over and over but he just got a bit groggy. Then I had to find some 'creature in the dark corner' and I found it and it was a white cat like thing. I don't know what it did, but then I heard police sirens. I used the back door of the shop to leave, which took me outside. The cops were already in the carpark and I had a thing to change my appearance and so I changed into a fat lady. They asked me some questions and then left me alone. I had taken my shoes off in the store and so sat down to put them on. I turned back to normal and then I ran from them. I had a gun and the bad guy told me to shoot the cops, so I shot two of them and then more came and I'd run out of bullets. I got close to a cop and pulled something off the gun, so he couldn't shoot. I got away from them. Then 'I' was a creepy guy with a moustache. He was staying at a "halfway house". People there thought he was dodgy. He had this huge room and never interacted with anybody. This little old man was starting to get suspicious and so the creepy guy invited him over. I thought he was going to kill him, but he was just trying to look friendly so they left him alone. The lady who worked there was also starting to get suspicious.
