I remember being on a familiar beach. I'm looking out over the ocean. I turn to see a huge wave crashing 200 yards or so from shore. 'Holy Shit!', I say to the person I'm with. We are wearing regular clothes - no bathing suits. We had just gotten there and were checking out the beach. Another wave comes soon after - even bigger. The water from the first wave spills up on shore all the way to us at the top of the beach. Everyone's stuff is wet and they are scurrying around trying to collect their stuff. We run quickly towards the building. I yell to my brother, "The waves are much bigger this year." "No they're not", he says. Just as he finished, the spill of the second wave comes from behind and we're up to our waists in water. My clothes are all wet. I wade towards the building.
