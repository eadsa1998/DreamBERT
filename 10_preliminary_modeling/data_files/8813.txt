I had gone into the office hoping to clear out all of my personal things, while no one was there. Bill C showed up and was surprised to see me. I told him why I was there, that I had just hoped to clear out my things while no one was there. He said that was fine, yet he seemed suspicious. As I was trying to clear out my things, we got into a debate, if you will. I was trying not to say anything mean or hurtful to him or about him or about Bryan N. But that was very difficult because of the things that he was saying to me. I wanted to tell him that I knew more than he realized about the whole situation. I wanted to tell him that he really didn't know much about what Bryan N was actually doing. Or how Brian F has been manipulating him, or using him or the things Bryan N has been saying behind his back. I just felt myself getting more and more upset and I wanted to get out of there. Ben D came in and was helping to clear out my desk while I was having this discussion with Bill C. Occasionally I would stop and tell him where some of my things were so he could put them into boxes. I told him that everything in the top right and left hand drawers belong to me. I think at one point I realized that he had completely emptied one drawer where everything didn't belong to me, but at what point I was so upset that I didn't care. So I just let it go. I wasn't feeling well and Ben D knew this so he was rushing trying to help me get out of there as quickly as possible.
