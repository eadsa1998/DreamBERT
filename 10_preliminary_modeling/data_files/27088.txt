I was shopping with my friend (male--age 23). We were standing in front of a store. He was giving me some money so I could go in a grocery store to buy a few things (can't recall what). He remarked that we should both try not to spend so much of his money I was rather surprised. I went into the store but could not bring myself to spend any of his money. So I went out of the store. In order to reach the sidewalk I had to walk through a field of weeds and high grass. When I reached the walk I saw that the parking meter for the space we had parked in was not registering. I put a penny in the meter and started to walk home having decided not to wait for my friend.
