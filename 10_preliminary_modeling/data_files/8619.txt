I was working on a document on the computer. I was trying to pull together a lot of information into one document and add to it in a way that would accomplish what we wanted to accomplish in an easy to understand way. I was working with someone but I don't know who it was, and I have a sense that it was more than one person. I don't think the work was CAS related. I was also using highlighting in the document on the pieces of information that I was adding. The statements that I was adding including both a number and a percentage relative to what we were talking about. I had entered several and before I realized that it wasn't quite accurate or that it was misleading. I changed it and thought it was better but I still wasn't happy with it.
