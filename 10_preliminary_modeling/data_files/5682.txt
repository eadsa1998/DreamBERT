[1997-06-29] This is one that has reoccurred several times over the years, along these lines. Back, right after I graduated from high school I worked for five years for a group of radiologists, I was a dark room technician and I was back there working, in my dream. The office appeared exactly the way it was, structurally, but who was there but the executive director of the state agency for the blind. And his purpose for being there was to tell me that my job was terminated. I didn't know if I should just gather up my things and leave then or if I was expected to finish up the day.
