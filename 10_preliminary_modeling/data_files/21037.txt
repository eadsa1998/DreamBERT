Brother Steve was in bed. I looked at him and thought to myself, he will get soldier bonus because he was in the World War II. I looked at Bill Grove's machine and there was oil running on the floor. I yelled at him, then I noticed from one of my machines there was oil also running on the floor. I kicked sawdust on the oil.
