I had the sense that I was in another state, maybe Colorado. It also felt like I was in another state of mind. I was standing on a corner waiting for a ride. Joel (an ex-boyfriend) turned the corner in his blue VW bus. I had the sense that I hadn't seen him in years yet I knew he'd be coming for me. But he was really surprised to see me. He was on his way somewhere else. I wasn't the reason he was there. We went to the same house. The band was there. It was like a hotel or a party. Lots of people. Joel disappeared.
