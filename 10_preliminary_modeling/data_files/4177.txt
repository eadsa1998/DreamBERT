["The criminal man runs and hides."] A criminal man is escaping something. He runs. I follow (disembodied) and watch. He finds a pickup truck someone is going to put down a canvas tarp on the back. He offers to help them, hoping to hide under the tarp as they leave. They agree he can help. He is tying down the right back corner. His ornate watch band gets caught up and starts to fall apart. He tries to untangle himself. But the watch band breaks. He abandons it and lies down under the tarp. The people seem to not notice. They drive away. He will be safe.
