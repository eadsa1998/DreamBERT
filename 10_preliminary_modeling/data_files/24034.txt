I dreamed that I went down into the town with my friend and I saw a big mob of people over by this "mercantile." Women were screaming and fainting. There was a huge black limo with red carpets and many guards. I walked over there to see what was going on, but I still don't know what happened to my friend. She sort of just disappeared. So when I got there it was "Brad Pitt." That's what the mob was about. He looked at me, and told the people to move away because he had to come ask me what my name was, and I couldn't talk. He was very nice to me. Then I woke up.
