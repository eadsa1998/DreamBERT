I am standing in a small group of 4 people. I am explaining why a young man is having problems. It's because his mom has cancer. As I am breathing, I'd hear a snoring pig snort sound. I am embarrassed and try to clear my nose so it will stop. I keep apologizing. I am going to go home early. I look for my boot slippers to put on so I can walk home.
