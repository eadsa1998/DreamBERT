I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people. Everyone seemed very excited and were all talking rapidly among each other. I was apparently surprised to see some of the people there. A man was there by the door, but he didn't say anything and didn't stay very long. I recognized many of the people as close relatives to me and my family.
