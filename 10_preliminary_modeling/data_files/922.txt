I am in Ireland at a school. We are lined up like in a fire drill. There are huge war ships going down the river. They are so big that an inner tube falls off on the back of the river and it is almost as wide as the river. I am exclaiming about how big it is and how can anyone hang on to it! We are supposed to stay indoors but I keep sneaking out. Veronica (a co-worker) asks me to come see a ship her grandmother was on. It is a large tea cup. Basically, I am on my way back to an American trip. I am being kidnapped to India. They talk me into coming into the cabin and resting for awhile. I look out the window and see the land going up and down. After I wake up from my rest, we are at sea. There is unrest (war) in India. I see huge guns. I'm being manipulated by "grandma" to get ready to have lunch with the captain. I know that and I keep stalling for time. I put my lipstick on and it smears; I do it again and it smears. She and her husband wink at me (he knows my game and isn't mad). He takes the lipstick and draws silver, fake symbols on a sign. I am delighted because it looks like a code. It will keep everybody busy trying to figure it out. The grandma then looks at me angrily and asks if I've hidden something. I smile at her and say, "Oh, yes. I did that." She just seethes. I enjoy being obstinate and non-helpful. Then the captain comes in. I make excuses for being late and falsely apologize. He seems to know I'm stalling and is challenged by me. He smiles.
