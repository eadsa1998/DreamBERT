I was skiing with my friend Chloe's older brother, and we were going to meet her at the bottom of the mountain to leave. We decided we just had to go up one more lift to ski down. When we got to the top he wanted to eat, but I didn't want to be late meeting my friend. I got mad and he stayed to eat, and I went down the hill. Setting: At a ski resort. Characters: My friend Chloe, who takes me skiing, and her brother who I don't really like (I think Chloe and I got separated and I ended up with him). Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, frustrated.
