I'm waiting to be picked up to go somewhere far away with Jimmy and I'm not sure what music to listen to -- after a while I pick Tori Amos. I pack and get all ready to go. Remembering my experience last time of not having anything to read, I load up my backpack not just with notebooks but with about 20 books, mostly 3 big shiny books by Bernard Shaw. I get into the van with Kelly and her new trucker boyfriend who wonders why I read so much. Then we're taking a bit of a break before leaving and I'm crossing this huge, rickety, wooden footbridge over the river at night. It's raining pretty hard and everything's wet and glistening. Halfway along I notice all kinds of loose change scattered across the bridge, so I go about picking it all up, especially the pennies, because "I'll need all the luck I can get." I find one really huge penny -- it's about a foot in diameter. This one's really lucky. As I'm kneeling to pick up all the change, a man comes along with his two kids. I don't want to look suspicious, so I open the cabinet in the side of the bridge and pull out two cans of Coke. He shines a flashlight on me, then goes away with his kids.
