We have an incredible BIRTHDAY PARTY: it is catered with a huge cake, but I can't find enough paper plates and spoons to serve it. Finally I find small wooden spoons with a design on them, but by then most people have left. I see that Wendy has left some of her things behind, and I put them all in a big blue plastic bag, even her radio.
