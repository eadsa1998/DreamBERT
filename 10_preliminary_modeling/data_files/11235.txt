I was climbing around a building that was being constructed. There were no stairways, so I climbed up the steel girders. After I got up there to the top, I looked down and couldn't see the ground because of the maze of girders below me. I stood there with my feet on separate beams and wondered how I was going to get down. After a while, a foreman came up and said that if I didn't have anything to do I could go to work. He took me into a small room and gave me a sheaf of papers and told me to start checking off items.
