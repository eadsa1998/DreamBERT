H and I are talking. Merle has moved and is back visiting. He comes by. I am teaching something or examining something for work. It's time to quit work and go home. Merle joins us. He is talking. He is standing up and is very, very skinny, almost as thin as a pencil. He says to someone, "My wife and I..." and I turn and look at Hasani, wondering why she hadn't told me Merle was married now. Hasani looks like, "I was sworn to secrecy." I go over to talk to Merle. He says, "It was a marriage of convenience. It isn't really working out." He still likes me very much. He then hands me five blouses on a hangers and an old pair of printed pants of his. He tells me that this man wants me to put them on. I am to choose which blouse to wear. I pick one. Merle says, "The man says not that one. You can't wear it ever. It's just to be in the closet." I am a bit annoyed and choose to comply now, knowing that I will rebel later at his orders. He thinks he possesses me, but I don't agree. He's sort of like the crazy man in a previous dream. I put on the pants. It's like clown pants. They are so overly large for me. I cinch in the yellow belt farther and farther, until I feel quite slim in comparison to the pants. This pleases the man, who is watching.
