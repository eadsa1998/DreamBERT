This is only a snatch of a dream. I was walking down S--- Avenue at dusk when a colored man jumped out of a doorway and pulled me back into the shadows of a dime store's entrance. He began to molest me while I fought wildly and called to the passers-by for help. The people walking past were people I knew, but I cannot identify them. They looked at me as if nothing was happening, waved and smiled, and walked on.
