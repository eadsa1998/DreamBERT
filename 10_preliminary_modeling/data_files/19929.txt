I walked through a yard to a street. I squatted down. A stout lady came, and noticing that I wore a dress with men's trousers underneath, looked at me contemptuously and asked me why I was dressed that way. I was surprised because I had not realized that I was still wearing the dress. I took it off. I was thinking that it was fortunate that I took it off before I came near my house where people knew me. I passed some stores and I stopped in one to put the dress away.
