We had a party and we invited Rose Lasko. She didn't show up. I walked by the window and looked out and was surprised to see Rose across the lot sitting beside the window looking at me. I didn't know that her house was there. Ann was sitting near the window. I told her to look and she would see Rose. Later she said she saw her. I said, "You moved your head slowly just around the corner of the window, so one eye came in contact with Rose's window and you saw her." She smiled. I looked again and I saw Rose and two of her lady friends in her home. I told Ann she must have a party of her own. That's the reason she didn't come to ours. I was working at Dill's pulling the barrels into some other assembly parts, which some of the barrels were oversize.
