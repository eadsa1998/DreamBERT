I'm in a strange restaurant on some tall building and it's raining outside. I'm with a lot of people who I know, but now I don't think I did know them. I have to use the bathroom, so I leave the table and walk through the kitchen up some stairs and am faced with a bunch of doors. I open the one in front of me and now I'm in some strange girl's apartment. She's in a towel and very embarrassed and tells me to get out. Before I know it, I'm outside of her room and faced with the doors again. This time I choose a different one and now I'm in a long hallway. On the walls are posters on naked chicks and I can hear people having sex. It's so loud that I'm sprinting down the hallway. I never reached the end, but I turn to the right, open a door and the noises in my head stop. I suddenly remember that I have to go to the bathroom and as I enter this new room, I see arcade machines, basketball hoops, and skee ball. It looks like the Boardwalk Super Arcade and, sure enough, as I move deeper inside, I see that weird game with the fake rifles that you can shoot stuff with and it'll do something. I ask the guy if he can tell me where the bathroom is and I don't remember what he says. I suddenly get a really weird feeling like, "I need to get out of here!" I turn to run, but I trip. I start spinning and I wake up.
