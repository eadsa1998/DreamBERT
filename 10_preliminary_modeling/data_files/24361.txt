I'm riding on public transportation. I don't have a place to stay. I ride the train all the way down to the ferry. I need to shower. There is a shower on the public transport, but no light. I try to use it while moving, but it's hard. I want to watch the news and get something to drink. I walk around in a place that reminds me of Spain or somewhere out in a suburb of the city and I find a bodega with chairs on the sidewalk.
