 I'm with my brother Wally in my dad's car driving to my dad's house. It's a different house. It's dark and Wally is driving down the alley. There is snow and snow banks on the ground. Wally starts turning the car around in weird directions. I ask him what he's doing, but then he pulls into the driveway perfectly. We get out of the car. It's daytime and there is no snow on the ground: it's summer. I walk from the driveway onto the grass. Wally warns me to not walk there, but I do anyway. I fall through the grass, which is actually a thin covering for my dad and Lisa's underground greenhouse-type area. My dad and Wally also fall through. They yell and scream at me in their characteristic ways, saying they warned me and that it's my fault. This is true: I didn't heed the warning. The greenhouse is about four feet deep, and there are wooden 2x4's supporting the grass above in various places. The spot that we fell through is a portion of this area. There is an old dirty window with a lot of yellow jacket bees swarming and crawling on it. There are some broken boards from where we fell, and I try to fix them. We can't really stand up because we'd break the grass "roof" again. Lisa comes out of the house. I think she is mixing cookie dough. She is mad, but of course, doesn't really show her anger.
