My friend Clarence is in a jeep with Linda, and he tells me they have just been pregnant. I am surprised, delighted and I ask to see the kids. I go to the back of the jeep and there on the metal floor are two bundles with two girls -- twins! I croon and sigh over them, but then I notice that they have huge bulging blue eyes and stiff faces and they are really plastic dolls, but spooky looking. I don't tell Clarence and Linda this, instead I just act happy for them, but I wonder what is going on. Don't they know they are not real? The setting seems outdoors, in a town I lived in once.
