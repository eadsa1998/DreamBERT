My daughter Carla's father had come by to visit her and decided that he wanted to take her overnight. I said that was fine. They asked if little Cindy could go too. I called Zack and asked him to please come visit us, and he said yes. I then told Carla and her dad that I was sorry, but Cindy couldn't go because her father is coming to see her.
