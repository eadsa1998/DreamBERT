[1997-06-02] People were playing these musical instruments at a big, ballfield, sounded like an autoharp or a musicbox. I wanted to learn how to play an instrument too, it sounded all in unison and really pretty, so somehow I got one, somebody got me one and somehow I was going to learn on my own how to do it so I could be part of the group too and make the pretty music that they all made. Somehow it didn't sound very hard. There was a master of ceremonies that directed the group.
