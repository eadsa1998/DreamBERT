I was in a choir class preparing to do The King and I.  Someone asked me whom I wanted to play.  I mumbled, "one of the leads" but I knew I didn't have the talent or courage, and walked away somewhat dejected.  Someone made a change and I was given the next biggest role, the 'zookeeper'.  We did some rehearsing.  The director was a tall man reminiscent of my Tuvan instructor Jim Hale.  He took off a helmet he was wearing, and somehow then hit his head.  Then we were practicing some yoga in preparation for the play.  There were three people demonstrating the positions.  The one in front of me was an Asian guy.  I was wearing my blue sweat pants from high school PE.  I managed the moves surprisingly well.
