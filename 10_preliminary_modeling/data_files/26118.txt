 An abrupt change occurs. Something or someone goes in, a big change happens, and that thing or person then goes out of whatever it went in to earlier. This is a major change. It seems to be all cluttered and jumbled. It is a decisive change that happens all at once: hard and fast. I think I kind of like the change. (I forgot the specifics of this dream.)
