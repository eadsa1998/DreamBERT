There has been a social D. (another table mate) informs me he is to marry mother. I am much amused and tell Q. that D. is going to be my Pa. Ask what arrangements are desired, doesn't he wish guests etc. Think that dishes must be cleared from table. Want to know if wedding will be on hotel lanai or in our own rooms. Suddenly John (another brother) and his family D's appear for the event. See R. coming and count her five children. Greet Eliz looking small and rather thin. (Eliz. one of R's daughters.)
