Charla drives a little car/boat up out of the water and onto the cement stairs on land. She was going so fast she couldn't stop. Now I'm seated on a toilet seat and peeing and no matter how hard I try to not let it leak out and get on the floor it goes down my leg and all over the floor. My father and my mother and an Aunt are in the tiny bathroom with me and my father is trying to fix the molding around the edge of the room and this yellow urine puddle is building. I am so embarrassed. I say, "I'm sorry. No matter how hard I try to keep it in the toilet, it leaks out." They help clean it up and try to make light of it. "I'm not even sitting on my raised toilet seat," I say, "and there is no reason why this is coming out." I guess I waited too long before I went and had too much to release. It was an unstoppable flow.
