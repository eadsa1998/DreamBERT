I am a maid of honor at a wedding. The colors are black and white. A black curvaceous 1950's dress and long white veil. I walk up the aisle and notice the groom isn't there. He then enters from a side door. Part of the ceremony is for the groom to describe the future. He's a little embarrassed. He takes his ribbons and artfully waves them around and tells how they will be married for a number of years and then he'll fall in love with another woman and leave. He shrugs his shoulders and looks sheepish. He asks her if she's willing to continue, knowing that. She says yes. The bouquets are black flowers and ribbons. The next step of the ceremony is for everyone to light a small candle and, while singing, put their flame into the common or larger flame of the bride. I light my candle and follow the bride, singing, realizing with embarrassment that the song is "Rashneeshee" and my parents are probably shocked. I like the symbolism of all our little lights coming together in one large light. I drip my candle wax in the bowl. She smiles and points out it made a crooked pattern. [BL]
