The clock said 10 of 12 when Miss W. called to remind me that I had a guest coming to lunch. I replied that I just had to fasten my garters and I would be ready. I was upstairs and went down to my room. No one was there, so I looked elsewhere, then returned and there were Mrs. C. and Mrs. Ed. In cleaning my room, the maid had pulled down my garment bags and tossed them in a pile on my bed. My dresses would be mussed. The bell rang and I started to lead my guest to the dining room. I told Mrs. Ed. I had not invited her and she went away. In the dining room, others had started to eat. No place was set for four and Miss Mc had pushed into the center of the vacant space. I got chairs for us and she moved over. Then I went to the drawer and got silver. We sat down and I introduced Mrs. C. and Mrs. Chal. but the others kept telling their names before I could.
