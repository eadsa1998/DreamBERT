I dreamt of visiting my old violin teacher and her husband.  They were living in a dark house.  Their daughter was about 11, they had a boy a few years younger, toddler twins, a baby, and she was pregnant again.  We went for a walk.  I noted the niceness of the neighborhood- large property, quiet.  We went up a ways on a hillside, not far enough, but there was snow.  My..brother?  Son?  was going to teach their son how to sled.  He said go ahead, soap the roads, he was going to use the snow.  They went down far.
