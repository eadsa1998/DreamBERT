Something about green grass and breast cancer research being done on men. Then my niece comes to my mother-in- laws with her newest baby sister. She has one other one. The baby is crying because her father forgot to show up to take her to a father/daughter tea. The baby has a strange name like "so something." My mother-in-law and I and some other women agree all men are the same. These things just don't mean anything to them.
