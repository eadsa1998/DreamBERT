The first dream I remember, my husband and I had moved to some large city in a nearby state. And this was, he had graduated and had his doctor's degree and we were going to live there. And it was a very big city and we were living sort of in the center of it, not out from it at all. And apparently we didn't have a car, because we had to go anywhere we wanted to go on these buses. And this was a pretty expensive way to go anywhere, and we didn't really know how to get from one place to another in the city. And we didn't know anybody in the city. But I had gone down to the bus stop to wait with my husband til he had caught his bus and started on his way to his office. And then I walked back to the apartment we had, and this was in a big Southern house, and it was very Southern in style and furnished in this sort of old-fashioned furniture. It was sort of a gloomy place. It had these big rooms and real high ceilings, and small windows. And I didn't know anybody there, and this old man and this woman about in her 40's came in, just came in my house from the porch where I guess they'd been sitting out there rocking or something. They came in and sat down in my living room. And it was a sort of friendly thing to do, but it was sort of unfriendly too because they sort of ignored me. And so I sort of ignored them, and wondered if they wanted to speak to me. And finally the woman asked me if she could help me with anything, and she started watering my potted plants, which I seemed to have several of. And one of these was, had been, a cactus at one time or another, but it sort of dried up. I had this real lonely feeling in it, to be in this new place and not knowing anybody.
