I eat dinner with a woman from the Counseling Center where we work. They are quite conservative and she is very concerned that her son understand her instructions. She ties a silver cord to each card she wrote. She drives me home, rather recklessly; finally arrive home and see WALLY and our friend John. I call to Wally: "John is here; come join us."
