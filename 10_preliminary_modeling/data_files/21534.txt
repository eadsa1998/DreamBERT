I was going to work and Ann and Carter walked to the station with me, then Ann and Carter walked to the train stop and I waited to get a ride to work with a lady driver. I walked off with Carter and I thought I was late for my driver. I looked for my lunch, then left. I came into our back yard and someone piled apples in the corner of the fence, one on top of another up about 2 ft. high. I took them down. There was a dog or some other animal that some people had for a pet. I was afraid of it, but later I let it come up to me and I petted it and it was friendly. This family had a dumb son and two small children died suddenly, and then the mother and then the father almost got it, but found in time it was murder for the dumb son. I was playing cards and here seemed to be clubs hat I was getting. I was climbing up the side of a barn, then I crawled thru a small hole. I came back out and went down. There was a pig and some other animal that was ferocious and they climbed up the side of the barn, but there was a post or ladder against the barn. When the pig went away, I took off the lower part of the ladder just so I could reach it. I saw two of my friends running and the pigs were chasing them. I ran to the barn and climbed up the side of the ladder. I reached the top, moved a little coal on the side of the hole, and I was going to crawl thru. I looked down and the thing with the pig was trying to climb up the side of the barn, but couldn't. I was under a low bridge in the water with Robert Pokish. He swam out thru the water and I waited. There was a train coming over, so I waited.
