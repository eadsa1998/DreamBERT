In Amsterdam on our way to the hotel. My wife and I, with a lot of suitcases, get lost in the cellars and end up near the slums. We go back to the travel agent. He is the stocky detective in the movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit. He decides he will help us because it is dangerous. My best friend and I go back to get the luggage through the cellars. In the end we got back and were in the erotic night life district in Paris. Someone says, "Here you know what you get. You go after what you desire. And it is not as dangerous as getting lost in the cellars."
