David Hardy was in grandstand in upper tier. The stands were nowhere near full. David said he disliked to sit down in a crowd -- that he was solitary by nature -- and in support of this he said he was not, even now, widely acquainted in the town where he was practicing (medicine). Grandstand was wooden -- upper tier partly open at back. These events seemed to take place in some unfamiliar town which I was briefly visiting on a trip. Hadn't brought enough clothes -- especially shirts and B.V.D.s and decided I would have to buy some new ones. I was to stop off one day; on my homeward journey, at some other town. Mary, Faye, etc. had left me, and I asked David and a young fellow who was now with him (perhaps Ernest Ford) whether the others of my party hadn't set some place (at Union Station) for us all to meet, but David said no, that I was merely to meet them. I felt annoyed, as the town was a rather large one, and many people were on the streets. However, I went to station. In waiting room I heard a train approaching, and I stepped toward window to watch it, but my view was partially cut off by the head and shoulders of another man who had gone to this window ahead of me. The train was moving toward my right and consisted of 3 wooden passenger coaches drawn by a small and old fashioned engine having a tall stack and a square headlight. It entered the station on about same track as did Faye's train ("City of Denver") when I met it in Nearby City to my hometown. The coaches were marked "Wisconsin Midland." Shortly thereafter, as I stood on the platform outside the station building another train approached, this time from opposite direction. It was a long freight train made up chiefly if not entirely of cars of livestock, drawn by a gigantic Mallett engine having 6 drivers (2 sets of 3) on each side. The train was moving about 15 mph and did not stop. A big cloud of dense, black smoke came from the engine's stack and extended far back along the train.
