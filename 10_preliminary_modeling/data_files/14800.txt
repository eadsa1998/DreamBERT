Dad, some random and I went to Vietnam. We were talking about something that cost $600 but years ago it was really expensive. He said he wanted to go to Bali because it cost only $3 a night and that there were lots of girls. I said "but they're Asian" and he said he didn't care. Then Dad, Ezra, Mom and I were walking along some train tracks/ride to go to Bali. It went across the water too. There were tracks on an angle and a train was coming and it was hard to stay balanced outside the track. They jumped off at one point and frolicked up some stairs (outside). I stayed on the tracks and it moved now. It took me into this shop and there was a door that said led to the 'cat haven' and it said it was unsafe. This 40-odd chubby-ish Asian lady said something and opened the door to some cats and dogs. She said the shop had food from all countries. I asked if they had gnocchi and it was in a fridge. She had lost a daughter. I went to a checkout and this girl at the end had blonde hair and was quite pretty. They lost something and were taking a long time to add everything up. Then the lady was like 'look who I've got! Phil Tony!'. I recognized him from some lifestyle show and he was there to help them find what they had lost.
