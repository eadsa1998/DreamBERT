A young woman and her husband and baby live out in the woods. They all sleep together in a sleeping bag under the trees. Now they've built a house. It has no furniture. It is only one room. I look inside and my voice is like a narrator on a TV show pointing out the features: a solid floor that has insulation underneath, a piece of green-yellow carpet on one half of the floor. The walls are handcrafted stained glass windows to shine beautiful colors with the sunlight. I try to make them look more beautiful. A roof to keep off the cold winter rain. The side wall opposite me opens up so that I see a porch with people on it, and a lovely view of the meadow and the river. People are swimming in the river. I have to sit up tall to see them over the rocks.
