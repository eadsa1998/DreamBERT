I was at the convenience store. A man and his son ran it. There was a front door and a back door, and large groups of children filed through. There were about a dozen of them. They were scared. Their faces were dirty. They had no shoes or shirts. On the huge video screen came a thunderstorm WARNING. Strong winds blew the children. There was big lightning and thunder, and the children had 2 daddies. Their fathers thought they knew how ??? We got them a place and ???. Dora was helping me with the last numbers (fingering) of the Debussy piece when I realized (that)I had forgot(ten) the negatives to enlarge so I could not print. ??? Lisa was working for Mr. Burns and he had brought me a huge plant. The plant was dead and needed watering. Lisa had to photograph veggie burgers for an advertisement.
