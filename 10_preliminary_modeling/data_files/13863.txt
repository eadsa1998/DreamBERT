We had gone to this place for an excursion before and it had been built in the early 2000's. It was in the middle of being built and it was underwater (not of all it). The first time we went there we were lining up and in another queue were celebrities, I remember seeing Adam Baldwin and Matt Damon and Tom Welling was in a car. The second time we went, I didn't notice anyone I knew. Mr Billings got some of us to go down to these seats. Elijah, someone else and I went and sat down. Darius made a stupid pose. Calvin and I were then sitting somewhere. Later when we went back, Tiana and some others were sitting in front. Some chocolate fell and they were going to steal it, but I got it back. There was another seating section and Eugene was sitting there, but if I sat near him it was too obvious why I was sitting there. Rodney came and sat near us at the front. There was something about Big Brother and Adam Sandler went in and he had no shirt on and was dancing and singing.
