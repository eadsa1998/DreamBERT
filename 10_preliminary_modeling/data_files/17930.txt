Memory is patchy.  I was either on delivery or got a job working an office.  There was a woman there and two desks.  It was dim and grey.  I was trying to do something helpful but the woman told me not to.  It was late, after 7.  She told me either to wait until tomorrow or that it was to be done at the other location.  I might have parked in a bad spot.  Then I remember something about black cows, and being somewhere with my parents at a place with large window that open at the top, like a classroom.
