I woke up and heard Mom complaining to someone about a guy who was coming over. He was a drug dealer and preferred sexual favours over money and also gave better drugs for them. He came over with his wife and kids. I went out and he flirted with me. He was really dodgy. Mom went out and it was just me and him alone and he raped me, but I didn't mind. His wife and sister had a ranch up north and wanted us to go there for some reason. We went up and it was the day of the storm [there's supposed to be a storm today]. Mom said we should stay up there to be safe. There was a llama that liked me and kept nuzzling me and putting its paws on me. It ended up curling up on my lap. I didn't have a car so borrowed a horse to ride back (sometimes it was the llama), but didn't tell anyone. I was nearly home and stole a car. I got back home and grabbed some stuff and then drove to this block of flats where I lived? I thought we'd be safer at home but it was too windy outside. There was a grey cloud coming from the south. Cars were getting blown into each other. There was a girl and a llama in one of them and I helped them get out.
