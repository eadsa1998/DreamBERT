I went into a restroom. There were men and women in there. A new ruling had been made allowing both men and women to use it. A woman who resembled the one who fainted in a recent dream tried to urinate in one of the men's urinals. I told her she would be better off using one of the commodes in the rear. I walked with her. I was attracted to her. A little later an experiment was taking place. The woman with whom I had spoken was told to be seated on a chair with a hole in the center of the seat. As she defecated, the feces was taken away and used for making children. The feces was round, light brown in the center, and the outer part was dark brown.
