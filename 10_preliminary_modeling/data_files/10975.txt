I was in the dormitory I lived in as a freshman in college. I was with two young men whom I knew. We were playing cards when we heard a lot of commotion in the halls. Then we heard police sirens in the distance. For no apparent reason we ran to escape the police. As we were making our way to the back fire escape, we heard someone say that there were three dead people in the ironing room. We stayed on the fire escape until the police left and then went in to look at these dead people. What I saw was not well defined. It just looked like a bunch of old dirty rags scattered about in heaps in the room. I was fully expecting to be horrified and felt much relieved when I could see nothing that resembled dead people. These young men were about the same age as I.
