I was at university in math. Ms Hayward was my teacher and she decided to make the rest of the course English and writing and drawing skills. We had to write paragraphs on how we felt about things. Then she drew a picture on the board and we had to guess who it was and draw it ourselves. The person had blonde hair and a green jumper but it was this Arab guy in the class called Peter. Later, I was at Nana's. Ezra had been there for like two weeks and hadn't showered at all. He was wearing a big blue shirt and there were patches of sweat and cockroach babies were flying around him. Dad came up and I was going back with him now and Mom was going to pick Ezra up tomorrow. Nana had food for us.
