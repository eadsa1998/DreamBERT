I bought a new home and the walls seemed to be built out of line. I noticed the other homes were being rebuilt or repaired on account of the uneven walls. I got down close to the ground and took a good look at the foundation bricks. I sighted the walls from one end to another. I was standing on a pile where there was a little fire. Thee were rags on it also. Gramp was below. I threw down some paper for him to start a fire. We were like on a mountain top. I was trying to write a theme or poem in the cafeteria in white. Ann was lying on the pile sleeping like in a bed. I looked at the time in New York and it was 5:45 and my watch was 7:00 p.m. That was Big City time. I went to see Dr. Allen. I found him at a party. The nurse was boiling potatoes; then she made rice. Dr. Allen was eating some. Dr. Allen checked me, and he made a diagram of some organ.
