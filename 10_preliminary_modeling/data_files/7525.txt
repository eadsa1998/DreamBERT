I am greeting Mary after an absence. I had been looking for her, and when I find her, we run towards each other and embrace happily. There is a golden glow radiating from and surrounding Mary. She looks terrific as we greet each other, embrace and kiss. Prior to our meeting I am looking for Mary in a house which has very small rooms and doors. I go into a room which I had already entered before. But when I return to it again, I find a small wooden box with some sort of earrings/ trinket inside it. When I see this, I know it belongs to Mary and that she must be somewhere nearby and I will find her. I leave this room to continue my search for Mary. Yet again, I return to this room where, now, I find Mary. It is here that we embrace each other joyfully. I don't remember much else about that particular room. The houses are either located in Japan or are of Japanese style.
