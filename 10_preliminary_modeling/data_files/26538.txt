 I come to a stream where my friend Paul Jones is trout fishing. He gives me a rod and reel. I'm fishing with a white fly. The trout are all over the stream, and many bite at the fly. I'm using a fly rod. I set the hook on several fish but they easily spit the hook out. Some of these fish are large: two or three pounds! I land a small trout on the fly rod. We continue down the stream. I'm then using a spinning reel with a white fly. I catch another trout. We move with our flies as they float down the stream. There is a woman there. I think she wants to fish as well. There are three of us and only two rods. I don't want to give up my rod. The stream is the alley behind my home in Oak Valley. Down near my neighbors the Knife's house the stream turns into disconnected, muddy puddles that aren't good for fishing.
