An online friend of my boyfriend Jeremy's came to visit.  I we hadn't been expecting her, and were still in our pajamas.  We sat on the couch talking a bit.  She had tannish skin and I asked her about her ethnicity.  She mumbled something that started with an O, and when I still couldn't understand her the second time around, I simply assumed it was some type of Polynesian.  I went to a little kitchen with a small fridge off near where the bathroom should be and toasted half a bagel and half an English muffin, since I decided I wanted both.  Her parents came over, and it was like meeting in-laws: there was some great desire for things to go well.  At first they didn't, but in the end we had things straightened out and were exchanging gifts, and people were happy.
