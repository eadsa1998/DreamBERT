I am walking along a street with a male companion. I am carrying a leather bag, which is soft and with no backbone and I am explaining to my companion how my bag sags and buckles unless it is packed full. My companion has the usual type of stiffened or reinforced hand bag. We seem to be in a crowd of people and one of them overhears my remarks; and I suspect that he is sneering at me, though if so it is behind my back. Presently I cross the street to catch a street car.
