Dreamt on campus, mostly.  In the Volvo backing out of the driveway I got in the passenger seat.  Driver was an Indian boy.  The car tipped backward, then to the left, and he blamed it on me.  Later on we were in a room with others and he kept blowing milk bubbles that everyone seemed to want to stay away from.  We walked along some trails.  My mother was there, and I looked at her hair with pity, as some strands had seemed to disband into thick veils of web like thread lit by sunlight.  A sort of conflict went on regarding something I don't remember.  I was trying to catch up to the group, and so followed a sort of obstacle course.  Under boards, roll across on pencils, in the end I got stuck in a pyramidal sort of construction, suspended on the corners only by thin rods of pencil led.  There was an anxious tension as I was freed before the collapse of the heavy wooden planks.  After that I did some stretches- was able to stretch completely past my toes without any pain.  With the splits it was similar- I wanted to feel the stretch.  I could have gone past 180 degrees if there were some way of putting my legs in such a position.
