I dreamed that I had to write an essay in Spanish about the most embarrassing thing to ever happen to me. I remember saying to myself "Tengo que escribir un ensayo sobre un dia cuando soy..." But I couldn't remember the word for embarrassment. Then it hit me --verguenza! And I woke myself up muttering "verguenza" in real life. Weird.
