Jeanne Noel picked me up in her little foreign car.  We were at the top of a hill, and instead of following the street down the hill, she turned off and started down on the grass.  It was very steep, and I was alarmed.  I protested, and she stopped right away.  I was afraid she wouldn't be able to back up on such a steep slope, but she was.  When we got to her apartment, it was about 10 p.m.  I went with her to the door, but didn't assume I would be invited in, because she didn't say anything about it.  Nevertheless, I followed her inside.  Don't remember what ensued immediately, but eventually she asked if we could have a "one-hour honeymoon."  I said yes, and she lay down and removed her pants or skirt-not her panties or her top-and I began caressing her.  <p
