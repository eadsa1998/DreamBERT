A group of people are taking a walk. Mondale, my husband, is ahead of me. We are walking on a narrow rocky path next to a pond of water. Mondale slips and falls in. I manage to stay on the path. He gets out and falls in again. Then we all sit down on the path to listen to speeches. Mondale starts speaking. It's pretty boring. They ask me to speak. I point out I'm smarter and more interesting to listen to. Later, a comedy troupe does a bit where a woman kisses a woman. They all look for the crowd's reaction. Everyone laughs. One member of the troupe says, "See, they don't approve." I disagree. I think they like it.
