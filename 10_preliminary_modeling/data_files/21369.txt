We were talking over who was going to win the 7th race today. There was supposed to be Rufus the Red running with Flashy Ways, but Rufus is not running today. I gave my opinion. I said between pp 2 and 3, but I prefer 3. Flashy Ways to win. I was driving along and there was ice on the road and it was slippery. Charles C. stopped by our house in his cab. I went out and he had a small car. I got down on my knees and looked at it and said, "How can you ride in this? It is so small." I finally said I would ride it. I sat on it, had my feet stretched out in front of it and I asked Charles to start it. It started to go and all at once it was running in front of me down the street. I was going to chase it, but I noticed I just had my underwear on and so did Charley. I was buying a ticket for the 7th race and the man was writing it out. He wrote #6 on it. Then later I heard #6 lost.
