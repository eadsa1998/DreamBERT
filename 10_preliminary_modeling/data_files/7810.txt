I got in a small canoe and rode down a canal in a city. This time, just before I got to the waterfall-like place I stopped myself. I went to the canal three times. The second time I got in the canoe. The first time I saw a canoe with a cake in it that was shaped like a large cruise ship but it was the size of a normal cake. The second time I saw the owner of the cake and spoke with her. She began to destroy the cake so I began taking parts and eating. The second time I was passing boats of other people. The last two I passed the people were all asleep. Just as I stepped myself, I realized I should have wakened them to warn them they were approaching the fall. They woke up and started screaming. I had gone under several overpasses before I reached this point. The third time I was sitting in snow along the canal. I called BJ on the phone. They were excited thinking I had called to tell them I had a job. I can't remember now why I called but it wasn't that.
