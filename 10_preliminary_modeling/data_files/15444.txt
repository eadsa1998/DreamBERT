The sun was doing to die and then we were going to get a new, lesser one. It was happening today. We weren't really worried. Mom and Darren were with me and we were looking out the window to check every now and then. The last movie I watched was called 'Last Day on Earth'. Dad watched this new sci-fi show. There was a new one starting soon with Brad Pitt in it and I wondered what he was doing on TV. I looked outside and it was pitch black. We were like 'it's so weird, I didn't know what to expect'. We checked a few minutes later and I saw a ball of fire (the sun) and then nothing -- we died.
