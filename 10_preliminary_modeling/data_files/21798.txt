I was trying to find out if Bonjour won the Derby because I played him. I heard a voice or someone say, "Yes, we won. We sure did." He meant Bonjour. I was walking with Judy on Broadway Ave. I looked ahead and there was a big white bear on the sidewalk about 500 ft. ahead. I walked across a field to the next avenue to go around the bear. I was in a colored neighborhood. I was in a place. I saw some trinkets nailed on a wall, so I got a screwdriver and pried them loose and put them into my pocket. I was afraid I would be caught, but I walked out and no one bothered me. I felt it was wrong to steal that, but I just did it. I went outside and was waiting for a streetcar. Then I asked a colored boy when the cars would come by and he said, "Go in and ask the nurse." So I went in expecting all colored people. The nurse's face was plastered black with looked like soot. She said, "Hello, Mr. Evans." I was surprised and the face looked familiar. I couldn't place her. Now I'm awake and I know it was Mrs. Rose Ezenski. Judy and I were walking on the sidewalk and there were birds on the sidewalk ahead of us. She wanted to catch them, but when we got close, they flew away.
