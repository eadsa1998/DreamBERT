I was informed that I had been made emeritus professor so I must teach a class again. There were 5 or 6 young men and women. A red-haired lad joined us. Each was telling who they were. He was English born but came from Indiana. I told the class the text would be Hart's Sociology, but I couldn't remember the rest of the title. It was 4:45 and the class began to disperse although the time wasn't up. I went to the bookcase to hunt for a book needed as the text but couldn't find it.
