I was sitting in the front seat of my car, parked in the carport of our house.  There had been a party the night before, and apparently I had slept in the car, because I had on pajamas or a robe.  Malika Awadi came up and Louisa Spears came out of the door to the house at the same time.  Louisa said they were leaving.  Malika kind of hung around until Louisa had left, then she asked if she could talk to me about something.  I told her to get into the back seat of the car.  I said I would have to go in the house and get dressed first, and she asked me if she could borrow $1.75.  Some friend of mine was working on another car parked next to mine, along with another guy.  I asked my friend if he had $1.75 I could borrow and give to Malika, but he was just about to slide under the car, and said I would have to wait.  So I went ahead and went inside to change.  A lot of people had been staying there, and the house was not ours but someone else's.  I couldn't find my clothes, my wallet, etc.
