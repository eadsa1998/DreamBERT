Some director guy was walking down a street. There was a Festen St, and I was like "I love Festen!". He liked it too. There was a little rack of movies and he wanted Ichi the Killer. I went looking for it. There was a new Nintendo 64 and it was faster and would play all the old games. Dad was there and there was a bus.
