I was at 'Mom's' and her boyfriend or someone and I were in the car, but he parked the car at the washing/power line and I almost fell. Then I was inside and I had this The Young Ones book and it was big [like those Childcraft books] and it had a fake surf-y photo of them on the front. It also had sounds in the book and I loved it. I remember something strange happened, but I don't remember what it was. I also remember that in the dream, I had once tried reading the book, but got bored.
