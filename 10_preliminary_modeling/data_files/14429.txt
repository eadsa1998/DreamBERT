I'm not sure how it started, but I was with Buffy, Willow and Xander (all from Buffy the Vampire Slayer). We used Twitter to find out stuff about Sims 3. We did something and then decided to go on this roller coaster thing. I was next to Xander, and he said that we were "too close. If anyone asks if were dating, pretend we're not". I said ok and then laughed and then thought 'pretend...?' and I realized I liked him. There was a dark tunnel and trains and buses were passing by on the opposite side. Then I was outside during the day, at a cemetery looking place. There was a rat in the kitchen. This person said "we're boring rich people, not fun rich people". This inspector guy was asking about the rat.
