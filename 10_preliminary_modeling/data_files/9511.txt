About Marissa: [can't make out this name] - at her home; spend the day with the children. See a piano bench that is just like ours, only new and slightly different shape. Then she has a nose bleed or hurting in nose. I comfort her. - Then many people and a raffle. I win a Paris gown, + a bathing dress - excited. - Then children come. I see Frank walking by from RR. He gives them chocolate - children are happy.
