I was hitchhiking to Michigan with a friend of mine (19) somewhere in southwestern PA. When we were about halfway there we ran into a fellow (16) whom I know lives at our destination. He had bought the car which had at one time been owned by the fellow with whom I was hitchhiking. The car had been shipped to the farm in parts, but was not yet assembled. We tried to rent it for $25, but were unable to do so.
