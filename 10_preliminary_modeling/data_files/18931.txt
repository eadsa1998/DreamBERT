I was in this drugstore (more like a small general store with a lunch counter) and I walked through to the back of the store where I played a gambling device with Joe Hill (one of my classmates). We each choose a marker (black or white) and when the machine was turned on the markers would travel through a maze at the end of the maze was a straight stretch into a cup and the first marker into the cup won. The machine randomly changed the coefficient of friction of the markers so that one would slide faster than the others. The marker I chose was fastest through the maze, but lost right at the very end. Then the scene changed and I was with a mixed group of boys and girls. They were pairing off (boy with girl) and soon I was standing alone with Phyllis (a girl in my class) in a room which had four rooms opening into it (one from each side) and where each couple occupied one room. I looked around and Phyllis was the only one left and the one I least desired to sleep with. She was lying down on a bed with her arms outstretched to me. I took off my clothes and with a mental shrug of indifference lay down beside her. She embraced me and her body was warm and soft -- more pleasing than I had anticipated. Then I woke up.
