I dreamt I was sitting someplace eating a sandwich. It was cut in half and was of soft, fresh bread with crisp crust. First there were pickles, round and nobby; not very long and not sliced, but whole. Underneath was peanut butter, good and thick, real smooth. Underneath that was grapes cut in half. Usually  in a sandwich things blend, but this was very distinct. I could taste each thing separately, although they were all together.
