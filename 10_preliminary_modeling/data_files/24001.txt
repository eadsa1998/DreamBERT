The most recent dream I can remember happened like 6 or 7 years ago. I was sitting at the dinner table with my family and I heard something up in my brother's room. So I looked up (our old house was open, so you can see all the rooms) and saw Freddy Kruegar in my brother's doorway. I was really scared, so I got up and ran out the door. I got into my mom's Blazer, but I realized the back window was open. I was about to get out to shut it, but I heard a scream and shortly after, I saw Freddy run out. I jumped in the car (the window still not closed). I tried holding it shut, but that wasn't enough, Freddy grabbed the window, opened it, and put his leg in. I saw that on his feet were my brother's shoes. I knew then that my family was dead. He climbed in, raised his metal claws up in the air, and then I woke up.
