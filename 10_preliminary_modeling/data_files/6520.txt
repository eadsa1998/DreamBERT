I was getting a tattoo, or rather I wanted to, but for one thing it cost too much and for another thing all the sample designs were pretty unappealing, childish even. I mean, there was one design that looked exactly like a three-year old's drawing. But while I was in the parlor trying to leave, I struck up a conversation with a man who had a really impressive series of tattoos on his head. He had a shaved head (of course) and he had tattooed a celtic band all the way around the base of his skull. On the back of his head was an *amazing* rendering of Quetzalcoatl, and the rest of his head was covered with intertwining Aztec, Mayan, and Celtic designs, which worked together very well. He seemed to be interested in Mexico so I told him I was going there. He told me that when he went there, he had had a good time, but wherever he went people would just stare and stare and stare at him. He was genuinely puzzled as to why people would do this to him.
