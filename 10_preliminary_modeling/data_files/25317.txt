 I'm swimming in a pool in my back yard with my friend Melanie McDyss. We are diving underwater looking at things. We have one diving mask. I use it first but then give it to her. We continue to dive and we see some little black fish in the pool. We are both underwater, wearing very little clothing. We surface near each other, and are touching. I kiss her neck. A man at the party we are having asks me for a box. I find one but it has my uncle Rusty Redding's camp stove in it. I find another box and give it to him. Grandma Redding is there and I hug her. It is really good to see her.
