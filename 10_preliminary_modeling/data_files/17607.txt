I dreamt that my boyfriend Jeremy and I were going to go to Japan with his parents.  It was short notice, the tickets unsecured.  There were a lot of people from high school getting on the plane.  I said my name and we were seated.  The plane started taxiing.  I asked Jeremy what we were going to do- we had no clothes packed.  He said not to worry about it.  Then, looking back, my mother was driving the Volvo.  A stuffed Ernie (Sesame Street) was hanging from the rearview mirror.  My mother was trying to catch up so we could grab the bag she packed for me off the hood.  The plane slowed after I grabbed the bag and we were able to hug.  She said she'd go back and grab some pants- there was time.  She handed me what looked like a walnut in a Kleenex and I got back on the plane.  The pilot threw up.  We wouldn't go anywhere for a while.  I woke up before I could open the 'walnut' and see what my mother gave me.
