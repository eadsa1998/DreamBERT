 I am at Mason Cafeteria at Brimson, which is rearranged. I yell harshly at an older woman. She is a guest, and has gone through the line without a card. The lines for eating at the cafeteria are different. It is almost like a fast food line. I cut pizza with my wallet. The man I know from Brimson who thinks he knows how to bale cardboard yells at me for doing this. The orange juice is constantly running, and I watch the container go empty. I get ice in a glass, and then water. There is something special going on at the cafeteria. It may be a convention or a show at dinner. I sit with my friend Anne Gooner. I feel guilty for yelling at the woman.
