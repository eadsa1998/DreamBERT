I and someone else are working with some EMT's, but not as EMT's. We are on some kind of covert mission. They have me lie on my left side in the back of an ambulance between the side of the ambulance and the gurney, with my feet toward the front of the ambulance and my head at the back doors. The ambulance is parked inside a dark garage. I hear someone coming. I try to hide but there isn't enough room for me to fit all the way down between the wall and gurney. I'm sure if this man looks back there he'll see me and then I'll have to come up with some explanation. He opens the door and immediately sees me. Then he nods and has this look on his face like he knows who I am and why I am there. He gets in and we leave.
