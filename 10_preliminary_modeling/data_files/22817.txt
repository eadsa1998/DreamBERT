I'm in the office building of Mr. Montgomery of Montgomery Ward fame.  He is a friend of ours somehow.  He has a beautiful office building, and his office is on about the fifth or sixth floor.  There is a lounge in which are several people I know.  Pretty soon, Uncle Joe, Aunt Wilma, Doug, and Suzanne come to the door of one of the offices.  It seems like we have been expecting them.  I hug them all, and Suzanne kisses me several times and gets lipstick all over me.  They say that was the custom in Iraq - kissing while dancing.  In the same building there are two beds in one room, and I am supposed to sleep in one.  It turns out I have to share it with a cute girl in pink.  I put my arm around her, but she twists away.
