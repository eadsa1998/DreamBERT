I dreamt that it was a warm autumn evening and I was in a restless mood. I decided to go for a walk in the woods. The forest was very quiet, but I kept hearing the rustling of leaves. As I walked along, I came to an overhanging cliff. I looked down and saw a small river far below. At first I felt very happy and then I heard the hooting of an owl in the distance. I then felt very lonely--turned around and went home.
