I am at Rob's.  But while the dream is long, and it all occurs at Rob's, he never appears in it.  It is clear that he is always busy with some errand or task with another woman.  I am sure he is not 'seeing' these women romantically, he is helping them out or visiting them, but then again, he does like women.  In one part, I decide to clean his bathroom.  The details of each fixture and the black trim on the woodwork are very vivid.  His sister is around?
