I don't remember the start of the dream.  We were on the beach, perhaps as part of a family get-together.  My brother Stuart's fianc√©e Sheila was there.  I swam in the ocean a bit, with an inflatable whale.  There was another inflatable toy that started to get taken out by the current; I tried using the whale to reach it.  Off to the left of the beach was a calm area, more like a shallow lake.  I went for a swim out there.  It really didn't take me long to swim over and back considering the length.  The water was green and there was something about it that made me uneasy.  I didn't want to get too close to the dock on the other side, and I didn't want to stay in too long- but I'm not sure why I was compelled to go in at all.  I might have been trying to prove something to someone.  I wish I could remember more.
