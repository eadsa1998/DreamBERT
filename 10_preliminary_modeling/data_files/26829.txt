 I'm in a group of people. A man, who is our leader, holds up two bars of soap in a bag. It is the kind I'm using now: a pink bar of Caress. He says all of us have to shower using the soap: one person each day. I will shower on the last day. I'm in a circle of people. I'm the person others have to jump on to get elsewhere. They have to walk on me rather than on the ground. The first man tries to do this, and I feel pain. It hurts my back and body to have people step all over me. I appeal to my high school teacher, Jim Richardson, who plays a role in this situation.
