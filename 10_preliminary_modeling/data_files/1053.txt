I am angry at Terence because I asked him to get something for me and he teased me. I glare at him and don't talk to him. He says, "Come over here with me." I refuse. He picks me up. He says with a grin, "You'll get over it. We're pre-ordained to be married." I am angry and say, "Not ever!" He takes me into a hall with a series of doors and we get to a room. A "recording" of some kind speaks of the future and says Terence and I will be married. I refuse to speak to Terence and he laughs because he knows that all he has to do is wait. Then someone's after us. We go into the men's room to hide. I sit up on the edge of the toilet with my feet up and head down, coiled. Terence stands, leaning over me so no one sees me. Men come in. At first, I'm worried and then I figure, "Well, I guess I haven't anything to worry about because of the future already predicted." Terence goes out. I have to wait. As I wait, a man sits in the next stall and starts chatting with me. I answer back in grunts and single syllable words in as low a voice as I can manage. At one point, I have to talk a full sentence. He looks over suspiciously. He says, "Hey, you talk like a man but you're wearing women's dress. I think fast and say, "Boy, you should have been at the party last night. I just woke up here, dressed like this!" He accepts that. Some other man is bringing a father and his son together in another stall.
