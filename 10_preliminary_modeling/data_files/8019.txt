It was a Dollar Day. Many of the JLI members were working. They had a very large buffet lunch. Some of the members were serving dinner and washing dishes. There were three rods of bedspreads, one above the other, in the backroom. I looked at all of them trying to find something I liked. There were two rows of children lying on the floor at naptime, where the rods of linens previously were. The rods are steel pipes attached to the ceiling and floor and not the type that can be moved easily. The children were not given mats or anything to lie on. They had to lie on the cement. Some of them weren't actually lying. They were moving around a lot in their own little space. This seemed to be okay. I went and had lunch outside with Jane H and Janet S. After we finished eating they needed to get back to work. I put my dishes away and told them I needed to go as well. I spent some time on the sales floor looking at some furniture and talking to some shoppers.
