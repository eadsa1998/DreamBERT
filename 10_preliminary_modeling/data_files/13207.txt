Some others and I had powers. People were trying to kill us and we were at Mom's old house. I changed the stairs so the others couldn't come up. Later, other people came. I had a Band-Aid on my second finger on my right hand. I was planning my escape and imagining different scenarios. I pretended to jump off the balcony. Alejandro walked near where I was hiding and I ran out and jumped onto this platform and tried to get out of the door. The door was locked. Eugene was there too. He was talking to me and decided that I had no powers. This Chinese girl was hiding from some bad guys. There was this joker guy with powers and looked like Jay Kay. This guy was saying something about Jamiriquai, and Jay Kay wasn't in it. Someone said that his name was Jason Cheetham, and then someone said that Jamiriquai was someone else.
