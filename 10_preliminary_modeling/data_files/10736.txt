My kid sister (15) and I were getting ready for bed in the room next to ours. I went into our room to get my pajamas and I noticed that the window shades were up. Our double room looked out on the porch roof and as I walked to the window, I had the feeling that someone was on the roof. I pulled the blind down, but a hand reached in the window and pushed it back up. A man was out on the roof grinning at me. I was angry and tried to call my father, but I couldn't. I went into his room and woke him up. I told him very incoherently what happened and he got up. I didn't want him to go in our room because he might get hurt, but he insisted. As he walked down the hall, I forced myself to wake up. I was afraid to go back to sleep because I didn't want to know what might come next.
