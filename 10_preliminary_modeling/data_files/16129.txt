I had a little car to help me practice driving before I actually got a normal-sized one. It was like the size of a go cart and it had no top. It was kind of junky, but it was alright, I guess. And one time I started it up and drove it down to the end of the alley and turned around and drove back. And another time I started it up and went to 7-Eleven, and then I left it in the 7-Eleven parking lot and I was walking around and I took a walk around the lake and as I was walking home from the lake, something strange happened. Oh no, I think I got home from the park first. This guy came to the door with this dog, which he called Squirrely and I just got this terrible feeling in his presence, I thought, "Ooohhhhhhh," so I went in the house, but he came on the porch. And I went in the kitchen, but he came there. Then I took off out the back door and down the alley, and he like chased me around the neighborhood and then I got into the house and he was gone; thank goodness. Then I woke up.
