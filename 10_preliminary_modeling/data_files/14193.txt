I had a baby and the father was Eugene. Then it had been Mom, but she had actually just renamed me and Ezra. He was now called Ian Holder and I said if you add "Somer" then you're Boone (Lost). Ezra said "I don't wanna be Boone!". I was renamed to Kim, but then changed to Amy. I was driving and Mom called to ask if Ezra could borrow my shoes. I said yeah but they wouldn't fit. Then I was at home with Ezra, who was sometimes not. This guy was trying to get in through the kitchen window. We got him away and then I couldn't lock the front door. He got in, but I was still holding the wood door. We got a knife and were tying to stab him.
