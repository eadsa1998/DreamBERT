I am with Pedro in VIENNA. I remember a long bus trip, and getting my bag and purse and blue raincoat, and meeting Pedro (and BOB?) in Vienna. We are in a hotel room, overlooking mountains and the city! We go walking together, very very happy, I say: "I am so happy to be here in Vienna with you." He kisses me upside down (turning his head only).
