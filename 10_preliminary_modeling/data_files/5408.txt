Last night I dreamed that I was in the gym and was really anxious to check mail because I was waiting to hear from a study abroad program and a teaching program, for some reason. I found out I had been accepted to the teaching program and was really excited to tell Aaron. When he looked at my letter though, we realized that it was only a solicitation for an application, not an acceptance. I was really embarrassed. Then I woke up.
