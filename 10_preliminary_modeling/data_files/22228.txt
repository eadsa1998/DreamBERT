I dreamt I got a letter from a girlfriend and in the letter she scolded me, saying that she wrote to me and I had not written in a period of four months, and that, therefore, she was angry at me. In the letter she told me that this was the end of our friendship. In reality I had written to her, asking her to excuse the delay and when I saw her again, she did not want to see me and she formed another group, which made me upset and I left town.
