 I'm boarding a plane, but I think I forgot something so I run back to get it. I see my friends Ellen Sanders and Bill Hanson, whom I have not seen in a very long time. I'm very happy to see them! We hug, and Bill lifts me up in the air. I have to hurry back to the plane. There is a glider plane and a plane with a motor. A group of students are on the planes. We have to get up enough speed to take off. The larger plane is going to pull the glider. Students I know ride in one or both of the planes.
