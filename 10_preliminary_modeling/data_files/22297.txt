I was in a house, watching how people got together, as though it were a parade. Suddenly the headmaster of the elementary school I went to came over and asked me to take him to my home, where they had gotten together to serenade my father for his birthday. I told him I couldn't because my father was busy working in his tailor shop. Suddenly I saw myself all dressed in green, with a needle and a green button, and all the rest dressed in all kinds of colors and with a needle and a button, which they had left in a carton at the entrance since the tailor shop had become just that instead of the room. It was strange to see that everybody's clothes, including my own, didn't have any buttons. When the party ended, everybody left. I searched for my button and couldn't find it. I asked the headmaster about my button and he told me he didn't know anything. But suddenly I saw him next to a little old lady who told me that she also studied and that she was preparing herself for the university admission tests. She asked me whether they used the new kind of high school physics and chemistry at the university where I study. Then my dream ended.
