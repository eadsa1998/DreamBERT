I'm in a small house waiting for the doctor's appointment time. A baby girl and I are seated on a couch. She's busy and mischievous. I sit on a plastic potty on the couch and pee, my pants are down and the door opens and the baby brings in this guy from the bank who gives me my new checks. I am embarrassed and pull my blouse down to cover the panties and the potty and pretend to be sitting there normally. He raises his eyebrows and stares. I smile and then after he's gone, I am angry at the baby for not knocking first. Then it's time to go and I pour the pee in a sink and search for my keys. I get out of the car to see I've picked up sacks of things I don't need and I don't have what I need, the keys. I'm annoyed at the baby. We'll have to go to the bigger house to get the keys unless I have a spare pair in my purse. I ask the baby girl to look.
