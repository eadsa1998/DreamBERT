["Kissing everyone BUT Gaston."] I am in a sort of parking garage structure. I am looking at objects in different levels, each one lower than the next. One bin has red and white high heel shoes in it. I am experimenting by kissing everyone around. Except Gaston. He comes into the area (like a caged car spot) and wants to kiss. I feel like I hurt his feelings because I didn't choose to kiss him. We kiss.
