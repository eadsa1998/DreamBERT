I was at home, but I think it was a new place. It was quite big. I wanted to get some kind of woodwork station set up and Poppa bought these bits of wood for me and was going to set it up in this outside area that we owned. But apparently the surrounding areas were dangerous and meant stuff might gets stolen. Then I was in a video game. I was playing with two others on my team. It was like an RPG. I think Ezra was one of the people I was with and we both had a little bit of armour but the other guy didn't. We did one mission (and it was set up so like one of us was in danger and we had to rescue them) and the second mission had these logs over pits, so if you stood on them in the wrong position, you'd fall. Both of them were tied up; one on this thing in the middle and the other on this wall at the back. I started walking towards him and then noticed there was a snake along the length of the wall. Someone said it'd seen me and I looked back to see it looking at me and I tried walking slowly away but it started moving and I started hitting escape and nothing was happening, so I alt+f4'd and got out of the game. I tried again, this time moving slowly but it saw me and I got out of it again. We didn't know what to do. We got back in and I paused, but now the scene was like a fair and I walked around it and I saw the snake come out of a toy grabber machine and wrap itself around a mother and squeeze her and kill her. I deliberated between going back and owning up to it, or just leaving. I started walking back to see what was happening but I saw it slithering out and around my corner, so I pressed alt+f4 and left and told the other guys I was giving up because it was too dangerous.
