The aura of something dark, a creeping tingling infused with the grim persistence of inevitability, radiated from every wall, carpet fiber and chair. I'd just come in from outside. Out there, I could feel the oily mist of this impending fate thick in the air, on the sunlight as it filtered through haze and ozone, as it backlit the swathes of knuckled cumulus clouds floating like cotton-candy cattle in the sky. Billowy bovines oblivious to their coming dissipation. This wasn't my house I had stepped into. It was small and squat, on the edge of the sea in a town mired in history, but now sagging with the weight of Taco Bells and tourism. The house belonged to friends, though, so I felt safe entering unannounced. I had to get out from under that afflicted afternoon. Before whatever was about to happen happened, I had to have something. I wanted to take a shower. The forthcoming journey, I could sense, would be nigh impossible, let alone make allowance for bathing. And the sheen of fear and finality from the outside was still sticking fast to my skin. I went into the small, square, messy room of one of my friends and asked if I could use his bathroom. He said, "yes, of course, no problem" as he dressed himself while seated on an unmade bed, dirty clothes surrounding his feet on the floor. I went inside the door adjoining his room with the dim and musty bathroom. The small space was covered in scummy beige tile from floor to ceiling, and the shower curtain was supposed to be clear, but had grown opaque from uncounted months of accumulated mildew. I stripped and stepped inside. When I turned the squeaky and corroded chrome shower knobs to full and hot, only a gentle cascade of lukewarm water came down on my body. I began to shampoo anyway, using a bottle I found in the shower. <br/
