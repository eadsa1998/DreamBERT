I had a dream, most of which doesn't seem particularly important, concerning preparations that I and several other people were making for a picnic that we were going to have. But this woman who at first seemed to be part of our group, and who, later it turned out was a Martian, was trying to kill us all, and had very unusual powers, and we couldn't seem to cope with her. And so I particularly was very frightened in the dream. But finally in the dream I said to myself that this dream couldn't go on like this. I couldn't go on being afraid of this person and never being able to succeed against her. And so I decided that something was going to have to be done, something would have to work out. And so she came out, and I grabbed some milk from the table and threw it toward her. And this seemed to have been the right thing to do, because on Mars liquids -- water especially -- being so scarce, were sort of poisons to her, and so sort of burned her. And so then I got water and threw it on her. And this was the solution, because after that I knew I could take care of her and she wouldn't be a menace any more. And this seemed sort of important because last night we were talking with Bill H. and Ruth about dreams and being able to manipulate them, and I said that even if I became aware of dreaming, I was never able to manipulate them. And so I seem to have had a dream in which I proved that I could do this. That's all.
