Later, I had a confrontation with an authority figure (I think it was me). I had something I was going to trade for the coral pillow that was directly connected with my mother's "enslavement." He had her under his power (like blackmail) as long as he had the coral pillow. He said, "You want all of it?" I said, "Yes." He said, "O.K." Then I was driving. Some one is with me (a young man, I think). I take a new path. It's like I was saying to myself, "Ah, ya, I'm free now. I can break the old habits and take a new path. I felt scared, like he would disapprove and I'd get in trouble. Then over a rise, I saw the ocean from a new perspective and it was beautiful. Then I went over the rise. The path was so steep, like a cliff. I made it. There was a table in the ocean. Some person had his head in the "sand." On the table was an old faded silk pillow with a picture of a leopard on it (like my needlepoint pillow). I felt blocked by this man, but then I just reached out and took the pillow and gave it to my mother (the man and my mother were also me). I felt very free and exhilarated.
