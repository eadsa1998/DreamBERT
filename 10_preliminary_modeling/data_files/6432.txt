This morning I had a dream about Gwen. I was holding in my hand the original draft of my novel, and I was telling her: "See this? I wrote this because of you. This book is about you. You brought this story into my life, and I told it." Then our friend Sarah came along and disappeared. Gwen implored me to come and find Sarah, to get Sarah.
