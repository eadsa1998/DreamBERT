I jumped into my car and decided to go target practicing in the country. I remember riding along and enjoying the beautiful scenery immensely. However, it then dawned on me that I had nothing to shoot at, so I decided to stop and find something. I stopped at a farm house and went into a barn looking for something to shoot at. I spotted it. Ah, a barrel with a bung-hole, (I couldn't be that hard up) and began to carry it out of the barn. Suddenly the farm woman saw me and told me to put down the barrel. The firmness of the tones of her voice hastened my putting down of the barrel. I made out as if I wanted to buy something, and I gave as an excuse that I wanted to put the articles I bought into the barrel. I then went out of the barn and did buy some tomato plants with ripe tomatoes on them. I then got into my car and remember myself driving home.
