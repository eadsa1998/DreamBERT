I was at school, which was different. I was there to repeat Year 12. There were lots of others there, including Calvin, Eugene and a lot of IB students were actually there to do a post-IB thing. Calvin remembered about Eugene suddenly and said "Eugene Pritchard!" and I was like "damn it!". Daryl was nearby and he knew about the joke and chuckled. Later, Eugene was sitting near me and his bum was close to my face. He had a black stain on his pants and I pointed it out to Calvin and he started joking behind his back and adding people to his city on My City (Facebook game). Eugene turned around and was like "what's going on?" but he was smiling and laughing a little. I laughed and said that there was "only seven to go" (only seven residents to add before we ran out).
