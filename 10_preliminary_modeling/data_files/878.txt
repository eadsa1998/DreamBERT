I wanted some ice cream. I bought some hot buttered rum, really syrupy and sugary. I took it home to the old house in M City. My mother saw it and said, "Oh, now, I'll pay for that." I said, "No, it's O.K. You don't have to pay me back. Just have some." But even as I said it, I knew she would pay me back and I would accept gladly. Later, I told my brother Dwight that my van wasn't running quite right. There was a loping in the motor sound. I said, "I guess I'll take it to be fixed. How much will it cost?" He said, "I'll do it for you and won't charge much." My mother wore blue jeans.
