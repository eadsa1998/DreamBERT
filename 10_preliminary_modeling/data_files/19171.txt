I was dreaming about this group of men. They were planning robberies. One of them was the leader, and they were discussing what they were going to go out and steal that night. The plan was that when he had made a good robbery, he would stick around and help look for the robbers to help get rid of suspicion on yourself. There was a bus and a couple of major crooks and there was some minor ones. They were doing everything very carefully. They were in black face so they were disguised. They were covered with something, but it was a little hard to see. They all left. They were upstairs in the building or something. They left and one of the anxious guys wanted to be a robber, but he wasn't very good at it. They were putting him down. They didn't want him to go with them. Everybody else was very careful and they could leave without making any marks, and this other guy, he runs off the building and falls to the cement. He gets up, but he leaves, you know, a mark, marks on his clothes and the stuff he had on. He kind of gives away the whole thing, or if somebody saw the stuff on the cement, it would give away the whole thing. That's all. Hall: Sam was a spectator, not a participant. He was just watching it. They were all men, the robbers were.
