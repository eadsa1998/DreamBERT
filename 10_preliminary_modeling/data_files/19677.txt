I pour water into 2 enclosures, one rectangular, the other circular. There has been a drought and the dry earth soaks up the water very rapidly. Carl Carty stands at one end of the rectangular enclosure with a camera, intending to take a photograph. Nearby are some chickens, and up on a hillside a big heavy heifer. Presently Ed Hemway goes to the corn crib, and as he does so the heifer lies down and comes rolling down the hill. I ask Ed if I can have a nubbin to feed the heifer, this being more tender than the fully formed ears. Ed hands me one which I feed to the heifer. Ed then shows me some of the extraordinarily large grains from prize ears. Some of these grains are 3 or 4 inches long. We laugh about them. I say no doubt these big ears have been frequently photographed. Every answers no, they haven't been in recent years, but we are unable to take any photos as Ed's camera seems to have been left at our house in my hometown.
