Melinda and I were riding home from school and we got out of the car and we started walking down this dirt road, and she told me that this was where her husband's mother and father were. And so we were walking down this dirt road, and before we knew it we were in the woods, and there were these geese all around and then there were baby geese in this little area. And then we saw somebody come up behind us and start shooting. And somebody was accusing us of doing that. And then I went inside and Mom had spilled root beer all over my bed [laugh] and I was talking about how good I take care of a baby when I really don't have one, and I probably never will.
