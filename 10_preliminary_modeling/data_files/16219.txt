I was DJ'ing the most bummer party ever. Okay, here's the deal: the Peavey system was set up out in the back yard, and there was a handful of people out there. And I was still inside rummaging g around, trying to get all my CD's together and stuff. And it took me like a half an hour to an hour to get them all together and ready. And then I came outside and it was dark already and there were some more people. And I was going to, I sat down at my table and I was putting this CD in, and everybody was just kind of totally like they didn't even hear it, and nobody was dancing, they were just all kind of "duhhhhh," like they just didn't even hear it. So I put on something else and I crank it up a little louder, and they still just like kind of "duhhhhh," like they don't even hear it. And I can't remember what I did, but I think I just was totally not ready and my system was cuckooing out on me and stuff, and it was just a real bummer of a party.
