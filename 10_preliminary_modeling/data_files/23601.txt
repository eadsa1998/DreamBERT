I fell in love with a girl I know by the name of Judy. She's about seven years younger than myself. I do know this girl in real life. She was a social worker or I should say we both were. I don't know what part of the country we're located at. It wasn't anyplace I knew. But the place was in shambles, like after a war, buildings half fallen down. Anyway, we were married. After that it seems we're always in trouble, because we were always on the go. About what I don't know. All I know is I was in love with Judy and that's all I dreamed about.
