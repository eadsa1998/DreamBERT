I can't remember properly, but I was either living with a girl or living in an apartment near her. She had a really hot boyfriend and they had been living together for like 5 years (it might be 8, it's hard to read). He proposed to her and he had some special family ring, so the marriage would last double the time. It was plastic and green. For some reason, I put it on. It was very hard plastic and I couldn't bend my fingers and it felt like it would snap if I tried to bend harder. I was then with Nana and she wanted to look. I handed it to the guy and I said that I couldn't wear it, 'it doesn't fit, my fingers are too fat' etc.  Then the guy and I were actually having an affair. He or the girl decided to break up. Ezra and I were at the shop and got bored. We made a mess in the store? There was a call for us about Mom waiting for us out the front of the store. Ezra had music on his phone. I was going through it, and it showed all the artists sitting around a table. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jared Padalecki were two of them. There were two others who had guest starred on Supernatural. Jeffrey Dean Morgan was wearing the same jewelry and clothes that he was wearing in P.S I Love You. He was talking and laughing with Jared. I went to play Jeffrey's music, but it just played Round and Round. He had two songs on Youtube and I was listening to them, but it didn't sound like him. He was a "rock fan". I was reading the FAQ for Comic-Con and there was a question about whether Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were going to be coming and it pretty much said that neither of them was coming.
