I was in an apartment building and I hinted something to my boss that I might quit Fuller Brush. He said nothing, but went down to the patio and started talking with two other Fuller men, one of them the branch manager, and the other a German. When I came in, the German began talking about quitting and the others tried to get him not to. They showed him how much money he was making, etc., and how foolish it would be to quit. Then they turned to me to ask if I didn't agree with all this. I said I did, and then he asked me why I wanted to quit. The little act they had been putting on was just to show me how foolish I would be if I did quit. I said I wouldn't quit until I was not making any money or my school work was hurt. They said okay. But then the manager began talking about my sales record. He said he wanted to see more than the $65 I turned in last week. I really turned in over a $100, but my boss needed some of it to fill his quota. At this point I walked away, but I heard my boss saying that I had worked for him and earned another $50. This seemed to satisfy the men.
