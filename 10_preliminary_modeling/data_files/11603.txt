I was in an underground cavern which was subdivided into several rooms where there were gambling games going. I had my shoes off and they were on a shelf at the end of the cavern. I was in a dice game when the police came in the front of the cavern. My brother-in-law was leading the police (he is 28). He grabbed my shoes and handed them to me and I went out the front door. There seemed to be great confusion in the back part of the cavern.
