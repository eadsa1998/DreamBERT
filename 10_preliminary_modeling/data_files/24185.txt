The only part I remembered about the dream was when my roommate (22/female) was sitting down in the living room on the couch and she was telling me that she was pregnant. I immediately felt concerned about her situation and I asked her what she planned on doing about her studies. She then told me she was thinking of getting an abortion. I objected to her decision. I was trying to persuade her to change her mind. I don't know what happened next because this was when I woke up. During the dream I felt very unpleasant. I was very concerned with my roommate's situation.
