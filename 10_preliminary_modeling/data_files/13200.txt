I was at home and something happened to my room. My bed was at my window. Dad said that nineteen things had disappeared so if I saw anything weird I should tell him. I saw a gnome and some other things and Dad came and got them. Then he saw a hand in the air conditioner and the vents were closing. I asked if he wanted a torch but he said no and I said that it was a gay torch anyway.
