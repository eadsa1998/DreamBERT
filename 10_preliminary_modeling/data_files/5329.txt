I dreamed that I had to take the AP US History exam, even though I hadn't taken the class. I also forgot all my pens and pencils and freaked out when I got to the exam. I asked if I could go home and change, but I wasn't allowed to. I left anyway and went down to the lake to take a break before I had to take the exam. On my way back up the hill, I couldn't move. Everyone around me was walking up the hill, and I became really mad because I thought I was going to miss the exam. I guess I was rooming with Victoria, because she was there too. I never made it to the AP, so I had to take it online during the summer. Then I had this power that I could make people fall in love with whomever they wanted. And then I woke up.
