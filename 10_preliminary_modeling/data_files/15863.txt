I was married to this chubby-ish guy who looked like AJ Bowen. He went to have a shower, and I got naked and lay on the bed on my stomach. He got out of the shower and saw me and climbed on top. He was moving, but his penis wasn't going in and I was thinking 'how small is he?'. I tried moving myself and grabbing it and pushing it inside me, but he couldn't get it back in. [In real life, I half woke up as I orgasmed, but promptly fell back asleep and returned to the dream]. I was really horny and annoyed. I whispered to him to turn over, he didn't hear me and I said it again. He got up and I turned around but he left the room. I didn't know where he went off too and I checked to see if he'd come, but he hadn't. Then I was at home, which was like the old house. I looked out the window and saw Mom walking down the driveway so I assumed they were leaving. I had this big box full of sex toys and I got this suction cap dildo and put it on my chair and sat on it and bounced up and down fast, which made a bit of noise because of the chair, but I came quickly. I got up and the suction cap was on the chair but no dildo and it was still inside me. It was covered in cum and slippery and sticky. I didn't know how to reattach the two, so I got a tissue to wipe them down and then put all of them back in the box. I then heard talking from somewhere in the house and realised they were home, but I didn't know if they'd been back the whole time. I also noticed my door wasn't closing, if I tried to lock it, it would still pop back open. It just kept opening inwards. After packing everything away, I told them and Darren came to have a look at it. He knew what the problem was and said it was an insurance issue so he couldn't touch it and had to call out certain people to take a look.
