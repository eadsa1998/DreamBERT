I dreamed that I was a guide at one of the parks here in C. I am not familiar with the park but I remember that I was directing people in the park to follow a sidewalk which would lead them to a voting booth. (Primary election this fall). There was a sign nearby that had bold red and white letters on it that said "VOTE FOR NUESS..." (or Neff...). I walked a little way with a lady about 50 yrs. of Age--no one that I knew--and then came back to my "post." There were a few other people of all ages in my dream but the lady I mentioned is the only distinct person that I remember. I didn't see the booth in the park but I felt as though there was one at the end of the walk. I remember that it way daytime and the sun was shining.
