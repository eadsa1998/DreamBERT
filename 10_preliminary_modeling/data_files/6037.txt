This dream was about where I work now, at the candy store in the mall. Only one person works at a time so it is hard to call in. I was supposed to work but I forgot or couldn't get a ride or get down to work. I was working from my telephone at my house, in my room. When I woke up, I figured it was impossible because how can you work from a telephone at your house?
