I was at home which was different. Mom was saying she got stuff from Dad's old place. She and Darren had been staying there. I asked why they didn't tell me and they were like 'meh'. They said 'wouldn't you like to have the house by yourself' and I said no. Ezra also said no. We argued. Dad was nearby and ignored it. I said "I've wanted that house since I was like 3!". I was then at a shop and it was quiet. There were no aircons on or the freezers for the frozen stuff. I grabbed some snacks.
