I'm at an art show (possibly a private view). It's towards the end of the night, and there's not many people left. It seems to be in a castle or a dungeon - cold echoey stone, very dark with pools of light on the exhibits. There's two artists showing: a painter and an installation artist. The painter is a very talented female. Her works are striking bold compositions with strong colors that remind me of Francis Bacon, but smaller and less horrific. The other artist uses live models 'trapped' in display cases. There are two cases on display containing people I know. Ex-band members Tyler and in another case Jack. We let them out before we leave and then we all walk down a huge mountainous incline that seems almost fake, as if it was made of fibreglass or rubber. I bound down with huge strides to keep ahead of Jack who is chasing me - not to hurt me, but probably to socialize with me (he is a bit over-bearing). The incline turns upwards. I bound up, full of energy, and get to the top before the others. Near the top there's a small hole, easy to miss, that I drag myself through. It is the entrance to an underground motel for bikers. My partner is waiting for me there. I am late. She says this motel is expensive, so we move on to find another one.
