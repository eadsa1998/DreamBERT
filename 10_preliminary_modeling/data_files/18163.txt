It seems that my husband had gotten his Ph.D. and we were going to have to move from this married students housing that we live in. And so we were trying to decide how big a house we were going to have. And there was this little plot of land nearby where we could have somebody come and set us up, mark us off an area of any size that we said might be the interior of a house. So we were figuring out how many rooms we wanted and how big each room was going to be and everything. And we came out with this, it didn't seem perfectly fantastic in the dream, but it does now. We decided that our house was going to be about 40 feet wide and 1,200 feet long. So we were going then to see this contractor to set up this framework and then we were going out to see if this would be an adequate size for us or not. But I thought, what they did was just to mark it off and put sort of a little rope around the area. I thought it was going to be awfully hard to judge that way without having the actual house there.
