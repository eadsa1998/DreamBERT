In a horse-and-buggy carriage that is supposed to bring us to a Restaurant. I am with Frank, Earl and other men. I remember lying on my stomach, face over the edge, feeling the soft sand kicked up by the horses' hoofs into my face. We come into the sun light and find the restaurant around the corner; as we get out, I feel a pain in my right hip and limp to the restaurant;-- shift: we are standing opposite a big CHURCH: I see the STONE STEPS leading up to the portals and I see a BRIDE who is wearing a beautiful white gown standing at the top of the stairs; Ushers help her bounce down the stairs like a CHUTE and she falls hard at the bottom, although they had put some black cushions down to soften the fall; When she arises she is wearing her regular clothes: an ordinary summer PLAY DRESS red and white checkers and shoulder straps. She says she hurt a place in her NECK and can't move it freely; she cries a bit and her mother tries to comfort her. - We go around the corner to a cafe.
