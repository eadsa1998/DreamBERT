There are wild mustang horses and I and some man are catching them and riding them. They have cartoon-looking eyes and each one has a sign held up or somehow on their faces below their eyes. The signs are pieces of large white paper with words on them. Now we are doing a documentary on the Wild West or cattle drives or something. We interview cowboys and then three Indians come by and I approach them to ask for an interview. I say, "I know we whites took your land and you have no trust of me, but I'd like to hear what you have to say." One takes an interest in me (I am a young, pretty woman with long black hair), He agrees to talk. Now the other man I'm with is the owner of a cattle herd and ranch and is doing a cattle drive. I decide at the last moment to tag along to help. I grab a horse, a blanket with a space blanket inside and some beef jerky kinds of food and gallop after them. This infuriates the man who chooses to ignore me or help me. If I freeze or starve, then fine. I follow along doggedly. At the ranch house, his mother says to me, "Make him talk to you. Then maybe he'll stop being so cruel and stupid." I laugh and say, "If I could, I would." He is adamant. Some other woman wants to help me and finds four umbrellas and ties them to my saddle bags. I say, "How will these help me? I'll take them if you can convince me they will be helpful." The woman tries to think of a way they can be helpful and says they would make paper sounds when opened and this may scare the cattle into moving, or scare away predators. I am not convinced. I ride out of the house to catch up with the man on the cattle drive.
