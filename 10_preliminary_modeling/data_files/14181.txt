I was at a carnival with the school. I was with Calvin. We were walking on the side of the road to avoid something. The carnival didn't actually start until "7 November", which was a while away. I had to go to the toilet (at school I think). The cubicles didn't have doors so I went to the shower. I had been in math and the teacher said we could go to the toilet. Then I was with Dad in a building. There were rabbits so I pet them. There was a giant rat thing with a spider and it was shaking. These guys shut the place down. The guy told us most of them were ok but I felt bad.
