I was doing homework at my neighbor's house. This really weird Chinese guy walked by the window and started staring at me. As I was looking at him out the window, it was like I was looking at him from my apartment window; however, I was still at my neighbor's house. He came inside and stared at me and started making these motions like he wanted to play with my hair. I told him to leave, but he wouldn't, so I called the police. When I picked up the phone to call, he left. So then I kept watching him. I wanted to get back to my house, so I took a secret way. Suddenly I was in our spare bedroom looking out at a bunch of orange bushes.
