G. and I were caught in a shower and took refuge on the piazza of a vacant house. Suddenly we heard the doorbell ring. We stood looking at the door in amazement, and it rang again. Then like a flash the door flew open and a wild-looking boy sprang out and hurled a heavy stone at me. It struck my right collarbone and I woke up feeling that there was something more uncanny about it than the bare facts explained, a common impression after a vivid dream.
