It was an afternoon of a group rehearsal. My three pals arrived at my home and we started to play a whole bunch of Beatle songs and they came out somewhat similar. We also recorded some other great rhythms. My uncle brought his special recorder and that and the mikes I had made a very good sound. More of my pals arrived and we were able to play Yellow River because one of them had the lyrics already, and later we turned on other instruments and at that moment the alarm clock rang.
