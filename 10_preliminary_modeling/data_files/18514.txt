I was in art school and in between classes Mr. Custode was drawing Jackie the model from memory. His room where he slept was full of paint and he slept with his door open too. It was too hot not to. He was drawing with pencils and chalk, and I liked the sketch study better than the finished drawing. He had drawn Jackie and her shadow and made numerical notes about the proportion of shadows in relation to actual size and angle of the sun. Time is only an attempt to name the relationship between revolving and rotation of the sun and planets, our solar system, etc. Then in the office I heard my name, Coach Croxton was buying snack cakes from the convenience store, he was helping a small black boy across the street; but then, beat him up after they got across. The little boy was lying on the sidewalk. TV was inundated with game shows. Ones trying to be coy and fake sexy. They went up to channel 149. The remote only worked in one direction. My mother wanted to watch a program on channel 4 about the 1700's. (It was the only channel without a game show on). She told me to switch the remote. I accidentally passed over the 149 and was going too fast and before I had time to stop, I had passed channel 4. [and the remote would not 'subtract' numbers] so I had to start all over again. My mother yelled, "NO!" I tried again to get channel 4 and I slowed down this time, but the numbers went over channel 3 directly to channel 5, skipping channel 4 and my mother said, "Can't you do anything right?" There was a check on the counter for $300. And on the line that said "For" it said, "2% and nonfat milk." Romulus sat against the wall and I had a yellow shirt jersey, with letters sewn on; and I kept talking about going to the thrift store on 148 St. in Harlem.
