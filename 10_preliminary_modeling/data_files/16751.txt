I was at my grandfather's house, and my grandmother was there. I wanted to ask her some questions, while I could. I don't remember what I asked, but she asked me if I'd read any Stephen King books lately, and I asked her if she's ever read Jorge Luis Borges (answers were yes, no, respectively). I remember trying to decide whether I wanted to sleep at their house or at home, but I got very tired suddenly and decided to just stay there. My grandfather is sleeping in a single bed (in what I think isn't even his bedroom; it's the room to the right of his). My grandmother was sleeping on another bed right next to him, and there were two other beds in the room that I had the choice of sleeping on. I went into the kitchen (where the door was misplaced from physical reality, and the outside was considerably different). The main door was open, I think, but the screen was closed. I had a sudden feeling someone would try to break in. Then, I saw someone walk by the door, and then come back and try to open it. It was a young black man who claimed to have the simple motive of using the telephone, but I was already paranoid someone would try to break in (besides, he stormed right in without asking permission). He took the telephone and I let him use it outside the door. It was on a cord. I let him take it. I wanted to call the police just to be safe, but the phone wasn't available because this guy was already using it (and there was actually a top part of the door that I didn't know how to close). I thought I'd be safer if I asked the police to do it. Then the guy claims I'm racist because I didn't want to let him in my house.
