There was a film that called for extras and some of us volunteered. There was a bus and we were all placed according to last name. I was away from everyone else. Tristan was next to a couple of people he knew. When they called out Frederick to place him they called out 'Frederick Pine' and Pine was actually Tristan's last name, so they were seated fairly close. Most people hadn't turned up though so when we went to leave they let us move. Frederick and I kept looking at each other and then looking away. Later, we were in a class or something and Tristan was talking about something and referenced this data which was like a calendar, but had little cogs on the days when the person had had sex. Apparently this was my data because Tristan said there was a bit where I'd said 'I don't want to have sex on my birthday' and when it was revealed it was mine, there was an awkward silence.
