I was back at the agency again, in our office, but the place was unrecognizable.  It had been reorganized and repartitioned, and there were new people all over the place.  I looked for Kathy but didn't see her, and Evie Marche was back at the distribution boxes.  In fact, I think someone told me that Kathy had quit. Vernon Tolson was working there, but the only other the agency people I knew were Jim Plummer  and Norma Grimson.  Jim was briefing me on a problem he was working on, and bringing me up to date on my files.  At one point I suddenly realized that I didn't have my badge, and I couldn't figure out for the life of me how I got in the building.  But then I felt in my shirt pocket and found that I did indeed have one.  Then I was puzzled about how I got one on such short notice, since it seemed they had called me up and asked me to come back and work temporarily, because they were shorthanded or something.  Even that seemed odd to me, as it would in real life.  Norma was sort of filling me in on things.  I asked her if she was now branch chief, and she said they were no longer organized that way, that she was chief of the data branch-all reports had to go through her.  I assumed Bill Clay had charge of all the secret codes in his branch, and apparently I was right, but when I looked in their area, no one was there-out to lunch, I surmised.  It was all pretty depressing -- the reorganization and separation from my friends, the breakup of familiar routines, the plethora of strangers and absence of familiar faces -- and the prospect of having to have all my reports approved by Norma.
