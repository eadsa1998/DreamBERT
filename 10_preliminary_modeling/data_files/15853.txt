I woke up (in apartment in Hollywood) and it was 12.45pm. It was today (going to Six Flags) and I was supposed to be up at 7am to get picked up at 9am [happening IRL]. I tried to call Winifred and had no luck, so text her saying I was getting ready. I went downstairs (place was different) and found her on another street. I said my alarm didn't go off, I have no idea how I slept that long etc. We agreed it was too late to go today and I suggested Sunday but she seemed bewildered by the idea. Then she said maybe we could go today and Sunday but then realised it would cost too much. So we decided on Sunday. Then I was back home and Mom was talking to someone about me saying that I had no sexual experience and they were like 'how do you know' and she asked me and I said 'I'm not answering that question' and then said 'no', ambiguously. Mom said that she knew people interested and she said 'Chris' (actually Matthieu) saying he liked fat girls. I was like 'ew wtf' and then thought Luisa was the skinniest person ever when we first met her. He was then over and acting weirdly and I tried to avoid him.
