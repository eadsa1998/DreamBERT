In the dream the instructor at my martial arts class has a large gothic-looking apartment - dark with very high ceilings, dark red couches and curtains - like the set of a vampire movie. He and his wife and several class members are there. The atmosphere is one of a secret organisation, and this is the headquarters. The are some tasks that we (the members) have to undertake for the organisation - it involves putting capsules of water into the wheelie bins around the city. One capsule must be put into each bin every night - I don't know why. However, the organisation gets charged each time. What happens is in some of the bins, water gets in there ifs it's been raining and the lid wasn't closed, and the boss gets news of extra charges. He calls a meeting and is very passive aggressive with me, asking me with a smile "Are you expecting me to pay for this?" I back down and say "No, don't worry". However it's not my fault.
