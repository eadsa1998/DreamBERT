We are riding in a NEW CAR in the middle of July and there is a big SNOW STORM and we get stuck in a snow drift; We have to sit and wait for someone to help us get out of the drift; Somehow I manage to drive the car and ride wildly over the snow bumps to a Supermarket. I see young boys with skis attached to the bottom of their car riding over street covered with ICE. "Young people will always find a way to have fun." We laugh about snow in July.....
