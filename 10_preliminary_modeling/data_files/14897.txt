I was sharing a room with Ezra? Roland was over too. I went to bed with no pants on because it was hot. I woke up and I had to get out of bed to find my pants, but Ezra and Roland were awake. The light was off though. Roland was looking for something under the bed with a torch. I found a pair of red shorts and left to go to the toilet. As I left, Don't Ever Change started playing. The toilet was small and there was one on the side wall too. Mom had a cinema and she was in the projector room playing with the screen resolution. The popcorn was made in there too. I asked if when it was open, could I work in here and she was like 'of course'. The cinema was in a mall. We left and when we were going back we went through all these shortcuts that were full of people to get to it. Mom was angry about it. Ezra brought flowers to the cinema and they had bees in them. I got a butterfly and brought it to Mom. There was a big black one and it was the size of a cat. We got chased by a giant robot.
