In the dream I'm living in Germany, perhaps with my friend Sal. I have a job with a large organisation, which seems to be the only employer in this small town. I can't work out what they do. There are various jobs to do there - like waitressing, cleaning, pool cleaning, attending rides in an enormous amusement park. I've worked out this is some kind of tourism company that's employing me. This whole town seems to be one big money-making machine for milking tourists. My boss is a guy who was really by boss about 10 years ago. In real life he was a good guy - perhaps he is trapped here too. In the dream he seems to have become hardened - like a gangster almost - handing out rough treatment to his many employees. His office is large and scruffy. It is almost empty - it looks like he has the whole floor of a large office block to himself. He sits at a desk with papers all over it, signing employment contracts. When he sees me he smiles, but his smile seems double-edged (not genuine). Back in town, I'm aware that the town is like a trap or a maze. Once you're inside, it's almost impossible to find your way out. There are rides that take you through the streets, that weave in and out of a three dimensional spaghetti jumble of tourist shops, garish signs and cartoony fibreglass models. It seems people don't even have the freedom to walk anywhere - you have to travel on rides. They are like little bumper cars or roller-coaster cars. Behind the bright plastic and lights, if you look carefully, you can make out the workers - slightly depressed looking people in something like McDonald's  uniforms with caps. They look greasy and dirty and bored. They are mostly immigrants. This is a dirty and sickening place.
