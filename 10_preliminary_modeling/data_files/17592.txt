I was watching a fat girl jump into a pool.  It was a party.  It was late and I was going to go home.  My boyfriend Jeremy was not there, but surprisingly his dad said I should stay until the morning.  At first I said no, but he said it was better than risking the trip.  I sat a moment and suddenly felt the fatigue and dizziness, so I agreed to stay.
