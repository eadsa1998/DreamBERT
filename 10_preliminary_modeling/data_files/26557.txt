 There is a funeral for one of my friend Reed Maxwell's family members. Others and I are riding in a vehicle to the funeral. Some people ride in another car because there isn't enough room in the vehicle I'm driving. There is only a small place in the cab of my truck-like vehicle, and some space in the bed. My mom is there. At the gathering, my friend Hank Anderson arrives back from his study abroad experience. He seems a bit aloof or standoffish at first. Then we hug each other. He may be with a woman.
