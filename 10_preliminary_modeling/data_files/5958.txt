X. (a male friend) and I are walking through a public terminal of some kind and it is very crowded as we follow a long line. We are afraid of being caught for something we have done -- what? -- and we are each carrying incriminating pocket-sized pistols. They are loaded, but I am very careful that the trigger on mine is not cocked. There is a security inspection ahead and there is no place to hide the guns. "I'm getting out of here and doing this again", I think. I have some kind of power to go back in time a few hours. The terminal turns out to be an airport, and I go back to the time that my plane is about to land. (Somehow I have now lost X.) This time I am the pilot. I land the plane, and without any announcement, run undetected out of the plane through the indoor gate area of the airport. No one sees me yet and I look for a place to dump the pistol, still concealed in my pants pocket. I find a hedge row of bushes inside the terminal, still unblossomed. I conceal the gun there, hoping it will not be seen. I run through all of the hallways of the airport building, with my "passengers" still waiting on the plane I just landed. I leave the building and run through the parking lot, hoping that I can finally escape. When I reach the spot where I had parked my car, a policeman is standing next to the skeletal remains of a bombed-out automobile. "That's my car!", I cry. "That's my car!" I am very disappointed that now I can not drive away. The main feeling of this dream is of wanting to escape, to go away from the crowd quietly. I am not actually chased, but I run away and am hiding something.
