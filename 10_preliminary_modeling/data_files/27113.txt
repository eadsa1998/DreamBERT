In this dream I discovered suddenly upon waking up from a sleep, that I was the mother of two baby boys whom I gave birth to at the same time. I remember feeling surprised at not remembering giving birth, but I seemed quite proud of being a mother. My mother then informed me that I was pregnant again, but the doctor who diagnosed me said he wasn't sure of this he had heard some noise in my stomach and for this reason felt I might be pregnant. I didn't experience any pain in this dream, but I remember going through the motions of being in pain, I couldn't walk well and I acted as tho I were very weak. I remember showing off the babies to people who came into the house.
