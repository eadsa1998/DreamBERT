I'm at auditions. I chose my cast, four of them. Howie is glad I've chosen him and assures me that he was thrown out of the other production through no fault of his own. I don't believe him and feel uneasy that I've chosen him. He said the other teacher was Dan S and Jim G. I feel relieved it was only music teachers. I talk with Jock about who I've chosen. He openly grins at me at mention of Howie. "That nut! He's no good," he says. I feel embarrassed and then resolutely stand my ground. "I chose him," I say. "Huh," Jock responds.
