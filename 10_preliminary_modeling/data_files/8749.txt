I was in my office at CAS. It was set up differently than it was in waking life. The desk was facing the right wall, up against the wall. There was no computer credenza. I was sitting there working at my laptop. Bill C came up and stood in the doorway. He didn't say anything right away, like he was deciding what to say or if he should say anything, wondering if I was still mad at him. He was wearing black denim pants and a lime green shirt. It had ruffles, almost like a tuxedo shirt. His socks were also lime green. He finally said something. I answered in a testy or unpleasant tone of voice. He came in to the office and sat down in a chair to the right of my desk. We talked for a little bit. I closed my laptop. I opened the middle left desk drawer. There was a black shoulder strap, like for a computer case, in there. I picked it up partially and then could tell it wasn't mine. I closed the drawer and left. As I approached the front doors of the office suite I noticed that both Karen E and Jennifer C were standing there talking. I didn't want to face them but couldn't avoid them. So I just kept walking and didn't make eye contact.
