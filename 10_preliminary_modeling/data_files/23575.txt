I'm in my bedroom but it's in a different house. A red lightbulb in my lamp. Three young people -- none of them me -- are going to sleep together in the bed. One woman is non-human. The other woman and man are a couple -- human or not? John and his nine-year old daughter are there. Some other people I don't know. I was kind of there and kind of watching from outside.
