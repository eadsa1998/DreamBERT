I am a traveller carrying one light bag and looking for a place to spend the night. I do not have a lot of money and someone suggests a place. We walk there to discover a hostel of a sort in a large indoor space big enough to house a gymnasium. I find a spot near a corner and prepare for bed. I think to myself, "Luckily I have my high-tech pillow." I take out of my bag a light, flat panel about 8 by 10 inches and the thickness of a thick piece of cardboard. "It works by applying a voltage.", I say. "There's a new kind of material which fluffs up when you apply a voltage." On the face of the panel is a liquid-crystal display with two "buttons", one labelled "on" and one labelled "off". I touch the "on" button with my index finger and the flat panel magically inflates to the dimensions of a fluffy pillow. I lay it down on the ground and comfortably go to sleep.
