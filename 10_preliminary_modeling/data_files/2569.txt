I am auditioning for a play. A woman holds a male black and white spotted cat in her arms. The cat is soft and sweet and affectionate. He licks her cheek, giving her a bath. I smile and hold out my arms. I've decided to cast this cat for sure. I hold him and pet him. He is so joyful to be around. I am very happy to have him. As I am petting him and aware of the softness of his fur, a young girl (woman) with short, dark hair auditions. I know she wants the mother part, but I've already cast that to another actress. I say, "Would you be willing to play the daughter part?" Her name is Kitty. She doesn't want to, but I know she'll change her mind later and it will all work out.
