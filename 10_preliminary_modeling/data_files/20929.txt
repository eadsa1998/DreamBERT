Puddleduck and a Kennedy or Eddy horse was running the same day. I was playing them at a $100 and I had a feeling they were going to win. I saw the entries in the paper. The horse with Puddleduck was Mike, milk, mursing. I was eating bananas in the fruit store. I was carrying something under my arm. Jack J. said, "Don't drop it or touch anything with it." I crawled into a hay loft after him, then he was in the yard and I took the two pieces in my hand and said, "Why is this so important? I can't touch anything with it." He took it from me and handled it roughly. It was something that brought people back when they were about dead. I thought of my brother Joe. Rose was there and she razzed me how I was carrying the object. I was looking at the mountains. It was cloudy or fog. Then it cleared and my vision was clear. I saw snow. And I looked at a peak way far in the distance and could see a large tree. I went over the Hilt's shop. I thought of a bull chasing me. I would go into the shop and he wouldn't get me. I went into the shop. It was barren empty. A boy came in and I said, "What you doing here?" and he asked me the same thing. I said, "I am partner and have a key. " I go into the next room and I see a gang of people coming in. They were going to have a party. I looked for my shoes and found them. They were the old oily shoes I worked in by Hilt's. I was at Mary Drular's. She had a small blond baby. I played with her and took her out was to baby sit. I was to go to work, but I didn't. I said, "I'm too tired," and it was late at night.
