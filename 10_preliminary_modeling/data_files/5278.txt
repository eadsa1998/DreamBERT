I dreamed that Sue and I were going to some party and it was really exciting because Lou was going to be there. But all the awful girls weren't. So it was a really big deal for some reason. I had this long discussion about it with my parents. I showered before I went out, but I hit my head on the faucet. I fell over and couldn't go and was really upset. Then I woke up.
