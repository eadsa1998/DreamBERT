A had a job on a ship - actually it was a small ship that sat on a much larger one. The small ship was like a ferry that held private parties. I was working as a barman on the deck. Suddenly there was a storm, and we all had to hold on to something to stop being swept out to sea. Later a party did take place. There were several fairly glamorous people there including a black woman who was dressed very elegantly It may have been the opening of my uncles's play.
