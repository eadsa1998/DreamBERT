I was teaching at the same university as Doctor Pi was. I had attended one of his lectures. I had gone to talk with him. We were having a nice conversation as were walking outside. It must have been winter as I was wearing winter gloves. I decided to take them off, but I don't know why. As we walked, he was rubbing one of my hands. When we arrived back at the lecture hall, I sat near the back, or top. It was a huge hall. I made my way to the end because I wanted to sit off by myself since I was just there to observe him teaching. There wasn't much room. He was talking to the class and then began singing. He was singing a love song. As he continued to sing, he started walking towards me. Then he walked up to wear I was sitting and stood right in front of me as he continued to sing, while looking only at me. As he finished the song, he reached for my hand. I was touched and flattered, and embarrassed. I felt very attracted to him. One of the students made a comment about not paying to be sung to, or to sit through him singing a song to one individual. Doctor Pi asked the student if he had just criticized the university that he represents and works to teach him through, or if he was just having a bad day. The student then looked embarrassed and said that he was having a very bad day.
