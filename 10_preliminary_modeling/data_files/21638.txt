I had a whip. It had a lot of tails. Another man had one also. I said, "I'm going to whip you." He just laughed at me. I had a hard time untangling the knots, but I got it loose and I cracked the whip. Shy, our dog, was loose and I said, "Who let you loose?" and he said, "Mother did." I was in a shanty that had all kinds of old rugs and clothes all over, piles of it on the floor. I was buying something and the clerk was measuring the wood I was buying.
