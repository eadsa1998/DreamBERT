I was suppose to meet my Godmother's daughter who is seventeen downtown at 4 PM. I apparently left the house in plenty of time, but when walking to the bus I kept stumbling and it seemed like I couldn't walk. I saw a number of buses go by and I thought I probably would have to wait a long time now that so many buses had gone by. I was up to the corner finally when I saw the bus coming slowly yet when I started to hurry the bus began to go faster, and I kept running and calling for it to stop, but it didn't. I was still trying to reach the bus when I woke up
