I'm painting my bedroom, using three shades of peach. A light shade on the ceiling, a medium shade on the walls and a darker shade on the trim. Someone is helping me. I'm very excited about how it turned out. Aunt H and Aunt P comes and looks at the room. Aunt H just smiles and doesn't say anything. I can tell Aunt P is not happy. As they walk away I realize that this is not my house and that I've painted a room in their house without asking them. I go to find them and am apologizing profusely. Aunt P doesn't seem to respond at all. Aunt H just smiles, as always. I tell them that I will repaint it right away. back to what it was. I tell Aunt H that I don't know what happened. what's wrong with me. I can't understand why I thought I was in my own house. I'm very upset by this.
