I had just returned from a trip and had accumulated a lot of mail.  My box was up high, on top of some others, and someone else had to climb up and check it for me. There was quite a bit of mail, and 8 or 10 pieces were from Ron Nadner-notes indicating he still couldn't tell me his new address.  Each one was the same, simply saying, :Still don't know."  Another letter had been opened.  It was from Brenda Trask, and the person giving me the mail said it was the saddest letter he had ever read-but that the good news in it might balance out the bad.  I never did read it.
