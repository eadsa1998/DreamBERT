 I am with my co-workers, the chicken catchers from the early crew. We have guns. I have a .22. They have shotguns. Some of the guys are shooting clay pigeons. Somehow, a clay pigeon flies towards me, and I'm afraid I'll get shot. I wince. The catchers yell to me, "Smother it!", or "Kick it!" They want me to go right up to it and shoot. There is a huge bull there. Ironman, one of the catchers, comes up to me. I think he is going to tell me how to shoot. I protest, saying I'm a catcher and that I don't shoot guns. But he says, "Look, Kenneth..." and continues to give me instructions on how to catch chickens. <br/
