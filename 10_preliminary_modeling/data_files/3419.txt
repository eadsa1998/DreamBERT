I am outdoors and cooking some stew on a burner of a stove. Or my mother is and I go stir it. Clothes are laying all over the stove and I am trying to get them off the burner so they don't catch on fire. Corinne is talking about something. She says, "Communication sure is hard." I agree and say, "But it's worth working it through." Then my mother says, "Then I suppose I have to tell you (Corinne) what Sue said." I can see they are going to have a hard time working through this without getting angry at each other. I try to help out. I then look up in the sky and see my father hang gliding. He does it every day, for his health, like exercise. I lose sight of him and then find him again and wave. Then I see the sky is filled with hang gliders, hundreds of them. Some of them are landing in the huge river in front of the stove.
