Three bells or breakfast rang and we went into the dining room but the girls were still setting the tables. I saw a plate with two pieces of bread on it and said, "That must be mine." Took it and went to the toaster but it was gone. Girls said it had been taken away. There were hot rolls but I complained that I preferred toast.
