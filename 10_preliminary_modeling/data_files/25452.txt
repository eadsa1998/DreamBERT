 I'm sitting outside of the south side of Major Hall at Brimson with my friend Stephen Ramos and another older man. A tour or prospective freshmen comes along. One woman looks like my high school classmate Kathy Branch. She is wearing a hat like the Lindy Schadling hat that I have been wearing. I say, "I have that hat." Her father says that he doesn't actually have the lure. Someone says that they found something, which may be a box. Cute acne girl from Brimson is in the group. She says, "Goodbye Kenneth Hanson." I am surprised, and say goodbye. Stephen, the man, and I sit on the steps. Someone or something hopes for a rock. I talk about a degree, a Psy. D. from Stanford. There is a woman who has worked 40 years on trials with California men, after working at Mills Fleet Farm.
