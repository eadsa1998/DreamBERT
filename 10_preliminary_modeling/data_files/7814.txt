I was sitting in the back of church during Mass. I was falling asleep. There was a man standing in the aisle next to me. I think to keep me awake. There was a woman saying Mass. She had shoulder-length, black hair, parted down the middle. I get up to go to Communion. The people in the rows in front of me weren't getting up. Just as I got in line they got in front of me. The lines were all messed up like people not knowing where the lines were so I kept finding myself out of line. When I finally made it to the front, I was now a male priest rather than a female.
