I am floating down a river alone on a small inflatable raft. I lie on my back admiring the scenery on a bright sunny day. Underneath me on the raft are various personal items including towels, shirts, cans of drinks, and a portable radio. As I slowly move from where the river is narrow and thick with vegetation to a wide open stretch, I listen to the radio which is playing a sad Country &amp; Western song about a heart-broken cowboy. The radio is buried in the pile of clothing and is apparently sinking lower and lower into the pile as the music becomes more and more muffled. Nonetheless, I hear the words of the song quite clearly: the song ends with the cowboy telling his former lover, "Maybe tomorrow I'll love again, But I won't be at your door."
