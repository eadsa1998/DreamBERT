 I'm with my friends Stephen and Jose Ramos. Stephen has long thick tightly curled hair. Some of his hair is orange, and the rest is dark. Jose may have orange hair too, but it is shorter. They joke about butt sex. I have a partial erection. Jose asks me if I have a broken leg. I say no. I learn that they are going hunting with our friend Bubba Hacker. I'm going too. I hurry to prepare. The hunt will be video taped. Many others are participating in the hunt. Bubba is already ready. I hurry to get ready. I get dressed. Female teachers and staff from Carter School are outside with guns. One gun looks like a big double-barreled over-and-under shotgun. It is gray with a blunt end. It looks powerful. I'm uneasy about having a huge hunting party like this. Bubba and others chase birds as part of the hunt. A bird flies by me. I try to kick and hit it. By accident, I kill the bird by sticking my foot out. I feel guilty, because the bird is very beautiful and colorful. I didn't mean to kill it, I was just joking around, I say to my mom. I go inside a different building. My advisor Mary Monroe, sister Heather, friends Tim and Niles Zelling, and others are there. There is a basketball tournament occurring. There are many younger people there. I'm playing on Tim and Niles' team. We play 2-on-2 with a substitute. They won their first game, for which I was absent. We now play Utah. We should win in the tournament. I get a drink and bump into an acquaintance, Bill Dinks. Then I see another acquaintance, Ben Reynolds, in the bathroom. There are many kids their age around.
