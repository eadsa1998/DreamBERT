I dreamed that I went to the movies with some M-- friends during the afternoon. We had to go to the Balcony &amp; we kept climbing flights &amp; flights of stairs. The odd thing was that at each landing there was a candy or popcorn stand &amp; I kept insisting that one of my friends was hungry &amp; that she get something to eat. When we finally found seats they were in a single file &amp; we had to sit one in back of the other.
