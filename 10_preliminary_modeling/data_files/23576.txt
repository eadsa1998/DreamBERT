I walk up to this man who is working in a food court. It's bright, greasy, and hot. He is overweight, dark-haired, and wearing a striped shirt. He doesn't seem to notice me. There are three paper glasses of water on a glass counter which is about the height of my shoulders. I throw the largest one at him, but it hits the back wall and splashes water. The fat man continues to go about his business. I throw the medium-sized paper cup and that one goes through the window. The smallest cup finally gets his attention. He doesn't seem disturbed by the mess that I created, but he isn't too helpful and tells me to try someone else. There's a woman in a dingy, small, yellow room/office. SamÕs life is to be terminated a year after we've been married. I try to explain how terrible this would be. I love him, he is a part of me, and by killing him she would also be killing me. She explains that Sam volunteered to be terminated. She goes on to explain that this is part of an environmental project to help reverse the overgrowth of population. I feel myself getting more angry, and I'm yelling and crying. Sam is there and she looks up his name in her book of volunteers. First she finds a Mary and Sam, but they are a mother and her ten-year old son. Then she finds SamÕs name. What if we go away? We'll find him, she tells me. Sam can go either way on this -- if he lives, fine; if he is to be killed, then that will help the world. Anger and hopelessness. Sam and I are alone and I scoop up some type of mush or soup from the Hopi Indians.
