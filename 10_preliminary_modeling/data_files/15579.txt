I just got back from our holiday and later that day/night we were leaving for a trip to Africa. Ms Solomon was at this outside deli thing and saw me and asked how my rabbit was and I said it was dead. I was using the same luggage for Africa. Dad and Ezra were there. Then I was watching Castle and Castle and Beckett slept together once and she got pregnant. They decided to keep it and then they got married (or seemed like they already were).
