Three friends of mine-I can't remember who they are-are discussing our basketball plans with me.  They want to know if I would rather play during the day then in the evening after work.  I tell them that for me, that would be much better; I'm not sure why.  I know I mentioned that it would be easier to find a court free then.  I tell them that if I were working, I could not play during the day, because I would get too sweaty, and it would take me a long time to have a shower and get cooled off to start working again.
