I dreamed I was working in a department store with people I had gone to high school with. During my lunch hour I went to a library with my girlfriend (21 yrs.) to get a book out. I had to walk uphill. In the library I found a book which I needed for a class at some school. It was a reference book so I hunted for another copy. The book seemed to be about King Arthur, but it was only to be found in the F. room. Along with the books were also pots and pans on the shelves. After working we waited on the corner for the bus. I saw among the group two fellows who I knew very well and were good friends in high school. They admired my engagement ring.
