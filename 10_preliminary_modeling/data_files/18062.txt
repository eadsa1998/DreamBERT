My cousin John had a cat and it had kittens and he said I could keep one but unusual things happened while I had it and John was still at the house. My bed got bigger and bigger and higher and higher and robots came down the street and all sorts of wacky things happened. One day the cat that I took, I left it in the car because we were going to see a show. Mom found a good seat, but she was right next to a man so I couldn't sit next to her so I went into another aisle and I got a comfortable seat and when the show was over I forgot where my mom was so I went out to the door and she was right there. When we got back into the car the cat was right there at my seat. We got back home-everything was fine-even the cats and John said I could keep all of them.
