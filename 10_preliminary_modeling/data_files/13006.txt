Hiro (Heroes), Joy (My Name is Earl), a guy called Randy, Jason Lee and I were on the run from the cops. First we were at this park. It was just me and Jason Lee. We were running down this road and the cops were behind us and this dog appeared in front of us, so we ran down the side street. Later, we were all at this cafe. We ran off and stole this car because we had to leave the cafe. There was a 4wd type of car and we had to hotwire it, which Jason could do. We got to the car as the cops pulled up. We kept our heads down and got in. This had happened before, but Joy had looked up and this guy had seen her and described her. So I told everyone to keep their heads down, especially Joy. All of a sudden, the cops were after us. Joy had looked at a guy because he had brown hair. The car we were in had a tracking thing, so when we were lots of traffic, we got out and ended up at this place with all these Soylent Green-y things. We were hiding under them. Jason got shot. There were other people there and I was letting them carry me along. I got carried to this place with squishy balls and I dyed my hair black. Poppa was there and he didn't recognize me. There were stripper girls near so I pretended to be with them. Somehow, we all got out, but by this time Hiro was dead and Joy was now Cate Blanchett, but looked like Claire Danes. There was a foggy road in the forest. Randy was going to kill us. I was like "You're going to kill your own brother?". He said it was his fault. I said it was all our faults. He ended up not killing anyone. The cars were going like 120km/h. We were dodging the traffic. Later, we realized this black guy who had once been with us, was going to kill us. So we left to go the airport. We were driving down this road and this bridge thing which was over the road, got wider as we got closer. In the airplane, I was holding Jason's hand.
