Someone had used up all of the wet wipes. I was very irritated by this because I had only had it a couple of days and already they had emptied this. There were a lot of people in this house. I think most of the people were leaving. I think they were headed to GC. I decided to go with them. I was packing or whatever, planning to go with them. As I was doing so it occurred to me how long we would be gone. Maybe it meant we were going to be gone over the Holiday. I stopped packing and was rethinking my decision. I was trying to decide if I really wanted to do that. It might have had to do with the fact that I wasn't sure if I could take a week off work. I am thinking about going to a week long retreat in January and there is also a weeklong training in California that I'm thinking about attending. I probably can't take both weeks off. I've been debating about which one to attend.
