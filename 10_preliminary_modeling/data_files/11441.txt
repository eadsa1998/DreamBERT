I had been arraigned for a murder of which I was innocent. A former friend of the family could prove this as well as provide a lawyer for me. He refused to do so either because of a dislike for me because I had turned out better than his own son or because of a previous argument which he had had with my father. He claimed that he couldn't help me because I had had an intimate sexual relationship with my girl. At first I wasn't sure whether I had done this or not. Later I realized I had, but it seemed very conclusive and important that she was not pregnant as a result of it. I was then awaiting the actual trial and again pleaded with him for help. He refused me again.
