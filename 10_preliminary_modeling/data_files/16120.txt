I haven't been able to remember my dreams in a while. But I had one last night, and I dreamt that I had drawn some pictures. One was of a green guy that was supposedly Dad after he slammed on the brakes. I drew a picture of Mother Mary, of another girl, and some other figure -- I don't remember. And Mom had put them in a folder in the computer with a digital camera. She had taken a picture before her and saved it to a folder. And Dad and I were working on some animations that were in a program like a slideshow, like PowerPoint like we used in Mass Media last year, where you click on one and you see one after another after another like a slideshow. [laugh] And Dad and I were working on adding some animation to that, and adding a piece of MIDI music there and s that they were going to do a remake of the "Titanic." Oh, before all that, I happened to be riding a bike, the tandem, down the street without the front. [laugh] But anyway, we were going to remake the "Titanic" movie, and there was this lady going to show it, and she said that she wanted me to sit on the floor right up close because there were going to be kids come and sit behind me, right up close where the TV is and she was going to show some movie about the remake. And next thing I knew, I was down at the sea wall of Oceanside and I was standing on the little ledge down below where we used to jump off of, and there was a boom box on top of the sea wall. And I was getting ready to jump into the water. When I turned around, and I turned the volume of the boom box down some first, and then I jumped in the water and there was this inflatable ionic column floating around in the water that I grabbed hold of, and then I was swimming around and somebody was saying how the main thing in the movie is volume and how to visit their website and all.
