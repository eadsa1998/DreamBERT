 I'm at a hotel. I'm riding up an elevator with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, Annie's mother Tamara and sister Tina, my friend Emerald Reinhold, and Emerald's mother Abby Reinhold. I ask Annie about her trip to Germany. She says either that she doesn't have a German name, or that she doesn't have a name except in German. She and her family get off the elevator. Emerald and Abby get out on an upper level floor, which may or may not be the one I get out at. I am drawing the alphabet on the carpet with a pointy object. I draw small letters, A through H or I, and then go back and draw larger capital letters around the small letters.
