I have been recruited for some job.  I am walking with a general and another tall man.  First it seems like in a culvert  I know that Jeff is involved too.  I ask the general, "do you know Jeff, the short man?", and hold up my hand to my neck.  "He is my ex-fianc√©."  The general says, "well, you two will be living and working together on this project we're putting you on."  I say, "you're having us live together?  What if we have sex, how could we help it, as close as we are.  Aren't you concerned about that on the job?"  Then the general says to me, "And the next time you talk about someone else, why don't you just look inside yourself, do some introspection, instead of comparing yourself to others, or comparing other people."  He was chastising me.  Then we are all three in my kitchen here.  I go up beside the tall man, he is really tall, big, and bald, but nice.  I sort of jump up to him, his side, and he picks me up and swings me around playfully.  I realize how much I liked discovering I liked a tall, big man in Lynn.  How Lynn got me to really like that, not short men anymore, how he totally changed my desires in that area.  And got me over hangups in that area, expanded my likes, so that I loved his bigness, his maleness.
