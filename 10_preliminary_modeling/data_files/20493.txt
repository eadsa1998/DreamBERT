I was walking with a woman about my mother's age. She had a picture in her hand which she said I must have torn from a book I had at home. I told her that I did not tear the page out, and the page she was holding must be from somewhere else. She was very upset, and I felt frustrated because I could not prove to her that she was mistaken. I was carrying two books.
