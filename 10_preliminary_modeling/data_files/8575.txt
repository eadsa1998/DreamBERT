Bev was talking to one of her children as they were shutting off my snooze alarm for me. It went off at their house the same time it went off at mine. It was set up this way so they could help me make sure I didn't oversleep when I had to be somewhere at a certain time. Each time I hit snooze at my house they would shut the alarm off at their house. We did this about three times. Bev was explaining to her child why we were doing this, and why she wasn't doing anything else when the alarm went off. She explained that if it was serious something else would go off or she would receive some other kind of notification that she would act on. I was wondering about all of this, trying to figure it out myself - as though I were awake. Then something else happened and I realized that it also happened at her house and that is what would make her do something to help me wake up.
