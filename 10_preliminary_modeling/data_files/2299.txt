I am young and kissing my beau. He wants more and I sense it. I say, "Do you want more of this?" He says yes. I say, "I have to go to the bathroom and think about it. Really." So I go into a bathroom and sit on a toilet and pee, and then I walk out to him and hug him, kissing him passionately and say, "Yes." He is so happy and we walk arm in arm, really connected and in love. We pass Jake and Valerie all dressed up and walking together, Jake's arm around Valerie. We are at the Hilton. I smile at them, but they don't respond. I say to my guy, "Maybe she didn't recognize me because I'm standing." She then comes back and says, "Hi." We all walk together. Jake and my guy used to work together and Jake has made it big. He gives my guy 90 (0?) percentage, which pleases him. We walk out past a display in a museum where we see Basaltic rock columns rising and falling. The narrative tells us that that's where the Killer Bees live and thank God, they are disappearing so there's less bees. I see two naked men tortured by being covered with these bees. One man opens his mouth at their command to let them in and out. He is in extreme pain. It is horrible. The bees stored honey in his nipple. I feel sick and walk away. [BL]
