Matthew moving. Bill F was helping. They came in while I was napping. I couldn't wake up fully. I got out of bed even though I couldn't get my eyes open. They started moving things out to the vehicle. Because I couldn't wake up and see what was going on, Matthew decided to take a number of my things. Bill F just went along with him because Matthew had convinced him that I wouldn't mind. When I finally woke up, they were gone. I was so angry with him when I saw what he had done.
