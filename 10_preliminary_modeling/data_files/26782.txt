 I'm at the Redding farm. I'm in the southeast corner of the house in the baby room or in grandpa and grandma's old bedroom. I may be masturbating, or be about to masturbate: there is a sexual feeling. My brother Wally is there. I go upstairs in search of pornography. I walk in the upstairs hallway. My uncle Dannie Redding's old bedroom is barren. The hallway is dim or dark. Bats fly out of the small room across from Dannie's. There are spiders covering the walls and floors. Some of the spiders are large: bigger than my whole hand. Others are the size of a lemon. I only see the spiders when I get a glimpse of the light in the area, out of my shadow. I'm wearing gloves. I feel surrounded by creepy crawly critters. I crawl out of the area, brushing the floor as I go. I feel anxious, paranoid, and claustrophobic.
