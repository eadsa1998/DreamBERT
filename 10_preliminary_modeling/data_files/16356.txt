I was at school again and after class -- it was like the last day before break -- and after class I went to this ______ restaurant called Ceasar's Pizza with Linda and some other people and there was this band there and they were all like singing and having a good time. And we each got one of these little pizza things where you rip off a piece of crust and you scoop some stuff, and that's how you're supposed to eat it. Well, I finished that and then Dad came to take me home and it was flooded. I mean, we were practically swimming through the parking lot; the water was up to our chest. And in some cars there was water like halfway up the doors, but with ours somehow we were in a lower area, it was like only a little bit up to the tires, I guess. And [laugh] the funny thing was, he started backing out and maneuvering out with the door hanging wide open, and he said that he was going to honk real loud to make sure he got all the way out of the radiator, which I don't understand. [laugh] And I don't remember much more; I think that was it and then I woke up.
