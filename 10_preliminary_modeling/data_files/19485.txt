First episode takes place at top of Kent's hill in my hometown. I am standing on east side of cement sidewalk probably watching for a train. A girl or young lady walks up behind me (to my right). she is carrying a child, perhaps 2 1/2 to 3 years old on her shoulder. Sex of child uncertain, but probably male. The lady cranes her neck this way and that, apparently on look out for some person. The child is now being held by another girl who is standing next to wooden fence several steps or yards to north of my position. The baby falls from a fence post, head first into the area of the pasture, it's feet sticking straight upward and its skirts up around its head. Lady next to one calls my attention to the child's tumble, but makes no move to pick it up. A lone engine approaches. It is a small, 10-wheeler remindful of a switch engine. It starts and stops like an auto, and seems to operate silently -- possibly on rubber wheels. The head light is low down.
