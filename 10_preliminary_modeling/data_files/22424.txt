I remember this dream very vaguely: The surroundings were in the university. There were problems because things were being looked at from only one point of view. Then I presented another viewpoint which was totally opposed to the previous one to see if things would get better. The problems continued. Then I tried to get them over their opposition to each other by searching for unity, something intermediate.
