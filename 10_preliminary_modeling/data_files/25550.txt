 My friend Hilary Nano is frying potato chips in oil. The large metal cooking bowl that I used at home is there, and the bottom is filled with oil. I put some chips in it to cover the bottom. I take some of Hilary's chips. She notices this and is annoyed with me. I put some of them back. She adds some of the chips to her cooking pot. The chips fry and end up like a pancake, all stuck together. I try to flip the chips over with a metal spatula, but they don't flip well. Hilary divides one of these pancake-like structures into parts, cutting it up with the spatula.
