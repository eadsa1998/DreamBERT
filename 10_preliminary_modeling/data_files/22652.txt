We were all together (my family, my relatives and I) in some residence. the gentlemen were playing chess and the ladies were sewing and knitting. My brother and I were looking at the view from the windows, when we saw a group of armed men who seemed to want to kill my uncles and we started to close the windows and the doors. Everybody was scared and armed themselves to go against them. When the group of men saw the resistance, they retreated.
