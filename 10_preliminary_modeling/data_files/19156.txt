Cattle ranch. Before I went to bed there was a little pen with cattle in it, and this morning it was open and all the cattle were out. The pen is 5-sided and it's about shoulder high. It's made of long white boards. I asked the owner if he thought this was bad that all his cattle were gone. He said yes. He had only 6 left out of 75. My wife was with me on the previous day or preceding the loss of the cattle incident, we had gone out and seen a ranch which was a rather flat thing with a few hills around the horizon. The owner of the ranch was a friendly older person, female. This pen the cattle were in, originally it was packed full of cattle, just shoulder to shoulder, almost level across the top. Of course, in the morning one whole side was down, and the cattle were all gone.
