I'm in a house. I notice the ocean or some huge body of water is rising. I leave the house to look. I have several babies with me. When the water touches us, we are unable to break away. The water gets one of the babies and I have a hold of its feet and pull hard. I manage to save it and then must struggle to save myself. I manage and walk toward safer land. I lay the babies (3 of them) on a chair under a tree and call to Lydia to watch them, saying to the littlest baby, "We'll just have to see her." I go back to save things: a suitcase of clothes, books, my writing. I vaguely feel guilty because I'm only getting my stuff. I send Lydia in to get hers.
