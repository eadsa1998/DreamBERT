Betty (Ugly Betty) was on an island. She was sitting on a flat, round wooden thing, that was like a swing over a pit. This guy came on to sit and said it was safe to drop. I think she dropped, but couldn't get out. Amanda (Ugly Betty) was saying that Bad Ronald was real and was trying to show Betty. Then I was there trying to get through a jungle. There was some sludgy sand and I thought it was quicksand so tried to get out. It was really hard to lift myself out of. I met up with some others. Granma had lived on the island all her life. There were photos on a computer and it said who was going to get them when she died. Some of them were for me, but I changed them so they were all going to me. Mary Lynn Rajskub had pictures on there and they were really ugly. Someone's father was dying. His son was with him and he was sick. The father was lying down and they were waiting for this black girl to come back with some bandages. The son decided to kill his father and put his hand over his nose. He was crying and there was blood everywhere for some reason. Then the girl got there. Haley (One Tree Hill) was his girlfriend. She was there too. Then I was at a table/desk and lots of other people were seated around it. Eugene was on the other side and I was trying to take a photo of him, and was covering the light on the phone with my finger. He was then James Lafferty and I took a photo and he was smiling his crooked smile. Haley made a face at a girl which was funny. Then she made a face at my camera opening her mouth pretending to put her mouth over it. She laughed. Michael Emerson had been credited at the beginning of season 2 of Lost although he didn't appear "until one month after". I was thinking that I didn't remember that.
