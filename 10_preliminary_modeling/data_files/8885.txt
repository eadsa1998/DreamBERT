I'm in a store looking at fabric swatches. I had been to another fabric store. One store offers free swatches but the other one doesn't. I think that not offering free swatches probably causes the other store to lose potential business. The store I'm getting swatches from is just cutting very thin strips off of the end of the bolt for the swatch. I'm okay with this as it is really all I need. I'm driving down a tree-lined road thinking that whenever I'm on in this road it seems like all of the traffic is going in the same direction that I am. Just as I finish that thought one car approaches me from the other direction. For the first time I realize how narrow the road is and I wonder if there's enough room for two cars going in opposite directions. I have something like a Ziploc bag laying on the front passenger seat and it has crayons, or something like crayons, in it. I'm taking bites off the ends of them. They are supposed to taste like the color they are. For example the peach crayon is supposed to taste like peach. The purple crayon is supposed to taste like grape, etc. At first I think they taste nasty and I quit and take a bite from something else. But then I decide I need to stay with the crayon-like things. They have something to do with why I was getting fabric swatches.
