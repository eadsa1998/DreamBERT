I'm walking down a road that curves to the left, near a park - it's open where I am, then a hedge-wall on the left (or isn't it growing up a short underpass?), then the park - there's a car coming - I think I know who's in it, but in any case I'm friendly to them, and mean to get out of the way. Rather than moving to the side, I walk faster - the car is moving slowly - and then I find I'd like to run. I'm wearing a skirt and wedge-heel sandals (like my old navy ones) and I thought I wouldn't be able to run in them, but I can, and I run round the curve to the park. There are a lot of people here, and they're putting on a play. However, the play isn't on a stage, it's in the park itself. Most of these people are acting in it, and they're scattered across the sidewalk and onto the lawn. I can't tell exactly what's supposed to be going on, but it's obviously an outdoor scene meant to look colorful. Reminds me of a couple of production numbers in "Oliver!" The players are dressed in some (fairly stylized) period costume of that sort (the "Oliver!" sort). I am more or less in their way as I go through them - I have to bob and weave a bit - but nobody gives any suggestion that it bothers them and no attempt is made to stop me. Since it's a public park, I think they must expect it. After I get through them I go on up a little grassy hill to meet my "boyfriend". He's sitting in the driver's seat of his car, parked up there, near an RV. I go up to the back of the RV. He's waiting for me, we're going to go somewhere else in his car, but I have to do something first. I have an object in my hand (I must have gotten it from the back of the RV, I haven't had it before) - it's a circle, tubular, orange, and probably plastic, maybe 8" in diameter, and it has a clasp or join of some kind, like a necklace would - the thing is twisted open and I'm trying to bring it back together and hook it in place.
