I was with my mother in a Latin country. We were in a night club. My mother took some phonograph records upstairs to sell them. A man said it wasn't allowed. I was worried about getting into trouble, but my mother came downstairs and said the woman upstairs said she would keep us from getting into trouble. We went outside. Shrubbery was around the building. I became nostalgic when we passed someplace that reminded me of an emotional and spiritual experience in the past. We met my sister. A black cat appeared, and we were nervous because of the bad omen. The cat had a head like a dog. We petted its head.
