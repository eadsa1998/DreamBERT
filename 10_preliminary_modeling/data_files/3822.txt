["Where's my meds?"] I am at work. My office is a couch in a hallway. I suddenly realize that the woman who assists me hasn't been to work for days. And therefore, I haven't been taking my daily medicine that I am supposed to take. A woman from down the hall comes over and I ask her what happened to my assistant. She says she doesn't know. It is lunch time and she invites me to go have lunch with her. We walk down the block to a small conference room. It is open to the public. I sit at the conference table and several other women come in and join us. One of the women is my assistant. I am surprised to see her and she says she will be back into work tomorrow. She takes me into another room and hands me two bottles of my liquid medicine. I drink down a small cup of the red medicine. I wonder if it was harmful not taking my medicine those last few days.
