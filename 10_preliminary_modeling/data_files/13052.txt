I was on the net. I had emails and one was from Classmate-F-08 and I sent one to Gavin, but he was called Gavin Howd. I was going through my old emails and there were some from Valerie, which were all about Runescape. Gavin replied and he said that he got "13, 3", which was a good level, for something he'd written about himself for school, so he had sent me that. He liked Oldboy.
