In my dream, I lent a library book to a man, and he hadn't turned it back to either me or the library.  The greater portion of the dream was beating him up.  Part of the dream was receiving a letter from someone I talked with online.  Pictures of his family.  He was bald with long hair.  The children were about 4 and the girl was a newborn.
