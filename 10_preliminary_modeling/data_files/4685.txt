["Darryl manipulates."] Darryl and I are sitting in a car seat or a bench. We are young. He is kissing me. I am very excited and attracted. I am thrilled he's attracted to me. I want this relationship a lot. It is sweet torture. Then I am living in a 2 room tree house. My rooms are in the large roomy trunk of the tree,. We just got married. I have dinner ready and I am happily waiting fore him to get home He arrives and then hangs out with some male friends down in the basement. I finally go find him to see why he hasn't come to me. He's laughing at me and I see lots of boxes of rifles and guns. He has no interest in me, never has. He was manipulating me to see if he lure me into doing what he wanted. I am hurt and shocked. I rerun the kissing scene and see how cold and calculating he was. I am heart sick. Now I and one of my daughters are at a beach. We are wading in the ocean. I am concerned about the rip tide getting us. We struggle back out of the water. Now a murder mystery is happening. Beautiful women, Vegas show girl types die one by one. A man is thrown a dynamite stick and he grabs it and tries to run out the door with it to protect the others. He's not fast enough and it blows him to bits. Now all the employees travel in a group as self protection. They are trying to figure out who is killing them. I suspect it is the policeman. One by one, we die.
