I was on a train in my nightgown. There were two men in observation car. I thought I'd better get dressed, turned to look for ladies room but then it was my berth I was looking for. My berth was filled with others. I rang for porter and asked that they be put in other cars. He said that my berth was in 3rd car ahead. He took my arm. We passed thru compartment car. I have my arm around him. Thought this wouldn't do for if a Southerner saw us, the porter would get into trouble. When we found my berth, a family with children had strewn articles all over it. I began tossing them and told them to remove them so the dresses would be less mussed.
