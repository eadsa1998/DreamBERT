I was watching the performance of a symphony. I was sitting next to my mother. The stage was brightly lit and the musicians were sitting in one corner. They were dressed in brightly colored costumes. The background was yellow. The conductor appeared in a very unusual pink costume, like that of a ballet dancer. The performance was also unusual, for instead of directing the orchestra in a conventional manner, the conductor danced and in this manner conducted the musicians. I thought the performance was beautiful and I said I thought the conductor was very clever and talented. I felt enthusiastic and happy. My mother said in a very disgusted tone, "He's a nigger. do you mean you approve of him?" I was angry and hurt. I hit my mother on her knee in a restrained way and I said, "Oh mother, you always spoil things."
