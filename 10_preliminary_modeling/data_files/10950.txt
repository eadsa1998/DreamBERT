I received a phone call from a boy in his twenties, whom I used to date. He asked me to go out Saturday, but I hesitated and reminded him that I was engaged. He said that didn't matter and that he just had to see me. We went out into his car from our dormitory. Then the setting faded and I was only aware of the two of us. He kissed me and begged me to break the engagement. I kept refusing, each time less sure of my reaction. I thought I was in love with him, but yet I wasn't certain enough to break the engagement. Finally we were in a crowd of strangers and the rest of the dream has evidently been repressed.
