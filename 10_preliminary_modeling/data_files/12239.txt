Mom gave me and Ezra these fluffy rings with layers. We could teleport to exact addresses as long as no-one was watching. There were seven sheets. I went to this house which I thought was from The Ring [but it was actually The Grudge]. There were cops next door and they had lots of doors. There were these puzzles and I kept losing.
