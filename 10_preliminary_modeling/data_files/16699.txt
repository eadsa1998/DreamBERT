I was going to fly to Jackson in the winter time because I think Mom was already up there because Uncle Larry was either having health problems or had passed away. And I was in the airport and I was just thinking, "I have to get up there," and I was calling them to let them know I was coming. And they were already starting the boarding call for the plane and I think I was sitting at the gate. And I hung up, they were keeping me on the phone even though I was trying to get them to let me go, I mean keeping me on the phone. And I was crying because they said Uncle Larry was having trouble, and so I was running through this door and onto this thing that I thought was the plane. And then I realized it had posts in the middle like a trolley car or like a subway, and it was a tram train, and it was a tram train taking me back to like another city or something. And I was really upset because I was like, "There's no way I'm going to catch this plane in time." And then I woke up.
