I was at 'school'. I needed to find something I'd left behind on Monday, but I couldn't remember what I'd had last that day. Eventually I remembered it was chemistry and I was walking away. Ezra was staying behind for a study thing. Somehow I ended up in this class with other people, including Calvin. The teacher said girls who didn't take "mith" in Year 10, had to take it now, but I had (because of Runescape). Daryl found out that I had liked him and he said he liked me. I was trying to avoid him and I was annoyed that it wasn't Eugene. Porky was in her cage and she was still alive, which I thought was odd. Then I was at university and I had a text to meet them in a toilet -- it was Daryl. We left and went to some cafe place, but it got blown up. We were dressed in bear suits and went back to this other place. We had to clean it and wear these tight shirts. The lady called me fat.
