I was flying around up and over fences and then I was showing off by flying up and down the street. As I was flying, I thought, "Am I just dreaming or is it true?" Audrey was so old-looking, she was ugly. Her shape changed and she was slow like an old woman. Red was courting his girlfriend's sister and Audrey was jealous, I could see. I got married to a young girl. I gave her a kiss and hug and she did thrill me. I held a hose and a plug from a whistle in it and then when the steam came thru, I wanted it to make a whistle, but it blew out the plug. I was bragging to some young fellows how they walk to work slow and tired and then I showed them how snappy I was in the morning. I saw glass or class as winner in the paper.
