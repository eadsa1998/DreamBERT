It's night. I'm in a bedroom similar to backpacker guesthouses in Asia and Central America. It's made of concrete blocks, not well lit, somewhat grim and spartan. I can't sleep. I have to make sure the door is locked. I get out of bed. In Spanish I say, "Hey buddy, what's happening, man?" I turn the doorknob and am surprised that the door is unlocked. When I press against the door, it feels like someone is pushing back, but it's only the wind. Still, I'm fearful. I wake up.
