People were coming to live with my boyfriend Jeremy and I.  Old people from college- I think my old obnoxious roommate Chelsea was among them, though many I didn't recognize.  There were really about eleven people total, and it was just too much.  We still only had one bedroom, and after one day, I was feeling cramped and regretting the change. I went into the bedroom with the phone.  I closed one door, but forgot that there were two doors to the bedroom, and someone came in while I was trying to talk to my mother.  I was frustrated; there was no privacy.  Then I remembered- it wasn't legal anyway.  My name was on the lease, and the manager said that if anyone stayed for more than ten days it would be an extra $25 per person per day.
