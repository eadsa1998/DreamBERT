I had dreamed that my sister was in an accident and had injured herself severely. She had come home with a broken leg, arm and dislocated hip bone. She was all bandaged up. My mother, brother and I were shocked seeing her in this condition and as we heard what had happened, I had burst into tears because she was in such a terrible condition. We had not heard anything about it til she had come home, so it was a shock. The participants in this dream were mother 50, brother 27, sister 24 and myself.
