I'm going to a party. I'm going with a man much younger than myself. His mom is going to drive us to the party. She does not approve. I feel a little silly. He says, "Don't worry, when she's left, we'll have a good time." She watches us. As we near the house where the party is, I hear talk about a boy that deliberately does things improperly to get attention. He's always getting in trouble. I think, "Oh, he'll grow up." I see people arriving for the party, uni house kids. They have presents and food. I am empty-handed. I feel embarrassed for that and also because I'm older than they and so I feel out of place.
