 I'm at Carter School. I'm cleaning up the floor outside the secretary's office, picking up and sorting paper scraps. I pick up plastic bottles in a bag as well, and put the ripped back into an intact bag. I do grunt work. I play minesweeper. My friend from high school Simon Naver is there. He wants me to hit a mine. My grade school classmate Eric Stoner is there. They are in front of me. I challenge them. I punch one of them, and then the other. They don't retaliate. I rip off Eric's skull, tear his jaw off and rip it apart, rip apart his skull, throw it on the ground, stomp on it and crush it, eradicating it. It feels great to do this! I feel free. The Beast of Fury has been unleashed within me. I am with my sister Ramona. I'm flooded with ideas and memories of dreams. I say that it is more dream than I can handle. I ask Ramona to help me write it all down. PERM is an acronym for something self-destructive.
