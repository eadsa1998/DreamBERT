["Flying wheelchair."] I am in a large building with some people. I think I am speaking there . I want to travel down the hall and I discover that if I pull back on the joystick, I can make my wheelchair fly. I don't go very high, just barely over the heads of people. Then I go a bit higher so they can't reach up and touch me so I won't be in possible danger. It is fun. We are at a University. My female personal assistant and another speaker named Tim are there. We have to stay in a motel room for the night. I discover they got me into the room area by dragging me up some stairs, leaving my wheelchair behind. I am upset with them. Tim is arrogant and considers himself a better, more professional speaker than me. Now I am frosting a cake with white frosting. It is a rectangle cake, one layer. I call them in to have tea and cake with me. I decide on the small old tea cup like the kind I collected as a teenager. It has a crack in the bottom but I want to use it anyway. I worry I'll get tiny shards of glass in the tea. Tim is tired and grumpy. It's been a long night. We go do our presentations and return. He and I are both a bit depressed. We did OK but it was not our best performances. We commiserate together. I say sometimes you just are on and it goes great, and sometimes things just don't feel as good. He agrees. We drink tea.
