["Trouble presenting my dream program."] I am trying to make a presentation of my dream program at an important conference. I am stopped by a guard demanding where my registration is. I search in my purse for the papers. I finally after effort find the envelope and realize I never sent it in. The check for the fee is still there with the form. I hand it all to the guard and he lets me in. I go to a room and am trying to load my dream program on their computer. They have some resident program on the screen already, some scene of buildings and people. I can't get the my dream program window to load up. It is very frustrating. I try a number of different ways. I ask some men who are standing around curious. They want to see my dream program. I ask them to see if we can get another computer or monitor. They try to find one for me, but no luck. I finally figure out how to get the images up on the wall so everyone can see them. But they aren't the right images. More buildings and people, not my dream program. I am frustrated.
