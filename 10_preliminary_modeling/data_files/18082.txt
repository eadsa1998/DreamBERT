I was outside and we lived in the country and then this wolf came along and me and my friends all rushed into the house. And then it started to rain and then after it stopped raining me and my friends went back outside. And then we saw the reflection of a rainbow. Then we looked up at the sky and we saw a beautiful rainbow and then we went onto the Titanic and then a few minutes later into the sea. The Titanic started to sink and the top part started to go up because the bottom part was sinking. So I jumped off and was in this other place and I looked out the window and there were all sorts of boats but there was a storm going on so lightening struck a rope that held one boat, but there was nobody in the boat, and so it went out into the sea and started to sink, but two other guys tried to save it by standing on it. So they went under water too and then this lady had my classmates with her and they were going from one place to another. I had a hard time keeping up and doing whatever they were doing and then it was time for a drink, but we couldn't get one. So just from a little water stream thingy it was almost filled, so there were waves in it and we drunk out of that. Then we went to a ladies house and she said to try these kind of cookies and she said they were called scream puffs and she said they're crunchy and hard with cinnamon on the outside and puffy and soft on the inside.
