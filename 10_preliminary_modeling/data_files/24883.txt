I was at Great America with a friend. We were walking around and found a cool-looking roller coaster. I was really scared and I didn't want to go on it, but we got on, and we started rolling up a huge hill. Right before we plunged down, I woke up. Setting: Great America. Characters: Just a friend who I know. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I was really scared because the roller coaster was huge.
