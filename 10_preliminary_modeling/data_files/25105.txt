 I'm on the north end of Mud Lake in my boat with my friends Nate Nelling and Emily Zates. Emily is steering. They want to sit for a while before we go. I say okay, and tell Emily to go the middle of the lake so I can cast towards the shore. It is windy. She is having a tough time controlling the boat. I try to give her instructions. We finally get turned. I toss out the anchor, and tell her to stop the motor. We keep going. The anchor rope goes taut. The boat capsizes. Nate and Emily are somehow in another vessel. I am struggling to lift the boat upward and flip it over like a canoe. I finally do. <br/
