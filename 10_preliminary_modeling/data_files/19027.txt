Prior to awakening there was no deep dream, just like thoughts, scenes idly passing by. Just before awakening I was myself standing sort of like in front of a mirror with self-evaluation, being self-evaluated. At first I was in praise, and then I saw myself for what I really was. In other words, it was a dejected feeling afterwards. I don't seem to be able to recall anything that was going on before or after. I safely can say I was awakened just after, I think almost immediately after this thought. I can't give any action that happened previously or immediately after this incident. There doesn't seem to be anything I can tie it in with, just like I say possibly an idle thought.
