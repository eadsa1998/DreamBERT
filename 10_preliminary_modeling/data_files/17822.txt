I had an interview with a company for an administrative assistant position.  I didn't get the job.  I talked to someone afterward and they told me to give them whatever the company wants.  I was given a second chance.  I let them swing me around limp, and I was hired.  At the end of the day I was asked to stay late- they were pleased with my work.  There was some sort of trouble- an earthquake or rebellion perhaps.  People left.  Somehow I acquired a gun.  I had to shoot a security guard in a rescue attempt.  I got out of the building with the head of the company right before the building collapsed.  I felt safe.  Society began to rebuild.  A new company was starting up by two inexperienced men.  Interviews took place in a kids' plastic ball pit (Like Chuck E. Cheese).  There was a long line to interview.  At the entrance to the ball pit was a dish of orange jellybeans.  I ate a few while waiting.  I went in for my interview and flirted with the men.  I lied and said I didn't like orange (somehow I knew they wanted to hear this) and they hired me as a security guard.
