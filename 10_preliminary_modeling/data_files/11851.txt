We were at this shop or something and this truck came along and there was this guy in it that said something and Mike (The Young Ones) jumped in the car and drove off and the license plate was "If you don't get this delivery, I failed". I told Dad or someone that he took Mike, and they found the car. Then Mike and I were about 5-8 years old and I was a little black girl. Then he was like "You saved me" or something and they hugged.
