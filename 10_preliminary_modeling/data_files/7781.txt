Matthew and I were at a Value City store. He was returning something and I was going to have my class ring sized. There was a long line moving very slowly. Some people cut us off. Mother was in the line standing next to me. She said, There's two lines. I said, no, there is only one line and that woman cut us off, and pointed to her. Mother let us get back in line ahead of her. The next thing I knew, Ola S was in line in front of me. She was very short. less than 4 feet. She was carrying on like she always does. When it was her turn she couldn't see over the counter. I took the paper that the clerk was trying to hand to her and gave it to her. When it was my turn, I asked how long it would take. She said she could resize the ring as soon as she took care of all the people in line. I was very reluctant to let her keep the ring. I told her that the ring is very valuable. The line was so long that I didn't think she would get to it before the store closed so I decided not to leave it with her. I thought I should probably take it to a jewelry store anyway. After I got out of line I decided to go look at rugs. They didn't have the right color for the upstairs bathroom. All they had was a rose color. I thought about how that would look. I decided that I needed one for the downstairs bathroom more. They had the right color but I was afraid it was too big.
