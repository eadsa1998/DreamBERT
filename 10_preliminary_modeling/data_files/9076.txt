I was working in a restaurant that served alcohol. All of the waitresses had one particular employee assigned to help them but I don't know what they did to help. I was one of those assigned to a waitress. I only worked when she did. Part of my pay was a percentage of her tips. So anything I did to help her get better tips helped me as well. She was involved in some bad situation, or with someone who was a bad influence, and authorities came to the restaurant to question her during our shift. They asked her for proof of something. She was going through her wallet but wasn't able to find what she needed or what they were looking for so she had to leave with them. Since she had to leave my shift was over as well. We didn't process her tips for our shift that day before she left. They were all in a heavy, glass, goblet-shaped water glass. There were some scraps of paper in there also. Mostly what was in there were paper money, though there was also a one-dollar coin and a couple of fifty-cent pieces. The dollar coin was much larger than in waking life, maybe even three or four times as large. I counted up her tips and took my 10% out, having two other employees watch while I did it so they could verify the amounts. I wondered if the employees who would be left there knew how to close at night but decided not to worry about it and go ahead and leave. As I was leaving I saw a manager coming in so I was reassured that it would be no problem. Directly outside the door a patron's car was parked. I walked along the driver's side of that car and around the back of it, while getting out my car keys, thinking that I was parked on the right side of that car. I looked up and realized that I was parked along the right side of the building.
