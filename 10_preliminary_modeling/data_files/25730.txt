 I'm sitting down reading. My black boots have funky tips with jagged edges. Several men come up to me and start trouble. I ignore them at first, but then react quickly and punch one man. There is a fight. Among the men fighting are my classmates Alec Johnson, Al Livern, and another man who I know from Brimson. We fight and punch each other. I escape. I am running away. I bite off the finger of the person chasing me and run for the fire escape doors near the end of the gym or field house that I am in. I go towards a baseball field where people are. I am then in an elevator with my friend Bubba Hacker. We are running from my friend Lance Drift and others. I jump down many stairs at once. I am in a locker room with a man who is looking for my friend Niles Zelling because he wants to hurt Niles. I pretend to help the man, but I really help Niles. The man is dumb. I talk loud so Niles can hear us coming and hide. At one pint the dumb man and I actually pass Niles when we are walking.
