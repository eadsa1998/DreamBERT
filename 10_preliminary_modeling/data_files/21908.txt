I was at a party with Ann and Judy. I met George Gedeon. We talked about our families. He had one daughter and I was not sure if he had two daughters and the three boys. Later we were with Elsie Lasko. We were looking at a derrick at a distance, which was clearing a way for some homes to be built. I later met May Speck. I called her over to another room and loved her up, but Ann came in and we had to break up. Later Ann went out for Judy, who was a ways away with other people. I called May over to me. She came and we embraced and she went into another room of a shanty like and lay flat on her back. I lay on top of her and we loved and had intercourse. She enjoyed it very much and so did I. Ann was coming back with Judy, so we had to separate again. May went to another room and I just went into a corner of the shanty and lay down to hide from Ann. She walked right by me with Judy and didn't see me. I was looking at a portrait of a man that was beat up. He had clothes and skin breaks on his face.
