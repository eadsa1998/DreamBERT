 I'm at a sort of dance, ballet concert, or recital. There are different student performers. Cash prizes are awarded. The grand prize is $25,000. There is a lesser prize of $1,000 and many smaller prizes. The performances take place and the prizes are awarded. The top cash prize is not awarded. One young Asian woman is angry because she should have received the prize of $25,000. In response to not getting it, she gets up and does a spectacular performance that involves her reflections in a phone booth-like structure. A photographer shoots photographs and marvels at the images that are created by the woman. The woman walks up and down the steps in dim or dark light. There are many supporting dancers on stage. The auditorium, which has been dimly lit, is now bright. My friend Matt Yams is on one side of me. My friend Stephanie Peterson is behind me. A ceremony has ended and a reception is about to occur. I stand up in the front row of the seats. I have gas, which I'm trying to hold in. Stephanie bumps and pokes me. I blurt out a little, but noticeable, fart. She is disgusted, and facetiously says, "Oh, nice, Kenneth." I laugh, feeling embarrassed, but also glad that I let it out. I hold in more farts. Matt talks to me about the color of a particular fishing lure: how to get the reddish color deeper or better, using small cube-shaped blocks of red. <br/
