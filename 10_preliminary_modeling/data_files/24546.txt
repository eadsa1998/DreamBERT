I was looking at the moon and another thing that kinda looked like a cutesie-poo sun. I was with my friend Anna L., and Rita L., her mom, but it wasn't really Anna's mom - it was someone who looked like her mom. And then Rita got transported to the moon and told the people on the moon to take a man who looked like Al L. (Anna's father) and transport him to the moon. So they went down to earth (the people on the moon) to get the person who looked like Al, but Al - or rather the person who looked like him - did not want to go. The people who came from the moon told the person who looked like Al that the person who looked like Rita said to bring him to the moon. But then the person who resembled Rita said that she never said that. But the people from the moon said they had proof because they had one of Rita's 200 earrings. And that was the end. Setting: Part of it was in a strange room, part of it was on the moon. Characters: One was my friend Anna - she is my best friend, and two people who looked like Anna's parents, Al &amp; Rita. Anna had blonde hair and blue eyes, her hair was medium long. Rita had short brown hair - she was wearing a blue shirt with orange pants. Al was wearing jean shorts and a red flannel shirt. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Maybe anxious. Wasn't that a weird dream?! It was very weird.
