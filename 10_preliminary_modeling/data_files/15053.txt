I was at university after hours (i.e., it was late). There were ladies checking for people. I said to one that I had to stay to check out a building. There was some experiment with these mice -- there were two of them and I had to hold onto this handle and shock them in the head? This lady marked all the tests and I got 51% and I was like 'lame'. This mouse was getting tired and the lady let them off. They collapsed and there were heaps of them running around. I called the mouse 'Gizmo', because it was like Gizmo.
