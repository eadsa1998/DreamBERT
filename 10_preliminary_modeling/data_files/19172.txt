I was sitting on the floor talking to Dr. Van de Castle about skin diving. This boy came in. I didn't recognize him particularly. He thrust a hot rod magazine in my face, and he said something to the effect that, "Look, this is my club" or something. "Here's a picture of us." I wasn't particularly impressed by this. I was looking at the magazine, and they had an article on brakes and how you stop your car on a long hill to test your brakes. I thought it was a good thing we don't have a lot of large hills around because I would probably have to buy brakes for my car. Then the scene changed. I was talking to my wife. I was arguing with my wife. She wanted to go with me somewhere, I forget now where I was going. She couldn't go because she couldn't leave the baby alone. She said the baby was sleeping and he wouldn't wake up. Apparently I lost the argument because she went with me. Then I woke up. I don't know where I was going. Hall: The boy of whom Sam speaks in the dream is about 20 years old, and Sam knows this boy. He's a rather obstreperous young man. The picture in the hot rod magazine showed this boy's club and he was in the picture. The article about the brakes pointed out that you should test your brakes on a long hill, and Sam thought, said, that there were no long hills around Miami to test on.
