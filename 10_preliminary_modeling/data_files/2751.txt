I'm on stage with the same group from the last dream. We are doing a play and in the middle of it someone says, "Wait a minute, I have to go get something." She leaves the stage and we are left with a long pause. We begin to improvise to stall for time. The audience is seated behind a house wall instead of a curtain. I talk chit chat for a while and then I go downstage and play on a piano. I start with Beethoven's 5th and play the Flight of the Bumblebee and other things with huge, loud chords crashing around. I was splendid. I am surprised because I can't play the piano like this. I peek over the top of the upright piano and wiggle my eyebrows at the audience and they laugh. I continue to clown and play this wonderful music. Finally the woman returns and we continue with the play. Now it's after and the group each has some things in their corner and we are sharing with each other what we have (talking about the things). Bob M says, "I'll just count my money now," and ignores us like he's bored and will do something useful for awhile. I am annoyed at him because he's choosing to not be a part of our circle. Hillary and I lean on each other and feel the same way. I see a beautiful wooden carved tea chest with teas in it. I like it and suggest that we can choose to trade with one another if we liked what the other had better than what we had. This was agreeable with everyone. I traded for the tea chest, and opened the little drawers happily looking at the pretty colored packages of different teas.
