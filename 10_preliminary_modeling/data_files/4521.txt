["Ernie is ill."] I am at a table with a group of kids who are rehearsing a play I wrote. One of the kids is a full grown Mirabelle. She acts her part, saying "He's mine, he's mine." Then walking over to another actor. I say stop. That's not quite right. I need you to say more and wildly pull at your hair. I keep thinking her name is Mary, not Mirabelle. Then I look out the window and see Ernie in the driver's seat of a dark green beat up VW bus. I laugh and say where did he get that? Ginny says a woman gave it to him, because he is ill and goes to Boise to see a special doctor (Dr. Arquette). I see then that Ernie looks plump and not well. I am glad to see him. I haven't seen him for along time. I hope he feels better soon. I wonder for a moment if the doctor was mine in S City.
