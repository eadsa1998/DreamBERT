I was at swim practice. My whole class was there. We all changed and went outside and got in the pool and started swimming. The pool was much larger than usual, and about 40 feet deep. I heard that my friend Louis was walking through the building, so I wanted to see him and I got out as soon as I could, but he had left when I got outside. Setting: At the pool where my team practices. Characters: All my friends from school and Louis, who was my friend from summer camp last summer. I haven't seen him since then. I wish I could. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, disappointed, frustrated. I wish I could have caught up with him in time.
