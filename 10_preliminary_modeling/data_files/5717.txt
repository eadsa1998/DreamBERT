[1997-05-28] I was in a mobile home, decided to go have a cup of tea, on the way into the kitchen, I got deluged with some water or something and I stepped in it and it sprayed almost up to my face and I remember thinking that I had almost hit my eye with it. I thought, did the dog wet on the floor, or, I couldn't figure out what it was, and then I walked into the kitchen, and I was in bare feet and didn't have any clothes on and I was walking around in there, touching the refrigerator, and the sink and I was thinking, "boy, I hope there's nothing faulty in here, nothing electrical or I'm going to get shocked because I was in bare feet and it was a tile floor, water on the floor. I walked over too the stove and put the tea kettle on and the electric stove on and was heating up the tea, and went back into the other room and all of a sudden heard this really loud noise, super loud, vibrating noise and at first I thought it was an airplane, I couldn't figure out what it was but it was shaking the whole house, and then it subsided and we never did figure out what it was.
