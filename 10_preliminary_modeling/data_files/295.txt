I'm in a bus, just got on, and I'm choosing a seat toward the back. This bus is rather old-looking, and broken up into sections (actually it's not a lot like a bus, but more like a train, with cars &amp; rooms, but not separated). I want a seat in the back because it's nicer there, more sunlight. Before I get settled, though, I want a drink of water. Around a corner there's a concession stand - actually a large counter, wood base and glass front, right out of the 30's or 40's, with a middle-aged man and his (wife? daughter?) running it. I thought there'd be a water fountain, but no such luck, and I don't want a Coke or anything, that they're selling. But I see that there's a dispenser bottle on one end of the counter - a black girl is using it (she's from a whole troop of ghetto-type kids that are occupying this side of the bus, bustling around the counter and being noisy) and I figure if you could get a cup without paying for it you could get some water.
