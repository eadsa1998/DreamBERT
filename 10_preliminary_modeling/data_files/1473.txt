A pregnant woman goes outside and trips and falls. A man helps her up. She is worried she's created a problem for the baby. I suggest we trade doctor's appointments. She agrees and goes to see Dr. A, a rheumatologist. I go to see her doctor. The nurse listens to my story and says, "No way." I point out that I had seen this doctor before. It would be o.k. A man looks at my files and says my duodenal system looks pretty. It's clear. I say, "I know. It's this other part that's not working."
