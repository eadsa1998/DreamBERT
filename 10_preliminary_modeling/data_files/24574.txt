At My school, there was this big humongous castle which I lay in but it was a pool. If you wanted to go inside the castle you would have to take a seminar. But one time in the dream, since the castle was my house, I had a sleep-over and we went swimming. Setting: My school. Characters: Tom (friend), Anna (friend), me, moms of My school (can't describe), and (someone who is) supposedly my friend but I don't know her. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I think it's a cool dream and fun.
