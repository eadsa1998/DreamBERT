I was at a video shop and there was something about a boy that had died that morning running, he died without people knowing. Ezra, Dad and I were at a hotel and had dinner like we did at Dracula's. The claw killed this superhero/villain dude. I put on his clothes and he took control of me. Before he died, he had been at a lair that had bubbles. He was scared of bubbles and suction cups.
