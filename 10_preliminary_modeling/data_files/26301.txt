 I go by the outside of a library, where my friend Melanie McDyss is talking to another person. There is a sculpture there: a piece of art that consists of different kinds of chairs lined up in a row. I see a train bridge, over the Main River. A woman is in the water swimming to her father to say goodbye. The father is leaving for one and a half weeks. When he gets back the woman will be gone ( I think on a study abroad program). I think it would be hard to say goodbye in the water.
