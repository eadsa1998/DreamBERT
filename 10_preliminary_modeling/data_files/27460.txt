I dreamed that the Society for the Blind had given my grandfather, who lives with us, two tickets to the opera M-- B--. They were not good seats for seeing the performance, but they were excellent for a blind person who could only hear the music. I very eagerly offered to take my grandfather, so that I could attend the performance because I was very much interested in music.
