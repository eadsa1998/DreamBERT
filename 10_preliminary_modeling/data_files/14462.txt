I can't remember properly, but Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Ezra, Dad, others and I were outside, during the day. I realized this and I asked Spike why he was in the sun. We were on the way to Nana's. He started to burn so we walked in the shade. There were two paths to take, one which had bush covering and therefore totally shaded from the sun and the other was a long way around and not shaded. I said we should take the bush path for Spike but they ignored me and went the other way, so I went up the bush path. I got there first. I went into the backyard and walked towards the kitchen. I saw a giraffe in there. Nana said "Oh there's a giraffe in the kitchen", like it was normal and I said "Yeah... because that happens every day,". Dad came next. Inside, there were photos on the fridge. One had two Jared Padalecki's, with a guy and a fire in the background. Spike and I were also in it, hidden behind the others talking to each other. I was like 'oh I remember two Sam's'. Ezra was like "good times".
