There's a man after me, my brother and sister, so we go to hide in a room and I can't get the door to lock, so I place a couple of dressers in front of the door. Everything is made out of wood -- the dressers, the door, the floor, etc. Then I somehow end up in a store which is also where I work -- the store is all jumbled up and a mess because they are remodeling. I have to scrape old paint off of the wood. I keep looking at my watch to see how much time I have left to go, because this is quite tedious work and I want to do home.
