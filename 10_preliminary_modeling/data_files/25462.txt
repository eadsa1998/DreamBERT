 I am doing a group project, working on a paper. In my group is a first-year woman I think is cute, Jackie Hunter. I am then either downtown Wilmerton or downtown Woodland. My friend Gino Teavor is jogging on a bridge over a river area, where I am. I think about asking Jackie out for coffee. Either she or my other friends are there. The bridge I am on is not a car bridge. There is a dam below and behind me. I might jump. I think I might land on the dam. I ask the person I am with, "Do you think Freud was a Darwinian?" I got the name (Freud) from a purple book.
