The other night's dream, the one I just said, had a bunch of silver things in it: a silver unit to play the tapes on, a silver recorder that Christina was going to record the band, and the band's amplifier was silver. It looked just like Mom's vacuum cleaner without the hose. And last night's dream was full of red things. I don't remember, I have no recollection as to what happened, but I remember walking in a red house and seeing red things, and having a little toy house that was red.
