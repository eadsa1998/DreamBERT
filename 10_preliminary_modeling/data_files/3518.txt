I have a lot of boxes and bags, of groceries and things. I see Curtis Salgodo and he's telling someone that his brothers have decided not to play with him any more as backup band. He'll have to go on alone or with a new backup band. I go up to him and say that I know he can do it, because many years ago, when I began my Masters program, I first saw him with the Night Cats (which should be Nighthawks). He begins to chat with me. I am very pleased, as I am a big fan and in awe of him. He is being nice and interested in me. He asks what my disability is. I say Rheumatoid Arthritis and talk about how I was walking then and danced all night with a brace and a cane. I realize I am building the story a bit, to get him to be in awe of me, or maybe feel a bit sorry for me and hang around a bit more.
