But where is my briefcase? I know I brought it. I go back to the door and find I had left it there. Return to the counter and find I had forgotten to bring my Christmas gift merchandise order and sample of something else I wanted. I'll have to return so take the bus back. It's getting late, almost 4 p.m., but I think I can make it before our early supper and so I go back downtown with forgotten articles.
