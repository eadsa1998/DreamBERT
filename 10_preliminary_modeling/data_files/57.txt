Woke up frightened. I come to my front door, find it open - don't think anything of it at first, then not sure, so I turn away and an arm grabs me from the opposite side. I croak "Help" as loud as I can but it's not very loud and though I know there's people to hear me I'll have to shout. I try to breathe and call out but I can't. I know I've got to do it soon but nothing comes out.
