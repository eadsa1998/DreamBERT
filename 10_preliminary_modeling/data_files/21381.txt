I saw or heard 109. There was some kind of puzzle or picture in the newspaper which you could work out or I could look it up in my books of knowledge and get an answer for it. The prize was in the hundreds of dollars. Red said I got it. It was #10 if I'm not mistaken. I put it on the floor beside Terrie and she was going to pounce on it, but I said, "No, don't you touch it," and she was tempted but didn't.
