I'm just going to the bathroom, I've got a skirt on and I've pulled my pants down, when I hear somebody coming up the steps. I think it must be James, so I leave my pants on the floor and go toward the front door. Before I can get there, it opens - I didn't leave it unlocked, it must have been picked. I yell, Who are you? What do you want? - that sort of thing. He looks at me like I'm a petty annoyance. He looks around like he's deciding what to take or something, and his only response to me is sneering, like, "Go ahead and scream - nobody will hear you." But I do scream, knowing that if Tom hears downstairs he'll come out, and maybe others. I manage to get outside and dash down the steps, screaming, help, help, robber, or something. There are some people about, and it takes a few seconds, but they start to pay attention. The man comes out, startled apparently, and makes as if to run away. I start calling out description - he has light brown curly hair, a hat, baggy brown jacket, etc. He looks confused but still trying to be arrogant, makes some threats like, I'll be back, don't you worry. There's a little crowd gathered now, and they look like they'll be all over him if he tries anything. I'm very grateful but still angry. [He goes off in a vehicle, and apparently I chase him, because I encounter him somewhere later, but that part's gone.]
