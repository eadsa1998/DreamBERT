I moved with my mother and sister to a new house. I told them that we should have moved from that house right away, because there was no tree in the yard. The yard was so hot and sunny. I experienced a deep feeling of regret for having stayed in the old house so long. I felt a hollowness in the pit of my stomach. Later I told my mother and sister that the patients at group psychotherapy had made light of my grievances.
