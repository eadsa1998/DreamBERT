I am supposed to go to church camp again, with Mrs. Riddick and a friend of hers-a really cute girl my age whose name is Moot or Mooch, or something like that.  When we get there, everyone is in the mess hall.  When we go in, I see Uncle Joe, Aunt Wilma, Doug and Suzanne.  I hug Aunt Wilma and Suzanne and shake hands with Uncle Joe and Doug.  They say they will only be there for a couple of days, on their way to New York.  I go over to talk to the girl, and I find out her address is 307 37th St. (in my hometown, I guess).  She won't tell me any more.  She says she is only especially interested in one boy.  I tell her I know what she means.  It seems she does like me, though.
