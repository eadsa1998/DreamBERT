I'm rinsing my mouth with water. My mouth is full of water and I'm heading to the bathroom to spit it out. Mary comes out of the bathroom and I spit the water out at her feet. She looks at me in surprise (and disgust, anger?). As soon as I do this I realize I have done something terrible and I begin to apologize to her. I immediately kneel down to wipe up the mess, all the while apologizing. I'm so sorry for what I've done. I see Mary only for the instant when she came out of the bathroom. I see the surprised, startled expression on her face when I spit out the water from my mouth at her feet.
