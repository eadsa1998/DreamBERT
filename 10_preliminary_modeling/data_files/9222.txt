Al H had reopened WDF and hired Tim W to help him run the company. I'm not sure why I went to the office. I leaned inside the door of a large room. There were quite a few people there. I turned to my left and saw Tim W. I was very pleased to see him and said, Tim! He was standing there talking to someone and looking down at something. When he heard his name he looked up and saw me. He nodded his head in response but didn't say anything. I was disappointed at the way he responded to me. [He was quite a bit shorter than in waking life. But he was over six feet tall in waking life, probably still close to six feet tall in the dream.] I took a few steps into the room. Al H walked in to my right. I turned and saw him and said hello. He seemed more glad to see me than Tim W did, which somewhat surprised me. I probably didn't greet him as warmly as he might have liked. I was involved in discussions about setting up the office and setting up processes and such for how things would be done this time. Marcia N also came back to work there, as did Polete U. [I had a great job interview the day of this dream.]
