Chuck and I had been out on a date (Chuck, the boy I used to go steady with, 23). We were coming home and it was quite late. For some reason we have to stop at his house. I believe we were deciding where to go to eat and decided to go to his house instead of a restaurant. I was hesitant about going in but nevertheless did go in. He woke his parents up as I feared we would do. First his father came out; him I remember seeing very distinctly. There was some conversation between us, all of it very vague. Then his mother came out. Both parents were somewhat cold and indifferent to me. Then two girls, supposedly his sisters, came out. He doesn't have any sisters. The two girls were girlfriends of mine, two sisters. We then left and Chuck took me home.
