I must have had too much rootbeer or something last night. Well anyway, I dreamt that we were at somebody's house -- I don't know whose -- they had a pool though. And in an effort to scare me, they put a bottle full of YooHoo, they made it in a plate with black ice and then they put a fork and knife behind it like the cross bone, and they put that out by the pool. And then all of a sudden we were at our house and Dad was laying on the floor sleeping, and I thought maybe he wasn't breathing or something. And Mom was like, "Call 911!" And so I called and was talking to the dispatcher and I was doing okay until I came to the symptoms, and I just kind of froze and I passed the phone over to Mom. And we were laying in the bed in the dark, and by the time Mom was finished to them, while she was still on the phone, the guys arrived. And it was Colin Hanks, Walter Overton and some other guy we know. And then next thing I knew we were in the hospital and we found out there was nothing wrong; he was just sleeping. But I was all distraught over the fact that he was going to crab and complain as to why did I call when I didn't need to. And the doctor who took time out of his schedule to check him out and see if there was anything wrong rigged a sound board in front of somebody's yard, like a booby trap, knowing that I would go up to it and check it out. Well, he rigged it so it would go, "Whoop, whoop, whoop," and so all kinds of sirens and "yoo hoo" and stuff when I went up to it, but somebody we know cut the wires so that didn't happen, and I went up to it and I checked it out in this person's front yard, and I turned it on and it started doing what it was supposed to do. And there was like this live concert that I was mixing in this person's yard, as I faded into consciousness.
