I was upstairs in our house in my room. My cousin was with me. She was going to go downstairs. I didn't want her to go so I took hold of her wrist. She couldn't get away so she took a syringe and needle from her handbag and went about giving me an injection of some drug that would make me loosen my grasp. She is a nurse and knows about such things. After she gave me that shot I got weak and let go. I stood up and it seemed that I fell back on the bed after having passed out for a minute. Then I awoke.
