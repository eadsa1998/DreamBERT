I'm with a group of women at a place we're staying maybe like a retreat for vacation. Somebody has stolen something, I think, and very slim evidence points to Jean Yocum (or somebody, at least an older woman), and I think somebody else. There's a scene in which the group accuses her/them and says she/they have to go. I'm rather put out at this because there's been no attempt made to prove their guilt, not even to give them a chance to say if they did it. At some point I've gone someplace or been distracted but I have plenty of opportunity to speak up about it. I keep "rehearsing" what I'll say the way I do in real life, and never get to that point before the dream ends. After the accusation scene breaks up, I go into the bathroom to gather my stuff, and either something spills or there's a puddle on the floor for some reason, and I gather things up. I'm sort of packing things up to go myself.
