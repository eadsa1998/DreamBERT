I and another person, maybe a woman, perhaps Dora, are moving into a new apartment. It is small and empty of all our stuff. The wall is covered with a blue foam pad-like substance to prevent nicks and so on. The woman bumps it and causes a big hole and wrinkles it up. Now the landlords are going to be upset. The woman trowels some putty stuff into the hole and tries to straighten up the wall. I go through the door, which is glass and wood frame, to the kitchen area. We have some glasses and that's about it. I come back to the living room and shut the door, pulling a chain to shut it. Then I look out the window, which is small and a bit high up. I see we are on the shore of a huge body of water. The waves are big and choppy. I see lots of high-rise apartment buildings along the shore. It's not all that pretty. As I watch the waves, a huge one comes up and splashes on the window. I am surprised. Another one does so. "Hey, we need to move," I say. The woman doesn't agree, "We just got here, and our furniture isn't here and it will be fine." I am adamant. I cry out, startled. She says, "What?" I say, "Never mind." I thought I saw a huge wave, but it was just a big building across the way. Another wave hits. Water splashes inside a bit. "This will ruin everything inside," I say. We have to move. So we do. She is reluctant. I am now traveling down a skinny, curvy road toward the town in a van or VW bus. On one curve we are going too fast and we nearly run off the embankment and crash, but we don't. I scream for a second and then calm down. I hope the next car in our caravan doesn't crash on that corner.
