 I'm with others in a forested area. There is a suggestion to use pages from some magazines we have as bait, and to add scent to try to attract animals. I look through a magazine aimed at the teenage girl crowd. I think there has to be a good picture to add scent to that is not plain. There is a two-page picture of a woman, viewed from the side, an all fours. She is partially naked, and her butt is raised in the air. The picture or advertisement has something to do with butt sex, and that is what it reminds me of.
