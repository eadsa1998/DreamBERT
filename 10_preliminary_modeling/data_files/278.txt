I'm in a bus (school-bus type) with Jimmy - he's driving - it's dark and the road is wind-y, goes by a creek, with a nice bit of green bank and trees between, lower than the road. It's been raining, and might again. We're not travelling so fast as all that, but the turns are coming faster and tighter, so Jimmy's having a time keeping up. Well, here we go anyway - off the road, there's a turn he knows he can't make, so we're off onto the grass, and he's trying to keep from running us into the creek. This bus has a lot of momentum, so we have to do quite a bit of swerving and changing to keep the sucker out of the trees and the creek and maybe come to a stop or get back on the road.
