I am seated in a classroom. It is a course in Beginning German. Our teacher is a woman (face unfamiliar). It is the first day of class. The teacher is speaking to us in German. (I don't understand her.) All of a sudden we see a man running past the window. He is carrying books. The teacher attempts to attract his attention, but fails. He comes into the classroom a few minutes later, wearing a shirt. I seem to recall that he wore a baby's bonnet on his head. He takes these clothes off or, at any rate, I later recall him as wearing a business suit. His features are very clear (face unfamiliar to me). I particularly notice that his teeth are not nice. He and the German prof. discuss the possibility of opening up another German class. The teacher again talks to us in German. The words are very long. I do not understand her. The young man leaves and says goodbye to us all. (Forgot to mention that I laughed almost hysterically when he came into the room. I remember the tears rolled down my cheeks.) In the second part of my dream, I seem to be near a football field. I am looking for my boyfriend, but cannot find him. The scene changes to the lounge of the dormitory at O. S. U. I am sitting on a striped-chintz love seat. My housemother comes into the room (aged 60). At the same time I see a girlfriend of mine being helped into a car. Someone says she is being taken to the Dean's office. My housemother approaches and asks me for my notebooks. She says the Dean is looking through all girls' notebooks to see if they have loud sentences written in them. I give her all but my psychology notebook which I fear may have some obscene words in it. I look through it, but find nothing. I see my boyfriend (age 20) and tell him what happened. He tells me he thinks they were wrong for doing it. The third phase of my dream took place in my living room. My boyfriend and I are seated on the couch. He attempts to kiss me, but I feign indifference. He calls my bluff and we kiss.
