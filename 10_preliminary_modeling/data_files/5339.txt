I dreamed that Ben wanted to climb Mt. Everest, and Riley and I had to help him, but we didn't know the way. Then I was in a mall trying to buy a dress, and Mr. Stipps wanted me to babysit my brother that night. I went into a Godiva store, which was three stories, and I stole all their chocolate. I went and tried on jeans, but they were huge. Then I remembered that I already had jeans at home, and woke up.
