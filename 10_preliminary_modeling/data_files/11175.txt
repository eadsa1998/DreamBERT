I dreamt I was in a beautiful swimming pool in which there were only girls swimming. Everyone was an expert swimmer or diver. It was as though there was a swimming show, for each girl seemed to have a special feat to perform. It seemed as though they were swimming and diving for a very long time. I wanted to join in the pageant, but I seemed spellbound. Suddenly something happened and I was in the midst of the aqua group. I knew just what part I had to do and I did it.
