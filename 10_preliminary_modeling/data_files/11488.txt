I was climbing a steep hill or mountain. My wife was slightly ahead of me. Suddenly she stopped in her tracks and when I caught up with her, she was extremely nervous and afraid but for no apparent reason. She was unable to continue the climb so we started down. Thereupon I myself became fearful, again for no apparent reason.
