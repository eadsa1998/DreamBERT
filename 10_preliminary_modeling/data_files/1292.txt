A small kitten follows me everywhere. It is intense! I am annoyed. It won't leave me alone. I decide it has to die. I put it in a cupboard and put a gas pellet in there. I notice there are some rabbits in there too. They are in plastic bags. I pull them out. The kitty is trying desperately to get out. I shut the door. After awhile, I notice that there is a white mist in the room and I realize that the kitten has put the gas pellet in my room. Coughing, we escape outside. Later, I hear that cousins Patricia and Terence are getting married. I am concerned, after all, they are already brother and sister. Then I think, "I guess it's O.K. They are really just cousins."
