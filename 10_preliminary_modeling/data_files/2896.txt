I am moving around in some kind of dance that moves purple colored sands around in patterns. After I am done, someone says, "How very beautiful a voice she has." Someone else (male) says, "Yes, we all have beautiful voices. But after they become aware of it, they change and can't do it as well." I feel like saying, "But no, I can continue to be beautiful after I'm aware." The man says, "Well, I invite you to partake of a new game. This one is going to be finished soon." I don't want it to be finished, because I do it well. He wants me to move on and try something new and challenging.
