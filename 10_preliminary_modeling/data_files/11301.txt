I was in the dining car of some sort of a train. I seemed to be on the way with a group of my father's friends to a football game. (I had that feeling and the men in the car were warmly and roughly dressed.) I was standing at the entrance to the car watching a group of the above-mentioned men eating at one of the tables. A drunk staggered down the aisle and began an argument with one of the men. A fight was narrowly averted and the next thing I knew was that a huge blond man was standing at the opposite door of the car and hurling baseballs with tremendous force at us. (We were covering on the floor.) I was not hit but was terrified.
