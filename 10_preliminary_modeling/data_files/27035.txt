I was riding on a bus with some other girls. I can't remember who any of them were, but I believe they were all from M--. I don't know where we were going or why, but it must have been a fairly long trip for we had to stop off for two meals, lunch and dinner. Each time, after we were in the cafeteria and had our food, I discovered that I had left my money in the bus, and had to borrow it from somebody. I can't recall anything about the bus ride. I just seemed to know we had been riding, without experiencing the ride itself.
