I get a phone call from a man trying to sell me a modem for my computer. The connection is very bad. I can barely hear him. The phone I hold has a round ring of lights that light up when it rings. A woman's voice says: "Your phone is ringing. Please press 4." I may not have pressed the right button or something but the guy's voice keeps cutting out. He's a rude and insistent man. I say to him firmly, "I'm not interested" as well as a confused message that I can't hear him well or the connection is bad. He says, "Shit," and tries to keep me on the line. I hang up on him, saying to my woman roommate, "Boy, he sure isn't good at this." She says, "Come out here and look at the flowers growing on the porch." I am annoyed. I'm very tired and sleepy and it's hard to walk, but she wants us to share some time together and the flowers are a way to do that. I allow her to push or lead me out, even though I don't really want to.
