I was walking down a street with a group of boys and girls all my own age. In the distance I could see a building. This building was queerly shaped, the roof coming to a point. There was a garage attached to one side of it. I said that the building should be used for the rec hall because it was much nicer than the present rec hall. One of the boys in the crowd said that that was impossible because there wouldn't be a 50-foot clearance. I asked what a 50-foot clearance was needed for and he said because of playing basketball. I became rather confused since I knew they didn't play basketball in the rec hall.
