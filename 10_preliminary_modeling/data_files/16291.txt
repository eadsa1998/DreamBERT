Somehow I got pregnant, but not by making out with some guy. I think Mom took me to the doctor and had an egg implanted in me or something, and I got pregnant. And I was going to have a baby that was going to be just like me, so that when I grew up and was out of the house, she would still have a Jessie to raise. [laugh] And so we were at the beach and I was going to have the baby in the salt water to make things a lot easier and to make it so I wouldn't have to go through so much pain of labor and stuff. And I started having the baby and the head popped out, and I was asking Mom, "Does my body naturally push or do I have to act like I'm going poop?" And she said, "It naturally happens," and the baby was starting to come out and we were going out deeper and deeper into the water. And then when the baby's body started coming out, it was like really, really painful and Mom was like lifting me up to the top of the water and putting me down in the water, and lifting me out of the water and putting me down in the water, thinking that it might shake the baby out. [laugh] And then the baby came out and fell down to the bottom of the water and was going to drown, so we pulled it out real quick and we raced up to the shore. And there was a whole hullabaloo going on up there. I don't remember why though. And there were these clowns and things running around, and we got out and showered off like nothing happened, and then we were going back to the water. And this woman was there, and she said, "Is that....?" I had to tell her that this baby was Mom's granddaughter, and oh, it was weird, and I don't remember too much more.
