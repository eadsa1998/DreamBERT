 I am in a class. We are making iron deficient tea. People in the class drink the tea. No one likes it. It is difficult to swallow a couple gulps. I quickly drink my whole cup of tea. It doesn't taste that bad. The tea is supposed to turn hair and skin green. I see this happen in other people. One man tries to drink a lot of the tea. He can't swallow it, and spits the tea out, laughing.
