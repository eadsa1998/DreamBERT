Today I dreamed that I got together with four friends and we went driving in my car. First we went to the beach. We went to the shore and walked without shoes along the shore. Then we went to a nightclub to drink. Then we went to a large gambling room and started to make bets. We really laughed a lot. Among the people who were betting, I saw a very beautiful girl who was alone. I parted with my group to go to where she was and we started to talk. Then we went to a dancing area and danced a long time. I felt attracted by the girl, but at the same time I was thinking about my girlfriend. Then I remember I ended up with this girl in a house of ill repute and there we spent the whole night.
