I was going somewhere to play baseball with some people.  It was out a country road, and we were walking.  We passed some guys playing ball on our left.  There were plain fields on each side of the road, and it was sunny.  We had come about 1 mile and had come to the place where we were going to play, I think.  I decided to go back and get some water.  I went home and got our old red jug and put a couple of trays of ice cubes in it, which filled it considerably.  There were also a clear plastic fork and spoon, and between them and the ice it was rather hard to get the lid on.
