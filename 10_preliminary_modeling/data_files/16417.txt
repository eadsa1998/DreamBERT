Dad and I were at the park reviewing psychology, and we found this bench to sit on, and there was this dog that was laying near the lake, just laying there and seemed just exhausted. We threw him some bread and he ate it, but other than that, he didn't want to move. And then these other two dogs came running down the sidewalk, barking and yelping almost in unison. And they were just going over to that other dog, going to terrorize the heck out of him. And I stood up and yelled at them and ran them off, and they had collars, I think, because I heard them clinking. And Dad got up and went off and ran after them and he came back and he said he caught one of them and he had it in a covered box. And he said he was going to report the owner to the SPCA or something. And then I think I woke up. That doesn't make any sense at all.
