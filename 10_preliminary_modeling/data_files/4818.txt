I am at a beach. We are looking for a place to build a fire. After traveling (walking) for quite a while, we find a long sandy beach with a cave. That seems to be important. So we begin to build a fire. Small twigs and wet grasses we gather from the beach. I find a small branch maybe 4 inches in diameter. Then someone adds papers. We light the fire. It goes well. I was worried the wet grass would make the fire not work. (Something about a case of Pepsi.)
