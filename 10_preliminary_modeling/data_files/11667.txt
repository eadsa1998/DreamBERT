I dreamt that I was walking along a street when I suddenly realized I was in the army. I could hardly believe it when I realized that I was in the service. It did not seem to agitate me very much except that it surprised me. I thought to myself that since I was taken from college I should be an officer. I looked at my uniform and saw that it was a second lieutenant's suit. I became very pleased and began to whisper to a passerby that I was a bigshot. The passerby seemed to be shadowy and vague. I began to get hungry and I thought I would go up and eat with the general. I walked a little ways until I came to a white building and I went in. There was a fat man about 50 sitting in a chair (the general) and a sergeant about 30 was cooking breakfast. The sergeant looked just like a bartender that I know in my hometown. When I told them this they began to laugh.
