 I'm sitting around at an outdoor cafe. Some people there are on two opposing teams. One man is shot, and he disappears into thin air. A man on the dead man's team shoots a flame out of his gun, spraying the crowd. All the opposing players that are in disguise disappear. There are two or three of them.
