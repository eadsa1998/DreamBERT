I went with some other guys to a mess hall to have breakfast.  Maybe we were in the military, but I don't remember any uniforms.  There weren't many in the mess hall, and it was pretty dark.  There was kind of an ominous feeling.  Someone said that another guy from our unit or group had been mysteriously killed; apparently there had been others.  Then we saw a couple of yellow parachutes drifting by the window, and for some reason we took it as a sign that someone else was going to be killed.  When we left to go to another building, on a city street, I thought I would be safe, because I only had to go about a block and a half, and there were a few others with me.  On the way, though, we encountered a group of guys who reminded me of guys I had known in high school, though I don't remember anyone in particular.  They stepped into my path and then surrounded me.  One of them hit me in the back.  I thought if I was tough enough they would let me go.  For some reason I even tempted them to hit me.  I tried to hit them but couldn't get any force behind my punches.  I wasn't really very afraid.
