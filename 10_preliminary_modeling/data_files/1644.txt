I find a bird feather-shaped earring hanging caught on a zipper loop of my jumper top. It is Lucy's and I say, "Oh look, here is your earring." She says, "Oh, the other one had a break in it, a 'line,' and I think I threw it away." I said, "Look. Maybe you still have it." Merle and I are going down a hill.
