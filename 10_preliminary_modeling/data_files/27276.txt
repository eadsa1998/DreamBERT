I dreamed of a circus - made of sequins and rhinestones. It was all exotic colors - no plain blues or yellows - but magenta &amp; chartreuse &amp; aqua - I watched a merry-go-round - all dazzling &amp; glittering. I seemed to be far off and seeing - just enjoying watching - and not darinng to go closer.
