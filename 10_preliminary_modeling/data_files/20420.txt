I was a patient in a hospital waiting to be released. Someone was collecting the letters that patients wrote on hospital stationery. They never did that before, and mine wasn't written yet. I would only have time for a few lines to my sister, but I guessed that she wouldn't mind, because I had been home and broken my habit of writing regularly anyway. A young boy about 15 was staring at me as I held the letter in my hand. Later I was walking outside the institution with two boys about 7. We went through a chapel where the pews were being moved sideways in preparation for Benediction. Then we walked through a crowd, and I accidentally patted a young girl on the belly. (She was about 15.) She gave me a friendly nod and I nodded back. After we passed her, it occurred to me that she may have thought that I was flirting with her. We came to a place where some benches were against the wall. One of the boys had to urinate, so he undressed and urinated against the wall. I told him to move to where there was a gutter at the bottom of the wall. It was the wall of a building. I held his penis for him and guided the urine toward the gutter. The touch of his organ excited me.
