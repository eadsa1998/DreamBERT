It was Christmas morning and I was kind of lollygagging around, giving Mom and Dad a chance to put presents under the tree. And there were Christmas lights strung all over the stairwell for some reason. And I was searching frantically for the tape I wanted to record our Christmas on because I want to record it on a tape, and I was searching frantically all over where I keep tapes. And then I woke up, so when I woke up, I realized the tape I was looking for was right on the edge of my dresser so that I wouldn't lose it.
