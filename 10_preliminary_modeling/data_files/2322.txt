Howard is visiting and sleeping in Ellie's room. I am moving photographic enlarger equipment around. He gets up and, out of politeness, I ask what he'd like for breakfast, feeling annoyed that I'm the only one around and have to do it. I list pancakes, eggs, toast, and he smiles and says, "Thank you." "All of the above, eh?" I say and sigh. I go to the kitchen and am cooking waffles and so on. Karen and her son are there also and talking to me. Howard is trying to hold my hand and talk to me also. I'm having a hard time trying to listen to all of them. I don't like the fact that he's holding my hand, but I allow it. He's upset because he wants all my attention and he wishes Karen and son would go away. I am touched by his tenderness and also uncomfortable.
