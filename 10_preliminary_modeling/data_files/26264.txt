 I'm in a store in the Uptown Mall. I leave and pass my classmate Robyn Masters on the way out. I go out to a vehicle parked in the Dayton's parking lot. I'm having a party for a class in my home. All my classmates are invited. My friend Kathy Branch, her mother, and younger sister arrive. Her younger sister has a fat face. Kathy and her mother look very much alike, and I comment to her on this. My aunt and uncle Rusty and Sheila Redding and their kids Rich, Melvin, and Melissa arrive. Grandma and grandpa Redding are there, though I don't see them. My aunt Elaine Grains is there. My childhood friend Tim Robbins arrives through the front door. Robyn Masters isn't at the gathering, though she is in the class. Two women from Europe can't make it to the party either. We all start to sing Edelweiss, like we do at normal family gatherings. I sing, but I feel uncomfortable because there are people here in my class who aren't used to this type of singing.
