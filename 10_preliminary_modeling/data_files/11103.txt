My father was Napoleon, why I don't know. My brother cut his foot on a sword that he had been using, but my father showed no concern or sympathy for him. All he did was to tell me to put an apple on my brother's foot. He said this would cure it. I didn't think so, but I did it anyway. Then people, no one in particular, told me my brother was going to die. I didn't see how he could from such a small cut, they said he would.
