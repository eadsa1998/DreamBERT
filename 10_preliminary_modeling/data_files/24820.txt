I was watching 90210, and one girl was mad at the other and she was sending vicious notes to the other. Then all of a sudden I was in this room and there was this huge open door leading into an eating room, like a summer camp type eating room. In the room I was in there were letters on the wall like the ones on 90210, which was strange. Anyway, I got into the eating room and I see P. At the same time we both made that signal with our index fingers to come to each other and mouthed the words, "yeah, we're not shy." Then we walked towards each other. My mom then woke me up. Setting: Two rooms, one like a camp eating room, the other a plain old carpeted room. Characters: Shannen Doherty, Tori Spelling from 90210 (big brats), and P., who I luv, but we're usually both shy around each other. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed. It was a nice dream, very joyable. Every dream I have with P. just makes me happy...and usually we're shy around each other and we weren't which was good!!
