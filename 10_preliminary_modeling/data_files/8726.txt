We had hardly any vendors show for the conference. I knew it was because the mailing went out so late. There was a man named James [unknown in waking life] who was responsible for everything once we actually arrived for the conference. He was responsible for everything: the vendors, making sure they were all there, that they all had what they needed, etc. I was standing there talking to him. I noticed the vendor packets laying there. They had never been mailed. Obviously, I was very upset about this and the subsequent poor showing. We were in a small room and I had tables lined up around the walls and maybe one in the center. All of the tables were covered and skirted and the vendors that were there were setting up. The hallway outside the room was very wide and open. The facility had told them they were going to hang white draperies or something like that on the back wall. The facility said they had to take down all of the mini-blinds before they could hang the draperies. There were a lot of them. Two entire walls across from each other were windows.
