I was just hanging out near my locker, getting my stuff out, and had closed it. My perspective switched from birds-eye view to my POV right after this guy I liked, Neil, suddenly turned and embraced me. Then he walked away like nothing had happened. No one was left in the area but me. Setting: In front of locker #127 (my locker at the time) at the Middle School. Characters: Miscellaneous, oblivious students, and Neil (object of my affection at the time who is incredibly shy and withdrawn). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I was really happy that he hugged me, even though it was kind of pathetic, and I wondered what my friend Kolilei would say.
