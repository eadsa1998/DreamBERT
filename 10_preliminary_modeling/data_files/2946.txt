I am in a house and apparently living with Ellie and Charla. I hear Ellie yelling at Charla and Charla is crying. I feel very upset at Ellie and want to go rescue Charla from Ellie's anger. I see a picture of Ellie on the mantel/bookshelf, smiling. I go looking for them, but I am worried that that means I shall be leaving all my possessions in the house in the care of my roommates who might steal it. As I approach Ellie who seems to be in another house, I see the three roommates, two men and a woman driving away with my van, stealing it. I yell at them to stop. They keep on going. I get in the passenger side of a brown car with a man driving and we chase, in the woods, up the mountains; we are going fast and side by side. I lean out the window and yell at them, poking the driver with an umbrella. I viciously poke him, trying to get him to stop. He laughs at me. The woman reaches her hand over and says, "Give it to me." She is laughing. I say, "You'd really like that, wouldn't you. Then you'd grab it and I wouldn't have anything to fight with." Just at that moment, the man's head explodes and he just oozes out from under the door jam. No one is driving now and I am shocked. The other two don't even attempt to try to get the van under control. It crashes over a steep hillside and crashes and burns. The flames now start a forest fire. Now the man and I must run for it. We try to go downhill but can't. It's a cliff. We want to find a river. We are forced by the fire uphill and he remembers a place we can hide, a creek. We find instead a small cave and the smoke is now overtaking us. He says, "Get in the cave," and I balk. What if there's a bear in there? What if we suffocate from the smoke? He pushes me in. I see a bear, but it is too busy trying to survive to pay any attention to me.
