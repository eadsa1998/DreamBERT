 I'm at the Redding farm. I shoot a squirrel with a BB gun that I have. The gun isn't powerful enough to kill the squirrel. I pump the gun a lot and shoot, knocking the squirrel several feet in the air, but not killing it. I'm aiming the gun at Randy Menders, my classmate at Brimson, and I fire once or twice. The shots are very weak. I'd have to fire many many times to kill him. I don't have the heart to kill him: I can't bring myself to do it. Two dead children are lying in the grass between the chicken coop and the plum trees. I look at the kids. They look dead, and have been shot, by me, I think. The kids look like animals of some sort, and seem to be half alive, still breathing a little bit. There is an older woman who is in charge of things. She speaks to me and another person about what to do with the two dead kids. She says we have to keep one of the kids out, maybe because someone like his parents are coming to see him. So we have to give the kid orange juice, since the ascorbic acid in it will prevent oxidation and decay, and we have to pick the feces out of his anus, since a dead person's bowels relax.
