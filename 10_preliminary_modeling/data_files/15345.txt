A girl, her brother and their 'uncle' were reminiscing about their father that had died. He used to take them to a spot in the woods with some fish. They remembered about it and decided to go there. The girl went back for something but on her way back a guy slit her throat. The others waited hours before deciding that something was wrong. She ended up being okay. The girl was a teenager, the brother about 10 or younger. I was at a restaurant thing. There were lots of people there and I said I'd been playing this lame song a lot lately then it came on the radio - it was Lovers in a Dangerous Time. People complained and I said it was a good song.
