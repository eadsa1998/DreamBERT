A beautiful girl was brought in front of me to tempt me, but couldn't faze me. Then another one came with me and took me outside. I looked out and saw snow on the ground and beautiful white clouds floating by. I saw candy on the street. I picked some of it up and ate it. I stepped over cars as they came by.
