I was watching Misfits and there were zombies. In the last season, Dmitri had fallen in love and become boring. In the first ep of this season he ditched her and he and some others escaped from some house. It was spreading through the air or something so pretty much everyone was turning. I was then there. We left a building and I followed Dmitri and we ended up in a car. I said 'what are we doing? Where are we?'. We went to a house where there was a young girl. He spoke to her and said 'this is Izzy' and she said 'oh. Dmitri's girlfriend'. He had secretly been talking to her for a while. Then we were driving again and a car came around a corner and hit us and sent us straight into a pole. Zombies came out to us and opened the doors and took us. They took us to a house and outside there were lots of flies and Dmitri said it smelled really bad. The people there looked really dirty.
