[1997-06-16] I was walking along this road and there were a lot of leaves on the road and suddenly there was a cool, damp night, I remember that it had been raining and afterwards I decided to go out for a walk for some reason I could smell the night air and the leaves and then all of a sudden I woke up, back in the house. The house was part of the house I live in now, because I remember the dining room table, sitting in the kitchen and I remember that suddenly the house changed and it was the house I had previously lived in and there was all kinds of stuff that was in that house that should have been in that house, but the floor and the walls, that I actually touched, were of the house where I am living in now. And I said that we'd have to remodel it to look like the other house and I remember actually starting to take the walls down.
