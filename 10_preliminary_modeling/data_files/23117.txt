I am coming down a long fire ladder with a kitten in one hand and french fries in the other hand.  I drop the french fries, and they go skittering down the ladder.  Someone recovers them for me, but I am not sure that I want to eat them anymore.  I am very high up, maybe 10-12 stories, and I am very nervous trying to hold on to the kitten as I descend.  At one point I leap and grab the end of a dangling rope with something on the end of it, and swing a few times before dropping to the ground.  I don't know what has happened to the kitten by then.
