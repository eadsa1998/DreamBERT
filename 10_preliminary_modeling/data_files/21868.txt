I was in Rivertown, my boyhood town. I was hiding under something and something like sand or earth came down on me or snow and I was buried under it. I noticed it was hard to breathe under there. I moved myself up and made more room to breathe. I was then out and looking for myself where I was buried. Then I was a prisoner held by some foreign power or a bandit gang. It was not clear to me.
