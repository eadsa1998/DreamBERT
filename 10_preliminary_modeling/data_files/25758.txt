 I'm waiting for a shot in a doctors office/grocery store. I wait a long time. People pass me up in line. A woman says I haven't gone to the counter to check in or register. I get up to register. A woman calls my name, "Kenneth Hanson". I say I'm here. Another man stands up too. His name is Kenneth Hanson! He pulls out his wallet. I don't have my wallet. His middle name is Greg. My classmate Shannon Barns is there. We say hi to each other. She signs in. We are going to give plasma. She goes in to donate and talks to someone she thinks is me, but actually just looks like me.
