["Center of Attention"]  I have a black suitcase, more like a briefcase. It has a game inside it. You push a button and round disks, brown colored and sandpaper like, move around. I get bored easily with this game since nothing much seems to happen. Perhaps it is broken. I open up the case and clean everything out of it. I have a bunch of quarters and odds and ends. I gather up the quarters. I hear John Lithgow talking to another man. He is telling him that he shouldn't be such a hog with the center of attention in the group circle. I smile at the fact that it is John himself that seems to need to be the center of attention and he is jealous of the other fellow's share.
