It takes place in the future, summer of '98. I was to leave in the middle of July to go spend a year in Germany as an exchange student. Some of my friends, all around the age of 17 or 18, more than half of them were guys. Other half girls of course. We all got together to spend a week together. First stop, Valleyfair on June 21. Then we went to a motel for the night. Left early in the morning on the 22 to drive and do some sightseeing up north. We settled on camping out at International Falls. Next morning we drove into Canada; over the next few days we had gone to Toronto, Montreal, Quebec, Niagara Falls, then drove back home. Afterwards we all had been closer than ever. Even the ones who really didn't know each other from the beginning. Once in Germany we constantly wrote. We were all like sibs who didn't fight. Nothing could split us up.
