I was walking on a dirt road and this very peculiar fog, it was very heavy and I couldn't see the road, but my head stuck up out of the fog and I could see trees and blue sky and stars and so forth, it was like I was wading through this fog, grayish white, the sky was brilliant blue, the trees were just lovely.
