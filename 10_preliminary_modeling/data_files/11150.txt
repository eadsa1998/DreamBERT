It seems I was riding in a car with some fellow I had a small crush on about 3 or 4 years ago and who I have hardly seen since. Someone else was evidently driving the car when we saw a lake and decided to go swimming. There seemed to be a lot of other people in swimming and enjoying themselves. Somewhere Jim left the dream, and I found myself swimming in a slimy lake full of seaweed, fish, etc. I had a strong desire to get out (no doubt due the slimy lake and fish--both for which I have a strong dislike). When the dream ended, I was out of the water, just standing there on the dock watching the others swim and wondering why they didn't mind the polluted lake.
