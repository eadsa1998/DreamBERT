The next day I also dreamed that I was swimming in a pool. What impressed me most was the construction or layout of the pool. It was all made of tiles and the area where the pool was, was completely enclosed, with little lighting. And it seemed to be a dark winter evening. When I got in, I realized that there was little water, so that my movements were slow and pretty close to the floor or bottom of the pool. There were people whom I couldn't clearly distinguish. I was trying to swim well so that the people wouldn't realize there was little water. Then I came out and started watching them and then I awoke.
