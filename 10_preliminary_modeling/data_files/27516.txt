I was sitting on my bed, which wasn't made when my three guests (which I am expecting next week) walked into my room. I was very surprised to see them, and very embarrassed that they should see my messy room. I, however, was very happy to see them and told them to unpack their clothes immediately, and I would help them. I hung all their clothes in the attic, which seemed a long distance from the main part of the house. They, however, were thrilled with the attic. We all got dressed up that evening, for I was going to have a party that night. My father then came in and I introduced him to the girls. Then six sailors in their white uniforms rushed in and made a dash for the piano. They wore overseas caps. About a half hour later, six more sailors with different kinds of caps rushed in and started singing around the piano. The girls were having a marvelous time.
