 I'm at a lakeshore. A hilly gravel windy road runs along the lake. I'm with others. A man trolls along the shore of the lake, about 50 feet out from shore. His fishing lure drags really close to the shore: one or two feet. He's using a baby torpedo lure, I see. I ask him if it's a tiny or a baby torpedo, even though I know what it is, just to make conversation. He stops and talks to me, saying it's a baby torpedo. He is trolling for bass. He uses the name ____ (I forget) instead of bass, which is unique. I think there probably aren't many bass in this lake. It's a very clear lake, and the depth drops off from shore really fast with little shallow shoreline for bass. He says that a thunderstorm is supposed to move in shortly, tonight or tomorrow, and after that we're supposed to get clear weather until it cools off this fall. I think that's good news because I want sun when we're in the Big Resort Area. I am in a basement with the man and my friend Hank Anderson. We talk about moving a wall back for more space. Something comes up or happens with buffalo and Indians.
