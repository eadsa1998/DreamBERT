I went to this girl's house and she had a voice fader on her C.D. player. Her name is Cara and she is a new friend of mine. I had never seen her house before - we were in her bedroom. I asked her if I could use her voice fader to block out Mindy McCready's voice (a country singer) from her CD so I could tape just the music and use it in a singing competition. She told me I could if I paid her and I said OK.
