I was at a party I think. I was sick and had one glass of alcohol and vomited. There were lots of people around and I was trying to get somewhere but was dizzy. I was hungry too. There was a cheeseburger that I hadn't eaten as part of this thing where you save something you managed to resist eating or remains of when you ate it. I kept my vomit too. I was then at the old house in the kitchen. I was reorganizing my vomit and the burger. I kept seeing the 217 lady in the bath in the bathroom. The first time, I glanced back and she was gone. This time, she was still there. She looked at me and I freaked out and started screaming. I tried to call Mom who was actually there and she came in to have a look. She couldn't see her, although I still could and I freaked out again.
