Beautiful trees surrounded my house and they made a huge shade in which I was resting on a very, very nice afternoon. Then I saw the biggest tree getting smaller and then it became just a shrub. In what had been the tallest part, there was the nest of a very big bird. I grabbed the chicks and then I saw the bird appear and it grabbed me from the back and raised me very high and then let me down.
