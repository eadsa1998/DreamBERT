I was looking on a man seated on a sort of grassy ledge on the face of a sheer cliff across a small valley from me. He seemed to be talking to some one. I noticed the ledge overhung and thought it not so safe. Then suddenly it split off and all crashed into the valley below. I told mother to go down the road a piece and get someone to phone for a doctor and rushed toward the man. A man from another direction had preceded me and was working at the heap of earth. I saw the man's hand protruding and began to dig with my hands. Suddenly I exclaimed that I felt his ear and the rescuer began to dig where I was. We had his had free and helped him to raise it and he looked out through the dark tunnel.
