["Doing high school again and quitting."] I decided to go back and do high school all over again. I get up to prepare for the school day. I am dressing. I try on a pair of jeans, my old jeans from when I was skinnier. They seem to fit now. Then I notice they aren't my jeans, but Ellie's old jeans. They are way too large for me. But still ok to wear. I am gathering up my books and papers to go to school. I know I will be late and try to hurry. Then I begin to think about maybe not finishing this course. I don't really need it, I did fine the first time through. I think I am doing this just to refresh myself of knowledge. A fun thing, but it's a lot of work now. I decide to quit and not go anymore. I haven't been there for days and am behind in my work.
