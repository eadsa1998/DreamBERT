I was at a restaurant with my parents and my maternal Grandma Jane.  I think we were staying somewhere on vacation.  We were leaving the restaurant at night and some distraction slowed them all down.  I was impatient and wanted to go back to the hotel, so I crossed the street to the teleport pad and wished I were home again.  At the same time I was sort of worried because I didn't want to leave without the others knowing where I'd gone.  By this time my father had crossed the street too, and had gotten in the car.  But I didn't teleport back home or to the hotel, I simply turned invisible.  By this time my mother and Grandma Jane had gotten into the Saturn.  They were going to go look for me, and I wanted to get their attention so they knew I was there.  I tried pounding on the back of the car, but it didn't do too much good.  They had never talked to my father, either, who should have had a better idea of where I went.  My mother and Grandma Jane drove off to look for me.  So I followed after them trying to stop them.  I wasn't walking though, more like floating.  It was dark and dingy looking, a bad sort of area.  As I continued down the street there were a lot of old sky blue cars parked off at the sides.  A lot of them had been partially stripped- fenders folded up and hubcaps taken, among other things.  I came across my own car amongst these and was distraught.  Toward the end of the street I went into a sort of car repair supply store.  Parts were hanging from the ceiling.  I went into a back room.  Something I did accidentally moved something- perhaps I hit one of the hanging parts.  In any case, someone became aware that somebody was there- apparently they were somewhat familiar with people turning invisible and coming into the store, probably to pilfer.  So they were trying to catch me.  I was very aware of the floating at this point, and I left the building and started heading back toward the restaurant.
