A lot of impressions, I can't seem to bring them out they seem to be about the Russel Hill building at the Redwood school [for the blind]. It seemed as if there were a lot of people, I could hear their voices and I could feel their presence. There were no children. It was the children's building. There was some kind of a meeting there. Something to do with a piano. Had to be moved from one area to another and it seemed as if it was upstairs. I could feel my body pushing against it on a ramp and there may have been a hoist involved. The way the dream went, I'm not sure, the way the piano went, it was just messed up. It seemed as if I could feel that it was warm out.
