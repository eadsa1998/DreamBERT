I started off driving in my car. I parked the car then I walked through a hallway filled with children. Then I passed through some people's house to get to the outside. As I started to walk away from the house I remember I had forgotten my books and my bag for school. I couldn't go back and get them. The bus had come and I had to go to school without my books or my bag.
