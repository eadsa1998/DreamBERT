Some people had some disease like thing. Supposedly, 85% of people had the initial stage of it, but only 17% of them actually had it. You got powers. I got tested. Later I was in a study with a girl. She asked if I had a sore stomach and I said no. I kept making that weird throat burping noise. She was worried that I'd gone through some door, but I didn't. I was then at a hotel place. This guy and I helped out there. He had powers. We were with other people like that. These three guys, who were kind of ugly, came and one of them looked at this girl and fell in love with her. To distract the hotel staff, the guy took them out into the woods outside. Because of this, I had to go back to Mom's. I didn't want to though because my computer was here. I went into my room there and I had Sims 2 loading on my computer and I turned down the music and then shut down Sims 2 because the people were just outside the window. I called Mom to say not to pick me up. She asked if Aster and Cody were there. I said I'd check. I knocked on the door of a room and Aster (Dexter) answered and I said "I didn't even know you were here, you could have starved to death this weekend". I started talking to Mom again but she wasn't talking. I then got a photo of her lying on the ground with vomit like stuff around her mouth. I had to leave.
