Reviewing the books we had written in my 5th/6th grade teacher Mr. Man's class.  He was there.  I think I was supposed to go back and grade them.  Then I got to my own, and I simply couldn't do it.  I started reading down the page and while I could read, the comprehension wasn't there.  It was like scanning a page of technical scientific writing that I couldn't understand.  The words had no meaning, just went straight through my head.  I realized this and that I couldn't do my job appropriately, so I tried starting over.  I couldn't do it.  I looked away somewhat ashamed, I think with tears in my eyes.  I was too embarrassed by my own writing to process any of the information.  I set the book down and told Mr. Man I couldn't do it.
