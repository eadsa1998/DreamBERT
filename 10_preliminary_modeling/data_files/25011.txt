 I'm going to attend some kind of Armstrong graduation. I forgot to call Mimi Escher to let her know I was coming. My friend Tina Totts calls me to get my roommate Jens Nils' phone number. I can't find the number. Then I remember that his number is my number too: 696-7420. It's raining outside and I run to my neighbor, Alvin Broud's house for a Kleenex.
