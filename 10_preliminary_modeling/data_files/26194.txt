 I go into Carter Church. It is empty. I walk back to sit down. Then people are there. I sit midway back on the left side of the church. A service starts, but it doesn't seem to be a mass. There aren't many people there. The people that are there have been going to Carter for a long time. They're old. The Schmelzer family is there. I sing a little bit with the people there.
