I dreamed I had very good grades at the university and everybody was congratulating me. The color of the university had changed to a loud red and I had new classmates. Then my dream took a different turn and I only remember something like a shadow, I don't know if my own or somebody else's. The bottom of the shadow was a pink flesh color, like a human being.
