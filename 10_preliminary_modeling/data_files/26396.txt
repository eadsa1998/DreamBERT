 I'm with others, and my dead friend Mark Long arrives. He is alive! I hug him. He doesn't want to hug me, and keeps his distance. I ask his sisters, Becky and Shannon, if he is alive. I ask him, "Are you alive?" I talk to him. Though it is good to see him, it is uncomfortable. I am angry with him. I yell at him, telling him he ditched out. He displays guilt and remorse. I beat him, smashing his head into a wall.
