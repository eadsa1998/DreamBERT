Had a text from Kiersten saying 'hey chic' and said Beatrix had said I was really noisy after 11pm. I also got a message from Benjamin saying something like 'I should've told you by now but I'm still a virgin'. I thought it was an odd comment but I was glad that he was and wondered if he'd told me because of that.
