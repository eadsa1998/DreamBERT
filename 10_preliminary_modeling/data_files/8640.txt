I am in a small room that looks somewhat like a sun porch. It seems to have at least two walls that are almost solid windows. They each had some type of blinds on them. I had gone around and pulled up the blinds on all of the windows on at least one wall to let in the light. It seems to be a bright, sun-shiny day outside. I can't recall there being furniture in the room, but there is someone else in the room and some people who walked by the adjoining room. I don't know if I know them, or they know me, but they know someone else in here. They say something about someone else in the room, or a house or an office. The people on the outside are saying that they feel sorry for the other people inside because they thought some man was responsible for opening all of the blinds and letting all the light in and they thought that was inconsiderate of the others in there. that they didn't have a choice or that they had to tolerate all this light, when for whatever reason they wouldn't want to. The people on the outside seemed to assume that most people would not want this. So, they thought it was rude that this man was opening all of these blinds. I recognize that they were blaming him wrongfully. I don't know if I had an opportunity to tell them that it wasn't him but me. I was thinking that I needed to do that, that I didn't want them to blame him when I was the one that opened the blinds.
