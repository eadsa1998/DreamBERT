I had one day of school left. That morning though, I had no clean school clothes. I wore a white long-sleeved shirt under my shirt. I was at home and Dad and Ezra were there. I was making a microwave meal for breakfast. Ezra was in his bedroom had some giant thing that I don't remember attached to him and it was for MIS. There was a documentary on the TV about a dangerous monkey thing. It showed it eating and drinking at some water. A crocodile came and it bit it and then let go and then the crocodile left. The camera shifted to this other monkey in a tree and then I felt something scratch my back and I freaked out and woke up. When I woke up, I jumped and hit my elbow on the wall.
