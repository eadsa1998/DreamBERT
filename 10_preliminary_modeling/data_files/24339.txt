Shipwrecked or stranded on a far-away island; much like the undiscovered islands of Hawaii or Thailand. There were vast beaches with white sand, backed up to craggy mountains covered in thick forest. It's daytime, but overcast. There were dozens of people stranded with me; they all struck me as followers, going with popular opinions. They wanted to stay and wait for rescue. But the captain of the boat who brought us over, along with a few others, decided it would be worth a shot to venture out, try to hobble to safety on the boat, which was listing in the water (and there was a horse they needed to bring with them). The only engine was one of those multi-purpose tractor engines they use in Asia that had to be hauled back aboard and attached. As the boat was beginning to take off, I jumped aboard and grabbed onto it. It sunk right away, diving down like a submarine. I thought this was a maneuver that the captain had planned, or had happened, and the captain decided to go with. The boat plunged down into the shallow bay, flipped, then pointed upward toward the surface. I was holding onto the pointed bow like a trainer at sea world on the snout of an orca. It launched toward the surface and we were suddenly away from the surface, but lost in a way. I knew it would not be wise to stay on the island -- it had plenty of wildlife, but I did not think there was enough fresh water and food to sustain such a large population for very long.
