A guy was announcing that he wanted $9 to help a young woman escape (East Germany or some place). He was on a radio downstairs. I was upstairs. A man came over with a box that had $2.25 written on it. He apologized because it wasn't much but it was all he could afford. I called it downstairs, leaning over the banister. The two more men offered $5 each. Hooray, we made our goal. I left for a moment and came back. The guy was angry at me because he had told me to stay there!
