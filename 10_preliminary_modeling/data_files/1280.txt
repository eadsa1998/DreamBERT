I'm in the M City house. Howard and the girls are there too. Dovre is working on a school project that requires pasting papers to a poster in an interesting design. She finally gets it done. I hang it up on the wall. I feel relief. Howard says, "At least you didn't say you were tired of it like you said about receiving roses from the fair." I am a little embarrassed because receiving roses is a special favor, but I felt it was sort of off-handedly done and wasn't special.
