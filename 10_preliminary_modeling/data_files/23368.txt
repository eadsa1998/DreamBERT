The church of the dream stood opposite the present one. It was medium size, commonplace wooden building. I knew the denomination to be Baptist. The odd feature which impressed me was a block of pews on the green before the door. I understood that these could be occupied by people not finding room within. Through the open door they could look through the length of the church to the chancel and presumably enjoy the service.
