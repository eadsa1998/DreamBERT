We were on the coke yard in Rivertown and there were lions, place of my boyhood days. We started to fly, then we were in a big building and the lions were trying to get us and they finally got up around the top or ceiling of the big building. Then the lions were men. I got outside and Carter was after me. I flew in flight. He caught me. I was small and he was very big and tall. He set me down on the ground and he was playing with a ball. I had a chance to get away from him, so I took off and flew up out of his reach. I was flying so much that I started to tire and he caught me again and was going to eat me. He took me into his house and I was just waiting for him to eat me. Then Steve Kokash came in and wanted to know if Carter could take off some kind of contraption off him, which was wound around him.
