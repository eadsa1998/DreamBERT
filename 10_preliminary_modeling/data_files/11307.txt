I am walking home with my gym bag in my hand (probably coming home from a basket ball game). On the other side of the street I see one of my best friends. Several guys approach him and begin starting a fight with him -- his glasses fall to the sidewalk and smash. When I see these guys attacking him, I drop my gym bag and run to his aid. I fight like one possessed, like a maddened animal, as great is my concern.
