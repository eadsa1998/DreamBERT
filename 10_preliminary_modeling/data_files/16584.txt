Man, where are the days going? They're just moving by. Before I know it, I'm going to be graduating, and I'm going to be kind of sad about leaving this place. Well, no, I'll be sad about leaving Modern Media College because I'm enjoying it here so much, but I'll be so happy to leave ______. I might stay in this place if I find a job or an internship around here. I kind of like this apartment complex. But anyway, that's beside the point. This morning I was having little dreams that I was naked in here and I was walking around and that I had my door open and Jill's parents were cooking some food out in the kitchen. Jill came in here, she was wearing all black, which she never does, and she came in here and she started digging through my stuff in the closet. And she said she was, she didn't say it, but I had the notion that she was looking for something of hers, and she was digging and digging through a couple piles of stuff, and then she left. And I decided okay, it was time to get dressed, and I got dressed, and she came back and she started digging through stuff on my desk. And I was pretty upset, but I didn't say anything. Then I looked on my wall, and I realized that I only had three pictures and there were maybe 20 that Jill had in here. And I don't know, that was just crazy. And I dreamt that I had a little ______ from Astrid, that she sent me, and I was going to write to her and tell her thank you. And that's about it.
