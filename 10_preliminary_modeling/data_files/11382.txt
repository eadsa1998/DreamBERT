It was night and I was coming to my home and Jones was just leaving and telling someone his thanks. I entered the house and the DG arrived (an instructor at school, m 40). There was a break or lull in the dream but next thing I remember was FB (also an instructor at Reserve, a woman about 50) and she was leaving at night in a bad rain storm. I was cautioning her to be very careful lest she fall and hurt herself.
