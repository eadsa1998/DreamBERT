I concentrated in my dream and French fleet came to me and a house was thought of. Someone took my pan from my work and put a cardboard box there. Bindas was going to pick out some names from cards. He dealt me cards and when I was going to look at them, most of them were cellophane. I was walking around with only a shirt on. You could see my penis and I was ashamed for I knew people were looking at me. I brought an extension light from one part of the basement on 68th Street and put it in another part. One of them paid 13 to 1. John Bindas had a new suit of clothes. I took a good look at it. I ran my finger on it and it was so fine I could see the pimples on his leg thru the pants. I was looking for my belongings in his house. I moved the long extension cord again. I took my key out of his door. His wife walked in with two dolls, a boy and girl. I kidded him that he now had a boy and girl. I jokingly talked to the dolls and to my surprise they talked back to me. They were the image of human beings. The girl said Charley Petritus was buried today.
