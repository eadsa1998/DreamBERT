I was back at White's in the old plant. I was to grind some bars and I found there were 3 sizes mixed, so I matched each bar and sorted them out. When I was thru, I told Joe I was thru, but I didn't grind them. I changed my clothes and looked at the time, and I had about 15 minutes left. I thought I could finish them, but it was not enough time. I saw a fellow next door which was John Kell (deceased). I walked up to him and said, "Aren't you John Kell?" but when I got near him, I noticed he looked different and he said he was not.
