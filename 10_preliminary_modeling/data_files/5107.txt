I am living at home with my parents in M City. I have three cars and someone delivers some oil. It squirts out of the hose and leaks all over as it fills a tank outside the house. I feel better having it full now. I get in my red car with a floor stick shift and start to drive. I turn the corner to the left and squeal out, liking the good way the car is running. I feel pleased that I have three running cars now and Howard doesn't have as much. I feel a bit sorry for him, and as I drive I realize he wants to talk to me and wonder what it's about. I am feeling a bit superior about being better off than Howard. Then I remember I still live with my parents and feel embarrassed because I should at this age be out on my own. Even though I need someone to live in and help me, I could do that with a roommate. That would be more adult than relying on my parents. [BL]
