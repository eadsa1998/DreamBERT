I was in an elevator in a department store with some girl and one other person.  Apparently this other person and I planned to rape this girl.  Anyway, we wouldn't let the elevator stop at her floor exactly.  That is, it kept moving up and down so that we were always either half above or half below her floor.  When we were in the latter situation, she became desperate and thrust a paperback book through the opening in the top part of the front of the car, and told the person she gave it to give it to someone else.  Apparently the title of the book conveyed her message.
