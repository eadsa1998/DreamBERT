I was in a strange house in the town we lived in about 10 years ago. I was about the same age as I am now but it seemed that the time was about 8 years ago. My mother had decided to walk to the corner with the lady of this house who was about the same age as my mother. I said that I would take care of the children (who belonged to this lady) while they were gone. I watched them leave and a few minutes later there was a knock on the door. I thought as I answered it that I should look to see who it was before opening it. But I opened the door and there stood a big man. He was about 60 years of age and was unshaven with gray hair cut in a butch. He looked at me and smiled in a sort of fiendish way. Then he stroked the side of my face and said something I don't remember except that he called me dolly. It made me very angry and I could feel my heart pounding. Then he started to lunge at me and I ran. Pretty soon I found myself going down some back stairs outside the house and the man was gone. I felt weak from fright.
