I was driving with Mom. I was talking and then asked where we were going and she said 'you know where' and I said that I didn't. She was going to Dad's new place. We went in and he had moved in already and it was different from the pictures. Dad asked me how I liked it and I was like 'eh'. I asked where I was supposed to put all my stuff and he started going on about how I could "ship it back to the US". Mom had some pencils which had recordings from some young boy called Christopher who had played with snow. I cried and yelled at Dad saying 'what about my stuff, what if I want to live here' etc and that I loved the old house. I saw Tigger and gave her a pat. Mittens was in a cupboard in the kitchen. Ezra said that he liked the new place. I realized I was late for school and said to hurry, but nobody did so I didn't bother going.
