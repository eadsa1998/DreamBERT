 My house is where people stay, like a hotel. An attractive middle-aged woman arrives. I'm in the bathtub. She needs things for her room. I toss her towels and washcloths from where I am. She asks for a cover to a canoe. I tell her where the measuring cups are because I don't understand what she wants. I think she means measuring cups. Then I realize what she said. I don't know where the canoe covers are. Don't most people just flip the canoe over, I think? Her waterbed mattress is cold. I have an erection in the bathtub, which is full of sawdust. I get out of the bathtub to help her. I turn the waffle iron on to heat her waterbed. The waffle iron is on the kitchen counter. It starts to whistle very quickly, and is hot. I'll have to move it upstairs to her bed eventually. The woman is married to a man who has children, but the woman is not their mother. The children and husband are coming later. The husband's friends are also coming. They arrive. They are rednecks. I open the front door and go out to meet them, and hold the door open as they enter. The man comments on my hospitality. The husband, a male friend, and the two children are there. There is an ugly red haired woman who I think is married to the husband's friend. I think I should have tried to have sex with the woman who arrived first. She is attractive and is married to this loser man and his friend.
