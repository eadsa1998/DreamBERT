This dream concerned a sorority sister who was planning to be married soon; a sort of preview of the wedding. The auditorium was filled with thousands of people. There was an altar like all churches, but there were no pews. The people were sitting on stone bleachers. I was to be one of the attendants in the wedding and although not the maid of honor, I was to bring the groom's ring. The bride to be informed me that the ring was on a table near the altar and I was to pick it up before the service. The processional started and I followed the maid of honor down the aisle. I picked up the ring and started to leave the altar to go to my seat in the congregation. At that point, my costume was changed and I was just a spectator. The bride became frantic as she looked for the ring. Then I suddenly stood up and shouted, "Here it is." I tried frantically to get it to her, but too many people gathered around me and refused to let me through. At this point, the scene changed and I was with a group of friends, both male and female, eating in the hold of a ship. There were shells and mounted fish on the walls, and a foul fish smell. Everyone began talking and laughing and then I woke.
