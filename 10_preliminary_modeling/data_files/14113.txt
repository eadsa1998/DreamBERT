I was at an Indian wedding place. Me and a male friend decided to play a joke and so as the couple came out, we went through the shop pretending we were getting married. Later I was at school, which was different, and all these characters from Freaks and Geeks came. Some of them weren't real ones. They were people I'd gone to school with. I said "now Linda Cardellini will turn up" and she did. It had been ten years since we all saw each other. Linda had gone out with James Franco's character and was still in love him. She was calling him Brendan though. I was looking for Jason Segel. I went to find James. He was sitting on a bench in the middle of the oval (which was hilly) with a friend called Mark. I said "Bobby" and then Mark, who was really annoying, and I had a short argument, then he left. James was Bobby from Twin Peaks. I asked him to talk to Linda and he agreed.
