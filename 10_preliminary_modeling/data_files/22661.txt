This dream starts like this: I had to go to the library, and I always go there with my boyfriend because it seems to me that he can help me take notes on what I need. I had agreed to go to the library with him at 6 p.m., and my mother asked me to go to Ica with her for some business. She's from Ica. I told her I would go if we could be back before 6. We went and I was desperate to get back to Lima because I had to go to the library with him. My mother told me there was nobody to take us. I tried to get in touch with him at work, by phone, to tell him I couldn't be there, but wasn't able to. Suddenly I was in Lima and my dream changed. I dreamt that a friend of mine who left for the United States a few months ago to go to her sister's, had come back, and I saw her, very tanned, strolling with her little niece, and I asked her, "Have you come with your sister?" and she answered that she had come only with her little niece, but suddenly her sister appeared and both of us asked her, "How did you get here?" and she told us that she had come by plane. And that was all, I awoke.
