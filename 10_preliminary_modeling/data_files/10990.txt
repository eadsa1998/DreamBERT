The dream takes place in a large, new house. A girl is running barefooted over thick white carpeting. There seems to be the color green running around her. In the distance stands a smiling woman, the mother of this girl. Near the mother is the father, happy but not smiling. The girl herself is joyous, skipping around and jumping.
