I am moving somewhere with my family after high school graduation. I don't know where we are going. For a time I am at the prom in my regular moving clothes. My boyfriend is Wayne, who is actually my son's brother-in-law. I don't know if he is taking me to the prom or even what I'll wear because my clothes are packed for the move. Some old ladies walk in together to watch the prom. A young woman I actually do work with says she knows Wayne and will call him to see if he is taking me. I am thinking about work in this unknown town. Maybe I will work in a hardware store, but I want to work in a newspaper and will apply there, provided there is one. I am thinking I have a good background in that. I remember then that I left stuff in the oven. It is very dirty. I have forgotten an uncooked pumpkin pie, mixed vegetables, etc.
