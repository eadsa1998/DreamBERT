Something about new trays for the children's ward, trays of a very light wood instead of plastic. Miss M. speaks of her vacation, should leave this afternoon but must wait for ___. I ask her when the laundry I had sent out should be returned. I had sent it several days ago, shouldn't I have it now? Then she remembers that one of the board had taken it away with her. I explode. If I don't get it back, I can't keep changing my own pillow. I paid more than it's worth to come here and now someone steals my things. There are some of the meanest people here that I ever knew.
