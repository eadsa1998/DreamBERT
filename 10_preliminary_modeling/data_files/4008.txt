["Keeping the Animals Safe"]  I own a large run down house where I keep exotic animals. Lion cubs and a sort of furry dinosaur, and many other animals. I let them roam free. The house has a long front yard that goes to the ocean. In the house are stone outcroppings just like outdoors. I use them as sort of stairs. Some of the house is unfinished. The stones lead up to a wall for example. The dinosaur goes wild and is potentially harmful. I need to put it up in a room in the house. I struggle to get it up there. I feel bad that I have to lock it or any of the animals up like in a zoo. I am enjoying the fresh air in the yard and notice a lion cub is loose. I am concerned it will be hurt by the dinosaur. I pick it up, cuddling it. As I am walking around with it, I see two men who are going to harm the animals. Now the dinosaur is loose and swimming in the ocean. I get into the passenger side of the car. The two men are in the driver's seat. I pull out a shotgun and point it at their heads. I say if you don't stop, I'll blow your heads off. They smirk. I aim at their shoulder and shoot. This scares them and they jump out the open window on the driver's side. The car is moving fast and I struggle to get into the driver's seat to stop it before we plummet into the ocean. Too late. I feel the impact of hitting the water. I feel the sinking of the car in the deep water. I am also aware that the impact is softer than it would be normally. I struggle out of the window and start to swim back to shore, with my shotgun in my hand, on the lookout for the men. I see one up on a hill. I return to the house and run up a long flight of stairs. I see my staff, now a large group, working. I warn them about the men.
