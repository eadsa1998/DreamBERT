I remember coming to Santa Cruz with my best friend in her car. It was about 3 or 4 o'clock PM. We had been in the car for about three hours or so by now, when her car all of a sudden stopped. At first we thought, it doesn't have gas so we will have to walk the rest of the road until we get to Paso Robles. So, we did. We got there and I remember that I was using a pay phone talking to my boyfriend and telling him what had happened. Then I woke up.
