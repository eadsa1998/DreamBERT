Mom was going to see a friend. I drove I think. Mom met up with this other guy first, who was a 'behind the scenes' guy and he was weird looking, but hot. As he was leaving, Mom said "he's kind of weird" and the car did something weird and I said "ooh", but she thought I was saying "ooh" at the guy and kept telling everyone that I liked this guy. I went in and was resting on a saloon type of door and then saw someone who looked like David Spade. Then he said "How's Kylie?" and I was confused and he said "never mind" and I remembered we had had met him before. I wanted to leave to I complained to Mom and she left, just as these others got there. I was at this place and I walked past Eugene and thought "oh look there's my boyfriend". I had to go across this obstacle thing. There were chairs and planks in odd positions. I had to carefully maneuver over them. At the end this chair had a leg missing and if I fell I would've been badly hurt. I got over it though. Then Bradley and Eugene were going through it. I put up the chairs at the end to help them.
