I am seated and an Indian man throws me a deflated folded up football. He says this is a good one for her to throw. I see that it is as I can get a grip on it that way. I am preparing for a throwing contest with him and others. I am practicing with some women relatives. I try to throw to Patricia. My mother is there. I deliberately throw badly. I don't want him to know how well I throw, to throw him off balance.
