We went to visit a friend or someone I know that lives in the country. He has 22 acres of land and he was going to be on the news with his tractor and with a cow or a dog. He does these tricks with this animal and his tractor. I can't really explain what the tricks were even though I can visualize one of them a bit. There was some comment about how good the food was there and about it being out in the country and being an hour away from something but I don't know what. I was asleep in one of the bedrooms and someone came in and crawled in bed with me and I couldn't wake up. I thought that it was really happening and I couldn't wake up and I was feeling for the person. I thought maybe it was Nick R. I kept saying, Nick R, is that you? But he wouldn't answer. Finally, the dog went in and started attacking this person and chased him away. It turns out it wasn't Nick R. The dog was kind of shaking me. I was finally able to wake up then. There was something else about this dog but I can't remember what now. I closed the bedroom door then and stuck something under the door. The dog grabbed it and drug it outside and was attacking it. It was just sitting there tapping his paw against the floor and guarding this thing. I guess because it still had the scent of this man. I finally got up and went out and said good dog and then said something else to him so he knew he didn't have to stand guard anymore. It was a collie. There was another little dog, like the one on the Taco Bell commercials, came in too and I picked him up and took him inside and let him run up the steps.
