I was riding with Pauline Lenarcic. She was driving the car and drove very slow. I told her my Plymouth rode like that when it was carboned up. I was trying to find a place for Judy to sleep while we're at a party. I went to two hotels and neither one of them would tell me what the charge would be. One of them filled out the papers and the lady said, "You sign here." I said, "I will not sign unless you tell me what the bill will be." We were at a party.
