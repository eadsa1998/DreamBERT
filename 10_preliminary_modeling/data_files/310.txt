I'm in a theater where a rock band is about to play. One of the guys in the band is my boyfriend - we haven't been together very long but I'm quite fond of him and it's not a hot &amp; heavy affair. We're still quite shy of each other. I'm sitting in about the 3rd row, center - he got the tickets for me and some friends - and the lights are on while we're still waiting for the place to fill up. Which it is, mostly filling up with teenage girls. I don't feel out of place, but a bit conspicuous. The band is still setting up onstage (the curtain seems to be open) and I get up to go talk to my boyfriend. He's assembling something on the near side to the stage steps on the right, and I squat where he is and talk for a minute, just asking casual questions about what's going on. He doesn't mind. I really like him, and I'm pleased that he'd want me here. He's blond, quite young-looking, real nice guy. I cross the stage for some reason (with him?) and I'm there for a minute or so more, while they're finishing up, and now the stage is set and it's almost time to start. They tell me I need to get back to my seat. I turn, looking for the best way to do that, and then decide to go back the way I came. I feel very conspicuous walking across the whole set now that it's complete, now it seems I don't belong here. (I'm not sure if the curtain is raised or not - it feels as if the audience can see me.) The place is about full now, and the general audience buzz is still loud. I look for my seat, can't find it at first, then I realize somebody's sitting in it. I go up to her and say, "That's my seat" - there's no time to be polite or solicitous, the show's about to start. She hesitates for a minute, but I get a bit more forceful, "Come on, that's my seat - go away", and she does. Looks a bit surly but I don't care. I sit down, full of anticipation and excitement.
