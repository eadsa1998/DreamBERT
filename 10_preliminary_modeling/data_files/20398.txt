I was taking a sheet of paper to the foreman in a printing company. There was printed matter on the sheet which I had printed on a press. I was walking through a hallway past private rooms for sleeping. Then I noticed that I was unclad, and I hurried into a room to put on a pair of trousers that was there. But it was so large that both of my legs fit into one leg of the trousers. Someone saw me and laughed at my predicament. I felt embarrassed and belittled.
