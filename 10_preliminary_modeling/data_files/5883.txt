I am in Paris and strolling around looking for familiar streets. Recognize as few as well as some shops I know. Then I feel I should be doing something more worthwhile with my time and remember there is an Alexander Calder exhibition at the edge of the city. Go there and see some 60 pieces of large sculpture standing against the walls of a chateau. I think to myself how nice it would be if my wife were there to see this tremendous exhibition.
