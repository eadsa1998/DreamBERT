I was in a cafe and a bartender friend of mine, one who works with my boyfriend, gave me a rose bud. He actually put it into what seemed to be a creamer picture. He told me not to worry and walked off. I was sitting at the table putting on green nail polish. I wasn't worried about taking up a table because the place was empty and I knew the owner. The tables had table cloths on them and candles. I looked down and saw glass cuttings covering the tablecloths, like the tables in a restaurant I used to work in. The owner of this restaurant used to be the manager of the cafeteria in my high school and I used to work for him.
