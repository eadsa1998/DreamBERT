I was a hobbit? I was with some other hobbits or whatever and we were at the place they meet Bard in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. The boat was there and we went into the water and hid behind a ledge, but when he came he saw them and started swimming out to them. I stayed hidden and when he came past, I grabbed him. He was heavy and bigger than me so I had trouble and kept falling underwater. There was an underwater tunnel that the others went through and I pulled him through with me. Somehow he realised I wasn't going to hurt him but he was still cautious. We were in this underground little house thing. I was sitting with him in a bath (both clothed) explaining that we needed him to help us and he agreed to help. We left and walked up this big ledge thing and had to jump to the other side. One guy did and missed and fell but was ok, even though it was high. I grabbed the ledge and pulled it down and landed on the ground and flung back up. It was then a game which was like an advert I'd seen on TV that was set on a beach. One side had this pecking bird thing and has three holes where some animal thing would pop its head out and you would hit it. The other side had a cat which would hit them with its paw. It said you could win money, though I figured it would be like 'you win this much if you sign up with this site and pay money'. I did it anyway and it said I won over £100 (I had a bunch of them to hit, maybe eight, and each one said the amount I earned; I saw £30 for a few of them. I opened the thing to get my prize and it was all coins. I was with another person trying to work out how to carry the money -- we put it in a bag, which we put into another bag.
