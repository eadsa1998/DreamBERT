 I'm in a gunfight in front of my house. I have a pistol that is really thin, like a flimsy butter knife. I am fighting my roommate Stephen Ramos, who has a machine gun. I run along the sidewalk and hide by the bushes between our house and the neighbor's yard. I shoot and hit Stephen in the butt, and then in the leg (the quadriceps). He doesn't hit me. He fires the gun at me a little bit, but appears to be confused and fires the gun off in a different direction. After I shoot him he runs away. I could go after him and catch him to end the game, but I go inside. I have to find him before 9:30 pm. There is a girl that either I have to find or that goes with me to find Stephen.
