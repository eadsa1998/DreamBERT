I am in love with an Indian whose name is Orange. It's a special and warm relationship. I also am very attracted to this white guy that's like an actor in "Crossing Delancy." The two of them walk off together and I worry they will fight and I will lose them both. When they come back, I see they have exchanged hats and I am so happy. It means they have reached an understanding and both still love me.
