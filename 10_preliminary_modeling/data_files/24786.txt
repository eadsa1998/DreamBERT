I was with my mom and our car broke down, so mom called triple-A and towed our car. After that, it was a jumble of being in a somewhat Tom Sawyer neighborhood and being at school. Coming back with a babysitter, we waited for mom to pull up, and she did in a dark turquoise sportscar. Setting: At a Tom Sawyer neighborhood, at home, on the freeway, in the market parking lot. Characters: My mom, the blonde babysitter. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It's pretty unclear what I feel.
