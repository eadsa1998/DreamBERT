 I'm at a swimming pool. There is a long and thin device that floats on the surface of the pool. I jump in the pool, catching the device as I submerge, and dragging part of it under water. I swim underwater, collecting the ribbon-like floating device as I float up. The device may be a NADH molecule. I shoot electrons at my neighbors Gary and Wilma Stein who are on the deck of the pool. The electrons are part of the floatation device that I have gathered in my arms. I emerge from the surface and throw the electrons at them, and then swim down and away. My brother Wally is there. I swim away, coming up for air like a dolphin or a fish jumping, and then go back down. Gary and Wilma are throwing something at me. I dive down in the aqua pool water. There is a scale of depth. I go 14-20 feet down. There is a beer cap on the bottom of the pool. The top of the cap is facing down.
