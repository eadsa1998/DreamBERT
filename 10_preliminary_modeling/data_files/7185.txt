At last the service came to an end. I could hear the singing of two stanzas of well-known closing hymn but then the other two stanzas were mixed in one and I couldn't tell which words were being sung. We closed with the Mizpah benediction. Now I walked down to meet my Hayes cousin's son, introducing myself by name. I said he would not remember me well. He said, "No, I was such a tiny tot when you visited us." Then I saw a little 5-year-old girl in a blue dress and asked, "Is it your daughter?" "Yes." Then we talked about why we had come to the islands. He said he had to be careful about stairs. I asked how he had managed the big flight of stairs to the entrance. The elevator came down to the basement which could be entered by a side door. We talked about elevators. Then I pointed to the house across the street and said, "That is where I live."
