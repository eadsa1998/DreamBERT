I was at home but it was not our house. I saw my little brother (2) first and he looked as if he had just had a haircut. Then I went into what seemed to be the living room and my mother and cousin (29) Jack were there. Jack was planning a vacation to Canada. I told him he was foolish to drive all that distance since it was snowing so hard. As I said that, I walked to the window, pushed back the curtain, and watched the snow flakes, which were extremely large, fall to the ground. Complete change then. I'm in front of a mirror shaving under my arms, but the hair seems to be at least 6 in. long.
