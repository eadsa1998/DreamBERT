Ezra and I were going to go to the movies with Dad. We ended up at a zoo near a friend of Mom's. We were actually close to the cinema. Her friend looked like Mr Willingham. He was really rich and had a HUGE pool. I came back there some other time and Charlene was there on a swinging chair. I sat next to her and she said that she wanted his stuff (he was going to sell it and was probably going to give some money to me). He came along and pushed the chair away from the edge of the pool, which had no water in it, and was full of his stuff. Some guy at this new house wanted his books. Some of them were called Idiot, George and Stumpy. The Idiot one fell out but pushed Charlene into the pool.
