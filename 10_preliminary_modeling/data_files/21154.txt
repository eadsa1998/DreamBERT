Charles Charvat was taking down a neon sign and was going to change the lettering on it for Sears Roebuck and Co. I got the bill for my car and it was $53 and some cents. There was a flood in our house. I opened up the water drain and the water rushed down the ditch to a dam we built. It was filling up fast. There were kids on the dam. I yelled at them to get off. I was afraid it would break before they got off, but it didn't. Us grownups went on the dam, then I yelled, "Everybody get off because it is going to break." I could feel the dam giving a little. Just as we got of,f the dam gave way and the flood started. I saw the water go around a telephone operator. She was going to run away, but then picked up her phone as did the telephone operator in the Johnstown flood. Uncle Mike was visiting us. He was by Sue's place and I heard them say Sue gave him a dollar once in a while.
