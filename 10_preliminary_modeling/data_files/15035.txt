I was going to two schools and doing certain units at one. I was outside with Ezra and Rover. It was night but it was easy to see. There was a fence and I could see through it a little from this side. There were two guys from my class who were both kind of hot. One was really quiet and the other wasn't. I had a weird feeling about one of them (he was the hoter one, and had a very flat nose but it looked good). Both of them had dark hair and eyes. There was a little dog that I had got and a thing where the dog slides onto you. Some boys were watching and were like 'whoa a girl can do it'. This Indian woman was on their side and they got up and started talking to her saying stuff like 'Hello madam' etc. I reached my hand around the back and pulled out a water bottle and took a sip. I think he was going to kill her, so me and Ezra got up and ran away. We wiped our footprints from the sand and we had some trouble with a lock, which was like a USB and kept sliding out. I left the school. I tried heaps of others such as Creekside, which I was supposed to start in an hour but I didn't want to go. I reluctantly went back to the old school which was called Midvale but people from Brookland High School were there - well, I saw some photos of the Year 12's with six different ones. I was going to look for Eugene's but later I saw a video of them waiting. Evelyn was there and was just going for photos. I was then in class and there was a guy who looked like Shen next to me listening to You and Me except it was more techno. I tapped my finger along to it. The more talkative guy from before was there and he was going around the other side of the desk talking to people. I was wondering if he would recognize me (he had liked me before). Someone asked "who made Gone With the Wind? Was it Scarlett O'Hara?" and I was like 'what the hell?'. The guy sat at my desk.
