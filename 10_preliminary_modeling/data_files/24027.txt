I was on a yellow bus out in the middle of nowhere. I did not recall the place. There were a lot of boys around my age and three girls. I was sad and seemed to me to be very stressed and unpleasant. We left on our way to a place I knew about. Then all of the sudden I did not know where I was. We were driving down a long road and everyone was talking and I was sitting there alone by myself and feeling like I had no friends and that I thought terrible about myself. Everyone else was having a good time, jumping up and down, singing, and dancing along with the music. Then I was all alone beside one boy driving. We crashed and I blacked out and ran.
