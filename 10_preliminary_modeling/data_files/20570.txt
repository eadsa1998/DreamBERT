I went to see some patients in a hospital. A movie was being shown, and I strained to hear what the woman on the screen was saying. On the grounds later I met a girl about 8. She was carrying a doll. I was attracted to her, but I forbore any immoral behavior with her. She was intellectual in appearance and manner. She smiled at me in a friendly way. She was leaning over the rim of a fountain and examining the fish in the water. As she went to another part of the fountain, she dropped her doll without noticing it, and I picked it up and gave it to her. She thanked me and smiled at me. She seemed disappointed when I told her that I was going.
