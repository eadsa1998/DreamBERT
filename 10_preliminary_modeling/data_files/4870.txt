I am standing on a lawn in front of a white house shaped like the Mac House, but it is not. A horrible plant is growing out of a small buried mess of body parts in the lawn. It is angry. Its leaves are like tentacles reaching out to try and grab me, to kill me. I had been lazy and irresponsible when I buried the stuff there. I run madly and it grows very fast to try and get me. I run down a street near a parked car. The tentacles could only reach that far and it is screaming (Sounds like Godzilla) with fury and frustration that I am just out of its reach. I stand there listening to its screams and watches as it dies. I walk around the block to stay safely out of its way. Someone insists I go back and look at it now that it is dead. I am fearful to do so, but I do it. I am afraid it will spring to life and kill me. I wake up, afraid. Nightmare.
