[1997-06-05] We were out in Colorado somewhere and Martians came from outer space, from Mars I guess and we were all having a party, it was snowy, Christmas time. A female friend of ours was there, and Mort was there. We were just having a blast. I don't know why we were in Colorado, or even where the Martians came from but they were going to take us up to Mars where they said they had good New Years, and that was it.
