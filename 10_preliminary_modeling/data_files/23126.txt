I was at the last university I taught at looking at English Competency Exams with Mitch Roemer.  Sue Healder was also there.  I kept looking for blank evaluation sheets to use, having just seen some a minute or two before, in a stack of competency exam papers, but I couldn't find them again, and I got very frustrated.  Eventually I realized that the exams were old and they weren't given any more, and why should I waste my time with them anyway, and threw them away.  I did worry a little about whether the old files should be preserved, but then realized that I didn't work there anymore anyway, and so it was no skin off my back.
