A company was having a contest to give away four cars to its customers. Two of the cars were luxury cars, the same make and model but different colors and one was a "gold" edition of that model. I really wanted to win one of them. A customer I had been talking with had left but I saw through a window that she was coming back. I realized that she had won both of the luxury cars. She was in her late sixties or early seventies, with very short blonde hair, styled in a manner that you might expect for someone of her age. She asked me if I would go with her to claim the two cars and drive one of them to her home. I agreed and went into to change my clothes before going with her. While I was changing, she left and came back with her male hair stylist. She told one if my male coworkers that she no longer needed me to go with her. Her stylist was going instead. He was a man in his early or mid thirties, very thin build, with short, choppy, blonde hair. I was a bit disappointed that she didn't want me to go now. I was looking forward to driving one of those particular cars. I walked up to her and her stylist and said something to her about her hair. It was shoulder-length, full, kind of frizzy looking. I said something to her about the color of her hair being similar to mine, while lifting a some strands of mine up close to hers. The stylist disagreed, saying that hers was more yellow-blonde while mine is more ash blonde. He said something about how she styles her hair as he touched it here and there. I was surprised that it looked this way on purpose.
