I meet a young man (unknown to me in the dream) who says he was at Swarthmore college with me; I ask him: "what did you think of me at Swarthmore? "I didn't pay any attention to you then"-- shift: a client comes to me at my office and is very tired; he lies down on the floor on a bed that Frank had made.
