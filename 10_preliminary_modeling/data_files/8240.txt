I had decided to do a four-week dream group at the house. Based on registrations I was rescheduling out another week. I had called everyone to let them know but Lou S showed up on the original date anyway. I had just gotten out of the shower because I wasn't expecting anyone. I let her in. she had three children. Two young girls and a boy around the age of 11. They all followed me upstairs to talk to me while I was getting dressed. I grabbed my clothes and went behind the headboard of a brass bed and kind of ducked down so they wouldn't be able to see while I was dressing yet I could still talk to them. Lou S came over behind the headboard as well just to continue talking. I saw the boy moving very slowly and purposefully over to the bed and then he lay down on his stomach facing me. I said, Now I came over here so you could not see me changing. And you purposefully came over just so you could try to see me change. You just get your butt back over there where you were. Lou S said something to him also. He went back over to where he had been sitting. I went ahead and finished changing. As I did another woman had shown up for group and let herself in and came up there as well. I didn't know who she was. I welcomed her but told her we were having group downstairs and we were just getting ready to go down there. At this point I decided to go ahead and have a group for whoever showed up. I said we could all go down and I would come back up and get the folding chairs. Lou S had brought the folding chairs upstairs with her. My house was different than in waking life. In the dream this upstairs area looked more like a finished attic, with very low ceiling and one big open space. I also do not have a brass bed in waking life.
