My boyfriend Jeremy and I went to some sort of rock concert.  Some of the music sounded like Aerosmith.  After the concert we went into a garage...I think it was supposed to be Schwarzenegger's.  There was a sort of racing car in it, with three seats.  Up on a cabinet on the wall there was a pile of balloons.  I stood on the counter to look at them- one looked like a Grumpy Bear balloon.  I noticed there was a sheet covering the ceiling with other pictures of Care Bears too.  It was very cute.  Then it looked like the pictures started moving.
