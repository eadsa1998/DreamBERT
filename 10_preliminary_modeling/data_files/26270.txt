 I'm on a college basketball team playing with my friend Jimmy Youngman and others. Jimmy gets a slam-dunk. I get in the game at the end of the first half. The team we're playing is comprised of all black players, including my classmate Chuck. I say we should match up on defense. I want to match up with a heavier, more muscular man, who isn't one of the tallest guys on the team. It is tough to play the game: I'm rusty. I travel and the referee makes the call late, right at the end of the half. There are a lot of turnovers. The ball is thrown out of bounds a lot. Our coach yells at the referee for making the late call. The referee calls a technical foul on the coach. I jog into the locker room, and in doing so run on 1st Street and Home Avenue in Oak Valley. I go back and stop of the northwest corner of that intersection, where my neighbor Donald Branson used to live. I don't know the new people who live there. I knock on the door and a man answers it wearing a bathrobe. I say I just wanted to stop by because we haven't met. He says he has to urinate. He tells me we have met when I was walking down the alley behind our neighbors the Knife's house. I don't remember because I was drunk. I feel dumb because of this. I say I remember meeting him. He uses karate or tai chi to throw me up against a wall using his hand and the energy from it. I'm amazed by this power. My professor Jerry Rice is there. The three of us talk. Jerry tells us about a dream he had. I say, "One of those dreams...", meaning a big dream. Jerry had a dream before with a character of Harvey Gunner, the son of a hunting partner I have. The other man may be gay. He impresses me greatly. He asks me where I've heard of him, saying, "Newsweek?" I say yes, but I'm lying. I don't' remember. I was drunk, and embarrassed to say so.
