A man is talking to me. We are in a space where there is a double bed and an empty bookshelf, with old newspapers covering it up. I decide to go to bed and I crawl up the shelves and claw my way through the old newspapers to get to the shelf. I have a hard time, but finally get curled up on a shelf. It is uncomfortable. I cover myself with the newspapers, which look like the magazine pages for my collage art. The man is in the bed and he wants to get up and get something and apologizes to me for not being covered. I see his penis as he bends down to get something. He wants to know why I don't come to bed where it's more comfortable. I explain that Howard had been there so long that I'd gotten used to sleeping up on the shelf. It was better that way than be with Howard. I realize that I'd rather be in the bed even though this strange man is there and start to get off the shelf to go to bed. We'll just have to work out our relationship with each other after I get there.
