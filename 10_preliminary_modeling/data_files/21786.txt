I was lacing my shoes and my shoestrings were about 2 feet too long. I was trying to fix a broken electric wire on a post outside because I was afraid the kids would get shocked or electrocuted by playing with the wire. I touched the two wires and the electric was not on. I saw Boyage picked 1st in the selections.
