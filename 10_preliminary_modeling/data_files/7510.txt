Mary and I and some other people are in what appears to be a restaurant. I don't know these other people, and it seems we are in a South American country. Mary is dressed in an evening gown which is low cut, leaving her shoulders bare. I don't like the gown's style or color, but make no comment. Mary is very unhappy and I am most concerned about this. We both know she is ill. I suggest we leave the restaurant and go to a movie to get her mind off her sorrows. We go to where the movie theater is located. It is a very miserable place. It is in one of several one-story buildings which are made of corrugated iron. They are painted either gray or a very dull green. There are no doors or windows, so we can't find the entrance to the movie house. We wander around the outside looking for an entranceway. The place is completely deserted and no light comes from any of the buildings. There are tables in front of some of the buildings. On these tables we see empty glasses -- or partly empty glasses. It is as though people had been drinking wine before the movie began, then placed their glasses on the tables before entering the building. At one point in this dream I am cutting what appears to be coupons from a sheet of cardboard, all the while talking to Mary. I am trying to distract her from her sadness. I am not sure what I say to her, but think it was to the effect that there are other people in the world -- especially children -- who also have bad, or more serious problems.
