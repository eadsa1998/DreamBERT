I dreamt I was at Evie's property again. Lori and Kathy were there. I was supposed to take care of KathyÕs dog for awhile and stay at the house. The house had been changed a lot and Evie was there working on it. I got mad at Kathy because she said "I'd like to see CarlÕs room now" and I knew she was implying that he used to keep it very badly. I said I knew what she meant and how would she like it if I thought of her like "I wonder how Kathy is? I wonder if she's still a fag and a bitch?" I said I didn't want to take care of her dog since she was there anyway and didn't need me. She said she did want me to help with the dog. I said I didn't want to. I was sitting on the steps outside Evie's house -- not wanting to see Evie. The house was very ornate with beveled windows. Evie was vacuuming. She was upset and had been crying. I knew she wouldn't want me staying there and I didn't want to talk to her. Lori and Kathy said something about putting up facing in their room. I asked "inside or outside?" I was surprised when Lori said "inside." I asked what facing was and Lori said it would make the room padded. Susanne came along while I was sitting on the steps. She was cheerful and I felt annoyed, awkward.
