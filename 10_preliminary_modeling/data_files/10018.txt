I am very agitated talking to Mitchell: "You think I am crazy, don't you? The reason that I am seeing you is that I am crazy!"-- Then I leave with Frank, but we return to Mitchell's house; again I see Frank walk about naked and then he takes a shower and then he goes down to the kitchen. Somehow I can't get down to business with my analyst until we walk in the garden and we talk about growing plants; "When can I see you next?" I shout this as I push a baby stroller or lawn mower... no answer.
