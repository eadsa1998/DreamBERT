I dreamed I was in an elevator with a nun friend whom I love very much and a girl from school whom I haven't seen in a long time. We were going up, but suddenly the elevator's cable broke and I fell hard. I cried and screamed, but nobody said anything. They didn't move or say anything. The fall was quick and I thought I would get killed. I heard the crash, but nothing happened to me. I turned around and my friends had turned to cardboard. That is, they were just drawn figures. I thought I was mad. I thought my brother was playing a joke on me and I shouted for him to stop. But nobody answered until I fell into hysterical crying and I awoke. I was wet and felt I was breathing with difficulty.
