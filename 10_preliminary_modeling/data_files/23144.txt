Some guys were getting ready to play basketball in a gym.  They chose sides and one of them chose me.  Unfortunately, I didn't have shoes.  At first I thought I could play barefooted, but after testing it by running around a little bit, I realized that I would end up with blisters just like I did one time at my alma mater, so I asked them to wait until I ran and got my shoes from my dorm room.  It was already 20 till 10 at night, and they weren't very happy about waiting, but I went as quickly as I could to my dorm room.  Fortunately I was able to find it from memory.  When I got there, someone was asleep on the floor.  He woke up and said that he was only there temporarily.  I ignored him and tried to find my socks.  Time was slipping away as I hunted for them.  I think I finally found some, but was worried that the game might have started without me, or might even be over.
