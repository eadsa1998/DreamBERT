Some women decide I can look better and fix me up with a pair of sandals (like Birkenstocks) with special heel imprints so I can walk easily and a pair of jeans. I look real cute and sexy. I step outdoors. A man (Lee from Uni house) likes me and asks me to dance. It's a slow dance and it is very sensual. He holds me close and nibbles on my neck. I giggle and say, "Stop it." The music stops. He doesn't let go, saying, "Let's wait for the next song." I disengage myself from his arms. Another man wants to dance. It's a fast dance. I start to dance and he disappears. I continue dancing, enjoying it. There are mud puddles. I splash through. [BL]
