I was on the 'Tanner' farm (Full House) in a grassy field.  I went back towards the farm.  It was twilight and there was a lantern sitting on a deck at the farmhouse.  I left as part of a field trip.  We pulled into a gas station.  In the small mart I got a calculator, but had to get a small watch battery to go with it.  They didn't seem to have the right kind, so we went to another station.  Then somewhere else, I went to the bathroom.  A lot of old people were around.
