I was on a lighted stage--there was an audience which I saw as a dim blur of faces--and a glassed-in control room beyond--it was a radio program. The announcer cried in a loud voice a question (it was a quiz program) which I knew but couldn't think of the answer. "Spit it out, " he said with an exaggerated grin. With one part of me I looked on &amp; said calmly, "This is all foolish," but the part of me on the stage stood there--babbling nonsense syllables--&amp; laughing hysterically, &amp; all the people murmured &amp; looked embarrassed for me.
