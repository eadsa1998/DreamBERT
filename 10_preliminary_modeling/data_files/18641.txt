Joe had been living in my place. I had moved. A lady was talking about all the loose boards I had left all over the floor. They were 38" long, some of them. She said, "You didn't do much with the space, did you?" And I said, "No." She said, "Joe is now staying at the St. James." Corinne and I had climbed down off the roof and we were shopping at a place where they sold very, very old items in categories. Ladies hair bows with watches attached. They came in different sizes and ladies had worn them at parties many, many years ago. Some in the 1800's, and I wondered what good a watch was if they couldn't see it. Corinne already had her bag full and we were wearing the same kind of pants. Heavy blue work pants with ducks on the inside of the waistband. The waist was all stretched out on Corrine's because instead of keeping her hands in her pockets she hooked her thumbs over the waist of the pants. We got something big. She didn't have any more room to carry it so I offered to carry it in my bag. Cloth that had been folded up. In the barn yard, Bob was saying he wanted someone to make a film before they bulldozed the place. I said I would but what I wanted to film was him and it would not be nice. He had peed in the dirt under the trough of the barn yard and you could see the line wet in the dirt. I was given an office on the 4th floor of the church. I was the new chaplain for 1 year. The choir was singing. Little boys were spitting off the roof and I filled my mouth with toothpaste foam and went and spit back and we were all laughing and spitting at each other.
