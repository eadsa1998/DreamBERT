Earl and I are at a train station going to PORTLAND where children are putting on a play about going to heaven. They show a "pit" which is hell and a scene of being divided into teams... (one to heaven, one to hell?) Earl boasts about his speaking engagements and comes up to people who stand in line to shake his hand! When he comes to me, he kisses me on the cheek; I watch him leave with his suitcase and wave good-bye; he waves back. --shift: a slot machine which had not been locked properly, so I am able to open it up and a bunch of dimes tumble out....
