["Arrogant man."] I am in a house and getting ready to go on a trip. I am exhausted. I can't seem to see clearly. Things look dark and foggy. I step outside and wonder why it is so dark. Maybe I shouldn't go. I go back in. I decide it is important to go, so I pack and get on an airplane. I am at a window seat and the man on my right is talking with the man across the aisle. The remark on how ugly I look. I comment that I heard that. I call him an arrogant man. My feelings are hurt, but I am managing not to get too involved in bad feelings back at him.
