I was leading a group of people.  We were each supposed to take turns with a sort of demonstration.  I didn't really have one prepared.  They were talking something about dance, so I thought about showing them the dance instructor from my high school who did the capoeira, but of course I couldn't get a hold of him.  We drove around aimlessly for a while.  Then I saw my old math teacher Mr. Hodgkin.  I went over and tried to give him a hug.  He wasn't incredibly receptive, as if he didn't remember me.  He was getting Alzheimer's.  I went back afterwards and he was okay.  It had been a dream.  This was all outside his new apartment in which we'd helped him move into before in a previous dream.  I hugged him and sat next to him, and told him not to use aluminum deodorant.  He said he used to use corn, it was natural. He was holding a tube of natural toothpaste, too.  I left and introduced my group to him.  I sat and ate handfuls of corn amid noodles.
