I was on FilmForum. There were two entries for Mr Klein. One with no lists and the other with a static 'worst of' list by a critic. I was wondering how since it won a Cesar award and had Alain Delon in it. I was driving around Northtown and Midvale. There were cops behind me and they put their lights on and I went to pull over but they turned down a side street. There were heaps of other cops and I realised something was happening. I had been going 60 in a 50 zone so thought I was going to get a fine. Midvale shops was up the road from Northtown High School and I ended up at the school. There were job notices up. People kept asking who I was and I was like 'I don't go to highschool or know anyone except Farrah'. I saw Farrah a bit later.
