Mom, Ezra and I went to Red Rooster and we let this girl who was walking in front of us (in the drive thru). We ordered 3 chicken 'rolls' (actually wraps) and chips. We were waiting for like 40 minutes, apparently because the girl in front of us had ordered 10 burgers and they could only cook one patty at a time and they took 7 minutes each. Later we were at home. Some people were staying over, including the Hulk. We went into the bedroom for some reason and he was lying in bed (as Hulk) masturbating. We were like 'argh, Hulk!' and walked out and when we went back in he was back to normal (as Mark Ruffalo) and we talked to him briefly and left.
