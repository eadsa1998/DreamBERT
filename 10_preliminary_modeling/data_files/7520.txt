Mary and I are in bed making love. Mary is very much "into it," and very responsive as she was when she was alive. Then, for some reason, I become distracted and stop making love. I sit up in bed. Mary also sits up. This is when I recall getting a full frontal view of Mary, from head to waist. It is as though I am watching this scene from above, and from the foot of the bed. I don't know what prompted me to stop lovemaking. When I wanted to resume, Mary was reluctant to do so.
