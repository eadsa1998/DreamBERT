I was in a classroom at my school and was sitting in a circle with a teacher and a group of people. The teacher brought in some strawberries that were in a huge crate. None of them were ripe, but she didn't seem to notice. She passed them around for everyone to take a handful. Laura commented about them, but only I heard her. Then the teacher brought out really bruised peaches and passed them around too. "Anyone who likes to make sherbet, these work really well," said the teacher. "Peaches are my favorite fruit," I said to Zena. Later in the car, Leah's friend Mindy had gotten the extra peaches and was carrying them in a plastic bag. "Can I have one?" I asked. "Sure." "Can I?" asked Zena. "Yeah." "Can I?" Leah asked. "Leah, you already have two." "NO" said Leah, keeping the O on her lips. "Yeah, they're in that bag." Leah started sulking. "Come on you guys, hey, guess what?" said Terri. "I'm getting a new car." "When?" "Next week." "What kind?" "I don't know yet." Setting: In a classroom and in Terri's car. Characters: Zena, my friend. Leah, her little sister, sulks a lot. Terri, their mother, has a beat up Volvo. Laura, an old friend, likes to say bad things about people or objects. Teacher, someone at My school, don't remember who. Mindy, girl in second grade, barely know her. Class - I don't remember. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, appreciative. It could have happened, but I don't know why this particular group would be together.
