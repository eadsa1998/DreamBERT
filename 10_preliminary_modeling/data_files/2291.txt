I'm applying for a teaching job. I push a button outside the music room and a taped lecture comes on. I am embarrassed because I don't know how to turn it off and it's loud. I see a digital clock counting the minutes and seconds it will continue. I walk out of the building because there isn't anything else to do. I walk to a mental hospital for war-injured men. I go in and I'm dressed in a suit and heels and look pretty. The men whistle and tease. I look for the head nurse. She's nowhere around. The kitchen is unstaffed. I go talk to the men in their beds. One shares with me a box of papers, their secret plans. I am trusted by some. I need to protect them from the bad head nurse who is dressed in white and is cold to them. I have an argument with her about how the men need normal stuff around them. I am angry at her and run after her and hit her with the right cross fist. We roll on the ground and I'm slapping her tiny-sized head back and forth. Someone is worried I'll kill her, but I let her go, to leave forever. She refuses to change, so I make her leave.
