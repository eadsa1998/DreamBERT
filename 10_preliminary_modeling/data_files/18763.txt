I was working with Geraldo. First we had some work to do under water. We were cooking in covered pots. We would cook the next meal. Then I was doing design work for both our writing. When I finished I was typing and designing what I thought was his resume. But it was in Portuguese. I would do it in Trade Gothic Bold Condensed. I realized it would take longer to type and proofread in a foreign language. There was a big event at night we'd been working on with Marianna. We got there early before the crowd to set up. It was cold. No one had eaten. They made an announcement about sandwiches, cheese and 2 other kinds. It was clumps of old American cheese on hamburger buns. Re-used cheese. Packed in little balls. A blind man was walking with a seeing eye dog toward the event. At the road I asked him if I should hold his arm to help him, but he said that would just confuse him. He'd rather cross with just the dog. Inside the submarine I was making raisin bran in the microwave. The bowl was too high but I filled it anyway. With the rocking of the boat, cereal and milk had spilled all inside the microwave.
