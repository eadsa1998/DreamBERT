I only remember one scene. I was walking with a girl, who seemingly I had just met that afternoon (she was approximately 19 years old). All of a sudden Carmen passed by, crossing the street. I immediately left the girl I was with and went towards Carmen. This scene was accompanied by great affectionate, loving feelings.
