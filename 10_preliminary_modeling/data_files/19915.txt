A patient on the ward named White appeared in a dream carrying a dictionary. He said he could perform magic when the moon is full. I looked up and the moon was full, but the sky appeared to be solid matter and the moon appeared to be a hole in the sky. Later in a hospital, a patient who resembled a patient named Shepherd signed a petition of some kind to the hospital.
