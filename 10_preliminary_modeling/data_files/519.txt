I am in a house which has holes rotted through the floor. My youngest daughter watches me as a hole forms. She is frightened and falls backward and goes through another hole. I yell to her to fall on her back, not her head. She does, but then we don't go down to see how she is. When we do everything is silent. I can smell the mold. It is dark and dingy and we never get to see her.
