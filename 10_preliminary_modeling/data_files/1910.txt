I'm in a living room. A man likes me and sits close by me. I tell him no. He's not my type. I feel good that I can say that directly, but I sit there as he tenderly and needily strokes my face with his arm. I fall asleep. A man (Georgette Heyer hero) comes by and wakes me up. I think, "Ah! Finally! I'm halfway through the book and haven't met a man I like yet." This doctor is it. He takes me from the room to help preserve my reputation. He protects my reputation by lying to people. A girl has a small calico type short hair cat. I say, "Let me pet her. I'll bet I can tame her. She'll calm down and we'll like each other." I stroke her gently. I notice a small bald spot on her back like a sore healing.
