I was doing a quest on Runescape. I had to fight this hard demon/dragon which hit like 18's at first. I couldn't log out while doing the quest, so I just left it logged in at this place for hours. I had my axe with me so I went back to the bank and couldn't find my whip or battle axe. Then in real life, I had to do an exam. I couldn't find the stuff I needed for that either. I had two pieces of vegemite toast. It was 38 minutes past whatever time, and I was late. Earlier, I was at home and Mom had been on my Runescape account and I asked her how she got in when she didn't know my password. She said she did and I said what is it then and she said "I love Eugene" and I went quiet and asked how she knew that and she wouldn't tell me. I said that I used crushes for passwords. Ezra and Dad were there too.
