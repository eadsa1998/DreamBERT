Farber asks me if that is a compound engine that is passing. I tell him "Yes." The engine is a Mallet with 6 drivers (in 2 sets of 3 each) on each side. The engine is shiny and clean, and looks brand new. Farber goes on to say that he is now getting about 2 cents per mile from his car [Note: doesn't make sense, but seemed to be what he said] I then do a little mental arithmetic; evidently to compare my own experience with his; this involves multiplying 4 x 2 1/2, giving one 10. I then seem to have good reason to answer Farber, "No, not so good." <br/
