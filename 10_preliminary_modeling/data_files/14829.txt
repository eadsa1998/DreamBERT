I watched the new Twilight movie and it had left out this awesome scene from the book (in which a monster had attacked someone). I watched it with Ezra. There was something about some stuff going into the sun. I did some puzzles about celebrities and you had to find movies in a word search. Darren answered the door and it was Clayton. He said he would offer $3 to stay over. I went to look for Gizmo and she was out the front but the house looked different when you turned your head the other way. I told Mom and she wasn't bothered by it. Then they went out to do it. I saw Dad and he said 'thanks for the help' and I said  "What? I'm having a shower?" and he said "Oh. Take the steam cleaner to the oval to get rid of the dog poo with Ezra and Emery". I thought it was random.
