Someone told me he was going to play Bob's birthday. He thought he would win next time. I was out locking the car and two couples came up to me and said, "Do you know me?" I looked at them and said no. They said they were hillbillies from PA.,  Eddie's friend. I said, "Yes, I know him." I was going into the house and Switcher had a light behind the garage and he was getting coal for the furnace. There was a coffee cover on the porch. I shook out the coffee grounds. I saw a little worm like or insects. A frog came up and took one into his mouth, but let it go. Ann and Bob wanted to step on a cricket, thinking it was a cockroach. Ann saw Doctor Allen. She touched some instrument he used on a man and she got the disease he had. I told her to get treatments for her nose also. I thought I had my shoes off, so I flew around.
