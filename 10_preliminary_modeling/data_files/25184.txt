 I'm in outer space. A shuttle blasts off. The people I am with clap and cheer. Annie is on the shuttle. People are floating in the air. We lose sight of the shuttle because of a rotating planet. It might come back later. My old teammate Ron Lind is there. He has a sweater. The sleeves of the sweater are different shades of yellow. We are floating. I move around, trying to rid myself of something.
