I was in a dark room, in the room I was sleeping in (in waking life). I was at a friend's cabin, I had been for a few days. I was with some people I was getting to know better, get more comfortable with. And in the group was also a guy, who I grew somewhat attracted to, wanted him to be. Anyhow, he appeared in my dream, it surprised me. I was lying down and he appeared.
