I dreamt I had a date with my ex-husband. Before the movie we met at a drugstore lunch counter and had bacon, lettuce, tomato sandwiches. While we were sitting there, he started a quarrel about something I can't remember but I know it was petty. Then he walked out. So I bought a box of popcorn and went to the movie alone. It was a downtown theater and an usher seated me as if the seats were reserved. The movie "Hansel and Gretal" was playing. At the back of the show were tables, as if it were a first-class restaurant, so I went back there to sit with my younger sister (20) and my older married sister (26). The waiter helped me off with my coat and I sat with them but we didn't order anything to eat. I remember that it was snowing and slushy outside and we all wore boots. The alarm woke me before the movie started but I vaguely recall that it had suddenly turned to summer and we were out on a terrace.
