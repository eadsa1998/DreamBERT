I got taken to some place after university. There were lots of people there and some groups were wearing uniforms. They were teenagers. I sat down and Calvin was there. I was like 'where the hell are you and what are we doing' and he said he didn't know. He said something I didn't hear and he stared, waiting for a reply. I went off at one point and the rooms were confusing. Farrah was there and she was trying to hide from some woman but she came in and caught her. I was then at Dad's old house but it was different. I was in my room but it was windy and it broke the back door (it was flimsy). I wondered how Dad had lived here. I got up and closed all the doors.
