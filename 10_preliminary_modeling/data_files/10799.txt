There is a fellow on campus who keeps asking me for dates even though I have constantly refused him. I dreamed he was waiting for me outside very classroom and wouldn't leave me alone. If I went to Hayden, he was there. I sat with a group of sorority sisters and he moved in at the table, embarrassing me by asking me for a date.
