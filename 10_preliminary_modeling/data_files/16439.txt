I had kind of a typical dream, something you would expect from somebody who has a class that they're going to the next day. I was dreaming that I was up at the right time and all and waiting for the cab, but instead of the cab coming for me, Melinda and Chelsea showed up at the door, and Mom and I got in their van thing, and we were riding along and Melinda and Chelsea decided to take us to Mr. Denton's house. Mr. Denton was my economics teaching in my senior year that, I don't know, he thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all his kids were really kind of "blah" anyway, and so was his class. And so he thought I was just so intelligent and so wonderful, but anyway, we went to Mr. Denton's house and they took a bunch of pictures. And he still had his Christmas things up. And we, I was looking at his little village scene set up things and they were really cool. And then we went to the beach, of all places. And we bummed around at the beach, and we were talking about various different things, I can't remember what. And then finally they decided that they were going to take me back to class, and I got there in time for Speech class, but I had totally skipped Ethics class. And I was trying to persuade Mom not to show the pictures from Mr. Denton's class to Dad because he would know that I skipped Ethics class. And I think Mom and Melinda and Chelsea were going to go somewhere and they were going to come back for me for lunch, but I woke up before any of that happened. Oh, and I dreamt that I was real afraid because the cab people were going to say I was a no-show, so they'd automatically cancel the return trip, and so Mom and Melinda and Chelsea were going to come and get me and we were going to go have some more fun after my class. And then I woke up.
