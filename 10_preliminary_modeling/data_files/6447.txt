My family is staying in this really fancy hotel in the middle of a huge city. They offered to let me stay there for free, so of course I agreed to come along. I can't remember much of the "plot", such as it was, but I remember a few details: The main stairwell was blocked at both ends by this wierd fence thing, presumably to keep infants off the stairs. It was beyond me, though, so it succeeded in keeping me off the stairs as well until somebody showed me how to climb under it. As I got up the stairs, though, I found my way blocked by a net thing that folded over three steps. I picked it up and played with it a bit. Suddenly I noticed the crown at my feet. Of course! It's a tiara! The best way to get from room to room (if you were sure of your footing) was by climbing from porch to porch. Once I climbed into the wrong people's room and created much havoc. I was in my room at one point, thinking of taking a shower. I got a phone call from some woman. "Hi David," she says, and goes on talking like she knows me real well. I have no idea who it is. "Tell ya what," I say. "How about I meet you in the lobby down there in half an hour? I'll be reading a book." <br/
