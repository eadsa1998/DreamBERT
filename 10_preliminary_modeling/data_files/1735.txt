Lucy comes to me and we are supposed to sell the rest of the leftover hot dogs, but I don't want to encroach on the neighbor again. I feel he has some right to not want us on his property. So Lucy says, "Shall I rub your ears and brush your hair?" I say, "Oh yes. Thanks. I would love that." Rochelle stands there and wants us to get to work and not waste time just being pleasurable.
