I had a very bad dream. Something I would call a nightmare. My sister Sascha was visiting me where I live. She was walking with me through Mission Hill and suddenly someone started chasing us. We went from house to house and could not get away from him. We were running. He caught up and stabbed my little sister in the back with a huge blade. I screamed, "No!!" and then woke up.
