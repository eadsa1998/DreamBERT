I come home to my apartment after being gone a week (perhaps Xmas at M City.) Dovre is there. I see the place is a mess. I need to find something and can't, too much stuff to look through. I then see a huge turkey on the kitchen counter. It is bubbling with toxic bacteria because it was left out all week and uncooked. What a waste. I tell Ellie to throw it out. I am annoyed with her for leaving it out. I ask what this huge boxed set of food stuff is from. She says it's from _____. I start looking at what's in it. There are some interesting things I might like.
