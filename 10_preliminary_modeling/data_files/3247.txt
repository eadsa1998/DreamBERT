I have a crazy mother and a rich, distant father who owns a business. I have a boyfriend who is a good-looking man physically, but not so smart; not stupid, just ordinary. I am laying on top of him, kissing him and enjoying the close physical connection. I say something like, "Too bad you're not as smart as me," and then feel embarrassed at the disclosure. I smile, caught, and confess. I say, "I guess I think my being so smart is something special" (not those words, but that feeling). He laughs at my silliness. He tells me my father gave him a job. I am glad. He's to be a waiter in the club. My crazy mother comes by and starts to be crazy and then remembers his name and behaves herself. I am impressed. She must really like him to have done that.
