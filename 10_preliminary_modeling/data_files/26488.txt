 I'm delivering papers for my morning paper route. I ride a bicycle with training wheels. The roads are slippery: icy. It's winter. I don't have a list of the houses so I try to remember which houses I delivered to on a regular basis. I deliver to several houses on Bauer, Holy, and Delivery Avenues in Oak Valley. I ride on Next Avenue, going southward on the east sidewalk. I ride into a fence that is between Dinks' old house and the white house to the north of it. I hit the fence and then restart and ride on. Mr. Dinks is out in his yard and sarcastically comments to me, "Didn't see the fence, huh?" I reply very bluntly, "No, I didn't." I really didn't see the fence.
