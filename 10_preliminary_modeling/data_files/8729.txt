I went to the CAS office to retrieve something I had left there. Bill C needed to leave so I told him I would let myself out. He didn't seem to be okay with that. I became very angry and lashed out at him about not trusting me and how I don't deserve that mistrust and never have. He didn't say much, though I could tell he wasn't totally convinced. He did, however, finally decide to leave and allow me to let myself out when I was finished. It looks like I'm someplace other than the CAS office and there are quite a few people around. They seem to be getting ready for a costume party. Brian F is there and I see him walk into the men's room wearing nothing but a Tarzan type g-string. I told him if he was going to wear that I would not have anything to do with him. He assured me he wasn't going to. Later it seems that it was someone else wearing that costume. I'm now standing by a soft drink vending machine. For some reason I decide the money needs to be emptied out and deposited. I take it out and put it in a bank bag. I was going to put a note on it and put it in Jennifer C's desk drawer. Then I realized that she and Bill C both might get upset with me for doing her job. I didn't know what to do then. I realized how long I had been there and that I better leave. If Bill C finds out how long I was there he will distrust me more and be angry with me.
