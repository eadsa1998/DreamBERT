 A man who is a hick wins the lottery and becomes stingy. He holds a press conference in a hotel and part of it involved him saying something about how he has been able to pass on his fortune rather sneakily. He was able to pass it on quickly to his heirs without dying, I think. I go into the hotel. I find and pick up a trail of money. I puck up bills of the denominations: $1, 5, 10, 20, 45, and $90. There are also traveler's checks. They are in square sheets of four and need to be separated to use. Each check is worth $45. The area is mall-like, circular, with two floors. There are two other guys around when I pick up money. One of them is helping my by telling me when I can pick up money and when I can't because a security guard is watching me. The other guy is also picking up money. I tell my competitor that we'll alternate piles: I get one, he gets one, I get one, etc. Then there are no more piles of money. I find two king-size Snickers bars. I play cards. We start out with two people. The guy I'm playing with wants to play Kings in the Corner. Then a lady comes. We have three people, and are going to play three-way war. Two more people come. We play hearts, and I teach them how. Two of the people are old ladies.
