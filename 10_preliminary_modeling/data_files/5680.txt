[1997-06-22] This is kind of humorous, a lovely couple that I know, Bill and Barbara, Barb is just the sweetest lady, good sense of humor, love to be around her, so the incongruity of this is kind of funny: I was sitting in a chair holding a baby girl, and I guessed that she was about 8 months old. I was talking to the baby and I referred to her as "Little Party Girl" and I am sure I meant it as a word of endearment, Barbara's reaction was just completely baffling to me. She took the baby from me very gently, but her voice was rather testy and she said "I'll take her now. No party girl!"
