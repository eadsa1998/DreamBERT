[After nap.] I was sitting on a bench somewhere, and sitting next to a guy.  A guy came and sat down on my left.  I couldn't tell if it was my old elementary school classmate Oscar, or my schoolmate who had committed suicide, Tod Carpo, or who.  For whatever reason, though, I leaned towards him and he kissed me.  He wanted open mouth, but I refused.  We sat there and cuddled.  I felt the guy behind me was jealous, in that he could have tried that before this guy came along.  I felt the boy in my arms, and the one behind me.  I woke up and it was stuffed animals in my arm and a blanket on my legs.
