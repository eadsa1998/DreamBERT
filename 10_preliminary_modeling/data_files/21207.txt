I dreamed I could honk like a big swan and I seemed to honk a little better than they could. One came in to challenge me to a fight. I was sort of backward of the jab of the swans' bills, but I took the chance and when he made a lunge at me, I would get him with the sole of my shoe on the bill. He made a few lunges at me and I always got him. Then he got mad and took a good start and made a lunge at me and I caught him with my shoe again. Then he tried another big start, but he changed his mind as he came close and saw I was ready for him. He turned away and finally surrendered. I was the winner. So the swans lined up and honked for stray swans to come in out of the dark. I was driving up a long hill. Someone was ahead of me and I tried to catch them, but they got ahead of me and thru the green light. Ann and I were taking a stroll. I told Barbara I was going to play stroll and she said not to. Then changed her mind and said, "Okay, you can if you want to," It was night and Ann and I went into the house. I locked the doors. We went to a place where Andy Palider had a big hole dug and the boys had a cave dug into solid rock. Ann said, "Why didn't they make the cave higher?" and I said it was high enough. The arch they shaped it to was to strengthen it from a cave-in.
