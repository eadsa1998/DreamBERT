[1997-07-15] I heard Sandra calling me but this time I heard anger in her voice and she said "I'm glad I hurt you and all the family, I don't care if I live or die, I know I was told when I was in the hospital, that I was in bad condition because I hadn't been eating right and that there was something wrong with my chest, but I don't care and I don't miss any of you either." There were tears in my eyes and I jerked awake and realized that maybe this was true and I just felt miserable.
