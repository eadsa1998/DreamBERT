I was in the parking lot of a mall. I was with my friend Donald, an old friend Ed and an unknown. We were sitting at a picnic table and a waiter came out of the mall to take our food order. We both ordered some sort of fried seafood, scallops or clams or something. It arrived after a long while and the portions were very small. I had my own plate and the three guys shared one plate. After we were done, we ordered four cups of crab bisque soup. Then the scene changed and we were in a different part of the same parking lot and my friend Rachel and two more unknowns were there. An old friend Joan showed up. She and I had a confrontation; she said something mean to me, and I told her I didn't want to speak to her. We all ate crab bisque soup.
