Ezra and I ended up at this house. We had $20 on us and a bag of stuff. This guy there went psycho and I had a low battery on my phone and no credit. We had this 4-wheeler that was really slow. The guy chased us and we gave him a heap of coins. All of a sudden we were at this place in the Gold Coast. I was in pajamas? Ezra, psycho dude and a few others were there too. This lady let me use the phone and I called Mom and I asked her what year it was, and she replied 2270. We somehow got back. Mom came with the police and they had my diary.
