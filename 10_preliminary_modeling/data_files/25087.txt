 There is a news broadcast about paintball. I see a man with a paintball gun firing paintballs. There is a news van there. I have a small tube the side of a toilet paper tube, with which I am shooting paintballs which don't go very fast. The van and the action go away. An ambulance goes by. A woman says to go to 50th or 51st Street. She speeds off and we try to follow her. I am having a lot of trouble with the car I am driving, which may be my mom's car. I have a drunken friend in the passenger seat. I am by my home in Oak Valley. My friend Matt Yams and I are on bikes. We turn from 1st Street onto Home Avenue going north. There is heavy traffic. I get behind a vehicle with a boat. It slows and pulls over to the right, without brake lights. I realize the person driving is my dad. I think to go past him on the left, looking in the boat as I do to see if he got any fish. Matt rides off to the alley of the block between Home and Next Avenues. He's going north. I stop my dad, pulling him over to the right. I am on the sidewalk on the right side of the car. I tell my dad that Matt is around the corner and we're going to pick him up and go fishing. My dad says okay.
