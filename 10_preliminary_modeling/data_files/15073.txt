I was watching Chuck. Casey went to a poker game after an argument with Chuck. Chuck came to lend his poker skills, as he was really good and Casey wasn't. Casey was using his eyes to signal to Chuck what to do (pushing up, pulling up etc). Some caught them out and he admitted to it and apologized. He started singing to Chuck by opening his mouth a little and the sound was almost like 'baa!'. Chuck laughed.
