 I'm catching chickens. The people with me are inexperienced. I don't remember all the precise duties of a catcher, and all the exact procedure. The setup is different. There are different size drawers, and a different number of chickens go in each drawer, than what I remember. We don't do a good job: we are slow and incompetent. We regroup later and try again in a different setting. At one point marble-sized bits of white fluff are put in a small drawer to fill it. These bits of fluff are the chickens. I'm assigned to one of two groups.
