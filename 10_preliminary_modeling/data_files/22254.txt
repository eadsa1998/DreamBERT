I dreamed about a girl I didn't know. She was very nice and pretty. Well, I was an actor and a great singer. I was so popular that all the girls came over to talk to me and ask for my autograph, but she didn't come over to me, which surprised me. I went over to her and saw that she had a horrible face and I got scared and woke up.
