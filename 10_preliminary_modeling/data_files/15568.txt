I got a message from Benjamin on the forum. He said he watched Summer With Monika and liked it and gave it a 9/10. He said he was going to post that comment on Facebook and I hoped he was returning to Facebook but figured it just made a mistake. Then it was night and I was at work. This guy was fixing something for inside customers. I accidentally took the tomatoes with me and then Darren ordered some of them for dinner and I hold him not to and was worried I would get caught out.
