I have asked R. to my hotel so that she too may see Luther and his wife. Had to remake bed because the maid has put the brown and white spread, I use as a mattress cover on top of the blankets. Just as finishing, R. says it must be their auto that has just driven up. I look out can't turn the Venetian blinds so as to see but do see soon after about a dozen tourists coming up the stone steps. Then Luther and Roselle come in. Roselle tells of her planned trip home via Europe. I ask what about Luther and their son. She says their son will stay with Luther. Just then the clerk brings in three tourists who will sleep in my room. I hurry in and see that they have pushed in two beds, moved mine, added green curtains. I protest but she insists my room is larger than hers. Go to talk to Luther some more, bothered because his wife's name is really Frances. The waiter brings in trays for the tourists. I ask if regular residents are not expected to eat in the dining room. He says, "Yes." Wonder if I can take 2, no 3, because R. is there too, guests with me. When I have asked because it's 5 p.m. nearly time to eat. Then I wonder if when making the  tourist's beds, they used my blankets and go to see. Look in the beds and in the second one find two blankets, pull them out, thinking I will not remake the bed. Tell the tourists at least they must not sit in my room. but in the common rooms and go downstairs to tell the management. Suddenly I have no clothes on but the blankets are cover enough to go downstairs. I am outdoors, my room is on the 4th floor but I stop on the first to complain and insist on a refund. One of the tourists is sitting behind the desk and she says she doesn't like the arrangement either.
