I'm on a train, taking a trip. When I got on I had several pieces of luggage with me. When the trip was over I got up and attempted to get my luggage down but all the suitcases were gone and my stuff was scattered all up and down the luggage rack. I had to run up and down the aisle collecting my clothes in a garbage bag.
