I'm at Mom's house - bedroom. I've put stuff on her bed and there's already a large pile of her laundry on it - room is mostly green - Mom and Marcy are at work. I'm doing something in another room, it's a sunny room, living room or den. (Don't remember what I'm doing.) Suddenly I have to leave, or at least it's time to get my stuff picked up before M and M come home. I go back in the bedroom and start to grab stuff but I get hold of her laundry and mess it up. Very frustrating. They come home before I get finished anyway. There's no trouble, actually. We say something to each other but I don't know what.
