I turned down a brass bar and another fellow turned down another bar. He was instructor in an industrial school. My bar was a little darker where it was turned down than the other bar. I was saying or heard the second selection. Now I can't recall it. It was in the first or second race at Detroit track was going to win his race. I can't recall the name. I was driving and there were a lot of traffic lights where we had to make stops. I drove down a hill and it was icy. I had to make a sharp turn on the bottom and I made it.
