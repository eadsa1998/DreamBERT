["Saving Al Gore."] 3 FBI agents grab me in a car. They are trying to kill Al Gore. I am smashing their heads together and smashing them against the windows to knock them out. I am seated in the front seat just to the right of the agent driving. I smash him unconscious against the drivers side window. I am driving, trying to make it back to E City to tell the police. I threaten to drive us into a crash if they persist in pulling on me. I am driving very fast. I finally knock out the driver and the one in the backseat behind the driver but the one in the backseat to the right keeps regaining consciousness and grabbing at me. I pull his hair, hit his face and smash him around. I miss the exit and get lost. Finally I am driving on a dirt muddy road in the woods. Then I find the police. I get out yelling these agents were trying to kill the VP. An ambulance stretcher comes to take the VP away. I have saved him.
