I married my brother Jake. We were getting the furniture packed. Some of it was to be put in the "little house," (the house next to my parents'), and some taken to M City. My parents and sister were there to help. We only had a weekend for a honeymoon as on Monday, I had to be back to work on school. Then, we were sitting in the car going over the mountain. Then there was a big truck with our things in it. Someone was going to drive it for us. The driver went away. For some reason, Jake couldn't drive the truck, so I was saying, "Maybe I can do it, hon," and he said, "No, it's too hard for you." Then I said, "See, I can try." I got in and tried to drive it. I couldn't get it to stop. The brakes wouldn't hold, so it would slowly roll. Chuck was around helping move furniture. Then I got the truck to stop and Jake started yelling, "I'm bleeding to death!" I grabbed his hand and ran up the wooded hill. My father and my brother Dwight ran to him to see if it was so. I was thinking, "He's probably exaggerating." He came back and Dwight tried to put a pressure bandage on him. I was holding Jake and soothing him. I said, "Hon, relax. I'll take you to the hospital." "No," he said, "...got to get the bleeding to stop." My brother Dwight fainted. I looked at Jake's wound. I saw lots of orange blood but no continuous flow that indicated an artery or vein was cut. I tried to get him on the back of the motorcycle. Then I yelled, "Get him in the car! I'll be right back!" I felt a coughing seizure coming on and I ran for the house to get a glass of water thinking I'd grab it, get in the car, and drive Jake to hospital. I woke up coughing. Oh, earlier in the dream, I was teasing Chuck because he had clips and pin curls in his hair. He teased back and said, "How else can you have curly hair at work that everyone admires." He said that he was partial to saffron yellow now (somehow meaning that he was in love with Valerie).
