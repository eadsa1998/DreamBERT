I've come to see Trisha but she's not home - I either need to pick something up or leave something. She's living in this smashing house that's not in a residential area but, as if you were in a small town with a small downtown area, like it was near the middle of that, next to like doctors' offices and that. The house is modern, maybe with stone walls or something, very high ceilings, lots of plants hanging and standing, open spaces broken up by dividers. I let myself in to do what I came for and I also need to pee. The toilet is not in its own room but in the bedroom area, and it has an extra lever - I don't know what it's for, but I pull it just to see, thinking it might have a bidet function or something. What it does is let down this fine mist from above, right in front of you as you sit on the toilet. It's very nice but I still don't know what it's meant to accomplish. There's a cat here, too, a nice gray striped one, who comes up to visit. While I'm still sitting, Trisha comes home. I wonder if she'll be okay with me coming like this, but she doesn't mind. (She actually came in very quietly and I was startled when she appeared suddenly.) Her hair is different - she's let the tail loose and maybe gotten a permanent, it's falling to her shoulders, fluffier and curlier - very pretty - I hadn't realized that so much of her hair was braided into the tail. Also while I'm here, Lynnette comes in - we've seen her park her car and come to the house through the big plate glass windows. Trisha tells me she's changed her name. [Can't remember to what.] She just got tired of the old one.
