I was still in Spain, and that we were still in the apartment thing. And the apartment thing was really much blander than the one that we had, although you can't get much blander than that. The girls came and went without me, as usual. Anyway, we were talking about going to this little school at night, and afterwards going to this theme park. And then we were at the school and Aretha Franklin and this other lady named Elizabeth were going to show us how to cook something, and then they started showing us how to cook it. And everybody was like zoning off and wanting to go to sleep and wanting to not pay attention, but then I remember going on a roller coaster that everybody was talking about, and you held onto some orange handles. And you would go down for a long ways and you'd go upside down and around and all over. And we never did get to the theme park. I woke up first.
