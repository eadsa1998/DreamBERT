I go to the bathroom. A young boy is playing nearby and drags his plastic toy through the urine. I tell his mother and then take it to the sink to clean it. As I do so, Lydia comes over. She looks horrified and says, "Oh! There's a louse." She sees two or three on the sink and my hand. She looks at me. I say, "I don't have lice!" She is suspicious of me. I walk out to the car. My "man" is there. We sit in the back seat together with some of Lydia's kids.
