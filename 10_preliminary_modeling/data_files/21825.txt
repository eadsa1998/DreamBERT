We were standing on a street and the water from a rainstorm was running down the street. The street was full of water. I looked way down and one side of the street the water was running over the sidewalks. We went down there and to our surprise the water seemed to stop and we looked to see where the water went and there seemed to be nowhere it went into, a sewer or nothing. It just stopped there and beyond it the pavement was dry. We were leaning on one of the old buildings by White's and the building was vibrating or shaking. I looked up and I noticed one of the slabs on the top move a little, so I said, "Let's move away, one of those slabs might fall down on us." I looked and there was a new railroad built thru the valley down White's. A new double track went down to the river and up the hill to West 25th St. We were looking into some pond. I could see some fish swimming around. I saw some weeds in the water. I pressed it with a broom and fish swam away from the weed. I pulled it up and there were some dead fish. I squeezed in the bush. I saw a woman riding some kind of cart. She was wearing a ribbon in her hair. I said, "That's a man," and she heard me say this. So she stopped and said, "That's a man."
