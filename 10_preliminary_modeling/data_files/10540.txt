MARY LOU (Frank's friend) is living in a room at our house with her young daughter. Frank is getting ready to leave on a trip; he is packing his suitcase; very busy. He is unwilling to give me his itinerary. I keep asking, but get no answer. Finally I knock on Mary Lou's door and ask her; she seems to have at least one of his addresses. She also gives Frank a large package --two presents. He unwraps one of them and finds a pair of pyjamas!! Will he wear them? He forgets to unwrap the second package and is in a rush to leave.
