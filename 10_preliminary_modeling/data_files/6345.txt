I was driving to Jack's and it was at night. When I pulled up, Bonnie's car was parked in front. There was an electrical cord leading from her car to the house. I think I thought she was charging her battery. The house I was at was Jack's, but it was laid out differently. When I walked in, there were these two girls in the front room talking about face lotion. One girl was really fat and had red hair and I am not sure about the other one. They were trying to decide which lotion was the best. I said that I liked Chanel Base Matte. One of the girls said that it was good, but she didn't like it because it covered up too much. Then one of the girls was my friend Rachel, who just appeared. Then on TV was a Chanel infomercial. They were selling a kit of Chanel makeup.
