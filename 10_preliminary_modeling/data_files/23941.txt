I found myself in the middle of two warring tribes. Someone had once told me that if I befriended one that I would be safe - so I did. They were in the middle of fighting - throwing these super super thin and long spears with poison darts on the ends. The ends were also like a fish hook, you know how it snags. I was in between two buildings - a sort of alley way. The bad guys only wore loin cloths and were striped black and white from head to toe. Someone was throwing a lot of arrows at me that I was able to avoid. Every once and awhile a striped guy would throw a big poison stick. It was scary since I dont know how to throw but I managed to collect the arrows that were thrown at me and throw them back and kill a few guys. <br/
