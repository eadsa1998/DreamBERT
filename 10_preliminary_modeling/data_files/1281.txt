I am observing Dovre in her 1st grade class. It's music time and I am given a drum to play. So is Dovre. She has a base drum. Mine is more of a snare drum. The teacher brings me a clump of black and white beaded necklaces all clumped together. I help her try to unravel one black necklace out of it. We succeed. I now do a solo on my drum singing in front of the class.
