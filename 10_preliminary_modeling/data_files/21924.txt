I was driving. Carl Fisher was with me. I had my old 29 Ford. I got stalled in the center of the street and I couldn't move. I couldn't get the car in gear. So we left it there and I went to see if I could find a garage and have it towed off the street. I was about a block away and looked around and there were two policemen by my car. One was writing out a ticket. They were gone when I got to the car. I had a ticket on the wiper. I got in the car and the traffic was heavy. A streetcar was behind me, waiting for me to get out of the way. He came close and moved my car a little. I finally put it in reverse and drove to the curb backwards. Eddy P. from Dill's came over. He got in my car with Carl and he drove. I was walking on the city street nude, not a stitch of clothing on. I was embarrassed. I had my arms folded and bent over to cover my sex organs.
