There is a woman faith healer. A crowd is gathered around her. I go up close and lie down on the cool sand right in front of her to listen. I make a pillow with the sand. She is a forceful preacher. Suddenly, she reaches out and places her hands on my face to heal me. She is powerful. I feel her intensity. I see religious scenes of Jesus and I know that it is working. I weep for joy and say over and over, "Oh yes! Please heal me! Please work!" I cry and cry. Later, I get up and walk away from the crowd, testing my joints for pain. It's gone. I also need to pull away from the preacher. I don't want to be mesmerized and be a follower. I do it with respect. (Before I left the crowd, I felt them all around me. I tried to stretch out my legs but I couldn't. I looked and could only see a "sea" of starched sheets. That's what they wore).
