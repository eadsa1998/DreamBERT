["Spider woman ritual."] I apparently have a Mexican father named Jamisma and a Native American mother. I am accused to stealing a special bridal dress of a native American woman. I say I am innocent. They are very angry at me. Now my "father" shows me a large silver broach filigree work and a center turquoise stone. Caught under that broach is a huge spider. My "father" is afraid to touch it or let it crawl on him. I am too. I watch it closely when it moves, afraid it will come at me. After a long time doing that, my "father" then allows it to crawl on his shoulder. He says the spider is mostly dead now. Maybe completely dead. He asks me where we should put it. I say put it in the garbage can. If it is alive, it can feed on the food there and survive. He agrees, He thinks of piercing it's center colored spot on the belly to put it out of its misery. But if it has a chance to live, he agrees to let it try. He takes it out. I then go into a room. The ritual ceremony is about to begin. My "mother" begins it. She moves around me, talking. There is some large cannon shaped object that my "father" positions and fires off. A lot of stuff floats down from the shot. It is positioned several times and fired. I am concerned the spider will return. Now the angry Native American girl glares at me and demands I return the bridal dress for her ceremony. I look at her and say empathetically "I understand." But I can't return it. I didn't take it. Apparently there was some accident that happened to it, and that may have happened because of me. But the girl wants retribution.
