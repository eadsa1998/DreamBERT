I realize that there is more to our new house in this new state than I had previously explored.  There is an upstairs, for one thing.  Apparently someone else is living there, because when I go up, there is a children's room at the top of the stairs, and children's things are all about.  There are a lot more rooms, and some of them have large windows in them; there are people seated on furniture on the other side of them.  At first I think there is another house adjoining ours, and the windows are between them, but then I realize that they are simply between rooms in the same house.  There is also a third level, beneath the main level.  There is a bathroom which has a bathtub which is narrow and deep enough for one person to stand up waist deep in water; there is also a hot tub in that room.  Down the hall there is a swimming pool.  At first it appears that the ceiling is too low for people to raise their heads above the water, but then someone turns on the lights and I see that the illusion was created by a single low pipe at head level near the door to the pool.  The house is fabulous, and even though it is much larger than my wife Anita and I need, I tell her that at $290K it is a bargain, and we should stretch our budget to buy it.  Now she is the reluctant one; she doesn't want all the additional space.  I want to discuss it with her, but she is talking to a friend in the living room, and there is a black choir practicing outside and we have two open windows with no glass in them, so it is too noisy to talk.  I put two cushions in one of the windows, but they don't completely fill it, and I have nothing with which to fill the other one.  <p
