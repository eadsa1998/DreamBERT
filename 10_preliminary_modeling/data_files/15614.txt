I was at a video shop. I was looking at the horror movies and counting the ones I'd seen, only 5-6 I hadn't. They had Children of the Corn III on VHS. Ezra was counting the ones he'd seen as well and he'd only seen lots of new ones. Grave Encounters was there. One movie was called Absolum: Mega [something]. I had had a dream about it and Donald Sutherland was in it. I thought it was weird and told Mom and showed her the dream over the phone. They had the Demonic Toys soundtrack and I said "oh another movie with Daniel Cerny".
