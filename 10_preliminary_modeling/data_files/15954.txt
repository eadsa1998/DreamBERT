I was talking to Fletcher on Facebook and he said that he needed an "esoteric future" and that I was a "sacred mound". I didn't know what he meant but the other stuff he was saying sounded like he was 'breaking up' as friends, so I was confused and annoyed. Later his profile said it had been deactivated but I also had a friend called Joe Walker or something which I assumed was his account.
