I dreamed I met an old friend, Phil Lancione, from undergraduate school whom I haven't seen in a long time. We were out driving around town in his red Alfa Romeo. He let me drive and I was driving around where he wanted to show me how it cornered. I took several corners and he said it would taken them faster. I went around the block to try the corner again. I was shifting well and the car felt good. When we approached the corner, he said I could take it faster. I put the car in second gear and floored the gas. The car seemed to be set up just right for the corner, but as we got in too far to change the course of events, the car accelerated unreasonably fast, even after I took my foot off the gas, and we slid off the street onto a golf course. I backed off the golf course with no harm done.
