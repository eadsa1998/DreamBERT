I had the dream in which we did a play of jumping out of an airplane in battle; it was a funeral production.  We practiced in the living room.  My classmate Louisa and some others were there.  Then I met with a friend, blackish hair and an oblong face, a black tee shirt.  My 10th grade English teacher Ms. Erlstrom's son (read about him in the newspaper).  My badminton teammate Jon was on the bus; it was his father's funeral.  And then an online acquaintance Jason happened to be on the bus.  Thinner face, no dimples, and more rugged looking.  He may not have been him.  The vice principal's son, perhaps?  I gave him a hug but it was awkward.  Then at someone's apartment I met roommates; a girl with long flowing curly blondish red hair.  Said, "Hey Em..."  "Mickey" had darker brownish blonde hair.  Moustache, and maybe a goatee.  He had a high pitch giggle.  Was singing about "Eve's Drum", while walking around the apartment like we weren't there.  There were decorative ceramic shoes around.
