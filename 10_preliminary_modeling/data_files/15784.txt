I was at home, which was the old house. I was home alone and Slater came over, crazed and looking for Mom. He was trying to get in the front door and I was yelling at him to go away and trying to get a hold of someone. He went out the back and there was a problem with the back door so it wouldn't lock. Somehow, it sorted itself out and he got 'caught' or whatever. I was sitting at a desk relaxing and suddenly he shouted 'RA!' really loudly in my ear [it caused me to wake up IRL, cringing in fear and my heart was pounding].
