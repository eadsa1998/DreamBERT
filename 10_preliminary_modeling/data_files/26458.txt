 I'm in Australia with several people. We're in a shopping mall trying to get back to a place to leave. We move through a department store, getting into an elevator to go down. The door of the elevator closes. The elevator descends, and then ascends. There is a dinging bell as we reach the second floor again. We realize no one had pushed the button for our destination. Someone quickly pushes a button and the elevator starts to descend without stopping at the second floor. The elevator stops at the first floor and we get out. We walk through the electronics department. People are looking for an ugly woman who has something concealed in her hand or coat. The woman is in the store, very near or among us. Everyone starts looking for her, including us. There is an $80 reward for her capture. I see a man standing behind a rack of clothes. I start to walk towards him. He is the person that is sought after. Immediately another man comes and handcuffs him. I'm given the reward money, though others were involved in his capture. I give $39 or $35 to one man, $20 to another, and $15 each to my friend Niles Zelling and a woman, for their roles in the capture of this man. I say I didn't and couldn't have done it alone. We leave. We're outside the building. Someone says something about another search with the possibility of a reward. I don't want to participate: I'd rather leave. There are two large black dogs that come very close to me, snarling and barking. They are on leashes, which are attached to longer red leashes. The dogs nearly bite me, but are stopped short by these longer red leashes.
