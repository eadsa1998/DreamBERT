On the way to school, I was tired and I fell asleep. When I woke up it was 11am and we were still in the car. Dad explained that Doom 4 had come out and so he bought it. When he got home he was setting up the Xbox 360. Later he said that on Wednesday night, I had to go to school to do my English essay. Then they said it was at 12pm. Then Dad and I were at school and they said it was on Saturday. Then Ms Solomon changed it to the 16 March. Mr Stevenson said I was doing badly at school and had to talk to some teachers. Then I was at Nana's. Ezra was there too. There was a weird insect there; it was like a spider with a shell. It was extremely dangerous (its bite was). Ezra and I were running from it. We went to go inside and it followed us and we climbed up the door. I went up to Granny's and I was doing my essay there. I was sitting at this table outside, but it was too high. Fido had puppies.
