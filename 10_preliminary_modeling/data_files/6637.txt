M. is lying fully clothed on the outside of my bed. I in nighttime reach for rose dressing gown but he is in the way. I crawl out little bothered by scanty attire, sleepily remember it's New Year's and say, "Happy New Year." Go to brush teeth and find lots of loose bristles. H. is lying on lanai opening from room and I greet her too. Aileen followed by a child passes through the room. I am bothered by the looks of things with O.M. there. She speaks to him but when I turn to look at bed he's gone. Am downstairs with R. who has broom in her hand, looking for my watch. She offers me one but it isn't mine and it is broken. O.M. says "You reached yours over to me this morning, didn't you?" and starts to go upstairs for it, but just then I see mine on a shelf only it has no bracelet and I call him back.
