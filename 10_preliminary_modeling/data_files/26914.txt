 I have a loose front tooth on the bottom left side of my mouth. It is pushed back, bent out of shape. I wiggle it, trying to get it to be straight. I finally just pull it out. I bleed a little bit, which tastes salty. I spit into a garbage can. My tooth is long: the root foes very deep, about an inch or so. The tooth gets wider at the root: it's a very large tooth that I've pulled out. The tooth and root are rotting: the outer layer of the tooth has chipped away, exposing the more sensitive layers. It is stained, brown and rotting: decaying. I feel the place in my mouth where the tooth was, with my tongue. I hope that losing this tooth won't affect my smile. I don't think it will, because most of my lower teeth don't show when I smile. I see another of my teeth, in my mouth that is peeling like a hangnail. I think that I need to see a dentist for sure! I didn't think that I was taking that bad care of my teeth!
