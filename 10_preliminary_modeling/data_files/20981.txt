I was driving and I had venetian blinds on the outside of my car. They were not separated right and my view was bad, so I stuck my hand out and tried to set them and they stretched out and broke. They were uneven and I told Bill Grove about them. He said he would get a guy to fix them. A fellow came out of the office with a machine and was going to fix them.
