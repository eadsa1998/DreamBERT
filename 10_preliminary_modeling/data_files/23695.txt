I am in a suburban area.  In one part I am in a bar or restaurant.  I go in alone and am going to order and eat alone.  My oldest sister is there, with someone.  I say hi and find a black high stool to sit on.  She is really surprised I am not going to sit with her.  Then I start seeing people who know me.  One big man comes out, sees me, gives me a big hug and says he missed me.  [Tom B?]  It is like being at Charly's [bar in Flagstaff] at open mic., everyone knowing me.  Then Joel (another student) is there.  I am so glad to see him.  We hug and talk, look for another black stool for him.  There is something significant about doing this in front of my oldest sister, like showing her how many people like me and miss me.  Later I am driving around, looking for Joel's or maybe Pat E's house.  It is an unfamiliar area to me now, but it seemed like I'd been there once before.  I read the street signs but don't quite remember them now.
