Ellie introduces me to Jerome G. He and I like each other immediately. We hug and kiss and are very loving. He has a blue cat that looks at first like a spider and then is a cat. I pet it lovingly. The three of us are on a bed. Ellie comes in and I get concerned, but he says, "Don't worry." Then we get up and go into the living room. His housekeeper fixes us a lovely dinner. I thank her for her kindness. She tells me this is her night off.
