Playing a game of marbles indoors. Probably with one of the Ford boys. Our marbles, may of which are extremely large "glassies," are in 2 or 3 8-quart galvanized pails. A "ring" of this shape is laid out on floor, with about 8 marbles inside. My opponent has fist shot, and he knocks the marbles out of the ring, one by one, from all angles and distances without missing. Even though I seem doomed to a "trimming," I am delighted (even laugh a little) to witness such skillful play. I ask opponent how many small marbles he must win before taking one of my big glassies, and he says 25.
