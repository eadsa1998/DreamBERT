I was dreaming that I was pitching for the Boston Red Sox. I had a no hit game going into the last inning when Bob Feller of Cleveland came up and got a hit off me. It was his first hit all season and he just stood on first base and laughed at me. He laughed so much that I finally went over to him and shot him with a gun I had in my back pocket. Then from out of the stands came all the people. They started after me and finally caught me on the top of the Terminal Tower. They kept coming at me until they had pushed me off the tower. I awake before I hit the street down below.
