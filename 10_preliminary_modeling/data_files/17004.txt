I go to a barber shop for a haircut. The place looks like an old 1950s office with a reception room where customers wait. It's part of a larger open plan floor that has been partitioned. Foolishly, I leave my wallet on the table in the waiting room. I get distracted for five minutes, and when I remember and go to pick up my wallet, it's empty. All my credit cards and about fifty dollars in cash is gone. The thief did 'kindly' leave all my personal photos in there. I speak to the people in the waiting room - they all say they didn't see anything.
