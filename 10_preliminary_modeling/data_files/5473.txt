Last night I dreamed that I went back to school, to college, and I was moving into my dorm room and all my friends were still there, moving into their rooms, there was a lot of noise, a lot of people moving around, it was moving day. My suite-mate L was there, my friend J. I could see the room, the color of the carpeting, just the lighting and all that, the way I had always seen it in my head when I lived there, and I had been asleep and I woke up and this woman, actually two women came into the room, some of my friends were in the room too. And these women were telling me that I had to move all my stuff out, because they had a housing shortage and in the housing lottery I had drawn a place to live, but it was a tent in the parking lot and I was really, really upset because it was going to be winter soon and it was getting to be cold, and besides, I was in the room that I had been in all along and it was nice and I wanted to stay there and I told them: "Look, you better see what you can do because I'm arthritic and I can't live outside, even in a tent, especially in winter I just can't." And they were just basically saying, "well that's just tough luck" and I said "You know I realize that, but I just can't live under those conditions and I'll transfer out of this school but" I said, "in the mean time I'm going to sue you for discrimination if you keep this up and force me to transfer". And they began to get really annoyed and silent and sullen at that point I could see them vaguely, I couldn't see their faces, one was sort of heavy set and shorter and the other was taller and a tiny bit overweight. One was wearing a white cotton sweater, I can't remember what the other was wearing. I also remember something else which might have been part of another dream.
