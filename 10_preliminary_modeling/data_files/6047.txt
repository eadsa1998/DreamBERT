I had a dream about marriage noodle. They came in a blue can that was the shape of the Quaker Oats box. These noodles were kind of like soup only without much liquid in them. The expiration date on the noodles was for 60 years from now. I remember trying to figure out how they could last that long, and if they would last that long if they were opened, or would they only last that long if they were not opened.
