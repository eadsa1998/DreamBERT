I was at Ms Vickers's house? These bad guys where coming to see her. She gave me some stuff and told me to leave. I got out just in time. The bad guys were coming around a corner. I went to the carpark. These other bad guys were there and they wanted my keys. Ezra and I ended up in a car. He was telling me to open it up and fix it. And I said "I don't know what to do!". Mom came and we were both complaining to her.
