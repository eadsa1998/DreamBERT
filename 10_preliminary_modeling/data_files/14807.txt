I had just finished at the university. I stayed later to play poker with Calvin and some others. The game was weird though. You got three cards and you marked off the ones you got and had to discover which ones the others have to eliminate the winner. I was next to this guy because he was doing a scam. I was then at the train station and I took the wrong train. I ended up in Oceanside. I text Mom to tell her. I had to scan my SmartRider on this Timezone like thing and got a ticket. The train back was weird and then I realized it was the wrong one again and waited for the next one. It came and it was like a net and you had to hold on. I realized it was the wrong one again and I waited on the other side this time. I got really angry and yelled that it was the worst train station. It was like 7-8pm now and I was annoyed that it was so late.
