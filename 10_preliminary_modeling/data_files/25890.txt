 My mom rides her bicycle to Fishing Haven, which looks different. I tell her I have a bicycle too, and we should ride over to 15 Mile Lake. She can't: she has to wait for our neighbor Luke Stalk to pick her up. We talk in my truck. My brother Wally is there, standing outside my truck on the driver's side. I tell them my experience saving the Loon. There is a sports field below us, down a little hill. Many kids are playing lacrosse there. My mom asks me what I need. I say she has given me so much food, more than I'll use. I say all I need for my birthday is some good strong fishing line. I say I'll buy my own pasta in bulk from now on. A truck from Lake Lodge goes by. The old man from a different outfitter is driving it. The back end of my truck is sticking out into the road, so I drive forward a bit. A thunderstorm is coming. It is moving to the north, I see, but I think it will also move east and hit us.
