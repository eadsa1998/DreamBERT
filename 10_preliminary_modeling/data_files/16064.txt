I was in Aunt Margaret's pool. And we swam to the deep end and Dad said, "Look at this beautiful pearl here." There was like seaweed and pearl. And Dad said, "Don't ever go under this ledge; you might run out of air. I'm going to go get some pearl for Aunt Margaret and show them how pretty it is in her pool. And I swam around while he was getting that, and I remember telling myself not to worry about pool vents, but I was still worried about them anyway.
