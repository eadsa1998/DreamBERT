I was having a dream within a dream. I was at a beachside type of centre, sitting at a table on a deck facing the beach. There was a bird 'humming' a song. Each time it finished, it would start again and the song would be slightly more 'complex'. Eventually it had lyrics etc. In the dream, they were very clear and I was thinking I had to write them down as soon as I woke up [but I forgot when I woke up]. It was only a short song, like a verse and a chorus. I 'woke up' at some point. There was a video of some teens at this old temple type of place and one fell through a 'window' onto this big statue and knocked it over. They were screaming and then he jumped up holding the head and they all laughed. Was back in London at my flat. It was different though and looked like our old place in Parkville. I was there temporarily to gather my stuff and they were letting me stay there for free. I could hear Kiersten and Lukas arguing in the room next door. There was a girl staying there and apparently didn't get along with Darnell. She was really weird and seemed to spy on everyone. She was subtly making fun of me and started singing some 'embarrassing' song I had been listening to and I just shrugged and said I liked it. Later, I was somewhere else. An Irish guy called Nils was talking to me and we were trying to work something out. Dmitri was there and I mentioned that I used to like him. He then asked me "what is your Nils like?" and I asked 'what?' and he repeated it but was speaking really fast and I couldn't understand what he was saying. On the third repeat I said "what does that mean?" and he said "you know, the guy you're shagging?" and I said "he doesn't exist" and he said "really?" and I said "yes, now let's get back to this.."
