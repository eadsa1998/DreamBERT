I had a dream that my friend and I were walking in my neighborhood all dressed up ready to go somewhere. We were passing some of my neighbors, just saying hi to them. We went to one particular neighbor's house. We both had trouble getting up to his front step. We had to struggle. (This neighbor does have a steep driveway.) There were dirt and rocks involved like we were trying to climb a mountain. We asked him if he would take us out to a club. He told us he could get us into some club. He said he would drive us, but we said that my friend would drive because we know how he drives (crazy).
