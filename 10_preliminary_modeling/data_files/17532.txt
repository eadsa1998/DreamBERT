I was with my boyfriend Jeremy when my friend Ray showed up wanting me to address some small valentine to him.  One was black with a walnut inside.  He and Jeremy started causing problems, like a broken truck.  I dreamt Riff from the comic Sluggy Freelance said something mean and his pet ferret Kiki ran away.  I went to the rat congregation around the car and asked where "Chuckie" (an insult to Riff) was.  One rat nosed downward and I tried talking through the problem.
