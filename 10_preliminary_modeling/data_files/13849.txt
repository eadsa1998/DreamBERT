Exams were on. They were all done in this little room at one desk. Eugene, Jeremiah, Bradley and others were there. Jeremiah had 3 hats. My neck was sore and Ms Solomon told me to rub this bit of my neck, so I did and eventually it cracked and felt good. I think we were doing the English exam. Jeremiah was next to me and a yellow hat was in the way. Mom worked at McDonald's. There was a really cheesy burger. The shop was set up strangely and it was hard to wash up. There was weird soap. I was out driving with Dad and I saw the oldest number plate -- started with 3DE.
