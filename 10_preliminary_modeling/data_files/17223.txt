I was going to have lunch with my dorm mate Jason.  I went to go to the bathroom, but the ones at the restaurant were not private enough.  I tried to find another, and ended up down the block in a mechanic's.  I tried to hurry to get back, but it didn't work.  Jason wondered where I'd been.  After that I was one of twin brothers.  It was night, and we were going somewhere.  After everyone else had left for bed, I went to take a shower, which actually wasn't a shower.  I did something with a 3-foot sub sandwich, and put it back.  My brother came out.  Something happened and someone grabbed a rope and climbed it up the tower above the "showers".  I grabbed the rope to follow.  When I got up there, I swung around and punted someone and slid down to the second level.  I remember something about cows.  Something was not as it seemed.  Not cows, a pig!  A Hampshire.  I went over and hugged it.  It was supposed to do something.  We piled into the car and went to my maternal Grandma Jane's yard.
