I'm at The Maze (Canyonlands N.P.), but on the other side of river.  I can see the part of ISKY (Island in the Sky, Canyonlands N.P.) that sticks out separate from the mesa, above the confluence of the Colorado River and Green River.  There are junipers, pinyons, I can see Chimney Rock!  Red dirt.  It's like I'm near that walk I took the day I stayed out all night in that cave, and I had walked up that ridge to Chimney Rock.  Then I felt like I was on the other side of that ridge.  But I could see up a red incline at the end of the ridge to Chimney Rock.  There are other people there and I sit in the car and wait for them to leave because I want to be there alone before I explore and I also need to take a shit.  There's a family, some kids.  I don't mind, I just wait for them to leave.  I came with someone - a woman.  She has already gone off to explore up the ridge.  I get out of the car.  Thor is there.  [Our family dog when I was in grade school.]  I sit with him on a picnic table.  He is young.  I make him comfortable.  Then he seems thirsty.  I give him water from a cup but realize it had sugar in it.  I worry about this but he was really thirsty so I let him drink.  I get him more water.  He is happy, appreciative.  Both of these later 2 dreams involved important events in my life - the band, and the Maze.  But while I am on the verge, in the dream, of participating in each one, I am also taking care of Cody and Thor and taking care of them takes precedence over doing this important event.  I.e. - in my life right now, it may be more important to care for someone, to be concerned with loving, than to have incredible adventures.
