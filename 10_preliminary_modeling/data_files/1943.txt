I look to an opened window. I see a cardboard. I pick it up. It's some forgotten thing that had been with the closed window for a long time. I pick it up. A black and white photo or drawing of a young woman is in the upper left l/4 of the cardboard. My mother says, "My nose." She is surprised and happy to see it. Apparently it's a drawing she started years ago to practice drawing a nose.
