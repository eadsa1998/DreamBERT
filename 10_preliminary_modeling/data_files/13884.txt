I was at home and there was a bus out the back. It was an excursion for the last day of school. Calvin was on there. The bus driver was a driver I'd had from "year three". He remembered me and Melodie. He had to drive through the kitchen. Everyone was then in the games room. I said to Theodore, "Not Tigger, you can attack Mittens".
