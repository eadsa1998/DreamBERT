I was wondering whether general characteristics like value are transmitted through objects by some kind of inheritance. If the value of an object was as it was because of its apparent objects. That's all I remember. [Max: When Nietzsche was awakened, he reports he was sleeping when I awakened him, but he's not at all sure that he was dreaming. He wouldn't call it a dream. He reports that there were no images, nothing definite, but that he definitely was not awake, so we got what he thought he was dreaming about on the tape. I'm not sure whether this counts as a dream or not.]
