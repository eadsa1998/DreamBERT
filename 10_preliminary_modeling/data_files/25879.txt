 I'm in a muddy swamp area. I am wearing new looking white and red Nike high top sneakers. There is a basketball hoop there, which is kind of small. I jump up and rise, slam dunk the ball and break the rim. I feel powerful. I notice the hoop was shorter than it should be. There is a gang there dressed in black. I walk around a car. Two men pull out their handguns and try to fire at me, but they are out of bullets. I go back around the car and the trunk is open. I pull out a machine gun and kill everyone, mowing them down. I shoot a lot of gang members. I get shot from behind, and I say to the person who shot me that I'm already dead! I feel nothing. I'm in a building with others. I'm in a room with two people. We're supposed to watch a movie, which we go to do. I have seen it before, I say. The movie is not that good. In the movie, there is fake blood on a dead person.
