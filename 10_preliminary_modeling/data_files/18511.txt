Dora was crying and it hurt me so bad to see her sad. I said, "Dora, let's go sit on the bed and I'll hold you and hug you and pat your head until everything's alright." My father was suppose to be driving the church bus, but we knew that chances were pretty good that he wasn't where he was suppose to be. We knew it was trouble when my mother went to look for my father. We were waiting to see if my mother tracked down my father. Dora was afraid to cry when my mother was there. I realized how pretty she was (when she was young) and my father was too. Dora was addressing a 24" X 24" X 4" box to mail to the little boy. It was chocolate from Switzerland and snacks. Dora was concerned about the little boy because the big grown men in his family had been punching him hard in the face and before she would (take time to) cry (for herself) she had to help him. On TV there was a violent movie with grown men punching a little boy. In the background, behind the truck, the little boy's father was waiting for us to make a spelling error so (that) he could beat him up again. Movies about horses roping other horse, horses with their front legs tied together, were scary. I didn't want Dora to see such violence. She was already upset. The church bus came back. my father and a young man and his wife (both) with red hair (were with him). My mother was not there but had been watching from the top of the double decker bus.
