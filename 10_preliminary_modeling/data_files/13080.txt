Dad picked me and Ezra up from school because Mom was sick. I complained about this. Eugene was nearby. When I got in the car, I looked back at him. Dad gave Ezra a ticket, which I realized was to see some movie, which I also wanted to see. When we got home, I asked about my ticket and Dad had figured that I wouldn't want to see it and hadn't gotten me a ticket. I was angry. I asked to be dropped off at Mom's. Seriously Weird was on TV and it was an episode I hadn't seen. I was thinking that Ryan Cartwright was hot.
