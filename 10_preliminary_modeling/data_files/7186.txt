Entering my room, I try to turn on the overhead light but it flashed on for only a second and then went off. I tried it again and then another light and then my old table light. No good, I must tell them. I go out and look for the books I had laid on a table outside. Ask several people about them and see several piles of old books but not mine. Who could have taken them? I see a little girl throw something on the floor. I go to her, rest my hand on her shoulder and sternly say, "Pick it up." Repeat 3 or 4 times until she does. "Now throw it in here." She reluctantly obeys.
