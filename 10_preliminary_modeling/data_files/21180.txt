I saw a young fellow lying dead on a slab. A young girl came to dance. I watched her. She danced around him, then she stepped on his body. She danced on his chest, stomach and groin. All at once the dead man opened up his eyes. He seemed to come out of a dream. He smiled and started to talk, then he took the girl into his arms and made love to her. I was looking into the entries and I saw image.
