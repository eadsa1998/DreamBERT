Last night I had the most convoluted dream about Laura, Josh, Hannah, Grace, and Grace's poetry that she had written for Andy Warhol. In the dream, poetry was represented by these very geometric, and angular figures, with strange curves and endpoints. I tried to make a drawing of them when I woke up but didn't do it very well. Not least because they were 3-dimensional. You wrote them into the thin air with your pen. In the dream, I drew a "poem" from Hannah's chin, and I said: "You're a poet now!" We all laughed. I seem to remember the dream was mainly about looking for Laura. She was around, just hard to approach because she was elusive.
