Wilhelmina (Ugly Betty) cloned herself or something. The other her was evil and took over. Actually, the evil her could've also been from an alternate universe. She killed the clone thing. Silvio and Paulie (both from The Soprano's) were guards. She led someone to this place, asking "it's south of Canada, right?" and they said they were north. Silvio and Paulie ended up getting killed and I was annoyed because they were my favourite characters. Ezra left his phone with me and I took photos of myself. Also, at some point this guy weighed Wilhelmina, Ezra and I and Ezra was the 'ideal' weight. It said I weighed 190lbs. Wilhelmina was also overweight. Then everything was over. Casey (Chuck) was tied up in a chair. He looked like Jayne (Firefly) though [I started rewatching Firefly last night]. I had this belt and looking serious, I went over and did a whip movement and he was like "hey!" and I laughed -- he had thought I was bad for a second. I showed Mom and she fumbled with the belt. I couldn't stop laughing.
