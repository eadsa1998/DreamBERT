I am trying to put on a glove; it has the fingers removed, which makes it easier, but it is still a struggle. It is pink and goes all the way up my arm to the shoulder. I see my white blouse underneath it. There is only one glove for the left hand. I feel great happiness at being able to finally get it over my bent fingers and the bandage I wear on my wrist. Another woman wears a black lacy glove.
