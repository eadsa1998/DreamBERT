I met Ray Charles.  He was having an incontinence problem, as I could see.   His penis was exposed and a more or less steady stream came out.  I told him he could use some pads in his underwear, and I could show him how to put them in.  Then I realized I couldn't literally "show" him, but that he could learn by feeling what I did.  But he refused.
