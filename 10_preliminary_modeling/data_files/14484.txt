A submarine had gone missing? Some others and I went to investigate. It was connected strangely and I picked up the top bit out of the water and there was a little section where you sit to control it. I emptied the water out of it and pulled it to the surface. I got in and there was a guy talking on the intercom, but he was speaking a different language. It had then been a movie and he was Jean Reno. He had a daughter on there too. I discovered the submarine was full of zombies or vampires and so got out. It had started sinking again and it was hard to get out. I had to swim back to the top. Eugene was part of the group and we had a kid and two puppies (they were all with us). A bunch of vampires came towards us, but it was day time. There were these hard plastic arrows on the ground and we stabbed them with them. We got rid of that lot and kept moving. There was a section of the place (it was school like) that was messy and there had obviously been a big fight there. There was a giant arrow and I said "ooh, can I have this?" and someone said "They'll get you before you pick it up and turn it around to them". We were then given darts to get them with. More came and I had extremely good accuracy, getting them directly in the heart. I missed a few though and kept stabbing them until they were gone. Some ran towards us at one point and I had an arrow and a dart and held them out and killed them. We put our son, plus this guy's daughter whose name was Kara and our puppies on a roof to keep them safe. The kids were around 5 years old. Also, one of the puppies was called Mikey. We walked into this section with dorms and a classroom with stairs leading down. I was worried about the kids. There were vampires scattered around, just wandering around and dopey looking.
