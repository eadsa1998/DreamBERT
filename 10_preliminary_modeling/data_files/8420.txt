It looks like I'm at my birth home but it was___ Alan K was a doctor and he had left a message for me saying that he wanted to talk to me about something, I don't think it was medical at all. He wanted my help with something. I had gone there to pick up Matthew. He was a baby. I think 2 years old or less. He had a rash all over the front of his legs and arms. I was debating whether or not to go see if Doctor Pf could fit him in or to call, or just talk to Alan K since he was a doctor and right there. I called his office instead to see if he could take a look at it. As I called him he answered the phone. Since it was me he told me that he wanted to schedule that appointment to talk about the other thing. Then he asked me why I was calling. I told him it was because of Matthew's rash and I was hoping he could look at it. He kind of passed it off like it was no big deal. I just said that I was concerned that it was measles or something because it was so bad. He finally came out and looked at it. By the time he looked at it there was almost nothing there. I said that was really odd because it was much worse than that just a couple of minutes ago. I wondered if it was an allergic reaction to something I was wearing, because when I was holding him and he was close to me it got really bad. Before that there was also something going on with me and I was thinking that if I called Doctor Pf he could just see the both of us. Whatever it was that was going on with me I didn't want to talk to Alan K about.
