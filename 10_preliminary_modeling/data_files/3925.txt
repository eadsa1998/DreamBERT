["Black Haired Darryl"] I am on a train somewhere and sharing the seat with Queen Elizabeth. There is another woman too who gives me four parts of a script I'll be in later. Queen Elizabeth and I talk. I give her some advice she finds useful. We get off the train. Time to rehearse the play. Lots of people walking around, confusion. I see Darryl sitting on a bench, holding a thin baby boy, who looks more like a child. Darryl has black hair and he doesn't look like himself at all. I say to him Is this your baby? He looks just like you. He does too. He stands to hug me in greeting. He is very tall and I comment on it, surprised. I feel his hard penis straight out and poking into my leg. I am surprised again. Now a male director is trying to organize us. I am looking through my scripts and can't find the last section, number 21 or 22. Others can't find theirs either. He is annoyed with us and lectures me on being responsible. I feebly try to indirectly blame it on the woman on the train who might not have given it to me in the first place. But I do remember having it. I look harder, feeling guilty and embarrassed. I do find it in my pile of papers. We are going to rehearse.
