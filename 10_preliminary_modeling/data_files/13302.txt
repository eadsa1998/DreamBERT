For some reason I had to change my appearance. I had a short red wig (which reminded me of Lana in China (Smallville). I had black eyebrows too. There was this old lady at this shop. She was trying to give me a calendar. Something happened and this evil devil thing took over the shop. All the shop went blue and the devil thing had a gigantic tongue.
