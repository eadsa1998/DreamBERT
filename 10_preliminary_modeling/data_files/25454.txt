 My friend Stephen Ramos and I are fighting. It is early in the morning. He tells me to point a gun at something. I am angry, and I'm tired. I want to sleep. I punch him a lot. He puts on loud music. I tell him to shut it off and be quiet, or leave. He spits on a pipe that is on the sidewalk. I wipe his saliva up with a sock. I tell him he is being annoying like our friend Norman Noman was in recent incident in which there was an argument over some cookies.
