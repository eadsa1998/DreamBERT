We had to hide out. Nana had this cottage thing in the woods. Ezra, Dad and Clayton came. It took ages to load up the car. We had to get in through this chimney to get in the house. There were cool science fiction movies. There was one with Tom Sizemore. Then I was at home out the front. I got the mail and there was something about Borat in there. Something said that Johnny Depp was "my only" and I was confused about it.
