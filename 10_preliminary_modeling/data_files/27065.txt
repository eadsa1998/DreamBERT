It was about myself doing mathematical problems. It was on an examination. There were about 5 or 6 problems and I felt that if I was only able to do just a couple I would fail as there were only so few. Can't remember exactly what type of problems, but they seemed to be long involved ones where there was large amount of multiplying and dividing. I worked the first two or so out satisfactory, but then I wasn't able to do the rest. Could feel myself becoming anxious and tense. I looked at my watch, it was almost 3 o'clock. Class would be over soon and I had only done a few. In my dream I felt as if I was facing the same thing again, that is I could only go so far in some thing, but never completely work it through. Don't remember what happened from there, whether I handed the paper in or not. It did move out of the room. I was in a class room, to a place by myself - Cannot identify any other person.
