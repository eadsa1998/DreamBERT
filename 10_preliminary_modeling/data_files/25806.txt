 I'm talking with my uncle Gary Redding. We close the door on a semi truck. There is a ladder that has rungs that are split in half and won't stay connected because a piece is missing. Gary and I walk back home from the area around the Chinese Buffet in Oak Valley. He has a pornographic magazine. We walk past where the old Corner Cafe was. He talks about shipping neckties at least two days in advance of a big event. I get down to where my neighbor Donald Branson used to live. My uncle Rusty Redding is there. As I walked to his spot a little girl passed me up walking. My cousin Melvin Redding is there. Rusty is outside the house building a clothesline.
