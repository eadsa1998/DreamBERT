["Another demention and a loving man."]  A group of men and I are going to be transformed into another dimension. We become small. Then we find ourselves to be in another much earlier age where things haven't been invented yet. One man and I begin to work together. We like each other. It feels loving and warm. He wants to experiment and melt all the aspirin together but I am worried I won't be able to figure out the correct dosage.  Something is over and he runs and I chase him. He stumbles and is laying on the ground. I fall down beside him. He says I don't have a job for you. I say I don't want a job. We kiss and it is beautifully sweet and loving. I guess he was worried that I thought our relationship was employment related.
