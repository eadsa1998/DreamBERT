A man and I are in a car. He wants to kiss me. I say, "Well, let's see how you do." He kisses me. I agree that it is pleasant and ask him to promise that if I make love to him, he won't start demanding that we do it a lot, like Howard did every night or at least every 2 nights. He agrees, but I have doubts.
