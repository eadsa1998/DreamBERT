Ann and I were driving thru a tunnel. We were about halfway thru when Ann said, "Let's pray the our father for he will protect us from danger and let us know ahead of time." When we got thru, we heard a real high wind blowing outside, so we stopped and went back for the exit outside. I looked back into the tunnel and I saw some dust blowing into the tunnel. As we got out, I hung on to Ann as we walked out into the open. The sidewalk was muddy. I was conscious that I was walking on the wrong side of her. I was closing the door and something would hold it back. I couldn't shut it. I pushed and I finally got it almost closed when I heard a voice say, "This next one will be poison." A small pup dog came in. I told the kids to keep their hands off him because he was to be poison. Audrey touched him, so I told her to go to the sink and wash her hands. The sink was full of dishes, so I had to move some of them out of the way and we both washed our hands.
