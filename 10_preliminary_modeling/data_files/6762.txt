I went to an educational meeting. At the door was a woman taking dues and reservations for the dinner. I asked if she had any blank checks so I could write one. She didn't. I had suddenly realized that I had left my checkbook in my handbag upstairs. I went in. Told me go across to another room as I told her I wasn't going back upstairs. I went in. Sayers was talking but I couldn't hear much of anything that he said. I thought I'm getting deafer, not much use to attend lectures, certainly not discussions. When he finished there was a recess and I went across the hall to pay dues, again I had no money with me. But she put me down for a reservation anyway and said I could pay later. I decided to go upstairs after my bag and started looking for the elevator. When along one hallway and then another angling off from it. Realized I was only in my slip with some wrap on my back and wondered if anyone had noticed. At last I find the elevator. This is the first floor of a large hotel. As I press the button, a small boy pushed me aside, rushes in, the elevator ascends but soon returns and I step in but there is no attendant. While I look to see how to run it, the elevator goes up and stops by itself. I step off and look for my room which is 200 and something on the second floor. The first number I see on the left is 431. Well it isn't so bad walking down as up and I start down.
