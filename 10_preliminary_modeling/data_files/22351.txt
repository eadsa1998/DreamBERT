I was in the Ramic and I almost ran into a police car at an intersection. Two policemen came out and they took away my license for driving recklessly. I was a bit scared and didn't have one cent in my pocket to give to them. Then I went to the police station where my license was and I had to borrow three bills to pay the policeman. He told me to give him what I thought right, that on that day he wasn't going to have lunch, etc. He took the three bills from me and I came out happy.
