 I get a ride home from school with my friend Sal Watson in his truck. At the same time, I bike in the snow and the rain. I get tired out. When I get home, there is a note from my friend Hannah Reed to call her. I know it's her because she spells her name with an "H". My mom is just leaving when I get home. My sister Heather is still in the hospital. My friend Nete Nelling just called. He actually spells his name Nate, but I know that now it is Nete. He has strep throat and cant' go to the baseball game or the Olympic Volleyball with me like we had planned. Nate and I sit in a bar on the floor and talk. He had a tough trip with his girlfriend Emily. He drinks a Killian's Red. I swing on a gymnastics bar and try to touch my feet on a piece of light green paper on the floor. I have a beer. Nate tells me about Emily's father Dick, and how Dick never used to let Nate drink beer. Now Dick lets Nate drink beer; "Just as long as I don't want one," Nate says.
