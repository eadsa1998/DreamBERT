I was in a rescue boat, alone, waiting for help. Nobody arrived and I slowly felt I was dying. My heart's beats and my breathing signaled my coming death. I took a last, long breath and stopped living (fear and anguish in the middle of a foggy ocean). I was traveling through the innermost parts of my lymphatic system when I awoke.
