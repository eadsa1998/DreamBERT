The dream is very confused. I went to a building which was very high and located in a corner. One went up some narrow stairs which were spiral-shaped, and on each floor there were books, but there were also bedrooms, bathrooms, etc., In other words, it was part house and part library on each floor. There were long tables, with room for about 5 people in each book room; people ate while they read. I was with a group of people (I believe they were only women, of all ages) and my 12-year-old cousin was there too. On one floor (there were few of us then) we could not find the stairs to keep going up, then we ate something, and I don't remember any more. I don't remember too many details, just that everything was painted white: stairs, walls, etc.
