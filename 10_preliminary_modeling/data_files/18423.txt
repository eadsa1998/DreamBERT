Fragmentary recall.... In the early part, the "unknown couple" figured in somehow. We were going to meet them or something. There were drag races down a very steep driveway. Now reminds me of the driveway at Big Sur Hot Springs, although it didn't in the dream. I was down at the bottom as they were getting ready for the races. Each "car" would go down individually and be timed. One that went down looked like it had been made from a gas cylinder. Painted bright yellow. A friend of the drivers at the top was taking a movie of his going down with a weird camera, built in the end of a long yellow pole. I had just climbed to the top of the hill alongside the driveway and had to duck past this camera boom. I noticed that the end of the pole toward me had a human foot sticking out of it to stabilize it, which struck me as strange. Then I met some girl at the top of the hill whom I had met in an earlier dream tonight. She had sort of snubbed me in the earlier dream; now she was friendly and we made a date. She invited me over to her apartment. I then had some thoughts about how I was going to have an apartment of my own soon as I went off to college, instead of living with my parents (or was it roommates?). Something I can't recall now about time dilation and expansion. Somewhere in an earlier part we met Arlene &amp; Bob Morel, who were going to play poker with us (I had talked about playing poker with Arlene yesterday). Also some vague memory back then about meeting some girl to play games, but really to try to seduce her.
