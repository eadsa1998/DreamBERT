Zack and I were in a nearby town and we were standing on a street looking at a nice gray house with white trim that was on the corner. Someone was trying to break into the house. Zack yelled at the kid and he ran away. Zack revealed that he owned the house and he decided that the kids and I could live in it. It was empty except for some furniture and stuff that Zack stored there. He was helping me fix the bed and I noticed a rack of shirts. They were all his shirts that I had given him or some that matched ones that I had. I also noticed a box with some other stuff I had given him. I suddenly got angry. I felt like he kept that stuff at the house so no one who went to his house would see it. He didn't want people to know we were together. I got mad and started yelling at him. I even said, "I hate you!"
