I was in a big building in which a lot of people lived. It might have been some kind of a dormitory, but it wasn't familiar although I have been in the same room several times before. I went down a hall and turned left. At the end of the hall are suites of faculty members. The room is small with one window. There is a sewing machine in the room, a desk, a table on which there is some kind of machine with a switch on it. In the room are a number of old style goose-necked lamps. I turned on the lamps as I looked for something; can't remember what it was. I went outside with a friend and it was snowing. On a certain street at home downtown in the business district, we were driving an automobile and there were huge trucks like car carriers. Red, a little different from the real thing -- enclosed on the bottom. There were about 10 of them around. My friend was driving in and out of these trucks. I was quite tense when she hit one of the trucks. No one was hurt or even the car damaged.
