I dreamed I was sleeping and I heard a noise of cars and voices and I got up and went to the window (it was my room) and then I saw some schoolmates from classes ahead of me. They saw me and they came over to my window, which is on the second floor of the house, floating in the air and they shook me so that I would awake completely. One of them, the one I know best, came over to me and told me that they were collecting money which they needed for a problem all of them were in. I told them I could help them with us much as I had. Then they asked me for 250 dollars and I was amazed and told them that, with the holidays, the next day I could give them 10 or 20 dollars at the most. Then I remember that my sister came over and awoke me and went out with me. That's all.
