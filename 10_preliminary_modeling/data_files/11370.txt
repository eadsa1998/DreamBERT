I was a mailman delivering mail in the vicinity of Euclid and Forest Hills Blvd. near Superior. I had on nothing except the mail bag. I went to several apartments. I dreaded meeting anyone and when I, did I felt very anxious but they didn't seem to notice. I felt irritated by not having any clothes. Then I crossed the street and entered a store which was a kitchen on the inside. This was the post office. I then pressed a secret button and entered a secret part of the building which was more like a post office. I met no one I knew and spoke to no one. Also no one seemed to notice/me.
