H and I go into a restaurant. Two comedians are doing their act. The first one did a joke in Latin and Hasani got it and the second joke was in Spanish and I got it. They weren't very good jokes. He looks sadly at Hasani and says, "I think you misunderstood." We had been feeling pretty good about our ability to get the jokes even in other languages. Then, the second comedian comes on and his jokes are terrible. We pay and leave to go find Dwight and Arvonne. We go downstairs, past the two comedians who are having an after-the-show chat with drinks. We get in an elevator, and even as we start to go, we can hear their conversation. I realize we are going sideways and slightly uphill. There is no ceiling and I bend a little, afraid my head might be exposed and I'll get hurt. We return from whence we came, having gone through a huge basement room where two girls chased an older woman. Now we are being haunted by the spirits of the second comedian. It's in the curtain, bumping around. I'm not very afraid and I say, "Come on then. Teach me." He becomes visible. He has a bony face, long prominent teeth, and bulging eyes. He cracks a couple of rim shot jokes. I carefully look at the structure of the jokes. Then someone says, "Richard," and he says, "Nixon," and continues with the jokes. He then says, "teamster," and waits for me to finish the joke. I frantically think (like Sally Field in Punchline movie) and then come out with, "Teamsters are a little lost without their huskies." He laughs and says, "Not bad, but it needs work." I laugh, surprised I could make a joke. He then asks which set of jokes he did that I like best. I say, "The second set." "Oh, song jokes. I didn't think any were all that good." An older woman is sitting there playing cards. A young girl knocks on the door. She's bringing the other comedian. She says, "Is there anyone in there who will be scared? I want to be scary."
