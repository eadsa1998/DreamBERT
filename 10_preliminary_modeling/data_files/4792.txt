["The brother returns."] A group of brothers are going to do acrobatic style tricks. They each travel in their special souped up car. Their brother from afar calls out to them. He called me says one brother, like he's got a lot of nerve to try and reconnect again after leaving them so long ago. The father turns and says Quit complaining. Welcome him. The brother chuckles and says, "So much for natural consequences." They welcome the returning brother into their act again. They gather all wearing fancy black outfits and come into the area. They call themselves the Cousins. A group of women, the women cousins, come in too. I, the dream ego observes as these acrobatic people do complicated circle dances. (Now many members of the group.) As they flip and dance in unison moving in circle and counter clockwise inner circles, like the apertures of a camera lens moving to open and close. It is colorful, graceful and a big spectacle. The dream ego now seems to be a member of the dancing group, trying to think up routines for the group to display. An improv routine to keep the audience interested.
