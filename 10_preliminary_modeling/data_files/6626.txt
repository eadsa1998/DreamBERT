Settling into a hotel room. Was to share it with Q. Somebody wanted to share closet. I show it is not large enough, will have to have room for my husband's clothes. The closet has a very elevated floor. Then I realize Q and I are not married and had better not share room. Decide he can sleep on a cot over there and it'll be all right, only how can we keep others from knowing we share a room. Packing Q's things scattered around. Must take them to him but maybe he doesn't want all as he may be returning. Put my clock away but still can hear it ticking. No, it's his small red traveling clock on the dresser that I hear. Gathering up things. Trying to phone for the dray man. Men think box too heavy to carry down. Afraid of missing train.
