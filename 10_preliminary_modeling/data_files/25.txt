I'm trying to find the original plans or instructions to something and having no luck. There's a large "file"-thing with shelves that rotate individually along the lines of the one at work but on a horizontal axis instead of vertical. I'm turning each shelf carefully because they all have different things on them but mostly (Mexican?) painted figures on them, even group displays, very nice things too. But no file. Somebody speaks to me, I think (she?) is saying it won't be there, (she's?) going to look elsewhere. I go a few yards away to something or other that's got some things in it I can look through - it makes me think of a bin. I sort of halfheartedly poke at them, then I get a half-formed picture of what I'm looking for, and a new approach - I may have missed it and will go back to look (in the file?). This is all outside, in a kind of courtyard, and there are people around.
