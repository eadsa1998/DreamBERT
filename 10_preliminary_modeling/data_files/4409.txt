["Baby kitten."] I am in a house, maybe like the Mac house. I have a tiny kitten. I am holding it and petting it. It is black and white. It is very sweet and soft. I love it. I am going to travel. I wake up at midnight after only a few hours of sleep. I am exhausted. But I will be on the road for 8 hours and then visit for many more hours. I am already tired and will be even more tired by the end of the day. I carry the kitten with me, loving it. Later, in the house, I see a box with a mama cat and another kitten. It is my original kitten grown with it's own baby.
