Now a man that I am waiting for shows up. We are going to work on the project together. I take photo or something and he edits, I guess. Anyway, the woman comes over and starts to set up a deal with him, and I watch as she says things like, "A contract? We won't need one." He waffles and hems, wanting the protection of his material, but trying to trust her. I realize he's a wimp and would sell himself and then me down the river; no guts. I unplug my machine from his and say to the woman, "My stuff is not connected with his, so you can't get mine," which is what she was finagling for. The man is upset that I won't work with him and I feel very good at having beaten out this selfish, arrogant woman.
