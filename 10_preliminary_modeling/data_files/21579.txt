I looked at a name someone had. It was Boot. I told the party my name was almost he same. I was going to write my name and then I looked at the name and it was now boo. Then bo. I saw a big tire, one of those like a road scooper. It was standing as an advertisement. Then all at once it started to roll away. It rolled in a big circle across the road, then around and across again and it came towards me on one roll. I ran to get away from it, then I flew up to get away from it. On a couple of rounds it almost ran over cars on the road as they went by.
