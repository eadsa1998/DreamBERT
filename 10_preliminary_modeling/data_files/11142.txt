This dream took place entirely in one room and instead of a so-called plot, I dreamed of the room itself. It was supposedly a double room in a dorm. It was a corner room and had two windows. The companion wallpaper was flowered and was brown in color. There were twin beds in the room with chenille bedspreads. There were to desks, one being black and two dressers. Two pictures of my roommate were hanging on the wall. The floor was completely covered with maroon carpeting. My roommate was standing in front of the closet between the beds, and I was standing at the door leading into the hall. We were attempting to decide how we should rearrange the rooms we wouldn't have to walk around the bed every time we went to the closet.
