Nicolas got his license (he was older than me) and so one day he had to take me school. He was swerving all over the road and went really fast. I was telling him off because you don't know what's around the corner; there could be people in the middle of the road. I was then at school. Calvin and Samantha had made a list of 'quotes'. They were random ones like 'school made' which was for Evelyn and Darius and 'Izzy's boyfriend' for Eugene. Samantha was pregnant.
