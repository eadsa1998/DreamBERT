I was engaged in a vicious game of hockey with a number of fellows my own age. The bumping and board-checking were something terrific. Our team had been getting the worst of it all night, and finally, in desperation, we went on an all-out rampage. Our star player was seriously injured and carried off the ice, and then the game seemed to end.
