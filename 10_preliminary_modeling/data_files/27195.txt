I dreamed I was in a psychology class and was sitting next to one of my girl friends. The seats were not arranged in an orderly fashion but seemed to be mixed up in a disorderly manner. I had a balloon &amp; was playing with it when my girl friend reached out to get it. I gave it to her &amp; felt relieved for doing it as I felt Dr. H___'s eyes on me. This friend took the balloon &amp; blew it up - it was a long balloon and was yellow. Suddenly Dr. H___ stopped talking, walked down the aisle and grabbed the balloon away from my friend. He seemed to be so angry that he lost all coordination which caused him to have a peculiar walk. As he was walking towards his desk, he took his pencil and punctured the balloon. One could tell from the expression on his face that he was very angry.
