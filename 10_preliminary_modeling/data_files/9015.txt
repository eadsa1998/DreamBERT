My treadmill is broken and Bill F is trying to help me fix it. Instead of the round pieces at each side to hold on to while walking the upper, horizontal parts of those were rectangular in shape, with each end connecting into the electronics box instead of the electronics box attaching to them. The electronic elements were inside the rectangular pieces as well as the electronic box. That had come apart on one side and there were wires sticking out of the rectangular piece as well as the electronics box. I think Daddy came and was also then trying to help. He didn't think Bill F and I could fix it ourselves, and we may not have been able to. I don't think it really mattered to me that he wanted to help. I'm in my bedroom now and pointing out that my furniture is in really bad shape. The top of my bedside dresser is literally in pieces. It's as though it were made of numerous single boards that had been attached together and how now come apart. I was trying to keep them in place by just laying them next to each other but I couldn't keep them in place and you could see big gaps between them and see directly into the top drawer. Some of the boards would no longer lay flat either. Some were more significantly warped than others. The inside of the top drawer almost seemed to be illuminated in contrast to the top of the dresser. I'm talking about wanting to replace them as soon as possible after I find another job. Daddy agreed that I should replace the whole set but he thinks I should replace it one piece at a time. I don't really want to do that because I would rather have a matching set. Matthew and I are going shopping and we are discussing places that we might go to look for a decent inexpensive used bedside dresser in the meantime, like a local second-hand store. I still have paint left from repainting this set. If I find something used I can paint it to match the rest of the set.
