I was leaving a hospital, and some guy stepped on my foot. My leg was pronounced broken. They gave me a cast thing that velcroed on. When I got home I called Jacob. I woke up right before I left for camp. I was carried home just like Kerri Strug was at the Olympics. Setting: Hospital. Characters: Jacob - my teacher. Feelings and Thoughts: Pain, confusion. In pain. I felt confused about what was happening.
