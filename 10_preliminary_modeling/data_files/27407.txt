I seemed to be attending a party in my home. I recognized two of the people as being my cousin (a girl, age 30) and her husband. There were many people present. I was holding a baby which seemed to be my cousin's. He talked quite fluently for his age and I was much impressed by his intelligence. The scene shifts to my aunt's home (age 40). She seems to be showing me around her house. We come to one room that is empty and looks as if it had not been used in years. She then shows me a bedroom and I particularly notice the gay bedspread and matching drapes. We come to another room and I notice that it contains a double bed and two twin beds. I seem to owe her some money and she brings out a white slip with pencilled items on it and starts to figure.
