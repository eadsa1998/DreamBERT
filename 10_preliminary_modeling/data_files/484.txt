I am at the Women's Resource Center working with a friend who was once the director there. There is a lot of smoke. I am coughing and a man says I'm faking. There are a lot of other people there but they are all women. The man tells me to shut up and my friend, the director, says, "he means it." We are cooking and serving pancakes. I stay, but I stay out of his way because I know he was right. One of the women is a girl I knew back in high school but she was never a close friend. I'm hiding inside as some man wants to get in and keeps going around the building.
