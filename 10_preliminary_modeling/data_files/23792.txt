My middle sister was picking on me, over and over.  I was getting really sick of it.  She was wearing my clothes (in particular the blue long dress she gave me), getting them dirty, teasing me, saying mean things to me, doing things to me.  She did these things even when we were out with other people.  Finally one night I asked my oldest sister if I could sleep in another bed than on the top bunk above my middle sister, like if she would trade beds with me.  Apparently in this dream we all three slept in the same big room, my middle sister and me in the bunkbed like when we were little, and my oldest sister in a separate bed.  My oldest sister asked why.  With my middle sister in the room, I started describing all the mean things she was doing to me.  It was like no one had noticed, this was the first time it had come out, that I had let anyone know about it.  To make it really dramatic, I then said, "And when I'm in the top bunk, she reaches up and PINCHES my breasts like this!"  My middle sister made some exclamation of denial, but I was really upset and fed up with her.  I turned to my middle sister and said, "Can't you see what those kinds of inappropriateness can do to a child?"  It was as if I was remembering all the manipulative, neurotic, mean things she had done when we were little, and I was bringing it all out now, as an adult.
