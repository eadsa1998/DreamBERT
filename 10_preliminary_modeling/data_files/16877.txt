In this dream I'm 16 or 17 again. I'm on a school trip with various school friends and my partner in another country. First there were walks in the woods, like a trail. After dark several of us meet up. The next day we're all doing some kind of activity in an adventure playground. There are high climbing frames made of tree trunks and rope swings. The surrounding landscape is pine forests. There are various daring games. In the dream I'm not with my partner yet, and afterwards I pluck up the courage to talk to her. She tells me she is going out with an old acquaintance. The next day we had to take a train across the country. The train has a dramatic front to it - like a 1930s version of a viking ship in gleaming steel.
