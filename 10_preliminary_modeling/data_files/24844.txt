I went to school and we were doing Drama. Steve asked me, Melissa and Liz to sing in front of everybody. I don't like sitting in front of people so I sort of mouthed it: Then Steve, the Director, said Great! Liz, you're cast as Juliet, Melissa, you're cast as Lady Capulet, and Kelly, you're cast as the nurse. I felt cheated. I cried and said "I never even auditioned for the parts." Steve said that Melissa could sing the song in the play. I didn't even want the part of the nurse. I wanted Juliet. Setting: It took place at the stage (where) we usually had our performing night at school. It also took place at school. Characters: Steve is the director and the middle school head, and plays heavy favorites. Liz is a really popular "strong" actress, she never fells (sic) the parts. Melissa is a really homely person who is Steve's favorite and Carol is an okay actress. Liz is Steve's (illegible). Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, sad, cheated, mad. I felt sad that I never got a chance and Steve would cast me as the part I wanted no matter now good I was.
