I dreamed I was studying in the dorm. One of the girls from first floor came up and told me I had a telephone call downstairs. When I answered, I found I was listening to a record of a quiz program. The voice I heard was that of a boy who I have known for about 3 years, but not known too well. He was being asked a question which I think he must have answered correctly because he was given a reward. After that I found it hard to hear, so I hung up. The girls standing near me kept saying, "We told you so."
