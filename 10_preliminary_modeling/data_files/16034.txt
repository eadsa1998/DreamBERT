We went to Ms Nowak's class which was in this big lecture theatre. It was only some of the class. At the front were a list of shows and movies and other categories. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Young Ones were there and I said 'no one pick my favourite movie'. Ms Nowak said she knew I'd say that and had made a decision about groups. Bryce was in class and we all had green wristbands. The rest of the people came in and most had red bands, including Tristan and Frederick. I was annoyed she'd separated me and Tristan. We all got paired up with someone and attached to them. Justus and Frederick were together. Marcos was with someone else. We had to do some project together. I was avoiding Frederick but kept looking at him and missed him.
