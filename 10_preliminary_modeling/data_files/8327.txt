Something about my dissertation. Susan J and Dorothea D were both in my spiritual direction class. I had copied an article for them that I had asked them to read related to my dissertation. I think they were both going to be on my dissertation committee. I had made a copy of the proposal for Dorothea D but forgot to make one for Susan J. I told her I would make the copy and get it to her. I also told them both that if they had changed their mind or do change their mind about being on my committee because of time I certainly would understand. But it seems that maybe each of them were working on their PhD as well. We were talking about all of the technical editing. I said to them that I didn't think they should make themselves crazy about the technical editing of the proposal since we were required to hire a technical editor anyway at $25 an hour. I thought that as we were editing content, layout, and things like that, that we should make any technical corrections that we notice. Other than that we should rely on the technical editor that we are required to hire.
