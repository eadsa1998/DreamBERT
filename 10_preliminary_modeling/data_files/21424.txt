I was to see a building with Ann. I saw a policeman coming our way and I noticed I had long underwear on and I was outside. I walked towards the car with Ann. The key was in the door and I got in and drove away. The cop was writing my license on paper. We lived in a house that had a coal furnace. I put some coal on the furnace. Ann was laying nude. I put some hot ashes on her leg, but it didn't seem to burn her. I knocked it off with a shovel.
