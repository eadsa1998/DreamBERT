There is a second story deck around the building and I see the wood is stamped with the name Dougal. I look for my new camera because I want to take some interesting pictures of a dirt pile, an aquarium being made, and a tree with interesting lighting, but I can't find my new camera. I find my old one and take pictures, but I am unsure of the exposure times and focus. I then find where my father has accidentally put my camera away in the living room closet. I use it now. I am now in a spacious bathroom where I lay down on a futon/chaise lounge thing to suntan. There is a choice of music, chips and crackers to eat. It is pleasant. I get naked and enjoy the relaxing moment.
