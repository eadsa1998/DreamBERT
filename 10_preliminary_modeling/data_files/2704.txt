My family is going on a vacation and we are packing. I call us together and call out the items we need to make sure is in each suitcase: wallet, money, forks, spoons, knives, etc. We get all the stuff packed. I see a list of things. I read it over and over: sunset, blue sky, birds. It's like panels of torn paper collage pictures. Blue sky is repeated (see drawing in dream book).
