Was at the old house and playing some weird, old video game. I think it was related to Half Life, and I finished the first one and didn't really like it. I started the second one and then realised it was 5pm and I was late for work. I started to leave, but then went and ate all these chips like Burger Rings and Cheetos and then dinner and when I eventually left it seemed to take ages for me to get anywhere. I got stuck somewhere and started crying that I was going to be late. I was in a bathroom but lots of people were there and I told them to leave. I'd realised I got my period but took the pad I had off by mistake and didn't have another one. I also didn't have a bra on but people came back in and I needed to find somewhere to put it on. I kept trying to text Hector to say I was going to be late, but I never got around to it.
