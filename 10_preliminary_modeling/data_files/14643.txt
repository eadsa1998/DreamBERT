I was at the shop with Mom. We went there for something but then something I can't read but looks like 'tram' turned green. Something I can't read, but looks like 'CH quest for bar for blue' and something about $45. Some guy asked "why" and I said "because we want blue check thingies". This guy with a motorbike smashed something. We left and Mom's car was getting broken into. I called to Mom but then we realized it was the wrong car. It was night. We couldn't remember where we parked and there was another entrance at the shop (it was at Midvale). This car followed us as we walked around the carpark to the other entrance. This girl got out with a gun and we just kept walking. Mom unlocked the doors. The lady shot and took Mom, but I got in the car and drove off. I yelled out to this girl to call the police. I drove up the road where they were rebuilding the bar and then I went back. The people were leaving and Mom was walking alone and her hair was messy and started walking down the street. Later, there was some big building with lots of others and it was like a movie or something. This guy there had a French name but his real name was Jake Oriente. He was standing next to me and I thought that he liked me. He put his arm around me. Then it was a movie and everyone there took their clothes off, me included. This kid got an erection (like 8 years old or so) and this other guy bent him over and started having sex with him and complained about his poo. Everyone watched in disgust. This other movie that Jake was in, these girls saw maggots everywhere and spoke weird. Then they would start to bleed and then they would die.
