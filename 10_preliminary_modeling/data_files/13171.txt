Calvin and I were at this crime scene. There was a fake skeleton there in the place of the body. There was some shoe that had something to do with Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street). Zombies of some sort were around. There was a table which had names of dead people on there. Mariah was there and I laughed. Then I saw Michael Palin's name and I was like "Oh my God! No! My favourite person in the world!". I looked for Eugene's name, but I didn't find him.
