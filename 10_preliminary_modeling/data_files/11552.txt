In a house not known to me. I seemed to be waiting for someone. For some reason I left and went uptown to meet by chance my ex-girl's father (44). We talked a little bit, got along quite well, which was an exception, and then headed back for the house with him. Just from writing this, the house comes to me. It was his. I knew there was some ice cream in the ice box and he offered me some rootbeer. So I thought I'd combine the two for a Boston cooler. Dream faded.
