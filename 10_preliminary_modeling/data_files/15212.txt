Ezra woke up at 3 AM to go to work. I had two puppies, a brown one and a yellowish one. I was going to call them Stuart and Vince after the characters from Queer as Folk (UK) but I realised the brown one was a girl. Ezra had been looking after her. The names I was considering now were Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks), Kaylee (Firefly) or River (Firefly). I decided to go with Ezra for a bit. He was driving. He stopped at a house and they took him the rest of the way. I ended up at a friend of Mom's. I called her to get me. The clock said 12 PM but that was wrong. I heard the opening theme song of Queer as Folk (UK) and I turned around to see it playing on the TV and it was a scene with Stuart. I watched a bit of it.
