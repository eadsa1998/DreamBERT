I was watching Glee. Lea Michele said she didn't get along with the guy who would be playing her love interest. I was at home. At the front door, outside, was Seth Rogen but he was sometimes Jorge Garcia and had lost weight. Drew Barrymore was there too and had slept with him before he'd lost weight? Then I was inside with Mom and Ezra. They had vibrators and they had electrons which could disrupt other electron fields. We were hitting them together. Mom was like 'you're wasting good battery' and I said 'who cares, I don't use them' and she said "I do" and I was like 'ew' and put it down. She said to me, 'I think you like having more than the back of your head visible'.
