I was in Jackson and I was at Aunt Christine's kitchen table, and I had a laptop and I was typing away on it. And Bobby came over and wanted to see what I was doing, and you know how in a Word document I can have either a white or a blue background and print on it to match? Well, Bobby came over and he was putting a background behind my text, and he put up this really crazy thing that was kind of like a baseball scene, and then he put up a scene of Niagara Falls, and I said, "Okay, I like that one." And I went back to work, but I was afraid he was going to read what I was writing. And I think he was doing something else. He closed my document and he was just doing all kinds of crazy stuff. And then I realized that this thing was not just a regular thing, but it had two or three octaves of musical keys right above the typing keys, and you could go to freestyle and you could just go crazy all over the place. And about that time I faded into consciousness. That was a crazy thing.
