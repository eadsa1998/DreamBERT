I'm staying with a friend in an apartment building that is similar to the one I lived in as a teen. There's a bottle of Coke by the front door.  My friend says someone is looking for me and points out the window. I recognize a man from my unit in Vietnam. I yell to him, "Gary Owen! Gary Owen!" the password we used in the jungle when coming in from patrol. But he does not reply. When it's time to go, my friend says to be careful, they are looking to get me. In the hallway, someone stabs me several times. I'm bleeding. I wake up. I'm fearful for several minutes.
