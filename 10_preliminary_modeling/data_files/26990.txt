I was in a house. It was a beautiful large home with expensive furnishings. I went to the kitchen where I saw some people, whom I couldn't quite recognize. I saw 4 dogs one of which was a Collie; I also saw a small girl - an acquaintance of mine. I then found myself in the basement where I was watching my husband (24 yrs) and brother playing pinochle. My brother took the hand, but somehow my husband won money.
