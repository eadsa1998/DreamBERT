I was inside some place and there was fairy floss and it was like a blanket. Farrah and Ariana were there. They asked for some and I said "sure". There were some others and everyone just took a bit off. Ariana was very polite. Ezra was there too with a fairy floss blanket. He did something mean so I ruined something for him. Then I was with Mom and we were driving past Midvale shops and she was driving fast and was all over the road. She had a packet of drugs and was licking the inside of it. Once she had enough she drove normally again. This girl kept popping up on the street and it scared me because she was everywhere. There was also this guy who hopped across the road like a rabbit.
