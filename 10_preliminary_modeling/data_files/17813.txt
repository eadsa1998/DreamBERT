My boyfriend Jeremy and I lived at my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  It was morning and we were getting ready to go to work or school or something.  I was in a rush trying to turn out all the lights as I headed downstairs.  The last one triggered the Ghostbuster siren as I reached the bottom of the stairs and rushed for the front door.
