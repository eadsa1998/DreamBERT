We were staying at someone's house somewhere.  The phone rang, and I picked it up.  I was expecting it to be my maternal Grandma Jane, but it was my mother's friend Jill Block.  She sounded disoriented, thinking I was my mother.  "Claire....would you call the hospital please..."  So I dialed 911, but nobody answered.  There was silence.  I assumed then they were just going to arrive at where we were, because they didn't let me say otherwise.  I left the room to get things ready for bed.  I came back and my mother was shouldering a woman as she cried. I went back.  Something had moved, implying a ghost was around.  People started talking, but nobody really wanted to believe.  It had tried to stab my cousin Lonna.  Then, an RC car.  It seemed to sort of chase me.  I jumped on the mattress and said "Ah hah"- and then it leapt at me.  I said okay, you win.  I asked the ghost to talk to me on the phone (more like the second line headset).  At first it was just mumbling, but then I could hear him better.  My mother came in and I told her excitedly that I was talking to the ghost.  Then his story came at me all like a blur of text.  Something about virgins.  He asked me to follow him to the windy road up to the observatory, and a shadow grabbed my hand and pulled me off.  When I came back, I spoke to the ghost's grandchildren, a boy and a girl.  They might have been ghosts too, I'm not sure.  But that 'fixed' everything so he wasn't upset.
