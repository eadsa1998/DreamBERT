I was in a grocery store similar to Winn-Dixie.  Someone was leading me to a produce counter and instructing me in what to do.  I had a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach, partly due to what had formerly occurred (in the other dreams) and partly due to the fact that I was being weighed down with responsibility in a job I didn't particularly like.
