["Tidal waves and saving the babies."]  Raging tidal waves of brown roiling water is descending on me. People are running, screaming. I am running. I see naked brown babies being swept away. I am afraid for them. A woman runs past a baby. I grab the baby and I yell, "I will take care of the babies." I am being righteously indignant and feeling put upon. I am angry at her for abandoning them to their fate. I know I can't save them all, but I manage one or two, even though my instinct is to save myself and leave them behind.
