I was in Mexico walking around and my feet were all full of mud and I went to wash them off, but they wouldn't get clean. One minute I was washing my feet off, the next I'm sitting in a boat in the middle of the bay without a paddle, trying to get to my new boyfriend, Mike--he's in a boat also. We finally meet. I blink and we are walking along the water and again we are standing in a dirty washroom and I'm trying to wash off again.
