Atomic explosion in C. City (where I see my analyst). There is not too much panic since city has a 'life belt' surrounding it; but I am determined to leave for California and look around for a second hand car. Pick out eight old jalopies and make out checks for all of them! But as I wave my bundle of checks at the old man selling the cars, I realize how foolish it is to buy all this junk. Finally, I buy a new car and take off with Marita to California. When I arrive there is a convention and it is warm. I am so happy feeling the air and no coat.
