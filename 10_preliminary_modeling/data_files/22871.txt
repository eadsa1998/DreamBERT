I was working in a store, but in the open.  It was a pretty dirty place.  Behind me was something representing a cow.  It wasn't the whole body-only the front, perhaps.  Attached to it were four or five bloody hands, resembling dogs' paws.  I could hardly stand to be there.  Someone told me that if anyone had handled a paw originally (there had been only 2 originally), they might get the disease too, whatever it was.  I was horrified, because I remembered examining them earlier.  I wanted very badly to get away.
