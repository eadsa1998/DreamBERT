Audrey and I were running thru a field. We couldn't stop so easy because it was muddy. When we stopped, a big road grate came toward us, so we started to run again. Then it seemed to turn into a horse. The boss of the crew pointed his gun to the road across the field, but didn't shoot. I had a fancy pistol and I had a picture of the crew boss with one of these guns. He was a picture friend and made a good profit doing it. I showed it to some policemen and they admired it as they held it with the newspaper clipping. The crew boss came in and I showed him the gun. He admired it and one of the policemen said he is a gun collector. It's a waste of money, how many guns he has.
