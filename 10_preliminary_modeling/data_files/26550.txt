 I'm at home in Oak Valley. The UPS man pulls up in the back driveway, towing my boat. He has come to drop off the boat and a package in the boat. The rest of the boat is filled with junk. I sign a slip with my initials. The man makes a comment to the effect that I'm trying to be sneaky, and to re-sign the slip. I apologize to him: I had no intention of duping him, and I sign my name on a longer line.
