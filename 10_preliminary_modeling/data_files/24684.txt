I went over to my friend Ellie's house and we had to walk back on the highway all the way to my house. It was from San Francisco to San Carlos. first we passed my parents at my neighbor's house, then we walked up to the house. The house wasn't my house. I went inside then my best friend Amy appeared and we ran inside and jumped (on) the bed. This bed was reserved for Amy. So I had to make it again. I couldn't do it. So I asked my mom to do it. Then Bob came along. He was going to go out and I told him to be careful. Setting: Ellie's house, and along the highway, and my house (but wasn't my house in dream). Characters: Ellie (OK friend), Ellie's mom (don't know her), Amy, my BEST friend, my mom (I know), Bob (cute boy at school), Starla (OK friend). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I personally think that this was a really weird dream. But I think it was sort of fun at the same time.
