This dream is set in a balloon field with strong light. A beetle car has been lashed with ropes attaching an enormous balloon to the top of the car. The balloon isn't dangling above, rather it is right on top of it, and is slightly bigger than the car itself. The passengers include a friend from primary school (Jake), my cousin Adrian and myself. We intend to fly this car. I don't remember what happened next.
