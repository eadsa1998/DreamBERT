I dreamed that I was in a very high mountain which was covered with snow, but I wasn't cold. I looked down and saw a valley filled with forests. I looked and continued to look at a tall and bare tree, until I saw that it had writing on it and it was in a language I didn't understand. I thought it was German, but I couldn't read it (not because I didn't know it, but because I couldn't make out the words). The words looked fuzzy and they seemed to vibrate. I struggled so that the tree would stop moving, but it didn't and I cried. Then the tree fell on top of me, and it covered me with its leaves and I awoke because the alarm clock rang.
