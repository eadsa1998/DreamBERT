 I am going ice fishing at Mud Lake. It is springtime. My friend and I don't know how thick the ice is. We have a long thin metal pole to test it out. We are using my friend Bubba Hacker's auger. Bubba's truck is there, and the auger is in the back, along with a blue sled. There are two other guys going out on the lake to fish.
