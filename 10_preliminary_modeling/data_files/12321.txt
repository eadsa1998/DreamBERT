Some person who kept changing made Ezra and I follow them because we asked where some guy was. There was a dark room with a torture chair. It was Granny's old house, but didn't look like it. I didn't trust the person so I snuck into the kitchen and unlocked the door and started running but my knee screwed up and they got me. We ended up escaping. I was on this plane and there were people from Year 7 and Year 6. I was looking out the window to see Dmitri. I put all these blankets and stuff on top of me. Calvin was there. This guy told him that he had had dreams of me and he recognized me (he was the same guy from before, but not). When we got off he ran upstairs and he realized who I was.
