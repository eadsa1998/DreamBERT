 I'm catching chickens. I wander through several large rooms with corridors between them. There seems to be an underwater feeling to the rooms. I go into a room where two familiar women are peeling shrimp, as a job. They ask me if I want one. I ask them if it's okay, and they say any of us can eat all we want. I think this is like the chocolate factory I visited. I ask if the shrimp are cooked, and the woman says yes. So I peel a shrimp and eat it. <br/
