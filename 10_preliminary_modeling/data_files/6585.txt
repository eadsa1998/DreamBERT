At a church supper. Getting tables ready. Someone cutting pieces of cake in two slices. Says small pieces for children. I say "Yes, I'll cut mine that way too." Find my own silver gone from window sill on which I had placed it. Others help hunt. I go to turn my chair in to keep my place while hunting. Lady next gives me he chair for that purpose. She falls as if seat had been taken from under her.
