I was at a house. I had to get to a little octopus to inject it to stop it transforming. I got it outside and hid it behind a mattress. I got someone to get someone to help. They came back with a needle and I injected it. Then the octopus was a girl and she started having a fit and was turning into something dangerous, so Ezra and I ran inside and locked ourselves in a bedroom. I saw a cat under the door. It left, then Ezra called it back. I was annoyed at him for doing this, but it left again. The girl cried that the cat jumped off the fence and said it was ok explaining that cats had 'help'; she demonstrated on hands and knees saying it was like that, but on a pillow and she was ok. Later we had dinner and everyone had a good sized meal, but mine had a few thin slices of carrot and yellowish meat. The lady said it was "grilled banana" and I said 'what the hell, I'm not eating this'. I said "I'll go myself", then went for a drive with Mom and Ezra. She was driving fast and there was a bend around a cliff without a rail. Then it was a race. I can't read much of this, but at the end we were on a mountain and had to go through these rings? Ezra got no armour? People were staring at a church thing. Willem Defoe was a lawyer and some girl liked him.
