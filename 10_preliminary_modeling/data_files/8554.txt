I was at Bill C's house. He and Jane C were getting ready to go on a bike ride. I was going to stay there with his two daughters, Kelly C was younger than in waking life. We were going to be painting some things that were sitting in their garage. There were two different types of things but several of each. One looked like a bunch of window shutters. We were painting them a rose color, a very dark pinkish-red. We didn't finish before Bill C and Jane C came back. Jane C was questioning us, but I'm not sure if it's because we hadn't finished or she didn't think we were doing a good enough job or what exactly. We were also cleaning up and preparing for some kind of event. I picked up a package that turned out to be a new package of underwear for Bill C. It was the standard white what I think they refer to as jockey shorts or what I have also heard referred to as tidy-whities. I was surprised that Bill C would wear this type of underwear. It just didn't seem like his style. The event was getting underway but we were somewhere other than there house. There were a lot of people. We had three lines going where people could enter and each line was fairly long. Jane C and I were monitoring the lines, greeting people, and helping with things there.
