I see a dog who is very enthusiastic and eager to do his job. He is asked to sniff out where the woman is who is going to give them her baby. I follow the dog as he lunges, sniffing, through a thick crowd of people. It is nearly impossible to get through, it is so dense, but somehow the dog manages to worm his way through. A path opens for him and tightly closes as he passes. He finds a woman seated in a corner holding her baby girl. She sees the dog and says sadly, "You found me." She doesn't want to give up the baby. She had already given up the sister of this baby to these same people, but she resignedly goes with the dog back to the people and gives up the baby. Now I am seated on a couch and watch as a woman comes in and is told, surprise, she's going to get married. She wears a strapless dress, black, like my "kidnapped in Mexico" dress. Out of a closet pops a silly hip minister, a boy and maybe the dog. He will perform the ceremony.
