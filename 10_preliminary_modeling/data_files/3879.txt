["Howard wants me to come home."] I am exhausted and lying down on a raft like wooden thing. Howard is sitting by me on the left, He is gently but insistently trying to talk me into coming back home with him and living with him. I can barely talk I am so tired, but I keep saying no every once in a while. I am interested in a man over on shore, off in the distance. He might be an interesting relationship to explore. Howard is sad but he know she has no chance.
