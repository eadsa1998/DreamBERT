 I'm at a New York Mets baseball game. Darryl Strawberry is up to bat. It is the bottom of the ninth inning with two outs. He hits a two-run home run, his second home run of the game! I'm in the right field bleachers. The ball from the home run comes towards me, and bounces. I wrestle a man for it. I almost have it; we are both reaching for it. There are people wearing blue and orange striped shirts. I am wearing one of these shirts. We have to throw the ball 45 feet. We throw the ball the wrong way.
