I was with my boyfriend Jeremy.  Wherever we were, I left for a moment, following my father.  He made huge waves, with mental powers.  I was surprised to find that he had them, but not overly so.  It was magnificent, the deep blue of the water.  I wondered how he wielded so much power as to make such a huge wave over the entire body of water.  I was about to ask but I realized myself that it wasn't the size, that's just a psychological obstacle.  If you know how to do it at all, you're there.    We were about to go back in; it was now like a secret between my father and I.
