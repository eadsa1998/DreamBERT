I am downtown in my town collecting news. I talk to a priest, then stop at a store. A clerk is crying about a death, apparently of a child in a van. There was something defective in the van and the child died. The child belonged to a woman who was going to be married. Something about the grandmother being difficult. The clerk says she doesn't know how the couple can get married now. I pick up the obituary and am anxious to get back to the office and read it. The office is in my hometown - not my town now - and the office is an alley. I am going down the alley and am now in a red truck. I scrape a gas truck which is parked on my left. It begins to move and passes through a garage. I park my truck and check the scrape. I didn't make much noise but there is a huge scrape on the right front fender of the red truck. I am anxious to eat a lunch I bought at a restaurant in my town but I hear a noise and I know the runaway truck has hit someone. I see a man and tell him I hit the truck but it wasn't in park. I think about telling him the truck was already moving and hit me but I figure they can tell by the scrape on my truck who hit who first.
