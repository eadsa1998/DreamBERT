[1997-06-08] Another wild dream. Mort and I were traveling somewhere and there were people from MFB there, people from the council, but the married couples couldn't stay together and we all had little charms or beepers on so they could tell where we were. Where we were traveling, I have no idea but it was scary because they were playing all this country music on the bus, God was it scary!.
