We were moving rooms in college.  I was taking the one right next door to ours, a single.  I was going to ask my dorm floor mat Carol for my tape measure so I could rearrange things.  For some reason it felt sort of sad, splitting from my roommates Sally and Chelsea, although we were still in the same building.  I said so.  I tried to connect my computer, but it didn't seem to work.  I had to change my phone number first.  Had trouble finding that as well.  What I was trying to hook up was a Myst world, like Everquest in some way, I guess.  I finally got it to work; for the remainder of the dream, I was there.  Ocean.  On land were 2 robots and their armies.  One round, one boxy, like my computer Skynet.  The box one was the bad one.  "I will destroy you!" it said.  The other cracked up in laughter.  "That's the second funniest thing I've ever heard you say!" it responded.  The other asked, "Well, what's the first?".  "Mickey."
