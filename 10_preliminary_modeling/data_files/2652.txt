I am in some huge room like a warehouse. I'm looking for my camera. Tyler and Janet have moved it somewhere and I can't find it. A fat statue of a goddess says to me, "Would you please take my place for awhile? I've got some stuff to do." I hesitate, because I don't know if it will be unpleasant or hurt or not. Then I do. She goes off and I stand in her place. Later, I go outside and am still looking for the camera. I go home, driving my van. I go in and a man from a publishing house is waiting for me with good news. He wants to publish my book. I ignore him, looking for the mail. I see two rejection letters there. I decide to go downstairs and take a swim. I go down a long flight of white stairs where the walls are up high. I keep trying to make the walls into windows, but no dice. I get to my basement and see a huge swim pool. I know some men are waiting to go swim, but I take all my clothes off and dive in; they will just have to wait. I swim well and it's very sensual and wonderful. Everyone waits for me.
