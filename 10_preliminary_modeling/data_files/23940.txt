Something about going to a party - Hawaii, or did I lie and just say that to my parents. I do remember having a baby carriage with my grandparents as babies in it. I was going to put a third in there too - who was it - a little blond baby. I was sitting with the carriage with no socks or shoes on and there was glitter on the floor. I rubbed it all over my feet - tons of it- and some on my legs - but that looked weird because my leg's skin was kind've chicken-like. <br/
