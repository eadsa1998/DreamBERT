I was at home and there was this woman who came over to talk to me, and she was an elderly woman like Margaret Henderson, except she was calling herself Mrs. Michaelson, and she was talking like Mrs. Dougherty, so apparently she was a figure that was all of those rolled into one. [laugh] Bizarre, man. And I was sitting on the stairs and she was kind of like laying on the stairs above me and like leaning on her elbow so she could talk to me, and she was saying how it would sure be nice if I could be coming back to Westport High School and attending a chorus rehearsal so that I could be in the concert. And I was explaining to her that I wish I could, but I have college. And you know how people sometimes lay a guilt trip on you and stuff. Well, she was like trying to do that. Anyhow, she had this sweet old lady kind of a voice, and Mrs. Dougherty doesn't lay a guilt trip on people if they're not actually in the group full time, but this woman did. So she was talking to me about coming to rehearsals and all, and I can't remember, but I think she gave me a teddy bear and some kind of diamondy-like Christmas ornament. And I'm trying to think what else. I let it slip away because I went back to sleep this morning instead of record it. A thing with me is sometimes I wake up with a really dry throat and feel like "bleah....", I'm in a groggy sleep state, and if I get out my tape machine and record my dreams, I'll sound like really far away like I do sometimes, and I'll be all dry, and you know how that goes. So I think I wait until I'm a little more awake and I'll sound a little more normal, but then I forget half the dumb thing. And sometimes I'm too lazy to reach over and grab this thing, so I guess I'll just have to do that.
