I first dreamed that I was in chemistry, when I realized my entire schedule had changed. I was in none of the same classes, but my entire schedule was somehow filled up. I had the opposite lunch period from all my friends, and Billy Joel was my college advisor. Then I was in my room sorting my bras, and I couldn't find the white one I was looking for. Then, I dreamed that I was sailing in the pool. There were 3 different kinds of boats, and I didn't know which one to use, so I asked Caleb. Pete, Sam, and some other guys kept trying to listen, so Caleb waited until they went away so he could tell me which boat to use. I distinctly remember putting my hand up to cover my mouth, even though he was the one who was whispering. Our mouths were really close again, but we pulled away before anything happened, I guess. Next, I was at some swim meet and there were bookshelves lined up for bleachers. They were really narrow, so I kept falling off onto the pool deck. People laughed at me when I fell. Mason and Isaiah were sitting on the bookshelf with me and they finally fell too when the whole thing toppled into the water. Then I lived in this house of grime. I lived right next to some huge factory, so all the dirt, grime, smoke, and ash from the factory made a film over my house. It was really disgusting. Then I woke up.
