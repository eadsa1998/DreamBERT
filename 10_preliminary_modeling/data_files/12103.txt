I was at school and we would get points for doing stuff. The same people were always finishing. My group was going to cook. I went to the teachers' kitchen and it was all dark. There was this killer guy who was a black cop. He stabbed me, but it didn't do anything. I got him in the head. He was handing out Freddo's to people. I met some people going to a lolly shop. There was a cinema, which seemed to never end -- at the front of the room with the screen, there was a door which led to another room. This crazy killer dude did a crazy dance. I was at 'home', and this guy was pulling a tree up and it exploded. I ended up in Canada, and then I walked to Germany and then to Spain. I saw Dad in a place called 'Broken Cord' or something. There was a dog breeding ground.
