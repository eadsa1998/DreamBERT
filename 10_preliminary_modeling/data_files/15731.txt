I drove to this restaurant thing and the first floor had collapsed, but second floor ok (no-one was on second floor). It was day time. I looked in at all the people stuck in the rubble and went back to the car. I heard giggling and a group of young people came up and said 'is Valerie in there' and I was like 'I dunno' and they said thanks for picking us up and I said I didn't and she said 'you will though' and I said 'I won't' and she said 'you will'. It was now night time and I turned on my lights. I locked my door and drove off - and saw them holding on behind. I drove crazily but it didn't knock them off. Eventually it did, but they followed and kept turning up. I was trying to find the freeway but didn't know where I was. I ended up near a hospital and called Mom and she said she was at Dad's and I said I was being stalked but she didn't have any suggestions. I got out and went into the hospital, and it was now day again. I was trying to navigate but it was difficult. There was an area underneath the hospital which had like airport shops.
