Going to a steamer in a ricshaw. The man is a slender blonde. I wonder why a white man pulls it. He talks about his job. My luggage is in the cabin, a very narrow single room. Mother and I are to share it but where can I sleep? I will have to be on the floor by her. We will have to send for an extra mattress. Having arranged the luggage we start on deck. I tell mother I haven't my ticket yet but will wait until we start. Then if they don't like my check they can't put me off. I ask her for cash but she hasn't enough. As we go on deck an under officer asks to see my ticket. I say that I will have to get it form the purser first and ask where he is. He tells me back and to the right on this deck. The purser is busy but in a bit he clears his desk and sits on the opposite side. I start to buy the ticket. "how much shall I make the check out for?" $19. I express surprise at the low price, clear from Shanghai to the USA and ask him to repeat the price. I hear, "Nineteen" very distinctly. Am surprised and relieved that no objection is made to the check. We are passing down a river.
