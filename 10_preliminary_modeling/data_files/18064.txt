I was in the mall and there was a pet shop there and I had money to get two fish. I went in and there was this cage with two purple fish, and I bought them. Then the next day it was school and when I got home from school the fish were gone. I went back to the pet shop and they were there. But this time somebody stopped me from getting them and said these kind of fish you cannot buy. So I went back home and I dealed with it.
