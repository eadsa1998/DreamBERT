Three women roommates have three or four men roommates. The women notice the men have disappeared and only come back occasionally and secretly. We look in their room and see only four shirts left in their closet. They usually have many more. We suspect they are out trying to have sex with the wife of one of them. The guy is gone so they're after her. We don't approve. I feel sad they would do this. Now I am one of the women and I'm hiding in the basement/laundry room to spy on them. I'm under a pile of clothes and sheets. They come in to get clean shirts. There is a gorilla/monkey with them. He makes lots of noise. I listen to them talk and realize they were being honorable after all. They've been going up to a monastery (I see a dragon-like creature with a Chinese monkey face) to take care of things there.
