I was taking care of children and after doing my homework I lay down and went to sleep and when I woke up, it was very late and the children's parents weren't home yet. So I just left. The next thing I was waking up the next morning in my house and my mother was asking me how could I have left those poor children alone last night. I felt terrible about it and I told my mother I must be going crazy.
