 I'm in Mexico, in a place that feels like Cancun. I'm walking with five men to a movie theatre to see a movie about the Congo. I get a bottle of Snapple taken away from me. The theatre attendant squishes all of us into one row. The movie is about a man named Simon and his ghosts. The scene is a mountain. Simon and his crew climb the mountain, and are confronted by the ghosts. The ghosts are familiar fears. Simon's crew dies. He conquers his fears at the top of the mountain. A woman with a whip-like bungee is the last to be conquered.
