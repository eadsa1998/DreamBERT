Some others and I had been kidnapped? We were being kept in this old place and were like the equivalent of Jews in World War 2. We escaped and the guy had been our teacher? Benjamin was there too. I went to class and there was a package with stuff for me on my desk full of in-jokes. Benjamin left and I followed and jokingly asked if he needed a lift. He did, so I gave him one. He had an earring. Dad was in back of car and the brakes weren't working properly. I couldn't stop at a set of lights and crashed down the hill. I got out, but Dad was still in and acting weird.
