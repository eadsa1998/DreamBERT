I was going to the library at my best friend Emma's university to study for some language course I was taking.  I met a girl when getting off the train, I think named Cora.  She was leaving.  I asked her for directions and she decided to show me.  We went around the building and inside there was a step aerobics class.  They had some gymnastic and weightlifting equipment sitting in the corner that I wanted to try out.  Cora took me to the front of the class.  There was some discussion as to whether I feasibly could, given I wasn't dressed for working out.  Somewhere in there, the exercise idea was abandoned.  It might have been the instructor, a tall man, who approached me in sinister dark clothing.  Everyone was going to have sex with him.  He scared me.  I declined.  Later on he approached me again, and I played two roles.  I was myself had I chosen to stay with the group, following someone back to a private booth of someplace.  I was also myself watching myself, and I saw the first me with an extended belly...I was pregnant.  The observing me was distraught and crying.  I asked if that was how I would end up had I chosen...without finishing my sentence.  The dark figure I was with nodded, and I was still crying, but relieved at my decision not to go with the group.
