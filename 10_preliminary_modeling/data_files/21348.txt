I was cleaning off something off a truck and there were a lot of red rags underneath. We were playing ball out in the field in Rivertown. I had a nice view of the green grass and nice open field. I was with two men who were arguing. When I got back, one man was all cut up and bruised. A man was holding a knife in his hand and the third party just came in and the man holding the knife told the fellow who just came in, "Where were you so long?" Then the man with the knife put his tongue out and the other fellow held his hands on his face, looking at the sliced tongue. The fellow with the sliced tongue looked at a mask on the other man's arm and said, "You did this to us, but you better stay and help me with this other man." I was going to sleep on the porch, but it was raining and the roof leaked and water came all over the porch. A small baby gave me a kiss and said, "I love you." It was so small, I was surprised it could talk. Ann and I had a key for Rudie's home. When we got there, no one was there, so we opened the door and walked in. When Mr. and Mrs. Rudis came home, they seemed like they didn't like it, but didn't say anything. I heard in my sleep, "7 come 11."
