Dan Palmer was on OkCupid and I went on his profile to find it had been updated and filled out - he was 40 years old (which shocked me) and we had a 96% match. He had a photo of himself for every year and his one for 1991 he only looked about 8. I hoped he would find me in his matches and message me.
