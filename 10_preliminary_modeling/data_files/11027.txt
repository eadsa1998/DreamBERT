It was just before a stunt night rehearsal. I had to find a gym outfit to wear and went to the gym department. At the desk I noticed racks of costumes which the seniors wore two years ago. They were striped black and yellow with purses to match. Also on the shelf were a number of glasses--cocktail or champagne glasses. Finally the teacher came to the desk. It was one of the Mather instructors but, looking around, I realized it was the gym department of the high school I attended in New York. I then went into my gym class and participated in the activities. From there, went down to the locker room and still being confused as to whether I was in Cleveland or New York, I couldn't find my locker. I seemed to have been in a very big hurry. It seems I had to get to another class. A friend of mine helped me find my locker. I also remember something about a rattlesnake which was given to me as a gift.
