I was doing some contract work and I was working at this government/army office place. Tristan was also there. I was sitting at a desk and looked behind and saw an GBCS sticker and I was like 'do we stocktake here?' and then a few minutes later, a group of stocktakers came through the door. Mason was the supervisor, but I didn't recognise anyone else. I waved and made a joke like 'see I had a legit reason to not to do this job, because I'm working somewhere else'. Something happened and there were zombies, but they would get a little octopus attached to the back of their head when they were turned into a zombie. The octopus would also glow. The zombies would sleep in between attacks and if someone came near they would wake up and attack. Some of it got closed off and we had to kill all of them and open the doors to get out. I got separated from a big group, who got through while I got left behind. Though they hadn't all been killed. Tristan was in the group ahead and was right next to the big open door to the outside.
