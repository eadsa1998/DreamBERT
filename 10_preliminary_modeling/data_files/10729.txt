I dreamed I was in to see a doctor (a stranger) for consultation. The examination seemed of a trivial nature, but continued for quite some time. I was growing more puzzled by the procedure and wondering why he was taking so long. At last he seemed terribly pleased with himself and told me I had cancer. At the same time indicating because of his skill and early detection of the growth, complete cure was possible.
