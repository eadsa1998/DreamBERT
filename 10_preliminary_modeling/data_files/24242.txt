I was on assignment to cover both an amusement park something or the other (a race?) and a military homecoming/departure. I was just dropped into the setting -- unaware of where I was. But I saw a sign on the highway -- I was 13 miles from the city where I had my first newspaper job. It had the blue and red shield-shaped interstate markers. There were palm trees. The people there talked candidly. One was trying to get his two dogs, breeder dogs, into a pen in the back of his truck. He wore heavy sunglasses -- his vision was failing. But he was chipper. Many of the parents were somber, and one even said, "there are a lot fewer dead this time" I said, "really, is that so?", so I could get a response to speak to the fact that yeah, this was a good month -- only 5 dead instead of 20.
