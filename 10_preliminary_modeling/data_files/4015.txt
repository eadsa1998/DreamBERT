["Center of Attention"]  I am seated in a large crowd of people. Way up at the top of the bleachers are the important people who perform. I am leaning back on the ample bosom of an older woman, feeling relaxed and comfortable. I watch a man doing a performance. He is racing on the ice covered ground, running from something that could get him.The man tries very hard but doesn't quite make it. Now the important woman at the top of the bleachers is making a public speech about his performance. She then suddenly starts talking about me and how I will criticizes his work because I am always critical in a negative way. I am surprised and angry she speaks like this about me in public. I stand up and announce that I am not critical of his performance. I in fact think it was wonderful. The fact that he almost but not quite made it successfully was even an added plus to the excitement and poignancy of the performance. I am furious at the woman and stare up at her. The older woman and a younger woman seated next to us are very aware I may blow up and be caustic in my speech with this woman. They are trying to calm me down. But I stand up and walk toward the woman who is descending the stairs. I grab her with a cane behind the neck and jerk her around and force her to the wall. I lean into her and tell her off, angrily. How dare she berate me in public and so on. Then I walk away in a huff. When I sit back down, a woman comes up to me and says look at that. You did it again. Two years ago, you sat on the stage itself, and was the center of attention. Last year, you accidentally sat with the important people and was the center of attention. And now you managed it again!!
