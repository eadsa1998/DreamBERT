I was at some friend of Dad's place. We were on Hotties, on my account. I was worried about typing in my password but figured it was just Facebook. They had a young daughter who was really munted looking and one side of her head was big. She was crying. We went home and my money on Hotties transferred to Dad's account, because his friend had stolen my password.
