I greeted a lady at a church. She was light complected, about 25, and healthy-looking. Then I knelt in a pew next to another lady about the same age. She was slimmer. She was on my left. I do not recall her saying anything to me, but I felt her grasp my left hand and press the back of her hand against my belly as it held mine. Then she suddenly became faint and fell into my arms. I lay her unconscious body on the pew and looked around for aid. I saw my mother a few pews behind. She had seen it happen, and was going for aid. I was surprised that she was there.
