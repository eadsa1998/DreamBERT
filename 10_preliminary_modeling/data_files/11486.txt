I was walking along the street with a friend when we came to a movie house which had been made over and was now used for church meetings. On the marquee was an announcement that Ted Williams had died. I felt very bad after reading this and considered his death a great loss to the sports world. Then I began to wonder why he died, for death resulting from complications arising from a simple arm wound seemed very strange. Then I woke.
