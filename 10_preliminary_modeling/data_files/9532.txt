See Father Andrew outside my house: I have been working on some kind of special altar. I remember pinning up a blue gown: I see him and extend my left hand to him and put my head on his shoulder. He comforts me and smiles and says: "I got Wendy's card, it was charming"... I say "I am sick with emotions." We laugh and I feel better.
