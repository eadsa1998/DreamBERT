I'm in bed and Bob B gets into bed with me. He wants to make love. I feel uncertain and feel that I shouldn't because he is Howard's brother and he's married, but I feel sexual and willing to make love to him. I kiss him and we make love. He's not very good. He can't seem to get his penis in good and is a little embarrassed. We roll around and I'm on top and I feel an orgasm, it's too early, but, oh well.
