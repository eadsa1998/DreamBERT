I was writing something for someone, a large document. I had used quotes or stories from various people. There three adults in particular, triplets, that I had information from. When I went to use the information, I couldn't remember which information came from which triplet. I was trying to figure out a way that I could identify it. Someone brought them in and then I figured out which information belonged to which twin.
