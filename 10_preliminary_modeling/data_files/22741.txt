Today I awoke and didn't remember a thing, but I was sure I had had a good dream. Finally at this time I have remembered it vaguely and it went like this: Surroundings: it happened in a place which looked like a kitchen or dining room; it wasn't a familiar place. There was an ordinary table and everything and 3 chairs. I only remember this, but not the walls or what surrounded this place. There was a woman, Marcia, of about 35 years and Ann, a girl of about 15, daughter of Marcia. Marcia was the cook of the next door neighbors we had when I lived in Arequipa. In the dream she was complaining to me about Ann. I am not sure about this, but so it seems to me.
