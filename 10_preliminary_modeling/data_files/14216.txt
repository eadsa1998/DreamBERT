I had been going out with this hot guy and for some reason that I couldn't remember we had broken up a few weeks ago. Me, him and some friends were going out. We were all in this big toilet while some of the others got ready. He was there with a girl and he was hugging her and had his arms around her from the back and they were mucking around. I was at the wall and was bored. I slid down to the floor and put my water bottle on my head. Later, we were outside somewhere and Ezra was around. I was thinking that we should play Warcraft. We were talking about Crusades and our daily production on the game, but it wasn't really Crusades. The guy and I made up and he said he wasn't over me etc, but the girl he was with wouldn't leave him alone. I was sitting down in this forest and he walked past Elijah, who was sitting on a stump playing a guitar. He was playing the first few notes of a song. My guy friend said to him "you won't [or will?] get her like that". Elijah didn't know I was there. I remembered back to a while ago and we'd had sex and A World Without Love was playing. I was trying to remember why I had sex with him.
