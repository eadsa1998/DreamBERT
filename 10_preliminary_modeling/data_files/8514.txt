I was at Mass with some of my siblings and Matthew. As people began standing and walking up to receive communion I saw Larry K. I was surprised because I didn't know he was Catholic. My family and I rose and began walking up, exiting the pew to our right. Matthew had been sitting to my right. As we moved out of the pew, Matthew stayed in front of me instead of minding his manners, stepping back, and allowing me to walk in front of him. I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around and looked at me. He immediately realized what he had done so he stepped to the side for me to get in front of him. He seemed a bit younger, and very thin. He was wearing very faded blue jeans and a light blue, short sleeved shirt.
