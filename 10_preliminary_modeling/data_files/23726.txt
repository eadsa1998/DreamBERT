Someone was applying needles in my back.  I thought it had to do with my back injury.  They were put in all over my middle and upper back.  This took forever.  The needles were huge and long.  And when applied there was pressure around them - like cupping technique.  It went on and on.  It was a woman putting them in.  I could feel the pain as each went in.  And there was something about a substance being put into the muscle, through a syringe.
