I was in my old apartment on a rainy afernoon with my mother, brother, father and my dog. We knew that someone had to come in and exterminate our apartment. We had three bathrooms. The exterminator placed a light bulb, which turned out to be an explosive, underneath the sink in the bathroom. He put another tube under the kitchen sink. This tube looked like a roll of pennies. He told us we had 30 minutes to get out of the apartment before it went off. Somehow we couldn't get out. We each could pack one bag, but we weren't able to find my dog's sweather and it was cold. We all had to run out before the house blew up. Finally, we all went outside and the house started to smoke. We got out just in time.
