Another dream about the agency with no badge.  I started out on an elevator in the morning, with a number of other employees, most or all of them new.  The elevator rose at an angle, like the funiculaire in Quebec.  A couple of people asked me what kind of work I did.  I just smiled and reminded them, "No classified talk in elevators," while at the same time hoping to distract them from noticing that I had no badge.  On one floor there was a glass or wire mesh-enclosed room with a slightly raised floor.  Inside were several women nude at least to the waist.  Their breasts were of different sizes and pendulousness.  I went up to them, thinking if they didn't make an embarrassed effort to cover themselves, it was an open invitation to something or other.  But they didn't seem interested.  There was one other woman, on a bed just outside the room, and she seemed more willing, but I don't remember what came of it.  <p
