I remember climbing steps to my house and my friend Peter was in front of me also climbing the steps. He said something that I couldn't hear or understand. I asked him to repeat it. He then turned around and said, "I told you I love you," as he was still climbing the stairs. This surprised me quite a bit in my dream (also after I woke up!) because we are good friends who have known each other over 20 years and have never expressed any romantic interest in one another. I only remember saying, "Oh," in my dream and thinking that what he said was so nice and tender. In my dream I was thinking about saying the same thing to him prior to him saying what he did, but I didn't!
