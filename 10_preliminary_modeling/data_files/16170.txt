I can't believe the bizarre dream I had last night. First of all I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra were in town and we were going to go to dinner with Pavarotti. [laugh] And we were waiting and waiting and waiting at their little apartment, and he never showed up. So we thought, "Fine, we're just going to dinner ourselves." Well, we never did go to dinner. We brought them home, and I was like typing up a storm because it was Sunday night and my essay was due on Monday. And I also had my vocabulary to do, and I was thinking maybe I could handwrite it, but I wouldn't get very far. And so typing up a storm and also something happened to the computer, and it gets this weird thing going on, like it shows the keyboard on the screen like highlight the letters as you type them. And in order to get rid of this, we have to like do a whole bunch of "escape" and all this stuff, and I haven't even saved my work to a floppy. And then I wake up with a start and I realize that the whole time I was typing I wasn't writing my essay, I was describing and writing about the system, the system from my EJ thing that's called the Escort 2000. And I wake up with a start and I realize my essay is already turned in. I turned it in on Friday, and I like breathe a sigh of relief. [laugh]
