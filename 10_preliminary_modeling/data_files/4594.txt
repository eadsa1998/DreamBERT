["Chinese relationship."] I am traveling in China. I look out the car window and see huge shop windows. I am in the downtown area of a big city. The windows are so huge that the people look very tiny as they put merchandise in the window. I am intrigued with all the glamorous things available. I turn a corner and see a young man trying to climb up the ends of the shelves to put shoe boxes in their right places. He slips and falls. I gasp, feeling concern for him if he had been higher, he could have hurt himself. A young Chinese woman is going to get married. She doesn't know the groom.. She goes to an apartment of a male older friend to get advise. She wears a sleeveless blouse and a skirt in blacks and grays. She has very small breasts. Her tummy pouches a bit. He looks her over critically and says she is very beautiful. He says her thick silky black hair is beautiful. A diamond shape or A shape on her blouse makes her look beautiful I am a bit surprised he would say she is beautiful, because I don't think she is. He then tells her she is young and doesn't know what she wants yet. The woman walks to a large glass window and looks out a the lovely backyard which has a river and beautiful plants. Her groom is approaching the front door. The older man says now you will see him for the first time. A dresser is blocking the open doorway. She is maturing and becoming a real person with feelings and is starting to like the good character of her groom. There is hope for her yet.
