An outside room or porch, windows all around but shaded, a screen door, concrete steps outside, driveway, lawn, trees, next-door house, very suburban neighborhood, in here porch-type furniture, dark, crowded. There's a sort of refrigerator in here, has compartments, meant for a specific purpose to do with freezing things including live animals. I discover a kitten in here, I think it's not supposed to be here and I ask this guy that's around if I should take it out - he says yes. (He's in his 20s, blonde, husky - no scientist, but he's in charge of whatever it is we're doing.) So I get it out and help it thaw, and it comes to life just fine (as if this was a really normal thing) and starts to poke around. It finds the door and wants to go outside but it's not quite up to that yet, so I grab it - I need the guy's help - he's outside the door and he helps me get it back in and latch the door.
