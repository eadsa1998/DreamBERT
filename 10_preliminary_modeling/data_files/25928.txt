 I have sideburns like I do in real life. My brother Wally is there. I am shaving my sideburns. The shaving cream goes away very fast, as soon as I put it on it just isn't there. I splash some water on my face to see if the shaving cream will foam up again. It doesn't. I cut the side of my cheek near my ear shaving.
