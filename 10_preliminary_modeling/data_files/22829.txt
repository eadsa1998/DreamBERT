Doug and I are in the boys' dressing room at a swimming pool.  There is water up to within about 2 feet from the ceiling, but we can stand on the floor and see each other as clearly, if not more so, than we could above water.  Paul Sparkles is there, and he makes this observation while I am still thinking about it.  What's more, pretty soon I find I can breathe in it also.  When we swim out the door, which leads right into the pool, there are two or three girls zooming around on an inflated raft which travels like a motorboat.  One grabs Doug by the hand (he was the first one out of the door) and starts towing him behind the raft.  He tries to get loose, but I see that she is real cute, and I urge him not to let go.  I cut across the corners they turn, swimming underwater, and attempt to come up under the raft and capsize it.   On the second such attempt they see me and stop.  Doug is no longer with them.  I recognize one of the girls as Linda something, and I verify my identification by asking her if she knows Carl something, and she remembers me.  She is pretty affectionate and looks just like Sandie Evans.
