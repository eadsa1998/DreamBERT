I was in a car with Ezra. It was night. He was in the passenger seat and I was in the back behind the driver's seat. He had it driving on 'autopilot' and a turn came up and I jumped in the driver's seat and tried to steer it but it was hard and I went all over the road (we were on Wanneroo Road, just before Northlands). I saw cop lights behind us and I managed to pull over. I quickly got back in the back seat. The policeman came to the window and I explained that the autodrive was driving and it went out of control and he was like 'I understand but I still have to do something about it'. I said that we can't drive and had to get somewhere and he was like "Oh well, that's easy" and said that since November people without a licence couldn't use autodrive and I was like 'What I didn't know that!' He seemed like a nice guy and seemed to like me. He went to this place to get it removed and so there was no record of anything happening. Later we went to Dad's house. Jakob came too and was friends with Ezra. I looked in the cupboard for food and there were a few packets of M&amp;M's but they had all expired in 2005. There were some lamingtons too. Ezra said he preferred movies to TV shows and I said I preferred TV shows at the moment. Jakob said he hated them but he had watched a DIY one.
