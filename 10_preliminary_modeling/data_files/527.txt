I am in my parent's house. Somehow I get into the attic through a new way and am startled at all the old things I find there that I hadn't seen before. Then I realize it is stuff I already knew was there. I'm just seeing it from a different angle. I know I must clean this attic as I am moving and need to take this stuff with me.
