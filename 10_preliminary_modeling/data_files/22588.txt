My dream was about a trip we made to one of the provinces of Cuzco. My brothers and my cousins were in the car, which was a station wagon. But we were dressed as for going to a party. I saw myself wearing my mother's beautiful jewels. Afterwards we appeared in Lima, running on the beach. Suddenly I saw myself without the jewels, and I started to tremble because they were my mother's jewels, which I had taken out without her permission. I searched for them all over the beach. I felt very scared because I could not find them. Suddenly we went back to Cuzco. I went to change my clothes and I saw the jewels hidden underneath the bed. I could not explain to myself how they had gotten there.
