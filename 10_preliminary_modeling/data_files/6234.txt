I was with my friends in a car. We were driving around and I had a 9mm gun which I was fooling around with because I never held one or saw one up close before. We looked out the car and I bet them I could shoot the flame off the candle that was in the distance. I did. We stop driving and were in the house that was off colored compared to the other on the street. Then we went to a corner store, almost like raiding like police would, and found machine guns inside.
