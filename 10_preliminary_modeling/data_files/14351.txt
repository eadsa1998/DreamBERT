I was in the car with Mom and we were driving. Darren was at her window as she drove along and I asked how he just stayed there. We went to this guy's house and there were cops across the road. The guy got in and Mom took him around the corner. I was watching Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit later and they were walking towards and then down a step. They walked past this guy and Teller was taller than him and I remembered that Teller was actually normal height and the guy must be pretty small. Penn still towered over Teller like normal.
