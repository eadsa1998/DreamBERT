Ann and I were coming home. We were going it seemed like Granger Hill and she said there was a little tornado. She noticed one roof off a house. I looked out the window. It was a dark, cloudy night. The sky was yellow over the city from the lights. I was strutting down the street between Eli Belch's and the company store. I seemed to be walking on air. Then I was flying a little. I flew by the store, so I worked my hands like in swimming and I came back. Ann and I walked into the company store to do a little shopping. She picked up a bottle and handed it to me. I looked at it and said, "This bottle is half full and open." She took it and took a little drink out of it and put it back. I saw glasses of berries and juice boiling hot. I told the salesman, "That looks like it's boiling," jokingly and I said, "That's the way to make jelly." I was walking on the street when I saw George Hunzo. He was healthy-looking. I shook hands with him and said, "You're looking great." He said his sister took sick and when the doctor examined her, he said, "She will have to quit smoking cigarettes, a dope." I was looking at the results and I can't recall the winners now. I was traveling thru the mountains. It was night. I put on my bright lights and I cold see dust on the road from the car in front of me. I was at Amel's. I looked and I had a small double barrel shotgun. It had two small holes and the shells were small and seemed to be hollow.
