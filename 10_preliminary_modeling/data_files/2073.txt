I see a small black car with a man and a woman in it up the hill from my cave and marvel at how quickly they got to work. They are looking for something like "Roe" did - plants maybe. Then I see Ellie and the baby. She is writing her name on the mud wall of the cliff, Maria. I am amazed at how smart she is. We cuddle and talk.
