I was at school and it was Monday. I was annoyed that I was in Ms Solomon's class now because it meant I had English on a Monday [I don't really]. Eugene and someone sat in my seat, so I had to take one at the front. Ms Olmstead was teaching the class. She mentioned --Torrent and she asked what letter came before the -- and no-one said anything and she said "not even the people who know want to tell me". Someone asked Eugene if he knew. We went on the net and Ms Olmstead told us to do this quiz that would tell you what nationality you are. Mr Nixon was in a dropdown list. I saw Ms Solomon and I was glad I didn't have to do this essay.
