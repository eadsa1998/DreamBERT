I was at Nana's. I can't remember properly but there were girl and they would ask us questions in different ways. This girl asked me if I had drawing equipment and beans. I said "Beans? What do I need beans for?". I can't read the next few sentences, it seems like she asked me if I needed something that sort of looks like 'coins' and I said something that looks like "said I inks" and something about movies. We then chatted. Nana asked if I wanted to see how much weight she had lost and said she was "late", which had something to do with weight. I was then on a bus and I got off at a house I thought was Nana's, the bus started to leave and I realized it wasn't. I ran to catch up with it and I managed to get him to stop. I told the guy and then said that I left my bag. He said he couldn't wait and I asked when the next one was and he said "five minutes". I got my bag and then I was at some school in a place that I can't read but kind of looks like 'Piranha' (whatever it says is an actual suburb, but I can't remember or read it). It was stingy. It was a place for all the poor or troubled teenagers. As I was leaving I hid my phone. There were some people fighting. Silas and Theodore were there. I ended up missing the next bus. I waited at the bus stop with others. A different kind of bus came and it was squishy. I asked the driver if it went to Newtown or Midvale. He said no and I asked what the closest stop was and he said he didn't know but there was a place I could go to ask and it closed at 9pm. It was 8.20. He said he would take me there. It got close to 9 and he said we wouldn't make it. I text Mom. Someone at the back of the bus got up and Tiana sat down a seat away from me. I asked the girl next to her to move, thinking I would sit next to her and [something I can't read] went back. Dmitri came on the bus. I got back to Nana's and I had "three meows" from Dmitri, which were like a message or something.
