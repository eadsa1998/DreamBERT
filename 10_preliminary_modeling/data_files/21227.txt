Joe Bacon played Essakno or Essemonetta, some name like it, and it was a winner and paid $79. I was driving along the highway and found a spot where to park and I went to see a fellow who owned a lot of property to hunt on it, but he wouldn't give me the satisfaction of ownership. I went for a stroll and when I came back, I met the owner and I told a little fellow that the owner thought I was a gangster I was on Broadway Ave. I walked up to 72 St., then started to walk to the north and there was a big horse following me as I went along. I didn't like it because I was a little afraid of him. I was in the city.
