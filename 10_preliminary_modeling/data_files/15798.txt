I was at some kind of school or something. I can't remember what was happening, but I went into a small toilet cubicle - which was part of this room - to get changed. Some bad guys came and were stealing stuff and taunting people. I stood on the seat as they tried to reach under the cubicle door, but they knew I was in there and got in. I had a pen and was jabbing the guy with it as he got closer, then I sliced his neck with it. He fell to the floor and then I was worried what would happen when his friends found the body.
