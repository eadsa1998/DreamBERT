I saw two men jump off a high cliff so they would own their homes in a better home as they were going down feet first. Then one turned and landed on his side. I could see the blood come out on the ground as they landed dead. The other one, as he jumped, his feet hit the side of the cliff and he landed on his side and also was killed. I said, "I'm going to live in my simple house and am not going to jump." I came over to George Gotches. He was going to bed. I drove two spikes into broom handle sticks and he was going to sleep. I moved the spikes over to make room for me. The brothers and sisters of George were small like I used to see them when I was a kid. Grandma had a baby lying in bed sleeping. The baby was lying in water that it was submerged under. Its nose would come above and it would breathe. A rowdy Slovak boy came into a building and got tough. I went after him. He ran away, but his gang got up and I had to clean up some of them. I later found the rowdy and I collared him. He was afraid. I punched him in the nose and then I saw people sitting around and there was some kind of liquid going thru tubes and thru them. We had a large schoolroom. The paper was hanging loose and I got hold of a long strip and it was loose. Martha O. was walking up the stairs and there was a caster on the step and I told her to watch herself.
