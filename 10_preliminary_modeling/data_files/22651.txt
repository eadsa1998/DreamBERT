I dreamt about my dog, who is caramel-colored, had white paws and neck, and is very small. I was at the beach with my little dog, and both of us were playing, running, with a little ball. I patted her and she answered me in her cute way. The sea was calm, it was in the afternoon, there was a soft breeze and I felt very happy.
