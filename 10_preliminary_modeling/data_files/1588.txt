Judy and I are talking about who we've had sex with. She says she's even had McCork. I am surprised because he's married. I ask, "How was he?" She shrugs and says, "O.K. He's good medically, but emotionally he's not there." Bonnie and I enter a school building (maybe the community college) from a new way I'm not used to. She keeps meeting people who need her help. We get lost. I am cleaning out a trunk, but somehow end up keeping most of the stuff, even though I know I needn't. I keep a clear plastic compartmentalized box I had removed things from. I keep a set of keys that unlock someone's car. It has a small gas key on it. It's round and metal and says BUS on it. It changes to BUE. I couldn't figure out who it belonged to, so I tucked it in the back of Grandma Agnes' built-in hutch for dishes, silverware and tablecloths. I find Christmas cards I had been writing and suddenly realize it's May and the information will be outdated by Christmas. It's a waste of time. I keep them in the trunk. I see lots of newspaper sheets in the ink that are so big that when I try to shut the trunk, they're hanging out. I remove them reluctantly, and wad them up.
