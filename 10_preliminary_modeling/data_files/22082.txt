We had to go play a game at another school, but it turned out that their field was completely flooded. I checked this out before the others got there. Once we arrived, we found an open field. I had just seen a closed and dark field when I'd gone there. Suddenly a girl from the university appeared. There was a green field and in front of it there were some steps to sit on. She told me she wanted to go to Paracas. She is about 19 and is in her second year at the university. I told her that I would go with her, but later on there was a conflict. I believe it was a conflict between going to Paracas or watching the game. Then it seemed to me that I was in Ica and in outdoors surroundings. When I got back from there (it seems to me I had been in Paracas), I found the game again. but it was not taking place on a grass field, but rather on a narrow cement field which was very long and had a series of steps on its sides. I found Don (a 56-year-old priest) playing backfield and with a green suit on. I think there was some discussion with the referee. I and my girlfriend went to sit in the cheering section where there were very few people.
