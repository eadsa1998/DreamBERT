I was riding on a hay wagon one lovely moonlit night when suddenly a storm broke loose and the horses pulling the wagon became frightened and ran uncontrollably away and tipped the wagon and we fell off unhurt. My escort disappeared at this point. I was very disturbed and began running through the woods to find him, but found only fierce animals.
