Went down town shopping in Higbee's. The store was altogether different from the HIGBEE'S IN REALITY. In the store I was looking for something I couldn't find. Someone was chasing me and accusing me of taking things. I never found what I was looking for, and the person, whom I am completely unfamiliar with, never found me.
