 There is man who is driving a convertible car too fast for the road that he is on. The car flips over all the way, and keeps moving. Other people are in the car, and they remain unscathed. The man is going 100 miles per hour in an area with a 60-mile per hour speed limit. He can't slow down. The car goes off the road and into deep water. The people in it are unhurt. There is a big black man there. He may be in the car behind the fast car. His car isn't going that fast.
