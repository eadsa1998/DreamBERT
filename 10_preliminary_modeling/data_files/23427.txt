This dream concerned me interviewing several different people about their ideas of success and jobs and then shifting to being interviewed for several jobs in rapid succession in a number of neutral offices and by people of both sexes in random business suits. The interviewers were not intimidating or frightening. The offices were airy, sunny and pleasant.
