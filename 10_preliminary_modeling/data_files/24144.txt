I had a dream that I was working as a cashier at Safeways and that it was really challenging and hard. I remember being under a lot of stress and giving up and quitting my job. People were very impatient and upset because I was new and very slow. I also remember that I excused myself for being so slow and having to call the manager and ask so many questions because I never got trained. I was just placed in that job.
