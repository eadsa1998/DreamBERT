I am exhausted. The little girl, like Charla, is finally asleep. I am sitting in a wooden chair next to her. Ellie is holding her hand, trying to help her get to sleep. I nod to Ellie sleepily. She asks me something, and I nod, but I didn't really hear what she said. She leaves. I look up and see a glass cage with a monkey that looks like a cat in it, under water, breathing quite happily and content in the water. A water bottle for animals is in there and it sucks on the straw for the liquid food. I think it's cute and am amazed it can breathe under water. However, we have to be vigilant because when it is night time and it is sleepy, we have to move it to the regular metal cage so it can breathe air, or it will drown during its sleep. That is sort of Ellie's job. Now I am asleep and Ellie is trying to wake me up. She shakes me and I struggle to wake up. I mumble something and she says in a most appreciative voice, "Thanks, Mom, for letting me have sex," meaning she had asked my permission to go off with this guy and have sex, only I felt a bit strange, because I hadn't actually heard the request. "Oh, well," I think, "what's the harm?" I nod and go back to sleep. She moves another wooden chair over to put my feet on so I can sleep more comfortably.
