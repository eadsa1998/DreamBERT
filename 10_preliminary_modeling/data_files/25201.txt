 I'm leaving an office building. I have a dolly with some heavy stuff on it. I'm going down an elevator to the 8th floor below the ground. The woman next to me is going to the 7th floor below ground. It is a parking ramp. I am going home, back to the dark, dirty city. I'm in a place where there are six or seven ghosts of famous people. I am beating up the ghosts. I fight them. I kick, punch, bite, and shoot them. Even after I kill them they come back "alive". I beat them several times over before they "die" and disappear. I'm with another person, but I do most of the fighting. I kill the ghost of Carl Gustav Jung, and then the other ghosts. A truck is buried in golf balls. The hood of the truck is open. There is a big round circle of metal in the center where the engine would be. Golf balls, each one coming from or actually being a famous dead person, like the ghosts, roll towards the hole in the metal. Even if they don't go exactly in the hole, if they get close that is good enough, and they have made it.
