I was taking Dana, an office assistant at my high school (and daughter of my paternal grandmother's best childhood friend/sister-in-law) back to the high school.  She worked here in my college town.  It was dark.  We started out in the back, walking by the tennis courts and the pool surrounded by the handball walls.  The pool was Olympic sized and a bit run-down looking.  There was a large inflatable raft like thing floating in the middle of the pool that I was supposed to jump on.  I landed on my stomach and got a little wet.  How I got off it and back on land I don't know.  We went to the administration hall, in which the rooms were quite cramped compared to what they really are; it was like they were all squished into a train car.  Dana saw some desktop stuff that she'd left from when she worked there.  It hadn't meant much before, so she had left it behind.  Now she wanted it back.  I talked to the principal Mr. Davidson, and it took him a while to remember that she had worked there.  There was a bug that kept flying around and bothering me.  I'd covered my face and wanted to put my fingers in my ears so I couldn't hear the buzzing.  It kept following me, and I wandered down the hall.  I don't remember how, but finally the bug was swatted, and when we stopped to look at it lying on the ground, it was apparently about 4 inches tall, green, and holding a red and white umbrella.  He was known as a professor, and used his bug form to molest women.
