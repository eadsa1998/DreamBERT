["Wicked witch."] There is a wicked witch that will hurt or kill a young man and a young girl. I need to rescue them. She is swooping down from the sky and I manage to blow her up. She falls into the ocean now a small plastic figurine. I dive in and search for her as I need to pull off her head to make her less dangerous. She is fighting back and is still powerful. I struggle with her. She is still trying to get at the girl and the young man.
