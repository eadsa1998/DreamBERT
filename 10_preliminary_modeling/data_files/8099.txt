I was going shopping. I was Christmas shopping. I was looking for an electronic item for Matthew. I ran into Darren at the store. I invited him to walk with me and look too. He did. While we were looking in the display cases I found this game. It was like a maze in a plastic case. You had a magnetic thing that sat on top that you used to move a piece inside around the maze. like a steel ball. I think this was something to do with Batman. The magnet moved Batman through the maze. I asked Darren if he remembered those things from when we were younger. He said he did. I stood there a played with it for a minute and decided it was much too easy for Matthew. I had gone there to look for something very specific. Darren said he was going to go look at something else. I noticed these tall wide walls of jewelry. I decided to go look at it for myself. I knew I shouldn't be spending money on myself right now so I decided to just see if there was anything on clearance. I don't think I saw anything.
