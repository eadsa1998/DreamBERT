I'm in M City. There are lots of people. I'm going down the main street. Store fronts are built up, with cameras etc. Some big event is on the verge of happening. I ask, "Why? What's going to happen?" There's a cross street. People are lined up on both sides. I am wondering which street the parade will go down. I think that maybe it will turn left because more people are there and it's a newer street, but I then see that it curves back on itself and that the parade will go straight up main street. I see a woman. I tell her, "I've moved to a new house." It's near her. She's delighted and wants to give me cookies and cakes and have a party and such. I say, "Oh yes, that's nice," but then realize I don't want to eat cookies and cakes. I'm going to the house. It's the old T City house, sort of. It's beat up and wooden. There's a pasture with a cliff to walk across. I wonder if I'll see my old boyfriend. I see his brother Max. I pick up a cat. We're going back to look at something nostalgic. I put the cat down. A white tiger walks up to me. I'm a little scared and excited and in awe. I say, "Who are you?" He says, "I'm Tigger, I'm you." I ask Max if I'll see his brother. He sadly shakes his head and shows me a newsletter with a farewell letter from "Dwight." He's dead. I'll never see him again. I feel sad. The letter is confusing. It says, "If I had tomorrow, I would enjoy today."
