I was on a work trip. We took about 20 staff and were on a bus. We had to stop overnight and were crowded into rooms. I was with Hector and Mikhail talking to them in their room and I wanted to stay there, but had to go into the girl room. I was the last one there, but there was a double bed in the front room left over. There was a bedroom full of bunks that was full, and then 3 doubles in the front room. At some point I was wandering around this like laboratory warehouse and there were freezers and fridges everywhere. I looked in the freezers (like ones at the supermarkets) and people from work were frozen in there. I saw Mikhail and Co-Worker-M-05 in one. The supervisors were walking around and I asked Esther what was going on but she either didn't know or was avoiding the question.
