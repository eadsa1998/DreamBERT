I had driven to another city to visit my friend Steve from high school. He just graduated last spring, and moved there from a big city. We were sitting in a cafe talking. We were both happy to see each other. I told him how we hadn't seen each other for over a year when I visited him, and before that, at least a year. He replied with the month we had last hung out. I asked him who he was living with, other than our other high school friend Mark. He said there were two girls who he lived with. I knew his college friend Donald was from his new hometown, so I asked if he was in the city, and if he hung out with everyone. He said that Donald didn't feel the need to make any more friends after college and was kind of an asshole. I thought that was too bad. I asked him if his girlfriend of two years was out here. He said no, obviously upset, they were taking a three month break, and she was staying in his former home town. I apologized for bringing it up. He said it was okay.
