I was at the National Stadium. It was an afternoon of big games. One of them was between Universitario and Alianza. I screamed at the top of my lungs for Alianza. When the first point had been made by my favorite team, I took a leap from the west stand and landed right in the field. Then they lent me a uniform of Alianza and I started to play and nobody in the opposite team's defense was able to stop me.
