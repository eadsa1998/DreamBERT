There was this film set. These bombs were exploding near this guy, which was a mistake. Peter Jackson was the director. The main lady said that Leo (DiCaprio) was complaining about their "chemistry". She couldn't fall over in sync with him, etc. This robot was flirting with this chair. This lady was playing this computer type game and this big guy was like "Are you waiting for her?". He was singing a song.
