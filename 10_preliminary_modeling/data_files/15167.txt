There was some reunion on that I was supposed to go, but I sent Mom instead. She texted me saying that Kaleb had mentioned to her to tell me about something, which was an inside joke from a few years ago. I laughed and then tried to remember when I had been friends with him. I text back 'how formal is it?' and then I went there. I was wearing a suit and said it was 'so I can say suit up' and someone high fived me. Everyone was like 'Barney's awesome'. Then Ezra was there too. We had a drink and I started thinking about my proposed drinking game for The Marine. I was then at a hotel and I had a list of people who I had gone to school with. I'd written 'Jayne &lt;3', who was actually a girl but I was just pretending it was Jayne from Firefly. There was a lady, who was around 50 years old, who I had dreamt about, added something. Then, I was her, and what she/I had written were qualities of her husband 'bald, but had hair'. At some point I was watching music TV with Poppa. He said someone on TV had threatened to sic a crocodile on him.
