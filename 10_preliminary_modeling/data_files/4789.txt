["Fighting soldier."] A young man is a soldier. He belongs to a unit. However, the other soldier's in the unit seem to want to kill him. He climbs high up a cliff and sits in a small cave, with ammunition and weapons around himself to hide in. He is fully hidden by the pile of weapons around himself. Another soldier is there also, in support of him. I am sort of that soldier. The other soldiers shoot up at the cave, throwing hand grenades and explosives up there to kill the two. I catch them in my hand and throw them back at the others. One explodes in my hand. Causing some pain and damage, but we are managing to survive. Finally, a General intervenes and we are no longer the target. We are considered brave and heroes now. The soldier is given permission to visit his family and girlfriend who haven't heard from him in a long time, before being transferred to another battle.
