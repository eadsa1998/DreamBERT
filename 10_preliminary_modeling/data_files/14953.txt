I went to McDonald's with Mom (drive thru). I mentioned that everyone from Brookland was [something that stars with an 'e'] and Mom was like 'ooh big word'. Selena served us. Then Mom was in there and she organized food and stuff. She was saying "you look pretty in a dress" and I was like "you're an idiot". Calvin was saying I was a tomboy and mentioned this time in accounting where we either had to dress up or play some game where you draw pictures and Jemma yelled out "Everyone choose that!". Eventually we left there and we pulled up in a waiting bay. I was driving. There was a car behind me and they were being annoying. There was also something about Spaceman and a kitten.
