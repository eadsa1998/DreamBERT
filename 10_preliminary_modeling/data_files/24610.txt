I don't remember when...): I was going to school at the public school near my house. I signed up to do a class like a class I have at school. Suddenly, I was back at my school, doing a project you have to do for that class. The new class was nothing like my old class, and I hated it. The boy I was doing the project with suddenly fell off the bridge. I grabbed his hand, and a lady in yellow said he had only five seconds before he fell. She and another man dressed like her grabbed him and pulled him up. Setting: At a public school, then my school. Characters: Me, a teacher at the public school, some boy, and two people dressed in yellow. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, confused.
