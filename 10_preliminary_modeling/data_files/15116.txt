I was well-known? I wrote on some forum saying "Jeffrey Dean Morgan is hot". Some replied, agreeing. I had an assignment due for university. Buster (Arrested Development) was in a van. At the back of the van, something said "if you take me to prom, I'll marry you" and it was from 1991. He had this frog with him and he had made him twitchy, so he was always flapping his arms around and stuff. Someone said that George (Arrested Development) was "probably your father" and I thought it was weird because he used to be Jeffrey Dean Morgan (not really sure what this meant). I convinced Buster that a visit to the top of this mountain could help the frog. I also had to go there for some project I was doing with Elijah, as well as some Korean restaurant. Dad was coming too and he was driving on his own, and I was driving myself, but I ended up in front of him and I didn't know the way there. I found it and had to stop at the red light, but I couldn't stop in time and gently touched the 4WD in front of me. I parked and was trying to remember the way to get there. I was then with Mom, Gizmo, Cuddles and Amelia. Amelia smiled at me and I felt like threatening it or throwing it over the edge. It was now night. I put Cuddles and Gizmo in a bag and they went to sleep. I told Mom to look after them. Dad text about the mountain saying "Elijah is pulling $40,".
