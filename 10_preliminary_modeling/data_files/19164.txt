My mother and wife and I were in the car going to the grocery store. On the way to the grocery store we were having a rather philosophical discussion in which my mother was saying modern society was degenerate and the old ways were the best ways. Anyway, I was driving along and I pulled out on Dixie Highway, and the front of the car kept off the ground as we passed a policeman who was parked in the middle of Dixie Highway doing something. We went a little ways like this and then the front of the car came back on the ground, and we drove on until we got to the grocery store. I was back looking at the wines, and they had some wines from Spain. They were sauternes in silver paper and gold paper covered bottles. They had some real old wines there. I could read the labels -- 1917. The bottles were various shapes and sizes, some being tall and square and others just being squat and fat. Then I went over where they had this display counter with these little figurines and carving from Japan that were for sale. They were quite commercial. There was nothing worthwhile. But I looked at them for a while anyway -- wooden bowls and stuff. They were machine cut and they were not very good. That was all the dream. Hall: The whole front end of the car, including the wheels and the fender, sort of raised up off of the ground. Sam pulled out onto Dixie Highway very carefully because there was a police car parked in the middle of Dixie Highway. The wines went back to 1917 or 1916. Sam couldn't read the dates on the labels.
