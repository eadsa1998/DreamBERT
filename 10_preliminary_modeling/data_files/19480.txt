Mamma is going to the big city nearour hometown for an operation. Seems to be going in a buggy. After arriving at doctors office she was forced to wait a long time in a hallway. The doctor spoke kindly to her, and explained just what her chances for recovery would be after the operation. Mamma's diary ends abruptly in middle of sentence, and Mary writes immediately afterward, "died at 1 a.m." In this dream, I felt guilty and wretched because I seemed unable to arouse myself from a kind of lethargy or mental confusion which prevented me from helping my mother in some way -- I was rather a burden to her.
