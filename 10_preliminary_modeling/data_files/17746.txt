My old friend Neil Block and my boyfriend Jeremy were with me.  I still had a crush on Neil, and I started dancing with him.  I admired his confidence to sing and dance.  I thought about my freshman year crush Stan, too.  I was confused.  I had crushes on these guys, but I had a boyfriend- but I had trouble remembering who.  Then I remembered.  Jeremy, who was right behind me.  It was disturbing to forget who my boyfriend was, and I felt guilty.  We were in some sort of white, walled canyon.  There was a flood.  The water rose to the windows in the living room of some house we were in, and we were trying to figure out how to channel the water away so the flooding wouldn't get any worse.
