I'm in the computer room at school, only the windows are gone. Mr. S is not there. Instead, there is some woman with very short hair. I scrawl a name that isn't mine on the wall with a pen, and wipe it off later. Later I am still at school, only now in the theater room. Mrs. P announces that she is going to try a musical rendition of her lesson. I tell her that I play the guitar, and will be happy to learn the guitar part. Amy is near me. She asks to be taught a few chords. (After class.) I teach her the chords A, C, and E.
