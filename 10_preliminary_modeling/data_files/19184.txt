I was dreaming about respiratory measurements on the lungs. The problem that was bothering me was how the rate of respiration can go up and yet the minute volume of the air used actually goes down. I was dreaming about a graph the instructor had on the board this morning, where work done by lungs was a function of elasticity and air resistance. The dream is entirely day residue. Respiration is being presented as a new subject in physiology, and I'm having a lot of trouble in understanding the concept of this rate of increase in breathing, but decrease in actual functional volume.
