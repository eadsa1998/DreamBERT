I dreamed that I was on some trip somewhere and I was driving a huge coach bus with all my friends in it. Since I was driving, I was the one who decided where we stop for bathroom breaks and stuff. No one could agree with me about when and where to stop though, so I became frustrated and finally stopped at a rest area. I saw a little boy who looked lost. He spoke Spanish, so I said, "Donde es el coche?" (Where is your car?) But then I remembered that I had to use estar instead of ser. So I corrected myself and said "Donde esta; el coche?" A man nearby told me that the only way the little boy would find his way home is if I brought him to the church at the end of the mall at the rest area. I asked, "Donde esta la iglesia?" A woman told me she would lead me there. So I picked the little boy up and walked behind the woman. On the way I saw Ava; she had been shopping. She showed me a black tank top she had bought from Express. She asked if I wanted to borrow any of her money to shop, but I said no. Then I woke up.
