I was watching a movie with Jason Bateman. Michael Cera was his son. There was a flashback and Michael Cera's character was being played by a fat kid using a phone at this building. Then these people, on woman and the rest men, shot a lady in the face, killed some cops etc. They went to this cop place and there was a lady in there and cops in a car outside. The cops outside managed to survive and tried to tell the lady inside to get out. The people came into her room and she jumped out the window. They killed her. Buster (Arrested Development) came in with stuff for his mother (the woman they just killed). He didn't notice anything wrong, which they noticed. For some reason, they gave him a bag of this brown stuff which was actually cocaine. Then it was real life and I had the cocaine. I tasted it and my tongue felt funny. My heart started beating faster and I felt funny. Later, Ezra woke me up to ask something about my web site. Dad asked me "Have you tried the brown stuff?" and I said no.
