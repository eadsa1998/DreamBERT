I was at home. The car had to be pulled out of the garage. Later it was stalled in the road in some snow. My mother and sister were there. we went over steep hills and passed a church. Later I was parked on the road because it was stalled. A stout policeman held a doll in his hand. Army trucks were going somewhere. The Army wanted to close a place, but Le Pore out-maneuvered them and they could not legally close it. Then I hear the William Tell overture being played.
