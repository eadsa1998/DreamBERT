 My family's friends Murielle Long and some of her daughters are going to Madison, Wisconsin. My mom and I are planning on going with. Longs have gotten a light brown station wagon. They also have a new maroon colored truck. My mom and I decide not to go. I'm speaking with Murielle. She is sitting in the driver's seat of her car. She gives me three $100 bills. I'm very surprised! We talk about her son and my friend, Mark Long. The money seems to have come from him. I think of Mark. I tell Murielle that I pray to or for Mark when I do pray. I'm at home. There are five messages on the answering machine. The first message is from Mr. Peterson, who got my number because he thinks my sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson is or was at my house. My sister Heather left three angry messages, telling me to get down to where she is so we can go to Madison. I'm not going to call her back, and I'm not going to Madison, because I don't want to. I talk on the phone with Becky Long, and I get her confused with my cousin Anna Strange.
