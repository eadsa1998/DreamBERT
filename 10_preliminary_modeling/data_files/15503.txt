Someone turned into a werewolf (An American Werewolf in London style) and I knew that's where the inspiration came from because I heard Moondance playing, then Bad Moon Rising. I climbed to this top shelf and hid behind some containers. The werewolf came in and I accidentally knocked a container and it ended up eating Mom. Then I ran and went into this room and jumped on these beds and knocked all these things off. It was now a dog. I was at a party and Teresa was there and mentioned something of mine and I didn't remember putting it on Facebook. Then I started a conversation with Benjamin and Vikram. Benjamin said some movie was horrible and Vikram said he thought it was ok and Benjamin explained that he meant 'horrible images', but it was a joke. I hated it. They mentioned Amarcord if it had been directed by Kurosawa.
