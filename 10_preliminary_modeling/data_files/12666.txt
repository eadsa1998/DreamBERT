I was at 'Seabird'. I was looking for Dad and Ezra. There were big waves and the bottom part flooded (there was an upstairs part with houses too). I found Dad and he said "Have you seen Clayton and Ezra?" I hadn't, but Ezra turned up and we went to a cinema to see a movie called Breaking Away. I was worried about my laptop. Someone told me that I smelled. Neil (The Young Ones) was going out with some popular girl. He went to this drawing guy then he was coughing blood and he had no hair.
