I dreamed that I went to a cafeteria in a small town that served all you can eat for 99 cents. The funny part about it was that the cafeteria was on a plane of about a 45 degree angle. Apparently an earthquake had come through a couple of weeks before and left the cafeteria on an incline plane. As you walk in the door, the floor of the cafeteria was on an incline plane, not the whole town, just the cafeteria. As you walk in, the place where you pick up your food was in the shape of a square. You had to walk around a square-shaped counter pick your food, what you wanted, and place them in your plate. The first time around I didn't get all the food I wanted and I got up again to get some of the things that I apparently didn't see the first time around, such as dessert and stuff. On the next time around, I saw some rice and I picked it off the second shelf above head level, and I picked it off the shelf and tried to hold it level with the ground level outside. I apparently spilled it all over my head, and I was very mad. Before I took the second trip around, picked up my food and spilled the rice on my head, I almost got into a fight with someone who I remember from childhood, apparently over something he said that I didn't like. I saw other people in the cafeteria, but I didn't recognize them.
