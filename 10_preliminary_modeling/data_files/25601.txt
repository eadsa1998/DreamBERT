 I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. He needs to urinate, so I steady the canoe on a rock so he can jump out. He falls on his face into the water with rocks in it. There is garbage, litter, on a rock. There are houses. There is a plane with the letters KHanson written on it. The plane almost crashes into pine trees, but avoids them.
