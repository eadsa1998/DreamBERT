I am a maid or housekeeper in a rich man's house -- three stories, Colonial, very country decorated as in a magazine. There are three kids, two girls and a boy, and the father is kind and not really present. The mother, however, is very antagonistic and suspicious of me, ordering me about, questioning my work, generally bad-vibing and glaring at me. I clean the bedrooms, and as I make the kids' beds, she stands in the doorway watching me. She says "make sure you do it right." At night I go to the basement where a meeting of 50 people is going on -- everyone arguing, I can't remember what about.
