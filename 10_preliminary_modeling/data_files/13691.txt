I was at school and I went to this place which would bring people back to life or fix them up (like an emergency room). I had brought in Will Arnett ages ago and I hadn't heard anything from them. As I walked to it, I was reminded of Ugly Betty and how Hilda was when Santos died and I was talking like Hilda and saying "Oh my gawd!". The place was full of people and I waited patiently, and finally I asked the girl there. She said "Oh, it was Tom Arnett's body wasn't it?" and I just said "yeah". She scrunched her face and said "How do I put this..." and I said "Just say if he is dead or not" and she said "Ok, he's dead". Then she was talking to Stephen Tobolowsky who was hanging around in the background. I was trying not to cry and walked back to school. Some boy was throwing this ball and talking to himself. I walked into the senior school block and said "Geez, you're noisy" to the kid.
