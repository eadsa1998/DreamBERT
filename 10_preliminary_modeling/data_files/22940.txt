I was in high school, and sometimes rode my bicycle to school.  It was getting progressively harder to pedal, though, and I think I abandoned it on the way one day -- possibly near Ralph and Janet Stone's house, since that's where I ended up later -- although the chronology is a little hazy.  I caught a bus, and apparently was in a good frame of mind and among friends.  When we came to my stop, the bus was so crowded that I couldn't get to the door before it started up again, and I actually had to crawl along a narrow space between the ceiling and the tops of people's heads.  And when the bus started up again, I yelled, "Stop the damn bus-I'm trying to get off."  and everyone laughed, including the bus driver; I was amused myself.  Later when I was coming to and from school I rode the subway, in which occasionally three different trains crisscrossed over each other at different levels above the ground.  I had to transfer once on the way, and the place where I transferred was of this multilevel type, and reminded me of the place where we caught the Metro in Paris, coming back from the Eiffel Tower in the rain.
