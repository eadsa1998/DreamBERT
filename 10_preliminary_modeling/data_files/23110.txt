My wife Anita and I are moving to a new house.  It seems to be a large house, but I never have visited all the rooms.  What makes me feel uneasy about living in this house is that you can't see it-the entrance, at least-from the outside.  I don't really remember entering it, but every time I leave it, it is via some steps up from something which feels like a storm cellar, and you have to lift sheets of corrugated aluminum above your head.  I begin to have a sad and disappointed feeling about having invested in a house which you can't take pride in from the outside.
