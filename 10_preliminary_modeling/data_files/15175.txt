Ezra and Roland were doing a quest. They had to kill some mobs in this village. I was there too and for part of my quest, I had to kiss Ezra. It was just on the lips, but I was grossed out anyway, especially because of his tongue ring. Mom got in a car and changed the station. They were playing Round and Round. I was sitting in the back. At some point, I had my first kiss with Jason Segel; he had one arm around me and another touching my face. I kissed back because it was hard to resist.
