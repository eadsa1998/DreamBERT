A little bit jumbled.  Bill Caldon was in it; I was surprised that he was still living in a submarine.  He said he had been living there 15 years.  I had either forgotten or assumed that he was no longer living there.  I think it was docked in The city where I work.  I assumed it was above the water, and he said it was "most of the time."  I met someone else who was living there, too-don't remember who, probably a Korean student who was in the same dream and who introduced me to another Korean student in the cafeteria.  The latter was so tall that he had to stoop a little not to hit his head on the ceiling beams.  He was the biggest guy I had ever seen.  I ran into him again later in the library, where he was just leaving a study carrel.
