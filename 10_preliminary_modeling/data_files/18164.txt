It seems that a nearby university was going to put on these three sort of permanent pageants. What they were putting on was a cross between three pageants -- King Arthur and His Knights and Alice in Wonderland  --  and I decided that I was going to see the first of these. So I went over and the admission was a nickel, but there didn't seem to be anybody particular around to give it to. But I saw a woman sitting down in one of the first few rows toward the back who seemed as though she might be the one to pay and so I did. You also had reserve seats and mine was right down near the front, so I went down and sat down. There weren't a whole lot of people in the auditorium which wasn't like the nearby university's auditorium anyhow. It wasn't like anyone I had been in particularly. But at any rate some girl came and sat beside me and it seemed like I knew her from somewhere. And it started. And there was nothing particularly funny. And what happened was this boy rode this imitation horse on the stage and fell off it a few times like the Knight in Through the Looking Glass. Everybody thought that this was hilarious though and it was just so funny. And I was glad that these things were going to be a success. And then a bunch of sort of weird unconnected scenes that didn't seem to have much to do with anything happened. The girl that I was sitting with said that we would be sure to come to these things next year before we graduate because then we might not get so many opportunities to see them. I agreed with her. She was a funny person and I really didn't know her very well, and I'm not sure that I liked her too well. She reminds me of somebody I know.
