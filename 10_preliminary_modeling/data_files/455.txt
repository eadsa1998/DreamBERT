I was in my old elementary school and as I was walking through the hallway, I was looking at all of the changes. There was a classroom where the library used to be and a lot of other construction had been done; everything was new and the walls were white. Then the scene changed and I was in an apartment complex living with people I didn't know. I was waiting for my boyfriend, who was with his family. Then I went to a secret passageway that led to the inside of my apartment and I saw a note addressed to Boom. The note said that his family couldn't keep up with him and got lost while following him to the room. Boom was supposed to be my boyfriend's nickname in the dream. At the end of the dream my boyfriend and I were reunited with his family.
