[1997-06-26] I was still in California, traveling on the bus, and wanting to go to the mountains for some odd reason. So I was heading there and then the bus driver stopped the bus and said "I'm sorry, this is up to where we go, unless you give us more money." I got pissed off and said "Well, how much do you want?" and he wanted a big amount of course, and magically I had it and we continued and eventually we got there, got out of the bus, looked at the mountains, I could see them plainly, got back into the bus and drove back home. While driving back home, there was this guy named Bob, a drunk guy that I used to meet on the bus all the time when I used to live at my other address, he was some kind of PC designer or something. In the dream he said "I'll give you this!" It was a small shoe. On the bottom, you would press a button and record, so it was a recording shoe! Then I woke up.
