I was with a group of people, I think there were just four of us, who were working together on an ad layout. Three of the people in the group had different types of psychology ads. They were each for very different services. You would typically not see them advertised together in a publication because of their differences. However, the four of us saw a definite benefit to placing all of the ads together. It was not that we were placing them next to each other on the same page. We were incorporating them all into one ad. We felt they would each get more results from the ad, because we had done it this way. A man came up and told us that we shouldn't be doing it this way. He had some type of supervisory role over us. The rest of us immediately started trying to explain to him why we're doing it the way we were and why we believed it was the best thing to do, or the smartest thing to do. We felt this was going to be best for everyone, that everyone would benefit more by doing it this way than if we did it the traditional way.
