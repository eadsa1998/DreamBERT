["Nice man and Roses with Thorns."]  I am in a house. A man is there, following me around. He likes me a lot. I am in my bra, as I am busy with chores and getting dressed. I have children and am watching them and cleaning up their clothes and so on. I go out the front door and see a rose bush. I want to pick some roses, but I see all the thorns. I go back into the house and the man gets the roses for me and follows me in.
