 Something happens in my employers, Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills', attic. Their house seems to be high up. They are on the phone; it is late on a slow workday. There is a racecar in the attic. There is talk about a trauma: a person in surgery or in the hospital. There is a man there who plays basketball, who is not powerful. There is a large bolt-action gun.
