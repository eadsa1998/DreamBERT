I dreamt that I was walking to a class through M-- arch and noticed that a funeral home was located at the same place that M-- House is actually. This place had large glass windows and looking in from the sidewalk where I was, I noticed that a funeral was just ending. The mourners were slowly advancing to the front of the room where the casket was displayed. The corpse was a fair-haired woman about 40 or so, dressed in a black gown. I never saw the face before. Some of the mourners were weeping as they approached the casket. I remembered to myself that I had never seen a dead person and was rather curious to see this one. That seems to be all.
