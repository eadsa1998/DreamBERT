I was at school. Calvin and I played this game of sliding around a corner, but we kept getting in trouble. I was then at a shop and Ezra was there. Jeremiah walked past. Seamus and Silas were on an escalator. I was then back at school. I was at our bench. Ms Bigwood asked me if I ever liked anyone at school and I was thinking 'Yeah, Eugene, but I aint telling you!'. I said yeah and then she told us a story. There were big public toilets and people wouldn't leave?
