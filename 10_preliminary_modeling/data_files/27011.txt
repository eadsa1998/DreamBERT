My husband (age 20) and I were walking down an unpopulated country road when we came upon a modern looking house. The house was all dark blue, and it seemed to be made of some smooth canvas--like material stretched tightly on a frame. We went inside and sat down on a davenport. The floor and walls were all in different colored squares which soon made me very dizzy. I faintly remember the names F-- and M-- as being associated with that house.
