Henry Min lent me a canoe and sent me on a trip down a river that wound through a canyon-indoors.  It was like a business that he ran.  It was fun as far as it went, but it didn't go very far.  During this time, Anita called me on my cell phone to find out where I was.  She seemed not to be happy.  I planned to call her a little later, but something prevented me from it.
