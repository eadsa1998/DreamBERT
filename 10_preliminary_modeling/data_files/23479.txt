I was in my old apartment in the big city where I used to live and I was having a big party. There were a lot of people there and the place was untidy. I decided to order three pizzas and I felt really guilty because it wouldn't be enough food to feed everyone. I tried to encourage everyone else to order food or go get a burrito from across the street. I was having problems finding the phone in all the mess.
