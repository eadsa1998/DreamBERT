I am male and swimming in the ocean in front of a huge boat. In order to not be run over, I grab the chain and pull myself on board, only to discover it is a sort of prison ship. A man yells exercise marching orders to the prisoners. I hesitate. Which horrible place do I choose: dive in and swim and maybe drown, or give myself over to this prison setting? I stay on board.
