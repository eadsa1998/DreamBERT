I am in a room and Archie comes in. He is wrinkled and wears half glasses perched on the end of his nose. He looks in his forties. He is annoyed with me. I think I took a class from him and he's not going to give me a passing grade. I sit over by a very huge fish tank, several hundreds of gallons big. I see some angel fish and others. Some of the fish I must have gotten from when I was married to Howard; others are newer. The water is very cloudy and murky. It hasn't been cleaned in a long time.
