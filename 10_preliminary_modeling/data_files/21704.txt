Andy Kohut was with me. I started to run. I ran by him and thought he couldn't catch me, but he came up fast as we ran and passed me. I met a girlfriend of mine. I talked to her and her husband was in a hospital. My wife was in the hospital visiting someone. I was in the car all dressed up and I noticed I had on my old shoes and I was going to a dinner.
