I was living in a big mansion and had just awakened from an afternoon nap. I decided to go swimming in the lake which was near the house. I tried to get someone to go with me. It took a long time to persuade anyone, but at last I convinced them to go with me. However, we decided to go ice-skating instead. I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates. He tried to excuse himself for not calling me up by saying that he had to go to the doctor for a few days because of a sore hand. When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates. She thought I was very foolish and everyone was disgusted with me.
