[This dream is a recent dream that preceded the ATM-Book dreams. This dream is of a sexual nature.] I dreamt I was in a hotel. I saw myself outside of my room, while a maid came down with [illegible] equipment. When she got close enough to me, she said things to me that I could not accurately remember. But I did remember her saying price figures. I believe she wanted to sell herself for fifty dollars. I bargained with her and lowered the price to thirty dollars. She agreed to the price. So she would grant me sexual pleasure for thirty dollars. I also agreed. Then strange things happened. I found myself in the bathroom of my hotel room. From the bathroom, I could see people discussing things, just normal things (not sure about the contents). I started feeling guilty; I started changing my mind. I didn't want to have sexual pleasures with the maid. From the bathroom, I could see the maid preparing my bed. She wore [illegible] clothes. The dream ended there. Strange, isn't it?
