I was in law school. I was late to class. I had to stop at the library. I got a huge stack of books and started running to class. When we got there it was a room with rows of cubicles piled on top of each other. They were like balconies. We were watching a movie on Africa. I was watching intently so I could answer the questions. The movie started to flicker and then I woke up.
