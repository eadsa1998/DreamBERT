There was a TV show and I was in the live studio audience. There was a game announcer and an audience of contestants; possible contestants. The requirements to be in the audience were that you had to have quit smoking. There were 3 rounds of action. The lively announcer called names. If they called your name you were suppose to run up on the stage. The first opportunity was in round one of the action. You had to carry as many packs of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands, knowing full well it was the only time and place you could ever smoke again. You had to carry as many packs or cartons of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands and pockets--according to how much money was in your pockets and how much you could carry. They chose to smoke or not to smoke as part of the game. But to win you had to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes in 10 minutes. 20 cigarettes. In 3 rounds of the game show only girl was able to do it and she did it with ease. Those who chose not to smoke had to answer difficult geography questions. One lady dropped a bunch of packs of cigarettes and was tripping all over them and smoking flawlessly, using only one hand. We going to a picnic and my mother said, "There is no iron in any of this food!" Even if it is red or is meat. I wondered if I had a clean slate or if I was guilty--responsible for the lack of iron.
