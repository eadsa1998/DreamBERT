I was helping with landscaping in someone's front yard. The homeowner had hired a professional decorator to work in their home and that person was in charge of landscaping as well. Large, flat river rocks had been placed two or three feet out and all across the front of the house. At one end, someone had covered some of them, about three feet in width, with mulch. I thought that must be what needed to be done next so I continued covering the others with mulch. The decorator came out and told me that the mulch was supposed to have gone down first and then the river rocks. I apologized and said I would change it so I went about lifting all of the river rocks above the mulch and sitting them on top of it. I used my sleeve to wipe any remainder of mulch off of each rock. Gloria S was there and began helping me lift the river rocks above the mulch. She seemed aggravated at me for making this mistake. Somewhere along the line George Clooney was the decorator. He came out and we had a conversation about his plans for the yard.
