I am with a boy who was a childhood friend. We go to the Comfort Inn. We go in the wrong room and go to sleep in someone else's bed. I wake up and realize it and hurry to go. I am worried that I haven't called my parents. As I am getting ready to go to the right room the owners (two men) come in and are very upset. Someone holds me high over their head and takes a picture, laughing about the room mistake. I call someone later and tell them I went to a motel with a man and relate the story and neglect to say it was a dream. I am wearing leggings and a dress and I look really stupid in the picture.
