 I'm with my friend Matt Yams in a video store. My brother's friends Brian Rappaport and Mryle Madden are there with a case of root beer. Matt and I are going to pick out a movie. There is one we're planning on getting, but then he wants to get a different movie, Primal Fear, so we get it. We go to the counter to pay. Matt gets a plastic bottle of soda and I tell the man I want one of the two quart bottles of orange juice that are in the cooler. He tells me the total is $29.95! This man is a trickster: a swindler. He's trying to be sneaky and take my money. I give him a $5 bill. He takes the bill, which is in an envelope. He has no right to do this. I take the envelope and open it, knowing it's a federal crime to open mail that isn't yours. The man follows me to the car, pestering me. He is very skinny. I brush him away. I don't want to exert any strong physical force, though I know I could beat his sorry ass in a second. I try to open the door to my car and the key breaks off. I'm man, and unlucky because I just want to get away from this man. I get into the car the key breaks off in the ignition! I yell at my sister Ramona, who is in the car smoking. I tell her to come and get me to leave. (260 words)
