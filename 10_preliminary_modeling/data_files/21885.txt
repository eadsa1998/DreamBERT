We were like in the Army. The enemy and our men were for St. Claire Ave. The enemy and our men tried to get one another's positions and get as close as possible without being recognized. I was like on a side watching that our men would move up one at a time and when he saw the enemy, he would make a quick change of appearance to a woman and then to a boy and seem to disappear completely. Then at last all of them were changed to sisters or nuns in their hoods. They stood where Bob was standing. There also in his sister's hood and outfit. I called to him and said, "Bob, now all of you are in sister outfits." Then the test was over. I walked with Bob and he said, "Now I see why I would like to be in first class in the service." My Uncle Jon was at our home. He and my dad were downstairs as we were upstairs in bed in my mother's house. We heard a commotion downstairs, so went down. My dad was holding a file or some object in his hand or a dagger. I started to bawl him out for starting to argue and fight with my uncle. I also panned out my uncle the same. My uncle had a pistol. He pulled it out and started to shoot. I went up to him and took it away from him. It was a 22-caliber pistol, but I was surprised at how heavy it was. Then I looked at the wall and started to count the holes in the wall. We had sheet metal on the wall and there were about 50 holes thru it from my uncle's pistol shots. I met John Wiatrak somewhere. I can't recall now, but it was that he did something careless and I told him about it.
