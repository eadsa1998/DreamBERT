There is still an element in this one of trying to control sleeping or dreaming by -- I lost that one. At any rate, it's probably a reflection of trying to get to sleep. In this one I seem to be down on lower Church Street in New Brunswick with my mother. One of us is buying a watch, and the first one is a new Swiss watch. It has very elaborate design. The second one is the same make watch with a very simple design. It has a white face and the name of this one is Cellulex. I can still see that although they're essentially the same watch. There's something here about a cuckoo going off and on every fifteen minutes. I can see this as a cuckoo clock on the wall, although in the dream it's one of these wrist watches that has that feature. There was another part, but I seem to lose it. There's a comparison going on between, well a comparison of a large page with an elaborate construction on it, like a pagoda and another which is Calvin Hall's dream theory, both having just arrived from Europe.
