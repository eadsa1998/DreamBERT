I was at the Technical College. Everyone had to make an individual short film as well as the chosen ones and we had no idea how we were going to find time for it. Judah said most people did theirs on the weekend or over the holiday and submitted it in January. I put down Cecelia and Tristan as my crew and we were trying to think of ideas and Cecelia jokingly suggested this ad one where the girl says something like 'findmymusic.com' and flips her hair and pours water on her, but it was actually an already existing jokey ad. At some point Fletcher and I were somewhere with Co-Worker-M-04 and he said something like 'you two are like you have a crush on each other and sometimes think about it but then realise it would be weird and never do anything about it' and it was 'true' in my case in the dream and I started giggling and saying 'nooo'. We walked off and Fletcher was like 'we don't' and I said 'yep I know'. Later, Judah was dressed as Shaun from Shaun of the Dead, with a cricket bat attached to the front of him. A zombie invasion occurred and he had a gun and was owning all the zombies, so we were sticking with him. I accidentally pushed him at some point and he was very solid.
