Last night's dream was strange. In it I dreamed that I dreamed I was in my fourth year in Architecture, the profession I plan to follow, but that I was doing badly on exams and flunked out and couldn't be an architect. Then I awoke and when I took my exams, I got the highest marks and got many prizes. I went on to make beautiful and incomparable works and got many contracts and my fame in America and in the world kept spreading. My works were imitated by all the architects, I created a new style, and defined a new era in construction. Then I was commissioned to do what I called my masterpiece, which would be a building whose base would be at the bottom of the ocean and which would have thousands of stories. I finished the work and went over all the details, but when I got to the last floor, some wood was sticking out the balcony, which was for support, and when I tried to pull it out, I fell into the void and I saw that from each floor they were waving at me on my way down. My dream ends here; that's all I remember.
