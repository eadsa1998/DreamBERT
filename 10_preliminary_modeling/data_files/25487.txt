 I'm outside a dorm room at Brimson. There are some tall, skinny guys there. My brother Wally, cousin Henry King, others, and I are there. We go in the room. I am selected to fight my friend Tony Ramada. He is preparing by listening to music. I am standing there waiting for him. My sister Heather is on the bed with other people, watching. Her leg is in the way. I tell her to move it because it could hinder my fighting. I decide to go all out: to put my entire efforts forth to make Tony submit. The fight starts, and I grab his head as he lunges forward and smash his nose and face into my knee. I am then fighting my classmate Shirley Brown. I bend her leg around backwards until she submits. Bending her leg around is an unusual thing to do, but it works. Afterwards, she says it doesn't hurt that much anymore to have her leg in that position.
