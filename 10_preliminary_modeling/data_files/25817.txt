 There are three planes going on a bombing mission. I am one of the pilots. The planes are small: about seven feet long. They have a couple of bombs on each side and a gun in the front. I adjust the seat in my plane in the alley. There are two wheels on my plane directly on the front of the plane, the corners not suspending the plane at all. We are going to the east side of Wilmerton, where we'll land. We're trying to destroy something or some group. We have allies there waiting. I try to go, but it doesn't work well. There is a cord to pull like a lawn mower to start the engine. I pull the cord and it breaks. We're down at the white house next to my neighbor Mr. Olson's house, in the alley. My mom is on the phone in their garage trying to see what to do about the broken cord. I fix the cord by tying to back together. I have never flown a plane before. I say this to the other pilot, but it doesn't seem to matter. I'm excited and nervous about fling a little plane so high up. There is a scene like in the movie Top Gun, in which there are two pilots getting ready to take off. One of them is a rookie. One pilot flies over and drops a fake rubber bomb, just joking around. The rookie is annoyed at this. The rookie and the veteran pilot trade punches, kind of sizing each other up when they meet. My friend Kevin Simpson may be a pilot of another plane.
