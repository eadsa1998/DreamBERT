Dreamt that I went to visit my old house. My mom was there to greet me: but this was no ordinary Mom. No, this is the anti-Mom. This Mom has her own life. She has things to do. She's busy. She's together; she isn't neurotic. And she's been living in this house all along. Well, she had a job she needed to get to, but she agreed to give me a tour anyway. There was a little girl there, my analogue, or I suppose my homologue, since she would have served a different function in the life of the anti-Mom from the one I serve in real life. The girl was very bouncy and happy.
