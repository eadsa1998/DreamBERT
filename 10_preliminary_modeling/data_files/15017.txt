I was sometimes Lexie (Grey's Anatomy). She was sleeping with Karev (Grey's Anatomy). He discovered that he loved her and they were in a hospital and he kissed her and she pushed him away. Then later they were talking again and she had her back against the wall and he put his hands on the wall and pressed up against her and kissed her and she pulled away in disgust. She said it was because they worked together. Then I was dating Callie (Grey's Anatomy). I went out with Nana in the middle of the night to check on some small people. They were about ant size. We had to cross this huge oval. Then she was Callie and I said that we should get our own bed. This was because we were sharing with two friends. I'm not sure if we were sharing a bed but we were definitely sharing the same room. When we got back, she said to them that we wanted our own room and they were actually friends of hers and I felt awkward. One of them looked like Leighton Meester. Callie said she wanted to move tonight and said that 'we've been sharing for [however long], you can't expect us to stay here again'. Leighton looked upset but was then like 'until you meet hot twin guys' and then she said that they would keep the noise down. We then tried to work out the standard deviation of noise during sex. We laughed. Then they left and we saw two twin guys at the door and they were like 'whoa everyone's hot'.
