Joyce and Delatt were loving up. She started to tease him and he chased her. He caught her and squeezed her and said, "I will stick this thing into you." She said, "Go ahead, so I can get pregnant and we can get married. I want it bad and you are stalling." We were looking into a lake bottom watching the fish swim. Then a dg like which had six legs came stumbling along on the bottom. Someone threw a piece of meat and the dog ate it. He looked so awkward with his six legs.
