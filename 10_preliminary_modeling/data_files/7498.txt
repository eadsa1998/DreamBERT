Mary is washing herself at the (kitchen?) sink. She is stripped to the waist. To her immediate right is a large window. It is open. It is not covered by a blind or drape. Mary is clearly visible to anyone outside. Mary is happy and looks healthy. I am standing behind Mary, and to her left. I cannot see her face. My view, from behind her, covers the area from her head to just below her buttocks. Mary comments on how much she is enjoying this wash. She tells me that it's been a long time since she's been able to give herself such a thorough wash -- she'd only given herself fast washes. Then Mary goes on to say that she is seriously thinking of having another baby. I am in a reflective mood. I say nothing to her, but I am very concerned that she wants to have another baby. I know that she is sick and cannot have a baby. But I am reluctant (afraid?) to say anything about her illness, so I just let her talk on. She is very happy. I am playing with an eyeglass case (holder) while she is washing and talking. I am vaguely aware that her nakedness can be seen by anyone outside, but this doesn't concern me so much as her illness does. I am worried that she does not seem to be aware that she is sick. But I know she is. How am I to communicate this to her? Shall I even dare?
