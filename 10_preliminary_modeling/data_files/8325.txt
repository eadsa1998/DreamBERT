I was working for a large company and there was a team of us that was assigned a team task to look at the staff of a company as two separate teams. Each of the two teams doing this project were to come up with a list of descriptive words for one team in the company. Then we would narrow down this list of descriptive words to the top three or four. Then I think it was these top three or four words in maybe their strategic planning or maybe in coming up with some aspect of what they did or how they did it. All the descriptors would be used and considered but the top three or four would be considered essential in all decisions that were made. Then I think we also, both teams of this project, came together and looked at our list of descriptors together. I don't know why or how that was used.
