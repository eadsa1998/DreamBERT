I dreamed I fell in love with a boy of whom my parents disapproved. I became so ill as a result of their insistence that I not see him; that they finally allowed us to get married. After we were married, all my hopes were realized about him and we lived very happily. My parents, especially my mother, were so ashamed of their previous behavior that they came to us and begged for our forgiveness. My mother and I both cried and we embraced each other; and the four of us reached a very happy relationship.
