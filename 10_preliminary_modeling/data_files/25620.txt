 I'm with my mom and my brother Wally driving from Middle Mall to the Oak Valley Bank. In need to cash a check and put money in my checking account. We were going to go to Wally's bank, but then we'd need to go to my bank too to deposit the money, so we just went there to cash the check in the first place. We are driving by very small square houses. The area is in poor repair. There is a large brown wooden house off the ground, as if it were being moved. <br/
