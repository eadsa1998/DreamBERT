Howard keeps a photo of an old wedding. He says the bride is his sister-in-law and his sister a bridesmaid. I look and see that it is Dora's wedding photo. She is the bride and Sonja is the bridesmaid. I look to see where I am. I am off to the far right half, hidden behind other people. Or maybe I'm the tiny one off to the far left. I'm not sure. Now my daughters come to me. Paulina says she belongs to a group called the "Trauma Survivor's Group." Dovre says, "Yes, all three of us have been hurt." I now have to go to Howard and ask him if he ever did anything harmful to the girls. I don't want to talk to him, but I must, to get to the bottom of the situation (story?).
