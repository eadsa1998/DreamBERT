[1997-05-22] Betty and I were walking and somehow we missed our turn and it seemed like we had gone really far and I couldn't figure out how to get back. I pretended we were just taking an extra walk and I didn't really get mixed up, that I was just doing it on purpose and nobody actually knew, except me, that I had gotten confused for some strange reason because I covered it up okay.
