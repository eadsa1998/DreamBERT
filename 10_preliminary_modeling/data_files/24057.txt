The third dream takes place at what's supposed to be a school and college. But it's super crowded like a cafeteria with no food. I know for some reason that I have no friends here and want to make new ones. I go up to a group of cool-looking guys and say, "Hey, I'm Toby!" And everyone is nice. They're like, "Hi, Toby, my name is...." but everyone's name starts with an S. I repeat everyone's name, but I get some wrong, but they're like, "It's okay, all our names start with S." Then they say, "Hey! Aren't you that hot dude who hooked up with that hot girl who works at Jack-in-the-Box?" And I'm like, "Hey, that was me," being very cool about it. Everyone's like, "You da man," and while they're sort of cheering, I wake up.
