The whole dream revolves around a desk. I dreamed I was studying in the university. The same teachers and students were there, but the class wasn't the same. It was a classroom from the Champagnat school where I did my third year of high school. The desk where I sat wasn't one from the university or from the Champagnat school, but one from La Salle school where I did my first year of high school. Then I asked a professor how the desk had gotten there and he told me that it had been donated by some school which he couldn't remember. Then I started to look closely at the desk, trying to recapture that time of my life at that school. That was the whole dream.
