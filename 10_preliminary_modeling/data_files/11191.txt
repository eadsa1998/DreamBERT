I dreamt that a fellow I know came to the house and we were supposed to go out. I didn't like him very well and I wasn't too glad to go out. When he came, I found out he was married to my cousin who was staying with us at the time. He was dating me in order that he could see her. They had kept their marriage a secret. My first reaction was that I was glad he married her instead of me. Then I was surprised and puzzled why my cousin would want to marry him. I didn't consider him a desirable husband. I had refused to go out with him and had even told her I didn't like him. Then I was riding in the car with them as they were going on their honeymoon. He held her hand and again I couldn't understand why she wanted to marry him. Then I was angry that they had used me in order to keep their purpose a secret.
