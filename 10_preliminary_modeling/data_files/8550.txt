I was at CTS meeting with Felicity K. We were talking about my dissertation. Jack P arrived. I had invited him to be on my committee some time ago when I thought my topic was going to be spirit in the workplace. When he came in I was talking to him like nothing was wrong, all the time trying to figure out what to tell him or what to do. I felt bad that he had come here for nothing, because I couldn't have him on my committee now. I was explaining to him why I had invited him, saying that it was because I respected him and valued his opinion. Myself, Felicity K and some other people were working on some kind of project. We had to make some kind of a model out of heavy-duty electric extension cords. They weren't the typical orange colored ones however. They were dark colors like black and dark blue and such. I was having trouble doing much with mine. Felicity K had been successful but I don't remember now what hers was. I looked at someone else's and said, Oh. You've created a crown of thorns. They said no and told me what it was. It was round in shape and had a few of the old-fashioned sized Christmas lights standing up a bit here and there. I thought the lights represented the thorns.
