I was taking a pee. I had a hard-on and I peed up above my head. I had a bunch of bananas. Audrey was small. She was walking behind me, carrying them. I heard her yell. I looked back and she was up to her ____ deep in mud. I got hold of her and pulled her out. I was helping a man to mop the floors at White's. I saw down and fell asleep. When I awoke, I was changing clothes to go home, but I saw he did more work and had the water on the other floors. I asked him when he would be thru, and he said midnight, so I said I would stay and finish.
