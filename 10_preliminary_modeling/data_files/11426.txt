I was in the kitchen reading the newspaper and suddenly I turned and saw a hideous-looking person standing behind me. I then ran out the back door and to the front of the house. I turned again and saw the monster coming closer to me and I tried to run but I was unable to move. My legs would not budge. The monster was coming closer and I became frustrated and afraid because I could not move. The monster was about to grab me when I made myself wake up.
