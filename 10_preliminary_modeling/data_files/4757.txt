["Dream baskets."] I am in some store. Bonnie is around. There are craft things on the shelves. I see a small box with lots of miniature cute baskets in it. One is rectangular with a lid. I see boxes with little trains in them the engine and one car as a set. I see lots of skeins of embroidery or needlepoint threads many lovely colors. I'm thinking of making something with all these things. I feel happy. This will be fun.
