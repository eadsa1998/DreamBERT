I drove to Kendall B's home to discuss my studies. His wife was there along with his children, though I don't know that he has as many children in waking life. It seems there were at least four in the dream. He also had a lot of dogs and cats - they were the size of puppies and kittens but don't know that they weren't full-grown. They all seem to be black or very-dark colors. I was concerned about the cats because of my allergy to cats. I was talking to Kendall B but he had his back to me, sitting in a chair something like an outdoor chaise lounge. It was a big open room with very little in it. His wife was there also. Kendall B left the room for some reason. There was a white or beige sofa in the room but I was hesitant to sit down because of my cat allergy. The dogs and cats were running around my feet. I was having a conversation with his wife. She asked me how I came to be studying under Kendall B. I told her about my emailing him about 5 or 6 years ago and asking him to be my dreamwork mentor. When I got ready to leave it was dark outside. I was backing out of the driveway and being careful because I wasn't sure if I could see clearly enough to know that there were no cars coming and to make sure I didn't hit a mailbox or anything.
