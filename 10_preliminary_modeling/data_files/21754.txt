I was working in a shop and it was overtime because I had over 8 hours work in already. I passed a fellow worker who was reclining and said, "Come on and take a rest. I am." But I walked by. I was cleaning out brass chips out of the bottom of some big machinery. This was already cleaner and I was supposed to put the finishing touches to it, but I found out that the bottom was deep and a lot of chips were still on the bottom. I found the boss, so I told him and he was going to send some help.
