I am in a room and Dora is exhausted. She's a housewife and mother and works from morning until night and never gets caught up on her rest. She is folding laundry and Aunt Esther or Aunt Charlotte is visiting. Aunt Charlotte is wearing a black print dress and Dora pulls out a white, pretty dress from the laundry basket and says she can wear this one if she stays overnight. Bonnie holds it up to herself. Her hair is dark black and she has a pale complexion, so the white of the dress isn't all that complementary to her. She'd rather wear the black print one again. Dora is folding up bras and is searching for one that is comfortable for Auntie. She looks at one that is counterbalanced and says, "Maybe this one will help." They are all quite large, like "D" cup size. Aunt Charlotte then starts twirling and dancing and singing like she's pretending to be on stage and I think, "She really does have talent. It's too bad she isn't doing anything with it." Dora then turns to me and says, "We'll have to figure out something about the throat" (I'd had a coughing thing when I was being visited by this man, maybe Dovre's young man, Dwight. I'd impressed him with my humor but I'd had a coughing thing where I had to excuse myself from the room to choke and cough. He thinks I'm pretty talented. It was too bad about the throat.)
