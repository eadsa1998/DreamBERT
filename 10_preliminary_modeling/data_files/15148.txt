This creepy anorexic girl and guy were talking nearby. Mom and I were there and she said something like 'everyone sees an ugly girl talking' and everyone stared and I said 'that's coz they are'. I told Ezra about it later. I was playing World of Warcraft. The Queen of Stormwind looked like Mom, except fatter and she had red hair. I was with lots of others waiting at two elevators. One opened and it was pretty full and I thought someone dodgy was in there who wanted to 'steal' the Queen (she was with us and was like a blow-up doll). We went over to the other one, but thought that was dodgy too, so went with the first one. The door closed, but then immediately opened. Eric (True Blood) was there. We sat on the floor and heaps of coins spilled out of my pocket. The guy behind me was staring and I made fun of him. A person with me helped me pick them up. Then we stopped because we were supposed to let Eric and others do something. I had boxes at the old house and I carried them into my room. I was then watching How I Met Your Mother. There were flashbacks about how Marshall's mother hated Lily. One time Lily went outside, she came back to find the door locked. Then when she went back again, the door had never been used and was covered in spiderwebs and a red-back spider. The steps were falling apart and I thought she was going to fall through them. Marshall would go 'pfft' when he was doing something important or when he was nervous. I can't remember the first one they showed, but the next was when he proposed and there was a banner saying 'is this the type of host you wanted?'. Someone was on a road pretending to wait for something. A girl Ted liked was coming his way and he ran in the opposite direction.
