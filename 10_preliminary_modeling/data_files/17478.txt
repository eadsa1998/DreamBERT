I dreamt about my brother and I (I was also a boy) were trying to help our father.  We looked over the diagram of where we needed to be.  Side C.  It was to be very much like Descent.  There was a lot of destruction and I don't recall how things turned out.  I was unconscious.  I woke up in a dark room hanging off the corner of a bed.  We had succeeded, but I don't know what the casualties were.  Then I was in my maternal Grandma Jane's kitchen trying to make spaghetti.  Did I have onions?  I found rosemary wrapped around something that looked like one in a small strawberry basket, must be from my mother.  I found Tabasco sauce- little bottles of it.  No, I don't use that in spaghetti...why do I have that?  I was also making some macaroni and cheese but it was overheating.  Then we sat down to dinner.  An old guy was showing me the shoes of his kid.  They looked neat- but they were made from 'Lewad' leather.
