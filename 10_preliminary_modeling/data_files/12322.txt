We got told our classes for next semester. I had a 6.8. To get into the 'A' class you needed a 10. You needed a 20 to get into the top class. I was going to be in 'B'. Darius had 10 and Eugene had 8 or 7. Calvin and I were hanging with Eugene. Calvin said that we called him Swamp Boy and grabbing his arm and we were all laughing.
