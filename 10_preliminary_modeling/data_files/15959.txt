I was at the Technical College. We were in a computer lab but had another room we were in too. Frederick had some idea for a story involving me and I didn't want to be in it. Hubert was in the room and under a blanket. He got up and I saw his butt when he got back in and I squealed and he put clothes on as he laughed. He complained that people had called him gay and his family complained that he was in effeminate and I said it wasn't a bad thing. I was talking to Fletcher about leaving or something. I wanted to edit something but the labs were full. Bev also complained about something someone else was doing.
