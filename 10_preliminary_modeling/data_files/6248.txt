I had a dream about my dead grandmother, my father's mother. She was born in Ireland so she talked with an Irish accent. She was in the kitchen cooking breakfast like I remember she always did when I was little. My grandmother was making bacon, eggs, pancakes and sausages. Everybody in my family was sitting at the table: my six sisters and my brother and me. My father and mother were not at the table. I remember everybody eating but my grandmother was no longer there in the kitchen. It was just my sisters and brother and me sitting there, then I woke up.
