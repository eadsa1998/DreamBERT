 I'm in a small room with one or two other men. I urinate all over the floor, without regard for what I am urinating on. My classmate Julie Adams is there, watching me urinate. I leave with the men. She and another woman look around the room in disgust. There is a puddle of urine on one of the chairs. The women are repulsed by our behavior. My grade school classmates Jerry Kasper and Gino Teavor are there. A pregnant woman who breastfeeds, but is not doing so now, is there. I say something about this size of this woman's breasts changing. She has voluptuous breasts: large, soft, and fertile. Gino is concerned about the pay rate at which Jerry and others are receiving. Jerry works in a bicycle shop and is getting close to $10.00 per hour, but is not supposed to be earning that much. Something he has inadvertently done has caused him to get a raise. I don't think the situation is completely acceptable. Gino is expressing his concerning in his cussing way, the only way he can. Jerry talks to a man, and the error that resulted in his higher pay is easily corrected.
