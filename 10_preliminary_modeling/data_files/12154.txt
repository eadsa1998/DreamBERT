We had this robot scarecrow called Richard. I accidentally called him a snowman. I was out the back of our house, and I put two bricks in a shoe. A dog attacked me and Tigger. We all liked this robot guy heaps. He had to go and not come back. We had a path to the cemetery from our garage and people went through it all the time. It was Halloween and some boys were dared to stay there until 12.15. I went and people I knew were there. I went to a video shop, and Being John Malkovich was there. The robot came back for a short visit. At this person's house they left a light on for a little girl. This guy kept turning it off. The little girl was watching telly. Someone went into the bathroom.
