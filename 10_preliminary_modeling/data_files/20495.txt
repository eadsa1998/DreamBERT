I was with my mother on the street. I had an 8-foot ladder. We wanted to catch a bus, but I could not take the ladder, so I looked around for a place to leave it. My mother said I should leave it right there at the bus stop. I was afraid it would be taken, so I walked down the block to a hardware store. The bus came and we missed it. At the store two young women were there, and when I asked them if I could leave the ladder there, they just grinned and shook their heads negatively. Later I was on the ladder against a porch with a table on it. I was peeling an orange on the table. A man came over and showed that he was indignant because I was using his table. Then he took one of the oranges.
