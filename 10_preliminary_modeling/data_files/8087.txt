Darren and I were still married. We were at a point of giving it one last chance. We were in bed. I decided to try one more time to be intimate with him. He did something that I really didn't like. I just pulled away and didn't say anything else to him. I was just going to go to sleep. He could tell that I really didn't like what he did. I didn't want to talk about it. I just knew that was it. I just couldn't stay with him. But I also didn't want to say that to him. I think eventually I did. He was talking to people like BJ, trying to get them to. I don't know if he was just telling her how upset he was or if he was hoping she could talk me into staying.
