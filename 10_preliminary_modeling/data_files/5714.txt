[1997-05-25] Just came home from the grocery store and was picking up different bottles of aftershave I had bought and was putting them away. I could smell the Old Spice and wondered why I had bought it because I was tired of it and I already had some but I bought it anyway. I had also bought 2 other kinds of aftershave and I remember smelling them and putting them away.
