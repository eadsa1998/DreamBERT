One day I went camping and I went to the bookstore and my mom and dad were waiting in the car. When I came back out with my book my mom and dad weren't there. So I went down the streets looking for them. Then police came driving their police cars and they started saying, "homeless child, homeless child," and then I came to the street and I saw my mom but not my dad. She divorced--my mom divorced for another man. Well we got home with the new man and I tore my book apart because I was soooo mad that my mom divorced.
