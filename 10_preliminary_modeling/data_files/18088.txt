Mom was going to a party and we stopped at the pet store, and we saw this really cute black lab puppy. I had to go to a babysitter's, so mom thought about getting the dog and I went to my babysitters and mom went to a party. Mom came and got me and it was nighttime, so we looked at the stars and saw spaceships and comets and shooting stars and we went home and mom got the black lab puppy. I kept it and we named it Maggie and we played with it and Bonnie and Lucy [her dogs] got to know the little puppy.
