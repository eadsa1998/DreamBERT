I was in a house with many rooms, like Disch's Funeral Home, but an older house.  Felt a little like Indiana area.  It was a little get together with about 5 or 6 people, it was night.  Nell [a good friend from undergraduate days, she was a mime] was there, in the lead as usual, sometimes performing.  The house had older darker furniture, some antiques, and low lighting.  Wood floors with rugs.  Later the house filled with water and when it was about 2 feet deep, I had sex with a man I liked there.  Earlier in the party I knew I liked him a great deal.  By then the other people were gone or elsewhere.  It was spontaneous, sensual, fun sex with him, in the water inside a house.  We enjoyed each other, looked in each other's faces.  It was unusual, but we were not worried about the water, although we did acknowledge that it was out of the ordinary for a house to fill with water.  We just saw it as fun, part of the party.  Afterward he went to the door to leave.  I had assumed from our fun that we would spend time together, or be together as a couple, but now I realized I was mistaken, my expectations had been too high, and didn't match his.  I was greatly saddened by this but did not want to show it.  As he was leaving, I remember hoping he had not given me a disease, since we'd fucked so spontaneously.  I had not thought about it before, because I had assumed we would be together as a couple so there would be a level of responsibility.  As soon as I woke up I knew the man was Rob, from his face, voice, eyes, body.  But in the dream I did not call him Rob, I sort of knew it was him from that old longing, thinking that finally the long-held dream for him was fulfilled - that's how I recognized it was Rob.
