I am going to a movie and go upstairs to sit in a special circle chair. There's some spy stuff going on and a brand new baby. The baby would tell me to lay her under the water so she can push a button while no one looks. I let her do that and pull her out seconds before she runs out of oxygen. Finally, I protest. She assures me she's o.k. I put my hand down there and push the button myself secretly. Then the baby and I must escape. We hide in the movie crowd. Dora and Willie are there and we agree to sit together. My round chair is sort of a wheelchair. A German general spies around. [BL]
