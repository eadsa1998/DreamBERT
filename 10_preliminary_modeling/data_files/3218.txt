Bad men are threatening. They have a CD disk-like thing that is very powerful and can explode. Data decides to take over and strong-arms the men away from him as he blows a flame from his mouth to light a candle (like a birthday cake candle) that will set the whole place afire. He then decides to keep the CD disk thing. Why destroy all that power even if it could be dangerous in the wrong hands? The flames are starting too get big so he starts to leave, then noticing that the oven is on and the roast is now cooked well done. He turns the oven down and then off, thinking how sad to waste a perfectly good roast. Bad timing, but it can't be helped. He leaves.
