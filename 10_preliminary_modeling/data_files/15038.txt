I was watching The X-Files. Mulder and Scully were at a house. I was with Scully. There was a dressing table and some glasses on top. I put them on and then I could see the mother, grandma and daughter who lived there and were dead. I freaked out and Scully didn't believe me. Then the grandma was going to kill herself to save the girl and the mother was crazy. I cried a lot. There were some cheap houses in Seaside and I said that I wouldn't live in Seaside. Then we were in groups and there were beds in one room with no room to walk. I was with Ezra and we were using a picture to map the beds.
