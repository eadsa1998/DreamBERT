In the first one I was in my apartment reading, I believe, and someone knocked at the door. It was this friend of mine, a friend  from high school, though when I greeted him and so forth, it didn't seem as though he were an old friend, but rather a present friend. There was no surprise at seeing him come. He looked very, very haggard. His face was all kind of very obviously tired-looking and blemished and his hair was disarrayed, and I asked him what he had been doing. He said he had been studying for finals, and he showed me, it was obviously no surprise to me that he was a medical student or pre-med student because he showed me a book and he was showing me diagrams of livers, the difference between a human liver and various kinds of animal livers. I believe he even had one with him, that he was showing me. A human liver was like a scroll of paper which you could unroll and it would be a sheet and it would roll up into a cylinder. I asked him how he was doing on his finals and he said he was supposed to take four that morning, but that he had slept through them all. No particular emotions in that dream. I remember the dream very clearly and vividly. The dream was plausible. It seemed to take place in the present. It was black and white. The setting was my apartment, as I said, It seemed to take subjectively about 10-15 minutes, and I might say the day before I dreamed this dream, I happened to see that old friend in a restaurant at about three in the morning, and he did look very tired at the time.
