I'm being held hostage with a small group of others in a house. We have been left in a large room covered with mattresses and quilts. We brace ourselves under the quilts with guns which have been smuggled into our room for us. They are old and some of them don't seem to work. People suddenly rush in, but we stay still under the blankets. One by one the attackers rip back the quilts, and there are a few failed attempts to shoot the attackers blindly through the quilts. I can hear the other hostages being shot one by one. Finally it's my turn, I can sense people standing over me. I take aim and as soon as the quilt moves I fire in several directions.
