I was in Scotland. Everything was beautiful. The streets were big and clean and one got the impression that there was no end to them. The hotels were lit and very well lit. I walked and walked and found a town that looked very much like our mountain region. The little llamas raised their proud chests and displayed the pure wool which grew in their deep chests. Everything was wonderful. Then I was going through a city which had a volcano very much like the Misti.
