The beginning of a new tape, obviously! [she sings!] Oh well, that's dumb. [laugh] I had a dumb dream last night that I had just graduated from high school, and for whatever reason all of the teachers wanted to have all of us back for ten more days, and especially Ms. Marcos. She had, I can't remember, I think it was something like the fact that the state mandated that shove a couple more lessons down our throats and she didn't get to it. And in order to cover her hide, we had to go back ten days after we graduated and get a little more. And then Mr. Jameson decided he was going to do that too. And I had to go to the Wa______ and I was trying to figure how to get all this in at once. And it was kind of weird. I can't remember much of what happened, but the gym was like this big open, dark area and it just was different. And I woke up and I realized it was only a dream, and I was so grateful. But then I went back to sleep and I dreamt that I was in a dollar store with this little boy, and I had to buy certain things. And I was buying these gummy dinosaurs, and I like took a handful of them and I took them up to the counter and I paid 10 cents each, and then I woke up.
