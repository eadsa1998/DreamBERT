I was at a school. I was going to class and someone was acting dodgy and I poured hot tea on them. They said they were just warning us that we had to do a test on some body part next class and we needed to know names of some of the parts. We got to class and the teacher was covering the board and I was trying to look, but they kept moving so I couldn't see, as they had a picture of whatever the body part was with the names on it. Something happened and this creature started attacking people and we tried to run. The teacher got 'possessed' and in the class next door there were 'eggs' from the creature, which were just people covered in a sac, one of them had the legs still sticking out, kicking.
