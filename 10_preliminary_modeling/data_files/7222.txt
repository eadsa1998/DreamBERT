As I started out to teach my class, I realized I had left my notes and it was too late to return for them. What should I do? I could tell them about the percentages of each family member in my dreams. Started for former classroom to find my class had been moved to another room. Went there and students came in until the room was crowded. Two got very noisy running about and I opened the door and told them to get out. I began my talk by explaining briefly why the percentages of each member of my family differed in my dreams. Didn't give exact figures except the 41 percent of unpleasant ones for L. The room and number present changed more than once. Then I asked the students if they dreamed of their family members. Only one woman responded. I couldn't hear her very well and asked if that were her family. "Yes, in England," she replied.
