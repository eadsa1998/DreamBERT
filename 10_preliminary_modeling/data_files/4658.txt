A woman friend has an odd relationship with an old lawyer. He's feisty, rich and selfish. I help him walk into the house. I meet Robert Downey Jr. We are instantly attracted. He has 2 children, a boy and a girl. They don't like me. I win them over. Downey and I marry. We are a loving and wonderful family. Then I become ill or must leave. It is very sad we reminisce about the days we first fell in love. Our love is deep. It's close to my time to die. They walk with me to the circle area. Downey disappears upstairs. His best friend follows a bit and hears him ordering various women to come be with him sexually. The friend is very upset. I am sad but I understand. He needs connection because his grief over my death is so big and painful. He will "drown" himself in these other women to try and let go of the pain over me not being there. I so want to stay but it is my time. As I wake, I hear what I thought was Charla yelling in her sleep "Pill." Ellie didn't hear it. I feel very sad.
