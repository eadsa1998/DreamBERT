I went to see Ron and he was talking to me about Marcie, telling me he really liked her. I felt really jealous. Then Marcie showed up and Ron disappeared. She and I were starving but I was stressed because I didn't have any money, nor my ID on me. We ended up in a nursing home cafeteria eating pizza. We left and she was driving this car and I was the passenger. She was driving like a maniac and the car went off the road. We were speeding out of control down a hill and we ran over a police barrier and stopped. I was frantically trying to buckle my seat belt. She came up, I rolled down the window, and she lectured me on wearing seat belts.
