The scene I can recall is cast in the kitchen of our fraternity house. It was an ordinary college bull session revolving around an icebox raid. The only topic of conversation I can recall was a discussion of the various assets of a fraternity brother's girl. After that I left the kitchen and somehow got on a stairway that was pretty steep. I think I was going down the stairway and yet at other times I was going up. On the stairway, there was somebody else, I think it was a female but I can't recall who it was. I rather think it was an unidentified being.
