I was at the Technical College and it was Thursday. It was different, and on Thursdays we had this math class, but we had only attended the first 3 or so and then skipped the rest. I decided to go today, but Tristan and the others decided to skip it and go to this cinema on campus. I realised I'd forgotten my calculator and was contemplating skipping it when I got a text from Tristan saying there was some event on at the cinema, so I text back 'link?' and he sent me a link and it was this thing with Dan Palmer in it. It was a short film/music video that he was in and then a film. I went and bought a ticket but then forgot what session it was for and the time was wrong on the ticket. I asked the guy standing around and he said it was for 11am and it was about 11.15am now. I quickly ran in, but the film had already started and I'd missed the music video - which was something I'd been wanting to see for a while so I was annoyed.
