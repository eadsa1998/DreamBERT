And the second crazy dream I had was about a little while later, after I went pee, and in this dream I don't know how I was there, but I was with Mom and we were kind of at a backstage area of like a beauty contest, and these ladies were coming through all dressed up with their little helper kids. And they were getting presents and leaving them backstage in their areas and going on, filing on through. And they were stopping in this kitchen where we were, and one of our neighbors was there, and I think Mom and I were cooking food. And Aunt Christine had this -- I felt like Aunt Christine was going to come through this beauty line, and she never did. And the next thing was that we were here in my bedroom and it was daylight, Mom pulls out a little portable radio from when the girls were here. It was like theirs. And she turns it on and it's like, she's just talking to it, "I miss Jackson," and stuff like that. [laugh] That was weird. But then we were like walking, and we said, "Let's walk to the capital," and I'm like, "Okay," and so we're 15 minutes around and we cross a little bridge diagonal like across some kind of water and we're in this nature park and area that she tells me is Bestin (?). And there's this man with his bird that got loose and almost runs in front of a car, but I was saying to her, "If it only takes us 15 minutes to walk to Bestin, then why does it take us 3 hours or nearly 8 hours to drive there?" That was messed up, man!
