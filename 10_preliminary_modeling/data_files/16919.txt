I'm doing an urgent project for a long-term client. It's a bank holiday or a weekend, yet they need my help to make some changes to a project. Amazingly I give up my time to go over to my client's house to deliver the work to them. I drive one client ( a female) with her child for about half an hour to where her colleague Julian is having a meeting. I give the work to him. It's got something to do with a talent show for tv or something. Julian drives us all back to his house. Only then do I realize that I've left my car back where we came from. Julian realises this too, and he drives me back to get it.
