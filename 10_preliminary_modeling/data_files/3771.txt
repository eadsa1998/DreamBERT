I am trying to walk up some stairs that aren't even finished being built yet. I realize how futile and hard this is, so I go back down and find an "elevator" which is simply a pull chain as I stand on a wooden floor. The mechanism goes down and I see the inner structure of the basement floors go by as I stand there unprotected. I am a bit nervous, wondering if it has a stopping mechanism or if I'll just plow into the floor when I get there. It does have a stopping mechanism and I step off and find myself in a basement, a BIG basement. I am tired and lie down on the floor, with my head resting on a sack of some kind. I see a kitten and then another and then groups of them curled up on shelves and sacks of things. They are all adorable and most are calico. One of them, a half-grown one, sits on my chest and wants to be petted. I pet her, happily. One small baby one nibbles on my ear and I tell it to stop. Now four or five men come in and stop and see me. They are young and muscular and good-looking. One is in a power wheelchair. He smiles at me. They are here to pleasure me sexually. I lie passively where I am and then feel one of them near me. I turn my head and am happy to see he is very beautiful, Mexican, I think, because of his thick black hair and his warm brown eyes. I exclaim, pleased, "You are so very good-looking." He smiles, pleased. His skin is covered with a shiny coconut oil substance. I curl up to him and begin sensually kissing him all over his chest and so on. He begins to expertly wriggle his penis into me. It is very erotic and exciting.
