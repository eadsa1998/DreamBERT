I dreamt that I, with a few others, was in a house and people outside were shooting at us. They had guns trained at the windows so that if anyone showed their heads, they would be shot. I wanted to go upstairs to the bathroom, but was afraid I'd be seen and shot. I debated whether I could crawl up and was afraid not. Once someone threw in the window a jelly bomb, it was yellow. It didn't seem to have much effect. This fight had started after the backroom had been set afire. I forget why. I was told to throw water on it as everything was probably killed by now and there was a row of animals charred, but I don't think they were dead. I was a little frightened. There was a burnt crow and I think the other animals were birds also, perhaps vultures. Oh, I was also afraid someone would get close and stick their gun right through the hole made by the jelly bomb and shoot me
