My best friend Emma and some of her friends came to pick me up from the campus we were at.  It was large, and it was night.  The bathrooms were interesting.  We went to a gas station.  I got a call on the cell phone as I was getting in my car parked near the campus.  My door was still open and I think an Indian man was behind me. My mother was having 'another' stroke.  Then she was doing something in the bathroom with tons and tons of ants.  They were falling from the ceiling onto the bed, coming from the patio door, and from the other side.  She was trying to get rid of them all.  The last thing I remember before awakening was "jai pa uma tai".  I have no idea what it means, but I read it over and over again in attempt to remember it when I awoke.  I even tried etching it in my hand; I felt it was important somehow.
