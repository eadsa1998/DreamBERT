I was at Mom's. I died, but I was hanging around. Sometimes I could interact with stuff and I was learning how to fly. I had to go to the balcony and jump off. I didn't like that bit though. There was a trampoline out the back, but it was wet. I had to get the hose and put it in a hook. The hooks were all marked with Spaced characters. Mark Heap was in the yard, and I put the hose between his hook and someone else's. Mom was seeing this black guy. I was scaring some blokes. It turned David Lynch like and I was observing and everything was different. Jack Nance was there and he had orange hair [like Colin Hunt in The Fast Show]. Someone had their hand and foot on the doorframe, curled up. This girl was in a room and she was all jerky like. Later, I was at home telling Dad about my dream. First I was lying in front of the heater. Ezra said I wasn't going to school today because I got the day off. Dad made a joke about trying to learn how to fly for three days. There was a house thing called Riff Raff, which only had two walls. I was then at Mom's again. She woke me up and I was writing down my dreams. I accidentally wrote in my fat little notebook. My dream was about Tinkerbell and Mittens.
