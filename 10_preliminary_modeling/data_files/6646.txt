A woman doctor to whom I had gone for some other reason began to test my eyes. I thought "I can't let her for my own doctor should have that job." Then I remember that doctor C. could hardly be my own doctor for he has treated me only once. There is difficulty in getting me seated in the right stool. I am across the room and she flashes a light in my eyes. The retina is flashes on a screen. (I think I really opened my eyes.) There are many bookshelves standing out like library stacks. I wonder where the books come from, mow more than at first. The doctor is now unrolling charts for further examination and has me change my seat.
