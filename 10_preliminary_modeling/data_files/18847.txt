I was sitting on a couch with a girl whom I was dating, but lost interest in lately. I was acting very cold to her at first, but then she was responding the same way. We never were overly warm to each other. Then I started to make bold moves and she responded to my surprise in a very warm way. All this time we were having a conversation, the subject of which I am not familiar or can recall. We soon became involved in a show of affection and then I attempted to have intercourse with her. She became very passionate and willing, but I couldn't get her clothes off. Then I woke up. Damn it. [anxious, frustrated, pleasant, setting not familiar, no color]
