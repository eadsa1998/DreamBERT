I was at school.  I 'd taken a test like the core and got very poor scores.  These little handheld gadgets like calculators reported it, and then said why.  I disputed at least one of the reasons.  It was a why question, and the answers were very specific.  I sat on a little hill and the tide started to come in, and flood.  I was waiting for my boyfriend Jeremy.  He had to drive through some of the water.
