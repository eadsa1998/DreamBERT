 I'm on a busy with my green suitcase. I have killed my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and my friend Persia Miko. In my suitcase is Annie's body, cut up. I also beheaded Persia's body, which is under my bead. I talk to some people. They talk about where Annie is: where she will turn up, because she is missing. I go along with their talk, saying I don't know, but knowing full well that I've killed her. I get off the bus and walk towards a house where I live, which I don't recognize. It seems to be kind of a dump: maybe a trailer home. As I walk towards it I realize I've done something terrible for which there is no remedy. I'm guilty of a heinous crime. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, despair, and hopelessness. Even if I somehow tried to rid myself of Persia's body, the fact that there is no head would reveal my guilt. I realize that one bad action ruins all the good actions I've done. I don't know what to do. I know someone will find out what I've done. I walk into the house and someone I know or live with tells me there is an animal or something scary in my room. I go in my room. Loudly, I scare a small colorful snake out from under my bed. I'm afraid of it, thinking it is poisonous. I pick it up, grabbing it behind the head, so it won't bite me. It is on the floor. I stomp on it repeatedly to kill it.
