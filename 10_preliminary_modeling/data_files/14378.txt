I was on an island or on the beach. I'm not sure of the details. The leader guy killed some people and he kept some people that he liked. He picked three of us, me, a girl and a guy to be some volleyball players. There were only three players on each team and we were playing against girls. He was making us do this so that we got used to it and could beat everyone. The guy was Peter Krause, and his 'skill level' was 10 and ours was like 1.08. He said he'd gone running on rocks in the water. This guy made fun of his deep voice and I said that I did the same thing while watching Six Feet Under.
