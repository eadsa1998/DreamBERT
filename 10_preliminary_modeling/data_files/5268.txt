I dreamed that Jackson and I were on a bus on the way home from my elementary school. He jumped out of the bus to run to my house. It was pouring rain, so we had to change into dry clothes. I was changing when he walked in and saw me. I wasn't embarrassed, for some reason. But there was something I was trying to hide in my closet, so I was worried that he would find it. Then I woke up.
