I see a parade. A long and large group of women are marching and they all are naked from the waist up. Lots of big boobs. Some have a towel around their neck that drapes down, partially covering themselves. I see them pass by and feel concern that they will get hassled. Sure enough, a group of men whistle and make lurid remarks, then I see the group marching back, in retreat. One man is leaning on the back of one woman like a dog fucking from behind. I am furious at them and him in particular. I feel sorry for the woman. The police are following the couple trying to pry the guy off the woman. They reform and start to march again. I come out onto the sidewalk and see a few men standing nearby. I stare at them angrily. One man says, "Uh! oh! Here's a feminist." I don't respond to him, but belligerently glare. Another man approaches a man in a wheelchair and starts to make inane stereotyped remarks. I turn to him and say, "First sexism and now handicapism. Be careful, you are making a fool of yourself in public."
