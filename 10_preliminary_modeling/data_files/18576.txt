There was a girl with flippy blonde hair in a poofy white dress. I couldn't be sure if it was her prom night (that) she was trying to get ready for or (if) it was her Halloween costume and she was a fairy godmother. A tennis shoe was stuck to the skirt part of her dress. The shoestring (tie end) was stuck and the shoe was floating in the air. She was perplexed. I couldn't waste any more time looking at her and her predicament. I'd already let the lawnmower choke down once for watching her and it was HARD TO CRANK. I had lots of grass to cut that day. I kept having to turn the blade speed down because it kept going faster and faster. The blade was so low to the ground and CHINKING on rocks--"chink, chink". The speed setting was getting higher all the time. My knuckles were vibrating from the push lawnmower. Then the higher blade was getting lower. My knuckles were getting white. Then the Chrysler Building was opened after hours for a big party. I opened the huge window blinds to view the entire city. In the center of the "Cloud Room" were bump cars. They looked fun. 2 girls of ambiguous sexual preference were wrestling and having fun. One especially had very sleek, defined leg muscles. In the stadium--bleacher part ??? people dancing. The crowd hushed when the James Earl Jones's reading of Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven" began. It was the version from the Simpsons. ??? basement. Me and Sarah squeezed through. Sarah and I went to the basement and tried on swirly printed cheaply made long dresses. A sign said, "As a matter of fact, keep on top of what's happening. You probably lived in a previous century."
