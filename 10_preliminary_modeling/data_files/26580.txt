 I'm going out for a Rugby team. I practice with the team at Carter School. We do tackling drills. I dive, trying to tackle people. We do scrum drills. I'm in the middle of the scrum. I'm strong in the scrum, pushing others. I have a good time playing, but decide that I'm not going to keep playing because the season conflicts with deer hunting season, and I would never give up deer hunting. The rest of the team goes to do exercises. I strip down to fluorescent yellow spandex shorts and job around the field while they exercise. My friend Reed Maxwell is there. I would like to shower, but there are none here. Reed is going somewhere else to shower. Someone talks to me about B___, which is a place held in high regard to Buddhists. The person seems to imply I should go to this place. I have a mouthful of a white pasty substance that I spit out onto the ground.
