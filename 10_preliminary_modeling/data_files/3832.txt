["Packing for the Convention."] I am going to a conference. I am packing what I will take. I keep finding more things to take. I look at the pile and decide to take out a very large writing pad, because I already have a smaller one. I remove something else. My mother is trying on a pair of my birkenstocks shoes. She wants them. I think about giving them to her, then I decide to keep them.
