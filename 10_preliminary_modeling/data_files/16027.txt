I was in editing class which had us sitting at desks and the teacher was some guy with curly blonde hair who looked out of the 70s. He was showing some weird program to everyone and I was like just 'what the hell is this'. He came up to me after and said he'd show me since I'd been away. After class I saw him a while later and had to go back to class - he gave me keys then said he'd have to come because he had stuff in his bag. It was locked off like a mall, we went in and got some stuff and left. Then there was this game where you had to balance these life support systems and I accidentally changed something and a ton of people died. Then it was real life and someone had managed to save this baby before it died. They put it in this cylindrical thing and its face went green and got really big and it was like a zombie mutant baby but it started talking in this deep voice and was like 'possessed' or something. Later I was at dinner with Tristan at his sisters' place and Floyd was making jokes with me, there was some joke about pancakes. And his girlfriend (different) was talking about plucking her cheeks and something else and I was like what why and Floyd was like 'see she's smart' (because I didn't do it or care). Later Tristan said he was flirting with me and that the pancake joke was some inside thing, like a dig at his girlfriend. I was like 'he wasn't flirting' and Tristan just gave me a look. Later I went to this room which was basically a big mattress on the floor. Frederick came in and was having problems turning off the lights and was joking around and being his normal self. He turned the lights off and I said 'are you getting in?' And he said 'no... I'm just going to cuddle up to you' as he got in and lay behind me right up close with his arm around me and I liked it and had missed it.
