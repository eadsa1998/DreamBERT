My friend Mike was going to stay over night in the town of my university.  He wanted to be up at 4.   He moved in, and arranged the kitchen in his room the same as it was in mine, but with cheaper materials.  He "painted" the walls blue by securing blue paper napkins to it.  When I woke up, everyone was gone, and it was around 2 in the afternoon.  I missed my 11 am appointment with the chiropractor, and I was confused as to what time I had to be on campus for my last class.  While I was trying to figure it out, I looked outside to see a huge twister.  There was an ostrich in the yard.  Somehow my mother arrived; the highway wasn't affected by the tornado.  We were packing up to move.  I had to leave for class, though.
