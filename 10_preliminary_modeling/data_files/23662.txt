The other Robbie from my childhood takes me to his home on the park named after the queen who had been at the wedding in the Inner Court. We go upstairs. We are alone. I say, "Jeez, I haven't been here for ages. That is not true," I correct myself. "I still saw your father here before he died." The pond behind the park is beautiful with the beautiful orange colors of a sunset. He asks if I want a drink. I ask for tonic water.
