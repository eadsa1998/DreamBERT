One night while Bob is over, I dreamt that we've reconciled completely and things are back to the way they were. The abortion is over and we have decided to give our relationship another chance. Upon returning from a nice picnic at the park, Bob takes me to a place that is unfamiliar to me. I don't know if we are still in the big nearby city. I'm thinking, "he's going to ask me to marry him." Bob asks me to sit down. The tone of his voice is beginning to alarm me. "Marsha, I need to talk to you about us." First he tells me why we can't be together and that we're both too obsessed with each other. He tells me that he's gone back to work for my brother Alex and that Alex wants him to leave me alone. All during this time I noticed that Bob√ïs eyes have a weird look to them, as though he were hypnotized. I am sick with anger, my brother has gotten to him! I am filled with fury, a burning rage has welled inside of me. I begin to exorcise the influencing demon (my brother) from Bob. I rebuke him in Jesus' name. I am so emotionally enraged that in my sleep I literally begin striking Bob (who is awakened by my blows to his neck).
