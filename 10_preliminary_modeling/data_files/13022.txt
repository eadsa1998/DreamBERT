We were doing a Battle Royale 'game'. Samantha, someone else and I were hiding out on some rocks. We ended up hiding at home and the wood door wasn't closed. I saw people on the street and I was worried that they saw me and I managed to get the door closed. Mr Willingham was trying to kill me for some reason. I jumped over the back fence. Later, there were three people left and Eugene had already died. I ended up winning, I think.
