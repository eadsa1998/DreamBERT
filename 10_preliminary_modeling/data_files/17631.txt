I dreamt I started taking a shower with my boyfriend Jeremy and my housemate Drake.  Then I was in a house.  There were two people lying on pillows.  There were objects waiting, symbolic of my relationship with Jeremy.  A little house with some moving parts, and something about Thai.  I sat down and watched TLC.  I was dumbstruck- it was a biography about Jeremy!  Jeremy gave me some soup.  In it I found paper- 3 six-page letters, labeled.  One said cloud.  I went to tell my mother.  Everything was so wonderful.  Someone had a moustache.
