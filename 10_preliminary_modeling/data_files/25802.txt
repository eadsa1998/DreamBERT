 I am snowboarding on a ski slope. My roommate Stephen Ramos is there. He is being a jerk. There is a competition between us. He goes down the hill, jumps, and cracks his snowboard. I am cautious about taking another lift farther up the hill. I see my classmate Amy Leopard on a ski lift. I go down the hill out of control, spinning and going backwards and forwards. At the bottom of the hill my classmate Alec Johnson is there. We joke around and wrestle. I wonder if I'll see him again. I have a flat football for a lift ticket. I see my high school classmate Lyle Zeffman and some other guys at a table when I rid the lift up. My high school classmates Kari Otis and Carol Derth are on a ski lift. I am about midway up the mountain. I go across the hill because I don't want to ski down, but I don't want to go up any higher either. I go by a sled race area. Two people in plastic sleds race down tracks, like ski racing. There is a big drift area, which is a bog, and is dangerous to go in. I new truck is parked near this bog. I don't go into the bog, but walk away from it. I man in line for the race or the lift makes fun of me. I say to him, "Hey mate, shut the fuck up!" I go up on a lift. I try to get on a chair with some women but they go ahead of me and I am not quick enough. I ride up the lift alone. My old classmate Gino Teavor is then on my chair. Our classmate Bud Slick and two women are a few feet in front of us in a chair. We talk about fishing. Gino has several small spinners in his hat or somewhere. As we ride up the lift there is very little snow, and grass is everywhere. Gino points out a broken light bulb. I don't want to go up farther to the more difficult hills, but I do.
