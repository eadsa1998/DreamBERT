The girl I am in love with appears in the dining room at my school (I haven't been there in about 8 years). I recognize all the details of the dining room clearly. In the back I see there is a bazaar. I am with a friend, wearing my school uniform. She is wearing a yellow poncho, with books in her hand, just like I saw her going home one day. She was just coming from the university, her look is questioning, but since I have been angry at her for some time, I simply say hello to her, which makes her rather surprised.
