["Creating Music for my program"]  I am in a house, apparently one my mother, my father, and Dwight live in. I am working on my computer project. I realize I need music to go with it. I smile at my father as he walks through the living room. I hint that he should write me some original music. He laughs and says no way. That would take too long. I then comment that if I get music from someone else, it will be copyrighted. He doesn't take the hint and leaves the room. I go down a hall to visit Dwight's room. He's hanging out. He has no suggestions for me.
