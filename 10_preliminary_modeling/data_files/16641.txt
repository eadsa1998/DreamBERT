I had a dream about the red boat that we used to have. I dreamt that Sandra and the kids were here, but for some reason there was only Sandra. There must have been ________ when Dad was at work, because he wasn't here. And Mom and I and Sandra decided that we were going to take the boat and go to the beach, and so I think -- I can't remember if we hitched it up to the car, or if we tied it on the top of the car, but we did one of the above. And I suggested that we take the green truck and just flop the boat in the back of the truck, but Mom said it wouldn't fit. And so I don't really remember us riding in the boat; I just remember us being at the beach. And I remember swimming in the water. And I remember kind of being _______ boat. And when I was swimming in the water, wouldn't you know, it started to rain. And we were gathering up all our stuff and we were going to run and seek shelter. And, wouldn't you know, the boat was anchored and for some reason it had this odd back-up alarm kind of sound that would go off if you left it unattended for too long. Wouldn't you know it started happening, and Mom had to go and shut that off. And we were getting to pack it up and bring it home, I think, and I think we packed it up and brought it home because of the rain. And then, when we got it home, I think parts of it kind of got scattered all over the house. I think Mom put the boat in the bathtub outside [laugh] and for some reason the motor and other parts got put on the old sleeping couch, where the organ is now in the living room. And some other kind of piece got put in my bathroom upstairs in my tub. [laugh] That was pretty crazy. And so I think maybe in this dream they were going to work on the boat motor or something and I didn't want to be around to hear it because it is so loud. And so I decided I was going to make myself disappear, and in this dream -- not literally, you know -- I was going to take a walk. Dad says, "Make myself disappear" or "make yourself scarce" or something when he means just go somewhere else. So I had these little pink sandals in my dream, and they had like glitter on them. They were the ultimate dorky little girl things. So I put them on and I started out the front door, and it's one of those things where I couldn't really run, but I was really trying to, and I was trying to get away. And inside I could hear them, Dad was telling Mom that we have to __________ crank up the motor and then I managed to get pretty far away, almost to Merillee's before I heard it faintly, and then I decided I was going to take a walk all around the neighborhood and hopefully be gone until they were done. And then I woke up.
