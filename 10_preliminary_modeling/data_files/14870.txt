I was at Nana's. Ezra was there too. I went outside and the fish pond was quite clear. There was a big orange fish and I was singing to it. This big silver fish was nearby. I saw something on the bottom of the pond and it was rock like, but then I realized it was a fish. I then realized it was actually a Murloc. I ran to tell Ezra. He was on the computer and was smoking. He said something about a Supernatural convention and he was up to episode 4 of season 5.
