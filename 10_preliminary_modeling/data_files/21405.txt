Carter and I were in a building about a block away from a skyscraper. We had our rifles and we would shoot at the top of the skyscraper. Once in a while I saw two dogs chasing one another across the top side of the skyscraper. I pointed my gun in their direction and shot at them as they passed. I saw the bullet hit the building and chip some of it. Then Carter pointed his gun and he shot low. I thought he hit one of the windows. I saw the manager or detective of the skyscraper outside the skyscraper looking up, and I surmised he was trying to locate from where the shots were coming. I was going to hide my rifle and told Carter to do so also. As I was trying to conceal it, the man from the skyscraper came in. I held my gun to the side of me and walked away, hiding my gun from his view. I got to a locker, put it in, and then I had a hard time closing the door.
