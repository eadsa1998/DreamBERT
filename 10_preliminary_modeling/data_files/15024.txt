I was at Toys "R" Us. It was a tiny new shop but I liked it because it was neat. I was there to get something unrelated. There were two Asians at the counter. There was an ad for Warcraft. Mom and Ezra went outside. I had gotten some lollies and I did something and then I went outside. One of the Asians said 'you're Alliance, I'm Horde and strong and [something about backing off]' and he didn't call me a bitch. Then the other Asian said 'I think she is confused'. He came out and had an American accent and said he was level 1 and I said that I was level 68 but I had only started a few months ago. He said he was in a high-level guild and that he would go with them on raids etc. They would all end up dying and he would be the only one left. Mom was up a hill in an ugly green car which she ended up buying. Later I was driving and approached these lights which were red but were flickering green. But then they stayed red but Mom told me to go left. We ended up lost and walking. Then we found a shop that had nice rolls. We went up a path and we found 'guard horses'. There were four. They told Mom about this diet/workout thing that I had seen before. This was on a collection of short films and was the last one. We had gone to the beach before. I also got a low mark on my math assignment.
