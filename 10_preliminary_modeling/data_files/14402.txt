I was at the shop with Mom. I was looking for some chocolate and I found this interesting bar which was all curled around. There was a game (I can't read what I wrote next to it, but it looks like ([something] to see'). You had to search the area for a male and a female (could be between 1-something in a pair?). One lot I got was '14'. Then you did something with them but I don't remember. I discovered Dmitri played it and left like 10 messages. He joked about it later. I found a message he had written to someone saying he had applied for some police job. A photo of him showed him with a little ring on his little finger. I decided not to write any more? There was a dog in a cage.
