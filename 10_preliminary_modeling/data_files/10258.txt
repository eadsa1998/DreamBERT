Several generations live in our ancestral home: old aunts and uncles and Reynaldo is still a baby and he a TWIN brother; I sit on the bed with the twins and kiss them goodnight; I look out at the snow and wonder how come there is so much snow already? Downstairs in the corridor, there is a LEAK of WATER from the ceiling; I manage to get some buckets to catch the water; WALLY comes in with two briefcases looking quite mature; Much talk in the living room and after everyone has gone to bed, I go to the kitchen to clean up the mess, but do it without anger. Remember taking a piece of toffee out of the frig that I had bought in R.I. and tipping the plate so that the syrup can run out from under the pancakes.
