I am in my old red house (which I no longer live in.) It is up in a hill surrounded by a mote that has no water in it. In the dream many black cows are running around in circles around my house. I am trapped and just a bit scared. The cows have great horns and there are too many of them to cross over. I've not had this dream for a long time. The last time I had this dream, there were fewer cows.
