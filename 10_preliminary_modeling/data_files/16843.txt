I was preparing for a final show - perhaps like an end of year art show. I had to build a 3D model on a computer of the corner of space I was exhibiting in. My friend Terry came over looking very worried. He needed help ; he didn't know how to create the 3D model of his corner. Part of the preparations for this show seemed to involve the baking of cakes. There was an oven, and on top a stove, on which someone had left a couple of cakes slowly cooking in a very particular and unusual way. One of them was inside a waxed paper case which was sitting in hot or warm water which was filled up to the brim of the paper case. I accidentally knocked it and the water sloshed over the cake and all over the stove, putting out the gas and causing a mess. I was then driven by guilt to go and buy replacement ingredients for new cakes. I was going to try to cook them in the same way, so that it looked like nothing had been disturbed, but I realised it was gong to be impossible.
