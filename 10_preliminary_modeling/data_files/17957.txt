I was at my parents' house and my mother was distracting me with something.  I was supposed to go to the observatory and I realized it was already 10:30, the time I was supposed to report for work.  I was anxious and upset about being late, and it would be another 45 minutes at least to get up there.  There was some stop partway up the hill.  Something to do with packing.  I think my 5th/6th grade teacher Mr. Man was there.  I was upset that I didn't have the laptop with me, so I couldn't code, and I hadn't had a chance to get any sleep before coming up.  Someone had a bunch of logic puzzle books, and said I was one(?)  I got there and decided the fastest way to alert them was through the headset.  A few hours later they still hadn't started propagating, and I worried that maybe I'd forgotten to alert them that I was there, that maybe they were waiting for me.
