I woke up in my dream in a large mansion -- the building with a large vaulted ceiling. I walked around one room. It had a walkway around the room that led to what seemed to be a bedroom. Then out of the doorway behind me Angellina walked in. She was wearing a tight black long-sleeved top with tight black jeans and black knee-high boots. She came over to me and gave me a big hug and a sensual kiss. She took my hand and led me into another large room that looked like a study. There she pointed to a couch and I sat down on it, as she went over to the  "Wall of Sound" (a stereo) and turned on one of my self-made tapes. The music came on and she walked over behind and gave me a back massage. After a while she stopped and started to kiss my neck. Then she took my left hand and with a dagger slit it Just as she cut it, I woke up.
