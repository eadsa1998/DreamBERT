A woman friend and I are Hollywood stars. We are shopping and having fun. We meet these two men and they join us. It's a sort of outdoor mall. We try on different blouses and they try on shirts. The shirts are velvet and very soft to the touch. The man I'm with comes toward me and I stroke the large lacy collar of his shirt to feel the sensual softness of the shirt. My friend's man comes over in a more tailored version. I touch his shirt also. He and I are attracted to each other. He likes me to touch him. We walk on. My man and my friend wander off and her man (like the game host on Hollywood squares, Tom) and I sit and talk. We clearly are growing more affectionate and really like each other. There is hesitation because he is my friend's man. Suddenly it begins to rain grasshoppers. I don't like that and Tom and I duck into a corner of a store front. The other man ducks into another place nearby.  Tom is very efficient and helpful asking the proprietor of the store if we can come in. He says no. Tom goes in to get what we will need to be comfortable. A Mexican man comes up to me and asks if I want to buy a cover to put up to protect us. I say You will have to ask the gentleman. I really like that he is taking over and arranging everything for my comfort. Tom returns with several pairs of rubber boots, a bottle of something and something to eat. The Mexican man is putting up the cover which causes Tom and I to have to cuddle close together. We look at each other longingly. He adores me and I feel filled with love and sexual excitement. He tenderly kisses me. I love it. But I pull back, remembering he is my friend's man. He smiles gently at me and says, I won't do that again until I've talked with Carol and broken off with her. Carol is now with my man and they seem to be fine with each other. It won't be long now and Tom and I will be able to make wild passionate love. I look forward to it.
