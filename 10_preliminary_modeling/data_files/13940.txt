I was with the school at a cinema. You could make the seats higher. Some people went to a different room for a while. Eugene was in the second row behind me. We were going to watch The Dark Knight. I was on IMDb and it was number two now and I was like "Yay! It's not number one anymore!". It's rating was now a 9.4 and less people had given it a 10. I was extremely happy that people had come to their senses and given it a lower rating. [I checked its rating in the morning, and it had actually gone down].
