I was on a Mayfield streetcar, going to school. It was morning, but very dark and stormy. Actually it was dark as night. I suddenly realized I had forgotten a very important book and would have to turn around and go back; I got off the streetcar at the corner of Euclid Heights and Mayfield and waited for a bus. It was raining very hard, and I was afraid that it would not come. Luckily a bus came quickly, but it went down Euclid Heights Blvd. instead of turning on Mayfield. Another bus came behind it, however, and I got on. Then I had gotten off the bus and was back again and had the book under my arm. The bus came, and I got on. I felt relieved because I would be on time.
