I dreamed I was walking down the street when a boy, whom I recognized as a neighborhood grocery clerk, came up beside me; and without any warning, beat me up rather severely. I immediately went to the police station, but all the policemen were at the policemen's ball. I ran home, changed to a formal gown, and went to the ball. I tried to persuade the policemen to go with me and arrest the clerk but none would leave the ball with me.
