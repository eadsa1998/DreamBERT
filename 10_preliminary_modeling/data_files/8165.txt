I was in part of an armed forces battalion. We were entering this town on foot. We thought that the enemy was hiding and waiting for us so we were very cautiously entering this town. Trying to see if we could see the enemy hiding from us. It turned out that they weren't after all. We went all the way through the town. I don't know why we were there.
