Coming down from the roof of a hotel with new friends, and an acquaintance I didn't know very well and didn't much care for. Reminded me of that too-wired guy James Ginty. Creepy. Not very trustworthy. He wanted to take us to another party.  The city was dark. It was night time, but barely so. Either very early in the night, or very late. We were near the corner of two streets, my neighborhood. I didn't want to go off with this group of people. I was tired, and didn't want to deal with their idiotic drama.
