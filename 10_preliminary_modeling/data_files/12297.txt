Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were in this movie, except it wasn't. It was in a place on the other side of the country. There were animals and everyone was swerving for monkeys. She said it was the Desert and I was saying it didn't look like a desert. Her oldest child was called Jennifer, her second was called Scott, and her youngest who was also a girl was called Cheddar. Some guy was in a purple thing. His name was James and God called him Michael. It was then a different time, and he was a philosopher. Someone 'popped' him and he said he would smash everything so we undid it.
