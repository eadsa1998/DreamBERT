I also dreamt about my boyfriend, but this time we were not having an argument. We were at the movies and he was very loving, as usual. A very curious thing made an impression on me: the theater was completely filled and they were all children of approximately between 4 and 7 years of age, and the movie they were showing was a cartoon, so it's hard to understand what we were doing there. That was all I dreamt last night.
