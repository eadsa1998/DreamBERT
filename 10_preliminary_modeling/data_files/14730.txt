I was at Nana's. I was walking past the family room and I saw Marmaduke standing out the front. I went out there and some others had seen him too. We were then in a room and we were watching a movie or TV show and he was then sitting next to us, but only Poppa and I could see him. Fido came up to us. I told Ezra that it was all probably due to an "alternate reality".
