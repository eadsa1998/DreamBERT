We were in a small room standing on some bleachers for choir.  I don't remember what happened, it was sort of like we were taken hostage.  We were led out from the back room we were in to a sort of large warehouse.  We had to fight; these people were not just bad people, but the leader was Diablo.  We fought hard, but our hits did very little damage.  My last attempt before awakening was picking up a chair and driving a leg of the chair deep into the large black man's neck, holding it there until it crushed his throat, continuing to hold it there for as long as possible, waiting for him to die.
