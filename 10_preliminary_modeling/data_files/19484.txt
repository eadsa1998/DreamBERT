This episode takes place in our barn in my hometown. I entered barn to examine some rat traps (4 or 5) (spring traps) which were placed among a lot of loose wire, underneath a pig pen. The barn had been left unlocked and I rather expected the traps had been stolen. There was a large pig in the pen (evidently a sow), and from now on the rat traps fade far into the background. A trap door in the floor of the pig pen seemed to lead to a lower compartment where the rat traps were, and also where the sow's baby pigs were kept. Someone (probably Stone), asked if the pig (or any other animal below man) could comprehend spoken words, particularly "they are outside," but it was the consensus of opinion that the pig would only understand by hearing the squeals of its young. The old sow was grunting. I held a long, slender iron rod, slightly hooked at one end, whose purpose was to pry up the trap door without entering the pen. It seemed to me I should be able to detect the presence of any rats in the traps by the odor of their dead bodies. The floor in the pig pen was filthy -- covered with manure and dirty, wet straw; in this muck were 2 kinds of insects, a roach, and other kind which I at first thought might be a giant louse (pig louse). This latter insect was yellowish-brown in color, about 15 mm long, and moved about with considerable speed. It had large, claw-like front legs which were directed straight forward, and reminded me of the front legs of a cicada. The front legs seemed to "claw the air" when the insect was in motion. The pig, though unusually quiet, would doubtless attack any one venturing into the pen. It was on the right side of the pen, and lying down, Many of the hairs, especially those towards posterior end of body, bore blackish, oblong, bead-like growths that seemed in some way associated with the filth on the floor.
