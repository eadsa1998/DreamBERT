["Subaru breakfast."] I am in a house with Charla and Ellie. We are up early to cook a special breakfast to take to the J City school so we can enjoy it there. A special breakfast day at the school. I am frantically cooking. Cheese and meet tacos, omelets and some pastry treat. I also have a glass pot of very hot boiling water going. I see papers on the stove and try to move them from the burners. I push red buttons to see which burners can be turned down or off. The water is nearly over boiling. Finally we get the breakfast cooked and we rush outside with it, after choosing pretty glass plates to put it on so they will look delicious too. My "father's" new Subaru green van is out there and I decide to drive it, we get in and protect the drinks with a box so they won't spill on the way. I can't find the key. My "father" isn't home. I rush back in and ask Ellie where the key is. She finds it and we go back out. I have trouble opening the special double doors. I see two steering wheels, one a small one on the top right of the other regular one. I figure out how to turn it one and where the gas and brake pedals are. We lurch out the driveway. We are in a farm area. Suddenly I see there is no access to the highway., so I turn left toward E City on a dirt access road parallel to the highway, looking for some flat area I can get to the highway from. I see a woman has build a planked structure that might work but it looks flimsy. I ask her if she thinks it will hold our weight. She says sure. I gun across it and turn to get on the highway and see I'm blocked by parked cars. I keep driving until I finally find a way to the highway. Now I am speeding along, enjoying the power of this new vehicle.
