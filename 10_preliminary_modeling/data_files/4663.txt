Charla and I are in a play together. It's the life story of an important inventor. I roll on stage. 2 males are there. Charla comes in after me. I'd forgotten my lines and try to go back stage and get a script. I find one and rush back. I begin the narrative story of his life. I can't read the script so I struggle to remember the chronological order of events. I point to a picture of a sail boat and I say that's one of my favorite toys. But I did not like the power boat. Then I leave the stage to fly a short circle. Charla follows me. I get in a round thing and it goes up and around and down. I nearly crash it. I rush back to the stage. I comment there were many ways I could have crashed! Charla is rushing to catch up. I go on stage, wishing I'd waited for a moment for Charla to get into proper position. It would have been better for her if I'd waited. I felt selfish and unthoughtful.
