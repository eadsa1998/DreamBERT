Confusion and embarrassment because I cannot find a safety pin to pin the diaper as I change my baby. Talk with friends from camp (where we are in reality) about Frank and his sarcasm. I say to an acquaintance; "Keep a tear in your heart for me." I see Wallace in the distance, well dressed, driving our car into the garage.
