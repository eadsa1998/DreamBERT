I am clearing dishes from a place with dark bricks. And I walk in and out through a swinging door. Frank is reading on the inside. Father Andrew is on the outside and I hear him talking: I go to get some cups and plates and say: "I had been paying more attention to your sermon than to my dishes, of course," and laugh. Father Andrew helps me stack a few cups that were about to topple over and starts looking at the books; he points up to a book with his left hand, and holds my elbow with his right hand; I wake up as he touches my elbow!
