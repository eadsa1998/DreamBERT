 I'm at Carter School, where I went to grade school. I go to the front door. It is locked. I forgot something inside the school. My high school classmate Nancy Meyer and someone else come down the stairs and turn down another hallway, but they don't open the door for me. The door is then unlocked by itself. I go in. I see my classmate Persia Miko. She sees that I got a 96 on a test. She says I did ____ (I forget). My friend Esther Thurman comes out of the Billie's Daycare bathroom down the hall. I didn't know she was there. I'm in a calculus class that is on the 2nd floor of the building. A teacher I know from middle school, Mr. Thompson, is the teacher. He is a jerk. I know I'm going to do poor on the test. I'm not following along with the homework, and I really don't care about it. My high school classmate Connie Rodes is there. She is doing well in calculus. She shows me at the beginning of the chapter where the author of our textbook writes that the pace of the work can change for the student: some can go quicker and others slower.
