I decide to take a nap in a pickup truck cab, with the door open. I am on the passenger side and laying on my tummy, facing the back of the cab, my left leg hanging out the open door. Some woman is with me. I look up and see that we are moving and I recognize we are in M City. Somehow while I was napping, we drove to M City. I sit up, now in the driver's seat and try to hit the brakes; they do not respond well. I steer us into a left turn, as if toward the M City house. I get out. I see Aunt Elaine and Suzanne as a child. I don't want to greet Aunt Elaine at first, but she sees me and invites me into her apartment. I go in and look around. It looks nice. I notice the padded upholstery walls and say, "My mother told me about that." I quip, "Just right for the mad house. You can bounce off the walls." She shows me the kitchen. I ask how Uncle Lionel is. I see him coming in. She says, "He's not doing well." I look. His cancer is getting very bad. She is fixing his medicine in the kitchen, saying she wished she could give him a really big dose so he would die. This was a loving and humane thought. She goes out to the living room and I pick up the plastic dose cup which is quite large and taste the medicine, which is the color and consistency of honey. I realize I'm tasting lethal stuff and spit it out, spitting many times to get it out of my mouth. I hope I didn't take in enough to kill me or make me ill. I go into the living room.
