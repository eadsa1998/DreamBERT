Aliens were invading the earth.  I had run outside with others in the hopes that it would be safer than inside, but then strange things started falling from the air, from small fragments to bubble enclosures like the Mars landing vehicles.  We had to look at the skies and try to avoid coming in contact with anything which fell.  Martha Tuttle was in this dream.  She was going to go up in a glider for some reason-whether to counterattack or to try to escape, I'm not sure.  My wife Anita gave me some newspapers and trash to put in a trash room.  I had to go in several times, and every time I did I felt creepy; it was silent, and I felt like I was watching myself in a scary movie, right before something happens.  The last time I went in, with some loose newspapers, I saw a shadowy figure behind the window on the wall of the storage room opposite the door.  I woke up moaning loudly.
