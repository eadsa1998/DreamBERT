A strong, powerful man and woman want me to fly with them. I want to fly with Abner. I feel overwhelmed by them and I pretend that I agree with them. We are ready to fly now and I've been very passive, but suddenly I switch and move over to Abner. This angers the other two. They chase me. Abner and I flee, flying. We know we're not as fast or as strong, so we hide and become invisible. We fly into an upstairs attic window (like a hay loft opening) and hide there. Our strategy is to count on their strength and speed to move them beyond us as we hide.
