I am on a bus and look up into the sky. I see a white, streaky cloud like vapor trails of an airplane. It is sweeping around in a circle like a sonar screen would. I realize then that I have stumbled on a secret information and the Russian spies are going to be after me. I pretend I don't know anything about it and look around. I see my father and someone on a bench. I start walking toward a building that has display squares all over its front. I see cats sitting and standing in the squares, only their backs are to me. I think that's a little rude and embarrassing (all those asses). I continue walking and come full circle back to the bench. Trouble: the spies have replaced my father and are seated on the bench.
