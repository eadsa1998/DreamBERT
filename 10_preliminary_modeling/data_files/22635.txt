Then I dreamt that a gentleman, who I believe is dead, had appeared on the block where I live. But even though he was dead, he walked slowly, with a dog which he held by a chain. I knew that the gentleman was dead (I didn't now him in real life nor in the dream) because his head was almost like a skull, but he was dressed. It seemed that the little dog he was pulling was suffering a great deal, and the ragamuffins were trying to unleash the dog in a way that the old man would not see, because he did not want them to let the dog go. Then I, who love dogs, went close to them and very carefully unleashed the dog without letting the old man realize it, since he could not see. At that instant the old man started to scream and to throw curses on us, and then he disappeared. We did not know what to do with the dog, so we went to all the houses in the block looking for a place for him to stay until finally he stayed at my house with the two dogs I already have. I awoke.
