Frank is to meet me at a public gathering. He is with other people and I am sitting with Isaac and Karina Palmer (friends). Frank waves at me perfunctorily; he doesn't even have the decency to walk over to say "hello" let alone wish me a Happy Birthday.... Others get red roses, and Isaac offers to send me red roses, but I say No thank you....
