 I have a job at Arby's restaurant. I am a peon, doing grunt work. I pour corn and a berry fruit mixture from a boiling kettle to a smaller container. I wear an apron so it won't splash on me. I use several hot pads so I don't get burned. The owner and an assistant manager stand near me. We pour the pot of food. We move bags, newspapers, and sleeping bags from near the bottom of the staircase. I ask about time cards. There is no need to punch in, the assistant manager says, because hours are written by hand. It is a mindless job. At the beginning I find myself going into the building and getting the job, being very assertive and aggressive. I guess they must have hired me because I find myself working there.
