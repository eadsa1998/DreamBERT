I was at home. I was with Farrah and Ezra had Roland over. Dad was home. Every time we went into my room something was different and it was spooky. There was a piece of paper (like paper from a magazine) which was an application for a concert. It said "Michael Cain" and I figured it meant Michael Caine and said it was spelt wrong. One of the times I went into my room there was a new sheet on my bed but when I tried to show someone it was gone. The bed was in the middle of the room, coming out from the wall. Stuff moved around, like the lights etc. I was at the window and Farrah was doing something that I can't read but says that she slowed down for something. Also, Farrah was sometimes Tara from True Blood. Another time she found an old notebook of mine and it had the original copy of the magazine application and we showed Dad. Then I went to Brookland High to do something before going to university. It was a Friday by the way. I went to a room at the back of the school, where the psychologist was, who was a lady but was sometimes a guy. While I was waiting I was talking about a dream I'd had. She asked if it any religious stuff and I said no and told her to not mention religion. A while later I checked the time and it was 11.30 and I was like 'flip, I missed it' and text Mom to get me. Then the psych was a guy. His mates came and he said 'another [something] dream'. I saw Mom's car and took off. She yelled at me for not telling her sooner. Ezra and Roland were in the back. Then it was just me and Mom. We heard a siren and it meant there was a storm coming. There were clouds in the sky but were far away.
