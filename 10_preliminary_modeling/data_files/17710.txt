My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in a bedroom.  I had my shirt off, with a towel wrapped around me, as I lay on the bed.  Jeremy recognized someone he knew on the bus, and the two guys came in.  One made some comment about my cleavage.  I was trying to figure out who these guys were but nobody would tell me at first.  Finally it came out.  Joel 'Fontian' and his supposed old friend Lyle, classmates from first grade.  I still couldn't figure out how Jeremy knew them.  I was surprised how different Joel was.  He didn't have glasses anymore, and his hair was buzzed.  He talked at a more normal pace than the slow slurred way he used to.  We talked about people we used to know, including our classmate Gabe and Cecil Burns.
