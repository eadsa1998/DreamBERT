Woody Allen is in Boston at the bar "Cheers" featured on the television show of the same name. I am standing at the bar counter with a group of people who are admiring Mr. Allen from a distance, but who are unable to muster the courage to go up to talk to him. "I'll do it", I say and I walk up to the table where Mr. Allen is seated. I say hello and tell him that I am a great admirer of his. He looks at me blankly as he signs an autograph on a napkin. After that there is a brief pause in the conversation during which I feel upset that our encounter has been merely a shallow exchange of pleasantries.  I decide to elevate the intellectual level of the conversation and find out more about the views and opinions of Woody Allen. "What do you think about Ross Perot?", I ask, referring to the undeclared Presidential candidate. Woody Allen's eyes widen with interest when the question is asked, as if he is finding more in me than expected. I await an answer, but I can not recall any more of the dream after this point.
