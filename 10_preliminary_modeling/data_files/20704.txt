I was going to take a bus, but on the way, I recalled something I had forgotten to take. I started back. Later I was looking for the place where it was located. I had to avoid a certain building, because it was part of County Hospital. Then a little later my mother was with me in a house. As she went out the door, she told me to meet her at Macy's. The tone of her voice seemed to say she wished she could change my ways, but did not think she could.
