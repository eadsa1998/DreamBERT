Several people I knew, including Raul Sendler, Dick Trumpett, and Bonitawere with me in a barn or tall silo.  Everyone was leaving but me, and it was my turn to "guard the tower" (the loft) for the night.  Raul was sort of in overall charge and told me what had to be done.  The "tower" was high overhead, and you got to it via a ladder.  I felt it would be really creepy having to climb up there and look around after everyone had gone.  Raul checked it once, but there had been some group singing right before everyone departed, and there was some stupid regulation that the tower had to be checked after anyone had sung or spoken-even though everyone was right around the foot of the ladder.  The "barn" began to look more like the narthex of a tiny cathedral.  It must have been after checking the tower (I don't remember actually doing it) that I was descending the side of a building.  I don't remember much except coming down the sheer side groping for fingerholds and footholds in the brick and stone construction.  It was very difficult to maintain such holds, and I was progressively petrified with fear of falling.  At one point I considered jumping away from the building and falling the rest of the way, but I didn't know how much farther it was to the ground or what the terrain might be like there.
