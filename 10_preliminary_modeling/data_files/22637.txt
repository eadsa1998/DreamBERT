I remember that I was in front of several elevators waiting for one to stop in front of me. In the meantime I was observing the little lights which indicate on what floor the cars are. However, all of them went from one end to the other without stopping at my floor. I was not impatient or upset; I only observed this like a strange thing. It wasn't a very deep dream because then I remembered that in the morning something similar had happened to me: when the elevator doors opened, they told me to go in the direction opposite the one I wanted to go. I placed the dream in the same place (a department store). All the people that might have been there did not affect me. It was just a group.
