Last night I had a rather curious dream. I was walking downtown with my mother and we were around a square when we saw a gentleman who turned around and laughed with some girls. When we passed him by, I imitated his laughter, making fun of it, and my mother and I got away laughing. Everything caused us to laugh. The man I had imitated was following us everywhere and that made us laugh, it was like openly flirting with him. The man was approximately 28 or 30 years old. Then we got to a street where there was a small neighborhood bookstore, which in my dream was the administration office at the university. The exams of the History of Culture were there, tied as though they were a bundle of newspapers. I seized the occasion to ask for mine. I had to search through the bundle to find mine, and in order to do that I had to pull out the ones on top and place them on the side. When I found mine, the other exams had been already given out, according to me, because there were only a few left. When I saw my grade, I didn't laugh anymore because I had flunked, I had gotten 40. Then I told my mother, "They flunked me, I could never raise that grade. This happens to me because of having laughed so much." In real life, I have always had the notion that when I laugh a lot, I will then cry; something will happen to make me cry.  I always think about this when I laugh too much. Now, about dreaming of flunking, this always happens. Whenever they are going to hand me a grade, I dream about that test, I see a grading notebook or some such document, and I always dream that I flunk. Then, when I see my grade it's a passing one. In this instance, this has happened too. I've come out alright, I've passed the test.
