I am parking my car on 18th St., headed north. The road is dirt, and slightly mucky. On first attempt I get car too close to curb. Then maneuver it by pushing but get it too far from curb. Try a third time, also..... no more then done when a black woman walks up and unlocks the car standing just ahead of mine. When door is opened this car is seen to be crammed with a great variety of articles. Next I gather several pieces of a fence rail, and begin breaking them into smaller pieces with which to build a fire. Apparently intend to cool or warm something (?weenies).
