I was on the side of a road. I'd made a bet or something that I could hitchhike. I was wearing skimpy clothes to help get picked up. Rebekah was there and she was a hitchhiker/prostitute. I said "she may be expensive, but I'm [something I don't remember]" and we laughed but she said "you know what I do every night?!" and she did some stupid thing because her mother had died or something. Then I was walking down another road. It was a long straight road, and I walked past a road to the left (like a T-junction) and a cop was parked on the side of the road. The road was now sandy and bumpy and this person was driving waiting to be out of sight of the police before picking me up. The cop came and ended up crashing. Then it was Freaks and Geeks and this had been a test. It showed one of the main female characters having sex with someone and then all the secondary characters were masturbating each other. I was like "ok...". Then Mom took me home. It was late, I think. Darren was in the car. I had to transfer some stuff I had downloaded. When I came back to Mom's, they were on porn sites. I was then watching Lost, but Laguerta (Dexter) was on it and she couldn't remember anything she did after getting in her car the night before. Then Ben and Juliet (both from Lost) were talking. I thought they were going to kiss and I was thinking 'ew, Ben's too cool for her'. Then Juliet was with some other guy. Laguerta remembered had seen the dude and had either had an affair with him, or had found out about one.
