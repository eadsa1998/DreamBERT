The streets were rainy, the gardens were wet, the scene was filled with coldness and loneliness. I walked through the empty streets with my hands in my pockets, when suddenly I heard screeching brakes and the car wasn't able to stop and it noisily crashed into the pavement. It was an accident. Later I saw the corpses spread all over and I was amazed and started to meditate about what had happened.
