I was going to supervise a preschool sleep-over and my friend was going to come later in the day. I was there and this girl my age said that I needed a haircut. I said it's okay as long as you don't cut it too short. she cut my hair up to the middle of my ears in front, and left it long in back. Then she told me to braid the long strands and flip them over so they are in my face. It looked awful and I couldn't even do it right! Setting: At something similar to my brother's preschool. Characters: My friend, her mom, teachers, unidentifiable kids (except my brother), the girl my age, my parents, me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, awkward. I think it had something to do with what my dad said, "A new hairstyle would look nice on you." It seemed so real, I'm glad it's just a dream!
