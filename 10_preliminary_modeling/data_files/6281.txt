I was in a nursing home or a hospital, I was not quite sure. There were large, white rooms with curtains of the same color, and there were standard medical beds. I saw elderly patients eating food, such as bread and sandwiches. There was a supervisor that entered the room. He was dressed in standard doctor's apparel. He had curly, dark, reddish hair and had glasses. He was insulting the patients, and mocking them, and poking fun at them. He claimed they smelled, that they had bad breath and poked fun at the way they ate. He then turned and looked straight into my direction and started insulting me. He pointed out to the other supervisors that I ate funny. I realized I was a patient there. Then the dream ended.
