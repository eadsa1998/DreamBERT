["Coughing fit."] I am in a school of some kind walking the halls. I begin to have my coughing spasms and reach out to people gesturing I need to drink water. No one helps me, even though they are the support staff for disabled students. I cough and cough, feeling angry and frustrated. No one seems to understand what I need. I get to a sink and open a straw and try to suck the water from the faucet. I managed to get the coughing under control myself, but it took a great deal of effort.
