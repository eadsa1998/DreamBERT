I was in England. I was with Mom and we kept turning up at this material factory, which was in France or something and the guy there tried to shoot us. Also, at this shop they had all this Monty Python and Fawlty Towers stuff and Monty Python movies -- like Alien 3D. Then Granma and this person who had a really fat kid were around too. Fat kid went to lie down on a trampoline and Mom got Granma and fatty to go. I got lost from Mom and ended up in France. I asked this bloke, who looked like Teacher-M-05 and he spoke English, to help me, and he said he would. After a while I found Mom and I got rid of him but on our journey I had gone to Mom's car. When we got to the car he tried to take it but then I did these hell cool moves and he got hurt and we left. And this girl and I opened up a shop with these weird things and everyone was buying them.
