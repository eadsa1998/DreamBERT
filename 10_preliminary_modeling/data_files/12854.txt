I was with Mom somewhere and she randomly said "I thought everyone thought that Eugene was hot" and I almost spat out my drink. She had gone to a shop six hours away. Scarlett was there and she said that she "can't look him in the face because he is so ugly". Mom suggested that I call his mother and thank her. I said that everyone thought that Darius was hot and she said something about me being different and I said that both were yuck. Then I was at home and Mom was going through my laptop and stuff. Dad did as well. Mom said that I had said that I wanted to go the ball "for an instant". I said "No, I didn't". Dad and I were late to go to the Little Britain thing. Silas called me and read off some joke about a woman wanting her boobs to grow. Ezra was in the car. Then, Dad and I were going to Little Britain, which was actually a second show. Silas and Seamus were going, but sometimes it was both of them, sometimes it was only one of them. Silas had seat I9 and we had I11 and I12. He came and sat next to us. David Walliams was on the stage and was walking on a tightrope which was over a pool of water with a 'shark' in it. He was wearing board shorts with a shark on them. Silas was pretending to swim. They played a video on a cinema looking screen with Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall and they were cops. It started off gay and David was reading a really boring news report. Then he said "Why isn't anyone laughing?" then "Well there is this shit!" and it turned into Little Britain. David Walliams was walking past and Silas leaned over me to see. There was a blackout and Seamus, Silas, David Walliams and I lost our memories. This lady was pretending to be Seamus's girlfriend and she was from Delaware. I recognized the people I knew and I knew she was a fake. I was later talking to David behind the seats, but he kept turning into Michael Rosenbaum. Seamus and Silas later joined us. Someone called me a virgin and Dad said "She better be!".
