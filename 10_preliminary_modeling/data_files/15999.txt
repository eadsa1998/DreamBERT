I was watching the Big Brother final. Laura looked old and fat and had grey streaks in her hair. When I saw Andy walking down I called out 'Andy!' and he stopped and smiled and I gave him a hug and said he was my favourite or something. As a joke, someone listed these two Asian kids as adopted children for Alex. They were like 4 or something. Then there was a joke/prediction thing where Alex and I were married in the future and Mom was like 'yeah like you'd believe he'd be with her' and I was like 'I don't think he's anything special anyway' but then we did end up together and we still had the kids and we were getting them out of the car to take them somewhere.
