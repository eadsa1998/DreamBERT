I was in a large department store, at a counter, making a purchase. When I looked up there was Mr. B_____. He said, "I thought that was you, but you looked so different in civilian clothes." He looked about the same, however, and had a five o'clock shadow. He said that his wife and three children were upstairs and wanted me to go up and meet them. I followed him through the store, up elevators and escalators and around corners. He found the baby carriage but his wife and children had disappeared. Then we saw them coming down the aisle with 3 small perfume bottles that had been broken. The tops were off that was all. I went back to the perfume counter to see if I could obtain new tops for them. The salesgirl could not give me new tops but she gave me one new bottle of perfume for the 3 broken, older bottles.
