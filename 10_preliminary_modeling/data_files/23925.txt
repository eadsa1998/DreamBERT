I kept waking up last night because I was dreaming something about having the people I babysit for in a canoe. They wouldn't leave or actually I wasn't allowed to leave babysitting - we were canoeing. I would wake up and see the time on the clock - 2:30, 3:30, 4:30 and think "shit - I know I don't have to stay this late - I have to go to bed." but still I felt as though I couldn't leave. I was sort of pissed because I wanted to sleep and not babysit. The dream: Something about babysitting a baby. The parents gave me directions to just leave the kid down by the river and just check on it every once and awhile. Something about feeding the baby chili.
