I was walking by Dendy's House of Barbeque on Sitgreaves St. There had been a bad fight there the night before. When the fight broke out ???. To use as a weapon, someone had broken off the trophy from a plaque belonging to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I didn't think they had to go so far as to ruin his trophy. I was working for David Salle and he was married to a working class woman who'd made it big. She highlighted her hair. There was a 'Lose Weight Camp' for fat boys. To lose weight they would go down a huge waterslide standing up. Every once in a while someone would fall and I knew bones would be broken eventually. I was working for Bryan Hunt and he said (that) now he worked where he lived, but I never saw him around there. He painted a lady and I didn't think it was so good. I was staring at it a long time when I saw her thumb move over and over. Then I understood. He had a little gold object on the shelf. I stared at it. He had a barbeque grill on the floor in front of an old (oil) painting, trying to dry it quicker. I found a long sleeve, faded, white, men's (dress) shirt on the floor. I had spilled water all over it by mistake. It (the shirt) said Yves St. Laurent No. 38 Potion. It was perfume. I was trying to go in the door.
