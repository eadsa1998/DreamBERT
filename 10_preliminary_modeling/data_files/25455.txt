 Two people are strapped in a metal rowboat that is a lifeboat on a huge metal ship. There is a man in the water somehow connected to the boat that is fishing with a huge funny looking rod. The man hooks a fish. The boat moves forward so the fisherman's line won't break as the fish runs. Godzilla, Kirby Puckett, and Wilhelm Wundt are enormous monster-like creatures. Wundt is left at the bottom of the lake, which is then dry after the large metal boat crashes into the shore. Debris covers the lake bottom, and Wundt is at one end. Kirby Puckett and Godzilla fight. Puckett throws Godzilla into a dam, and the dam starts to leak. Godzilla is embedded in the concrete of the dam. There are dead things on the lake bottom.
