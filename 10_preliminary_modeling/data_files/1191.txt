I had my yarn shop again. I was disappointed. I moved it from my living room to a shop. It was in disorder. A woman came to the shop looking for a bulky yarn. I didn't have the right size. It was pink, dusty pink. I wanted to make the sale because I didn't want my shop to fail again. I suggested that she buy a double amount and double the yarn but in the same breath said, "No, because it would be too costly for you."
