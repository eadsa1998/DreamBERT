Real life: My friends and I just bought an eight-track recorder so that the band I'm in could record some songs. Dream: I get home from school one day and these two kids, kids that I know I've seen at Suffolk but don't really know or talk to, are down in my basement. They are playing with the new eight-track recorder. I was worried that they were going to break it. I went upstairs for something and when I came downstairs one of these kids told me he had to use my bathroom. For some reason all the lights were out and my basement seemed distorted. When we finally found the bathroom after some difficulty, I went into the bathroom and, this is disgusting, but I vomited through my nose. Then the dream ended.
