I and some other family members were at BJ's house, though it looked different than it does in waking life. I was in the house with some of the others and was looking out the window. BJ was in her car. It was a very old, large, red car. She was going somewhere. I noticed parts falling off from under the body of the car. I was thinking how dangerous the car is and said this to someone. I went outside and she had gotten out of the car and came back to the house. I said something to her about needing to replace the car and she agreed. Bill F was standing there. Now it seems that the car belonged to Bill F. We started talking about him donating the car. We went back into the house. Now the car was a flowering plant. It was in a very large, round planter. I was thinking that it was odd that as much as I like flowers and plants I didn't especially care for this one. I was studying it and began to think that I could really learn to appreciate and enjoy it. As I was doing this Bill F had a hand spade and was digging up the plant. It seemed to be several separate plants in the one planter. He was digging them up and separating out the individual plants. Someone asked the name of it. They said it was some kind of orchid. It didn't look like an orchid does in waking life. I can't remember the name now but at the time I thought it was such a beautiful name and it gave me a new appreciation of it. It's as though it changed how I felt about something else - feeling more joy. It was covered with small pink flowers with white and yellow on the inner part of each flower. Each flower had about four petals.
