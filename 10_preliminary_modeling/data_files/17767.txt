I was temping at the financial company again.  I was outside getting ready, trying to find my socks to put them on.  My mother was there.  It was dark.  There was purple lightning.  I went into the office and I was sent the next door down to a 'vault' where I was checking revisions.  I went back to the office for something and I realized I'd lost the paper I was working with.  I searched everywhere for it and felt horrible for losing it.
