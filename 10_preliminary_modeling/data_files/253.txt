I'm in a smallish, slightly crowded room - I think it's a living room, don't know whose. I'm with 2 others, an old woman and a girl younger than me. The room has lamps on, it must be night - the drapes are closed. We're engaged in some project, I can't say it's actually LT processing, but before we can get rolling, the old woman gets very deep into grief for her late husband. He was in the Navy, or went to sea for some reason, and was lost at sea. She hasn't cried about it in a long time. Actually she has trouble showing her feelings, and it's difficult for her to really let go and just cry. She reminds me of Nina from Park Forest, and also Martha, who covers everything up with a joke or a "pleasant" attitude - always be polite, never offend anybody, or disturb them. We're encouraging her, though this isn't what we planned to do, and of course she's letting her trained behavior override her feelings mostly - she keeps apologizing and getting out of her body. I have her bend over from the waist and I'm rubbing the small of her back to help her release. I don't feel any special warmth toward her, I just want her to get on with her work. I don't like people behaving this way.
