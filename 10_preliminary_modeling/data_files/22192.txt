That day we were still at camp, but this time we had been looking for another site. The place was not very appropriate because it was not a green area, but was covered with sand, a rather disagreeable place and not very clean. The arrangement in the tents was the same as the night before, two per tent. I dreamed that I was telling my impressions about the trip to a group of friends. I felt very happy and I was monopolizing the whole conversation. The meeting was at the same time some sort of music festival, which made the atmosphere more pleasant and more dynamic. We were in an atmosphere of camaraderie, where everyone wanted to participate. They were making a lot of jokes about my climbing expedition. All sorts of music was being played at this meeting. And it lasted for several hours until the musicians and artists started to retire. Only a group of us remained to talk, until we all fell asleep around a table. That was all.
