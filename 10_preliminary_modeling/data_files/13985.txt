Dad and I were in a car discussing a movie. I was telling him I interpreted some of the stuff and he was amazed at the interpretations I had made. I had been invited to some house. It was night. When we got there though, Dad wasn't there and this other guy turned up. He was saying to me to pretend it was a horror movie and we were discussing the things not to do, so you don't get killed. There was a long empty patch of land next door, which looked quite creepy. He pointed to it as an example of not leaving the group and doing things alone and I said "and don't have sex". We joined the others at the back of the house. There was a chubby girl, who was the leader of it, and she said we weren't allowed turn our backs (so we had to look at someone) or we would be killed. This wasn't her fault though. The guy and I managed to look next door and all these people were dead on the ground and were a green colour. Everyone who had played this game had died. We realized that everyone died the same way and that there was a killer involved. We decided to leave before the killer came and so we jumped over the fence we had come in through. As we did, this taxi drove off. We walked instead and found these bridges, which were Asian like and they ended up getting really thin. It was also daytime now. There was one obstacle thing and Ezra was there and we needed to cross these bridges while singing David Bowie songs, and Ezra didn't know any. A long time later, the guy I with or someone else and I went back to the house and the police were there. There was a lady who made me write a note for some guy and I signed it "Love [as a loveheart] Jacob". Jacob was a werewolf. Dean and Sam (both Supernatural) were there.
