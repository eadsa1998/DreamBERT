Working like mad. I need to finish a story. It's about a pretty twisted guy involved in voodoo or something like that who was caught, and I have exclusive material. It can be an amazing story. Though my deadline is coming up, and I didn't have nearly enough already written. The nut graf. I can never get the nut graf in time. But when I do, it's so easy. I had just minutes to go. And the story was all in pieces. My editor, was starting to call. I didn't want to check my e-mail. I knew questions would be stacking up. Javier, a co-worker, came over and offered me some advice. It was good I took it. He's a good guy.
