There was this resort in some country, which I had stayed at before with someone to lower costs on accommodation, and then later Nana and Poppa had moved in to an apartment there. It was a fairly obscure resort so it was weird. I was staying there again with some friends and told them this story. There was a sign in the bedroom saying 'this is the lucky room, if you present this card you get 50% off', but then it said it had to be handed in before the 30 June or something. We left at night and went to this creepy public bathroom. I went with my female friend and we closed the main door, but it had a big open area at the bottom of the door and I kept staring at it, expecting someone bad to come along. It was very quiet outside too, adding to the creepiness.
