I am working in the University Extension Division: very unstructured like at the Retreat Center. People come and go, eat and dance. Wendy is there too, wearing a Grecian robe. She talks and dances with her friends and carries her art in a basket. Frank is there also, telling jokes. We all sit on a big bed, talk, sing and tell jokes. I wonder when I will start work.
