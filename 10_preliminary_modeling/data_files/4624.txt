["Going to school again? Why?"] I live with my parents. I am downtown "M City." I have decided to take a college class of math at B City College. I need to take a test at Voc. Rehab which is at the post office. I have to get into a crate area that is the elevator. I crawl over the rail to get into the barred area as it is moving. I see Betty Cat is with me and I hold her as she snuggles. I must remember to tell my mother she's wandering off clear downtown now. I get to the basement. A man is there working and pays no attention to me. I call out to him that I want to take the 7 hour test. I need to take for that class. Even as I say this, I am wondering why I am doing this. I remember signing up to do high school again and then didn't go to classes for that. The man tells me I can do the test on Tuesday or Thursday from noon to 5:30pm. I sigh, and decide to do it now, as it is Tuesday. I don'' want to do this, but I'' doing it anyway. I hold my cat and cuddle her.
