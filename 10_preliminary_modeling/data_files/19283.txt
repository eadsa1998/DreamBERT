I went to the library and I saw my friend Dave with another girl. They were just leaving. I thought Dave was mad at me, but he wasn't. We went back inside the library. I felt like I was annoying him. I was jealous of the other girl. They were both older than me and I felt like just a little kid to them. The other girl was very nice, but I didn't really like her. They left.
