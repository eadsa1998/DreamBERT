There was a remake or something of Fantastic Four, but it was different. Zachary Quinto and Eric Bana were in it. Everyone in it were like people in Heroes. Eric Bana was like an alien and was green, slimy etc. Now Zachary's character looked like that. There was a scene where Eric Bana got on top of him and had sex with him. There was a flashback of Zachary in a car and was talking 'gay' like and said that he loved Eric Bana's character (who was outside the car and was normal). I think it says Eric was taking his farm. This girl outside was upset because she liked Zachary.
