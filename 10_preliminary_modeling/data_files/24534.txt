I'm in a medical office in an old building in Europe. The light is soft, not glaring, like in a US. There's no one present.  For a time I look at delicate small plants in a display case which are for sale. They are too expensive for me. This place is also where Erin, my former girlfriend, seems to live. I look for her, and find her brothers or people who know her, but they don't know where she is. I wander around the office rooms. Then I levitate, and float slowly from one room to the next. I want to meet doctors and show them this can be done. I'm floating in a doctor's living quarters. It's exciting, the thought of him or her returning without seeing me. I will see them undress. I hear clothing being unzipped. I wake up.
