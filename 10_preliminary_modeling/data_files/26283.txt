 I'm in a snowy field area. Two people are with me. We're in a semi truck, and we disconnect the back of the truck to make it up a steep snowy hill. There is a huge snowplow and even bigger trucks than what we're in. The plow is scraping snow and corn off the top of a field. There seems to be something wrong with what they are doing.
