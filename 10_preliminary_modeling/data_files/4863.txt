["Oil painting."] I am painting with oil paint the interior of kitchen cupboards. I have the color purple in a large bucket and dip my artist small brush in there. The consistence of the paint changes from thick and lumpy to smooth but I have to repeatedly brush it out on the cupboard wood. I also notice the colors keep changing. The purple becomes whitish and then greenish. I realize I had not properly mixed the paints. I am being incompetent about this. I keep at it until it now looks very nice.
