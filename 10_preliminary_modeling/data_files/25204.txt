 I'm at Wilmerton University. I'm with my friend Stephen and two other guys. We are playing soccer in an office building. The goal is to get the ball in the elevator. It's three-on-one. I'm on the team of three. The game goes between floors as the elevator moves up and down. The game has now changed. I grab the ball and run down the hall to get away from people who are looking for me. My friend Ivory Alshire runs and tells me to go this way, pointing. I say to her, "Fuck you." I am trying to find stairs to go down. I am over by the river adjacent the school. There is something going on to do with camp. I am hiding from people. I don't want them to see me.
