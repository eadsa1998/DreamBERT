I was carrying my three year old niece in my arms in a department store. The store seemed to be a woods part of the time. I stopped to look at a velvet cardboard with several diamond rings sticking in it. (like in jewelry stores) No one was around and I was tempted to steal one. I didn't though. I carried my niece up the stairs in the department store and when we got fairly high up I got dizzy on the stairs. I was afraid I would fall.
