["Dancing lessons, kittens and jewelry."] I am in a building. Some man is giving me dancing lessons. He belongs to a group of people who learn dances, like a Toastmaster's group. He shows me the steps. Toe first, heel second on right foot and the reverse on the left foot. I follow along. Then he holds me close to guide me in the dance. I catch on after some mistakes. I enjoy dancing close. Now Ginny is there and she and I are walking up some stairs. Kittens are kept there. It's like a animal shelter for stray kittens. There are many of them. I pet them and play with them. Some are brown tiger striped kitties. One is white and black spots. I put that one in a paper bag to take home. It is cute. I peek in to see if it's OK. I am worried they will be neglected. Now I find some jewelry of mine I haven't seen for a long time. Beaded necklaces, and so on. I wrap the necklaces around my finger and make a big ring out of it. I enjoy seeing the jewelry again. Maybe I should wear them more often. The dancing man watches.
