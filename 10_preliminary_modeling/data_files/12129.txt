I was at a theme park? Dad, Ezra and I went to see a show and the line was short but it then got busy. Then we were going to leave because another show was starting. I didn't go. I saw this girl who started talking about fish. There was a pond with a little thing in the middle with a monkey and a kangaroo. I fell in. We were then at a show and Jayson was with us. The show was cool. The Hitler guy from Dracula's was in it. I had a shower and then I found out that a taxi was going to pick us up to go to a restaurant. I didn't want to go because my hair was messy. I tried to straighten it, but it was wet.
