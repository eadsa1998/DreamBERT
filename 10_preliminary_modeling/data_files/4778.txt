["Mask."] I am creating a very elaborate and beautiful mask or head and face dress from pieces of jewelry and cloth. It has lace, necklaces, and so on . At one point the part over the face looks like a fox or cat skin face. I now take it off to put away for the night to be worn the next day. It is hard to take off and keep all the pieces together as they are supposed to be reassembled the same way the next day. A woman helps me take the head dress off. I place it on a sign on the sidewalk, I then worry that someone will come along and steal the parts of it. I call security and ask them to come by frequently to keep an eye on the stuff.
