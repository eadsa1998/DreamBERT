Today I had a horrible dream: I was at the beach with my aunt, my youngest sister and my cousin's baby. All of a sudden some giant waves came and covered us and the baby went under and we pulled him out at times, and then he went under again and all of us screamed because we couldn't save him. But the sea was pulling us and I cried very much. Luckily my cousin, who sleeps with me, awoke me.
