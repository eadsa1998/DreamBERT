[Slight fever; took brandy and sleeping pill from Dr. Matting] Looking at 2 houses, both exactly alike except for age and condition -- the one to the left being unpainted, sagging, and apparently unoccupied; the other well painted, in fine condition throughout, and occupied. The left end of house was lower than right, the latter of 3 stories and distinguished chiefly by the numerous and large windows which took up nearly the entire wall. The double chimney was on lower (left) end. The second and third floors each had 4 bedrooms, or 3 bedrooms and a library. The flooring of the library on the upper floors was designed to eliminate running up and down stairs at night, after one had crawled into bed and started the nightly session at reading.
