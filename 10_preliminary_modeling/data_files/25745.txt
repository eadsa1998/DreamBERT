 I walk up to my house. My classmate Carmen Allure, her sister Harmony, and their mother are sitting on my front steps. Harmony has short hair, which doesn't look as attractive to me. I talk to Carmen. She starts crying because her mother did something for her that she didn't want her to do, like apply to school.
