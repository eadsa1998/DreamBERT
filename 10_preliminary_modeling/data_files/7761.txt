I was lying in bed, naked, but covered with a blanket and sheet. Marshall E came in. I was surprised but happy to see him. I made sure I was totally covered. He sat down on the floor with his back leaning against the bed. A woman named Kate, someone from TV, came in, sat on the floor, and interacted with him. I could tell there was a romantic connection. I thought Oh no, he's not with her. I think it was part jealousy and part thinking that he could do better. The next thing I know he is standing and telling me how much he has missed me, how he still cares for me, and that he has never found anyone to compare. I was acting very coy and thinking that I was flattered, but unsure if I wanted to encourage him to try again.
