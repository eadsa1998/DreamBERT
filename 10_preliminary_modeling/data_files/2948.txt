Somehow I am helping get Jared's car fixed by a grumpy neighbor, brake shoes and other stuff, and I get the bill and pay it, even though I think it's too much. Then Jared and Dorothy come and he's belligerent and he's yelling how the job wasn't done right and he won't pay and I get furious and leap between him and Howard and yell at Jared, "Hey, I'm talking to you. We went to a lot of trouble to get this done for you. Now I know you traveled a lot of miles and used lots of time, but so did we and, hey, don't walk away when I'm talking to you. You finish listening to me, and then go yell at your son! We did the best we could!" And then the neighbor comes in apologizing, he had put on the wrong kind of brake shoes and offers to fix it at no charge, which is what Jared was mad about and saying he wouldn't pay for. It all gets worked out.
