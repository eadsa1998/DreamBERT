 I'm working for Fishing Haven. I take a boat to a dock. Arriving there, I go to do the errand: whatever I came for. It is later. I'm in a grocery store. My grade school friend Tim Robbins and high school classmate Greg Solomon are stockers there. Tim's sister Terrie Robbins is a cashier. Tim and Terrie try to find each other, but they always miss each other closely. Terrie is in the bathroom. Tim peeks in to find her. Eventually, they find each other and talk. Someone, maybe I, washes dishes. I'm a stocker and a grocery store. I walk with a cart of toilet paper, with Tim, to where the toilet paper is on display. We cut up the boxes of the toilet paper for the display. I cut some of the packages of toilet paper, through the cardboard, with my cutters. There is a special on toilet paper. I'm back at the dock where I parked. A man tells me where my boat is. I find the boat, which is one of two at the end of the dock. It is a nice boat and motor with a steering wheel and throttle in the rear of the boat. There is a city on shore. The bridge makes me think the town is Hillston. I think that would be a ways away, but I don't know where else I'd see the bridge. I idle the motor. There seems to be some metal beams in the water, near the surface. I am afraid of damaging the prop.
