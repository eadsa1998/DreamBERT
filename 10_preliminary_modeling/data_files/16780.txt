Mrs. Pappas is saying that we have a physics test around July 5, and I find out it's a summer reading test (also, I feel I will be on vacation during this time). I am talking to Jamie, or someone who resembles her, but she still looks a bit different than usual. It's a book whose name resembles "Gideon's Trumpet" which is an actual book. So I make the observation that we should read that book first. Jamie tells me the book is excellent. Kate is behind me, waving and flirting but I realize it could be a trick (as soon as I walk over there she'll disappear or get smaller or something) and I'd rather keep talking to Jamie anyway, and I have another one of those thoughts about how long the dream has been going on without actually becoming consciously aware I have been dreaming. I am aware the conversation has been going on for quite a while, and we seem to get very close to each other by the time it's over. I realize even the teachers probably notice this "bonding" going on.
