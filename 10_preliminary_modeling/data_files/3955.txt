["He turned into a cat."]  I am traveling with a man. The road turns into a ferry boat over a river. There is a big crowd around us and we get separated. I feel scared and worried I'll never see him again. We get across and I get off the boat, running around looking for the man. I get to the front door of the hotel and turn around to trace my steps. Then I see a very frightened cat in a cart labeled Racial. I pick up the cat and I say, Tom is that you? My God, they turned you into a dark colored cat and they put you in a segregated cart for blacks. I realize we are in a deep southern state. I carry him in my arms, soothing him, because he is shaking he is so scared. I say we'll try to sneak him into the hotel. I go in. It is late at night. I put him in a safe place to hide and I go to find the clerk. I see a bar room with little red tables but hardly anyone around. The bar is closing it is so late. I find a woman and I ask for Corinne's room. She takes me there. A special handicapped room. She is in bed, which is a double platform of wood. The other side waits for her husband Dwight, who is now a cat named Tom. She is crying and runs and hides from me when I come in. Her girls are there. I am concerned now how to get them to accept Tom, and I sort of hope they don't so I can keep him.
