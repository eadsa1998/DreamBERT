 I'm driving my mom's car down the alley towards home. I am returning from grandma Redding's, I think. I pull into the driveway, and see that the window closest to the garden on the west side of the house is broken, and the screen is half dangling down. Someone has broken in. I go in. The back door is unlocked. My sister Ramona is sleeping on the loveseat. I say to her, "Who broke in?" She tells me that a man was here earlier, when my sister Heather was home, but he was here to do something. Ramona runs upstairs, and I follow. She checks my green covered clay pot in the small closet where my belongings are stored. My money in the pot is gone! I am angry! I have been saving the money to deposit it. I am mad: damn!
