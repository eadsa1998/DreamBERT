I have returned from someplace with an injury and now I must sleep up on the roof of a small cottage. I am lying on the narrow flat part of the roof. I am uncomfortable. I have a slim blanket and no pillow. I am afraid I will, in my sleep, roll over and fall off the roof and badly injure myself. It is miserable. I have to be there until I heal. I in desperation look around for a safer more comfortable place to sleep. I stand up, although it seems I shouldn't be able to. I look out and over to the next small cottage and then my "parent's house." All these are owned by my parents. I walk over these roofs looking for a better safe place to sleep. I don't find anything. I walk into my parents' where I used to have a room. I see a man and I think it is my brother Dwight. I suspect he's leaving and I call out to him You'd better not leave without saying goodbye to me or I'll be upset. He hesitates and returns to sit in a chair near where I lay. He confesses he's decided to leave his family. I suddenly realize it's not Dwight but some other man. I say, "I know" and he says How? Did you call my nephew? I say no. I didn't do it. I am relieved it is not Dwight's and embarrassed that in my pain, I didn't recognize him. He had black dreadknot curls in his hair. Lydia does some math calculating to try and get me to stay in my room rent free. She shows me the figures. I don't believe it is possible that I can stay without cheating.
