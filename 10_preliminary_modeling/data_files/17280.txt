I dreamt I was learning and reciting a play with a girl.  We were in the grocery store.  I was supposed to be a guy infatuated with her, I guess.  Reading the labels on the frozen food section gave me a basic idea of what I was supposed to say, rather than losing my place and looking in the book.  I was having fun actually sort of acting it out.  In the play I asked her for a glass-framed picture.  Then there was the lady who first drew Sesame Street.  Went through the store as her, blind.
