It was like watching a cartoon show. There was this guy and he left home &amp; met a girl, but she didn't like him all that much. He was pretty stupid. Back home his little sis (about 5 years old) &amp; his parents are watching a movie. The parents were sitting on her to keep her quiet. All I saw was their butts and her head &amp; shoulders. She was squirming and when she finally got her head out she yelled something like "(brother's name) got out of the house and is running around with a girl!" Then back to the girl &amp; guy. They suddenly had a fat guy friend with them. They did some stuff, but all I remember is a scene with the guy on a pay phone in a hotel with the other two standing around. The girl got mad and walked away. The guy dropped the phone and followed. There was more but I don't remember it. Setting: All different places, but I didn't recognize them. Characters: I don't know any of the people. Feelings and Thoughts: ? It was weird. I've never dreamed a cartoon. I wasn't even in it!
