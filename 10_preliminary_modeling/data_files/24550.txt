It was Bring Your Pet Day at the Science Faire at my school. I saw a goose and a chicken and 7 chicks and a little girl came up and stole a chick. That's it. Setting: I don't know - at My school, I think. Characters: I don't know them. The little girl who came up to steal the chick was wearing a t-shirt with a chick on it and jeans. The chick was just a chick. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. Mad because the little girl was stealing the chick. Very strange, because the science faire is tomorrow.
