I dreamed we were in school, and we were going over lecture notes as a review session. Dr. Mende was leading with the review session. I had my notebook there in front of me on the first page. We turned the page and in the review there was some sort of demonstration. One of the students was showing a slide or something. He had this round glass sphere that he was going to show it through, or yeah, and this had a board on it. When he put it against the wall, it just stuck there. It didn't fall off the wall. Another student took a picture that was on the wall and put a red lipstick on a part of it and then they put this round sphere with the ____ in front of it. That was how we saw the picture. Hall speaking: All the characters in the dream that Sam saw were males and were classmates of his. The picture that was being shown was that of a house on the Mediterranean. In the dream Sam figured out a logical reason why the picture stayed on the wall. There was another episode preceding this one which Sam does not remember.
