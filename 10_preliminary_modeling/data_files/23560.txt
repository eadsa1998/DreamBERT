I was looking down from a building at a jungle which was enclosed by glass. There was water and many lions and one big, huge snake. They were thrashing around and seemed aggravated. They looked like they were trying to break free. I had the feeling I was in the Orient. I was going to go down there but I never made it. Then I found myself sitting on some rocks in the middle of a river, the water was flowing rapidly. I was safe on the rocks but I felt scared.
