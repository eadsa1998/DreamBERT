In the first part of the dream I was at a ballet school and the walls were covered by mirrors. The teacher stood across from the exercise barre giving us instructions to the music of a worn out piano. In the second part all I remember is that a very good friend and myself finally saw our hopes realized and were being taken into a ballet company. I remember noticing how well my friend looked in her practice costume and just as we were about to try out for our parts, I woke up.
