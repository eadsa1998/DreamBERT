I have a camera and it's not working right so I am trying to figure out what's wrong. Everything seems threaded right and then I see a huge wad of folded negatives like computer paper folded, only they are negatives already developed. Someone says, "You waited too long. There must be 5000 of them and the max to be able to develop or print is 4000." I hope I can get them printed anyway. Someone says is this a cheap Kodak Instamatic and I am insulted. "No, this is a cannon, sir."
