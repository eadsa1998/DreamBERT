Offices of Biological Survey are in a very large building. Several men are selecting lunches from a cafeteria counter. Thompson (next door neighbor but one) and I each take half a deviled egg. We are expecting but he fails to appear. After waiting some time (about an hour) I start out in search of him. Wander about here and there, look into various rooms, etc., but cannot find him. It the occurs to me that he may have gone to the toilet room, though that is not satisfactory explanation because he has been gone too long. A lady, rather homely, in nurse's uniform, is dressing 2 children, possibly about 2 and 3 years old. They are very small, but both can walk. The one dressed first (apparently a girl) has an abnormally large head with mature, or at least, very intelligent-appearing features.
