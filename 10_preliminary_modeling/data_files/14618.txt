Ezra and I went to this place at university, which was different. It was this hairdressing section which was huge. They had a little shop there too. I was going to buy snacks. There were huge shelves and I was looking at magazines on them, looking at the hair styles. There was a picture of Catherine Zeta-Jones. I was then at home. Ezra was in his room on a computer and I was in my room on the laptop. My roller shutters were open. I can't remember what was going on, but some people were being dodgy. I walked back to my room and I saw a dark dude walking towards the house. I called Mom and told her to come now. I said we were hungry and I squealed that someone was coming. I went to tell Ezra. I went back to my room and he was in the house. I ran to the family room and I was trying to find weapons. Then there were three white guys and a black guy. I stabbed the black guy in the head (there's something else written here that I can't read). I got a lighter and set one of them on fire in the bathroom. I closed the door. They tried to get the door and I hit them with a wrench or something. They stopped the fire and were ok. I got them outside and they came through the window, it showed us at the bathroom door and they stretched (like that episode in The X-Files). I thought it was gay. It took a long time too. Some time before, one of the guys went into a cupboard thing. He opened the door and sunlight came in and he burned. I was thinking 'why not do the Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) thing and put something over you'. He was actually on the roof of a building. He went to the edge and jumped. His skin was red and burnt. He landed on his feet on the ground and was ok. Then he went to the hairdresser place because there was a girl there he liked and she let him in do something. There's something I can't read and then someone said "Damn it! Sam and Dean!" and I think 'what would they do in Supernatural?'
