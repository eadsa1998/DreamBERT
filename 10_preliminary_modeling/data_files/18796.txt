I dreamed I was riding in a car along a beach somewhere, with someone else male whom I didn't recognize. He was showing me the beach front and the peculiar thing about it was that there was block after block of empty lots where houses once stood, but did no more. Instead houses, there were just charred ruins and their remains. He said something had happened that did all this damage but in the dream, it wasn't specified. I thought to myself, in the dream, that Negroes had moved into these houses and reduced them to the remains that they now were.
