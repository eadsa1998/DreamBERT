I was doing many things in the house here.  I think we were getting ready for an open house (the house is for sale), straightening up.  I had conversations with various people, important conversations.  I had a piece of Lynn's dead body with me, just the thighs, lower back and penis.  I had cut him up myself.  I took it into the other bathroom, the one I used as a child here.  I put lots of vaseline on the penis and had anal sex with it.  I thought, this is not so bad, if you get it lubricated really well.  It feels kind of neat.  I was remembering how much I'd disliked it before, and how this was different.  I could see myself in the bathroom mirror.  I watched the whole thing.  Some close up views of it going in and out.  Then Dad was in by the bedroom hallway.  Getting the house ready to show.  I thought, I do not want him to find this piece of corpse, but I had lost it myself.  I couldn't remember where I'd put it, and I looked in the closets, the bedroom, under the bed.  Trying hard to remember where I put it.  Only then did it occur to me how bizarre it was that I had a piece of Lynn's body, cut apart, dead.  How bizarre it would be if Dad found it.  I myself did not seem to care too much that I had Lynn's cut up corpse.  Later, I was speaking with a middle-age to older woman with short hair about her job.  Her features were very distinctive.  I had been trying to find work and had no luck.  She was telling me how I could become a site inspector like her.  She showed me the forms she filled out, showing me how easy her job was.  It was like a County Health Inspector job.  It was almost like I was already hired, or if I wanted this job I could have it.  I was happy at first about finding a job, but then began reflecting on how boring or ill-suited the job would be for me.  That maybe I shouldn't do it.
