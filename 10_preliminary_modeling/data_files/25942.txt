 My mom is having a baby. She wants to go to Oval Lake in the Big Resort Area with my sister Ramona tomorrow. I say to her, "What if your water breaks?" She doesn't think it will. She is due at 6:30 am tomorrow. Then her water breaks on the dining room floor, and the carpet gets wet. She instructs Ramona and I as to what we should do, because she is experienced. We hurry. We are to put the chicken, hot dogs, bratwursts, and potatoes in a cooler. We are bringing these to the hospital with a big pot, to cook them. I get ready. I bring a whole small chicken. I get dressed. My friend Jerry Pasons and my roommate Sean Williams from Fishing Haven are in my room sleeping. Sean then goes to urinate. Jerry is still sleeping, and rolls over onto Sean's bed. <br/
