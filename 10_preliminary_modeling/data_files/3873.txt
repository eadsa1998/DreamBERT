["Paulina Comes To Me."] I am going to do a performance and then I will catch a plane to visit Paulina. Another woman and I are to read some of our writings to a small group of people in a room. I am frantically looking for my book I read from. I can't find it. Now it is my turn and the people, who are standing up in various parts of the room are waiting. I talk to them as I rifle through a book looking for my place. I am charming but I can't find anything. I apologize and give up. I go back stage to call someone to get things ready for the trip. I can't use the phone because the next act is a rock band that uses a computer modem hook up with their act. Time is ticking away and I can't seem to find the man who can get me to a phone. I go looking for him and find myself in a tiny boat just off shore of the island we are on. The water is very rough and choppy. I am worried. I can't imagine trying to return to the mainland over this difficult bit of water. I then look again and see the tide has gone out and the water is gone. I ask someone to pick up my boat, with me in it, and put me on shore so when the tides return, I'll be safe. Someone does that. Now I walk back into the building. Finally I realize it is too late. My plane left at 12:30. The rock band is done and I try dialing. I can't remember who I was to call. Maybe Dr. M. for permission to go, no. Maybe my mother. No. Maybe Paulina. Then I turn and see that Paulina is there. She had used my unused ticket and flew to visit me. I am happy.
