I walk into an enclosed porch of a house and see Terence all dressed up in a blue suit (light blue). I exclaim, "What a coincidence, I just dreamed about him this morning." I am vaguely aware that he is dead and a little surprised to see him alive. Then I see a lot of books. They are children's mysteries written by Terence. I then realize that Terence had written them. I am very surprised. [BL]
