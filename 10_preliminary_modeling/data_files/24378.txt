I found myself climbing out of a reef. It was almost built into a building, half outside. I had fallen asleep under water with scuba gear on as I was watching the fish and coral. I woke up and gently rested on some live coral. I was afraid I would hurt it and that it could sting me. Then I realized how long I had been under water and climbed out. My hands and feet were very wrinkled. I'd stayed in too long.
