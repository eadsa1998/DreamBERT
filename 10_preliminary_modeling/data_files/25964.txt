 My friend Hank Anderson is on a train. He is taken on the train, transported, stopped, and then thrown out into the water of a lake. He has no choice. This is his life calling: his quest. I'm on a train with my friend Stephen Ramos. I tell him that I love him, in case we don't get out of the train. The train moves fast. We seem to be in California. My classmate Kate Francis is jogging. There are apartment buildings there. I fly up to the roof of a building with either Stephen or my brother Wally. I see a woman sun tanning that has her butt cheeks spread wide open. Doctors are on the roof talking to people saying they shouldn't be there because it's dangerous. One doctor gives shots to immobilize the brain, rather than fixing ailments. I say if I fall to fix me up but leave my brain so I can dream. Stephen and I climb down from a tower-like structure on the roof. He tells me a dream he had. I am not too interested in it. I am put in a room with an old woman. We have sex and I finger her vagina. I lick and suck her genitals, and put my finger in her butt hole. This is my life struggle. The woman is my sister Ramona. I suck on her butt hole. She doesn't like it: she doesn't like anal stimulation much. I realize I am dreaming. My roommate from Fishing Haven Sean Williams is there. I punch him and the woman repeatedly. One of them is in front of me, the other behind me. I punch Sean in the face, which flattens his face, and then backhand the woman.
