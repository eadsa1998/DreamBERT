I had asked my family to all draw pictures of the Simpsons. I drew 5 pages on typing paper. I'd shuffled back and forth and worked so long on them the paper was dog-eared and wouldn't stack even. Rudy did a few pages of the Simpsons too. Aunt Linda drew a bunch of cartoons of the state of Nevada on legs. There was a parade. I was wanting to go because they threw out free stuff--toys and snacks. But nobody could get it together to leave. I saw the floats pass through the window. Santa Claus had already left. This was a home for wayward teenage mothers. A woman photographer had intended to shoot photos for ads of the girls being loving, wonderful mothers--but the girl holding a baby awkwardly and despisingly at arms length--facing away from her. The photographer used this picture. I had left the window open and kitty climbed out on a tiled roof. I was afraid to call her for fear she'd lose balance and fall. I tapped the window lightly. She came back in effortlessly. A guy told me branches fall on the roof all the time and it was not good I let her out. There were a bunch of cameras. I needed to get the right one--my Minolta. When I came back it was gone. I asked the house mother and she said look around. It was the last day of the ??? Girls they'd given up on were being sent home for good. I went into the wrong room by mistake. On a dresser was my camera--with my film box stuck to it--I packed it up like I was gonna ??? but I had no intentions of doing that. I didn't feel like taking pictures. Women's group sculpture--bodies--on floor--bent knees/elbows. Sitting, lying--moving in reaction to the previous movements. Sometimes from across the room. Moving lettuce eagle on pulley swinging down from ceiling.
