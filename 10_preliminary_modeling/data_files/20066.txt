I was confined in a strange institution. I saw a gate. I was not allowed outside, but no one was there, so I went out the gate. It was evening, and the streets were dark. There were small houses, and small stores. Dogs were barking, and I speculated that the home owners had watch dogs because of the institution being so close. I saw the headlights of a car behind me, and I was afraid it was someone from the institution looking for me. But it passed by me. I kept walking. The wall of the institution was on my left. The homes were on my right.
