I am at some shop and notice a house next door. Many Asian and colored people are going in, many of them very distinctively dressed in costumes that are highly colorful, quilted or poofy and ornate. It's a church of some kind. I go over and lean on the fence in front of the house to watch. Now members of the church are tossing some of the people out over the balcony, some of them dropping or falling three stories. I am concerned that they will be hurt with broken bones, but they are not. These members are being ritually thrown out or rejected. Now Dora joins me. I want to take pictures, but I am out of film. I take an iron and smooth out a rectangle of sawdust, the medium used to take pictures with, even though I know it won't do any good. Now Dwight comes up and says, "Come on, we're all going now to pick out a present I'll buy for each of you." I say, "Great, but not right now, because I want to see this." He leaves. I continue watching. A few minutes later, Dora and I go to find Dwight. Maybe it's too late to get our gift. Dora shows me an ornate decorated cake she made for the contest. It has sort of a blue ribbon design on it. I say, "It's very pretty." I don't find Dwight.
