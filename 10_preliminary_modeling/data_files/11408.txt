I dreamed that I had a bath towel over my shoulders and that by flapping the towel I could fly like a bird. Several times during the dream I took off from the sidewalk and ascended to the height of a house. After circling around the street I would land safely and try again. Although I never fell, I was worried that the "wings" would fail me once in the air. Above the street was a mass of telephone wires, communication wires, and electric streetcar wires. In flying up from the sidewalk I had to get through all these wires and was therefore extremely anxious that I would become entangled. At the end of the dream I was roller skating down the street with a gang of kids after me.
