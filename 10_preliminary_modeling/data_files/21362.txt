Andy P. was playing ball. I walked away, then later Louie K (deceased) foreman came over and said Andy knocked one way over to Snow Road and that was about a half mile. I thought and I didn't believe it, but later I was thinking of the wrong road to the left instead of to the right, which was not so far as I thought it was. Women were talking of getting pregnant and I bragged that all I had to do was intimate a woman once and she was pregnant, instead of many times, as men do.
