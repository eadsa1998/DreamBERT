 I'm in a Hardees restaurant with my high school classmate Carmen Allure on a Friday night. My brother Wally and his friends Jeff Bautsch and Perry Glide are there. We walk by them, and go back to where they are when they call us over. We sit and talk to them. I think they are dorks for being in Hardees on a Friday night.
