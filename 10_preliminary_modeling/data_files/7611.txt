I was married to the man who plays Jack in the TV program Love and War. Here his name is Ben. I had a baby. We named him Benjamin. The baby wasn't well and was going to have to spend the first two years of its life in the hospital. The problem is that he would occasionally just stop breathing. My family and friends were keeping me posted on how the baby was doing. I was sobbing often and a lot and having trouble coping.
