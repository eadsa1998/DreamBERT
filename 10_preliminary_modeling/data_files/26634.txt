 I get my psychology cognition report back. I watch the woman as she scores it, and she makes comments about my use of the word "intent" and "intent to intent". She criticizes my writing, saying I say nothing substantial. She hands me back my paper with a score of 14 out of 100 points! I'm extremely surprised, because I thought it was at least a fair piece of writing. I tell her I thought it was pretty good. She tells me to redo it. I tell her I want to get an appointment with her to talk with her about it. Everyone seems to get a low score. A bright Asian man gets only 35 out of 100. My acquaintance Rachel Steiner rides by on a bicycle.
