First of all, this was after everybody left and after all the dust settled and I could start remembering my dreams again and I wouldn't get so tired. I dreamt that I was getting ready for school and I was all dressed and ready to go, and I had my book bag and my books and stuff. It was going to be my first day. And I went in the bathroom to go to the bathroom and there was this faucet on the wall, like opposite the toilet, and there were two of them and they were just spraying water out of control. And I went in there and I got myself all wet. They were spraying after me as I went and I just closed the door and I said, "Alright." And then I got my shoes and stuff and told Mom about it, and I don't remember what she said. But that was short-lived. The other weird dream I had was I dreamt that Samantha and Sandra and I were going through my magic show stuff. And there was this recording of me doing a magic show a long time ago and people cheering and clapping, playing even one of the magic show things. And then I said, "Where is that coming from?" and Samantha pulled out this mechanical chickie and she said, "This is a magic chick; now watch it." And it had like a little heart thing on its hand; you know how mechanical things do. And when you would press it, it would say, "Hi, I'm a magic chick. If you want to play magic," something about the something blue. You'd have to activate a blue king or blue foot thing or something. And then it would say, "Hi, I'm a magic chick, if you want to play magic," something like that, and then it would start to play this recording of when I would do magic shows. That was like weird.
