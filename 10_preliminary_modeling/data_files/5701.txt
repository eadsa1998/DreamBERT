I am talking to my father on the telephone. In reality my father died this past Spring. His death hit me very hard. In this dream I was talking too him on the telephone, and I said to him "where are you?" and he said "I'm in Shreveport Hospital" Shreveport Hospital is about 20 minutes away from us but is not the hospital we use. I said to him "what are you doing there?" and he said " The police found me in the street and they brought me to Shreveport hospital." And I said to him, "If you're in Shreveport Hospital, then who is that man we buried?" And he started to laugh and he said "I don't know, but its not my problem." The main sense that I used in that dream was hearing, talking and listening to him on the telephone and holding the telephone, I could feel the receiver in my hand.
