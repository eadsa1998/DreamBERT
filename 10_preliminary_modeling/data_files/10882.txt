I dreamed that I was walking down the street with a man and woman. I cannot remember the appearance or age of these people, except that I seem to think that they were about my age level. A very large man passed on the street who seemed to have a very distended abdomen. I commented on his largeness. The man I was with said his father's abdomen was like that, and that he was an alcoholic. He also said that his father was dead. Suddenly a woman started chasing us and I became frightened and ran to my car and got in and drove away. The woman seemed to be chasing me in my car. Then I seemed to be driving down the street and it was very dark and late at night. I locked the doors in my car. The street seemed to be very quiet and there were no cars or people on the street. I heard a noise and I turned my head to look out the window at my right and saw the same woman who had chased me before, running along my car and screaming. She appeared very old and her face very wrinkled. She ran faster than I was driving and began to run in front of me. I turned to the left and saw another woman (I have no memory of her appearance other than she was a woman) running in front of my car from that side. I turned the other way to avoid hitting her and crashed into a store window.
