By the ocean: it is cold and windy; I meet a grey-haired man with brown eyes who says he is called John Zech (which is the real name of an announcer on the radio.) -- I am with Earl at a restaurant and neither one of us has any money to pay for our food, so I decide to charge it on my credit card. I ride away on my BICYCLE, carrying the food in my wire basket in a brown bag. Suddenly I am on a SWING, and trying to peddle. I fall down. However, someone brings me my bike and I peddle away. very happy.
