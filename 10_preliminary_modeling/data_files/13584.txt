I was at home. I was watching something that had Michael Cera in it, and Bryson and another person were watching it too. I went out to see Mom. Ezra went with her and she took off before I could talk. I got prickles in my foot. Bryson closed the front door and I couldn't get back in. I didn't have my phone on me and so I borrowed off someone. The phone was actually a piece of paper so I typed out what I said, but I had actually called Mom and said we needed to go to Dad's work. Mom was there later and saw Kiki and a kitten on the roof of the shed.
