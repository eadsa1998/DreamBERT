I was having another one of those nights where I got a lot of sleep, but I kept waking up for some reason, and I had a lot of silly little dreams that I would remember each time I woke up. But now the only one I can remember is the most recent one, which was at a high school, I think. It wasn't any particular school that I remember being at, but it looked sort of like a school we went to when we were at a competition or something, kind of odd floors and walls that were kind of odd colors, kind of greenish. And I was, I can't remember why I was there. I had to take some kind of class again or something. It wasn't one of those dreams I would have sometimes about failing and having to go back, but it was more like I had some kind of official business, but I don't know what it was. And next thing I knew, I was back in Mrs. Dougherty's chorus, and there was this girl who was picked for a solo, and she sang most of the song and then we were going to sing after her, like at the very end. And the song was, "Once more b_______ coming to ____________," and it was so gorgeous, and I was crying in my dream. I don't know if I had any real tears or not, but in my dream I did. And people around me thought I was crying because I didn't get the solo, but really it was so profound and it was so amazing to hear and to be a part of. And all I remember is just wanting to stay and wanting to be there, and not being able to make myself leave like I knew I should. And even, I remember she was going to go over certain passages and give us certain measure numbers and tell us about the things to focus on. And I remember just really wanting to hear all of that, and then I woke up. It was kind of a crazy thing..
