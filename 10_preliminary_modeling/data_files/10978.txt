My husband and I suddenly were in New York at the school which I had attended 3 years ago. All of my professors were present, one of whom I had been very close to, as she was a philosophy instructor and I had spent considerable time with her. We had a long discussion in regard to pragmatism and my husband's view s about abstract philosophic approaches. She was extremely impressed by his keenness. (She is a woman of 45 or so.) Suddenly I was in the bath tub with my husband (that's tough to figure out) and a few of my friends came in to meet him.
