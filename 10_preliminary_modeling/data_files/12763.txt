I was at a shop and this reporter guy got shot. He was then replaced by someone else. People were jumping on the new reporter. Ryan Cartwright was there and was dressed as a girl. This guy told Dad and I to go to this weird shop. They had a few horror movies. When we entered the shop our ears popped and they hurt for a while. We bought a heap of movies the second time.
