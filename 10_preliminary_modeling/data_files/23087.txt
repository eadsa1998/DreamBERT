I was in what first seemed to be the balcony of a movie theater, then turned out to be the upper deck of a baseball stadium.  Mickey Mantle was coming to the plate and getting a thunderous standing ovation.  He hit a home run, and his batting helmet flew off into the crowd behind home plate.  Before running the bases, he went back and asked for it.  To my surprise, the kid who caught it gave it back.  I guess Mickey needed it for running the bases, according to the rules, even though he had hit a home run, and that he would return it to the kid when he returned to home plate.  When he rounded third base, he held up one hand in a "Hook 'em, 'horns" gesture, and several people near me started booing and shouting obscenities, giving him the finger, and spitting at him.  Two kids were hanging on the railing.  I got mad and went up and shook the railing-and one of them fell off, out of sight.  I was a little scared, but not much. Then I left, but was accosted by some boys under the stands who told me I would have to come into a room with them and take my punishment, which was to let them beat me up.  I sort of felt I deserved it, but I was a bit squeamish about getting beat up.  I noticed that all the boys were young and small, though, so I went in.  My daughter Christina was with me, which was bad.
