I'm at a family reunion in a large fine house with grounds (or a maybe a rented public building like in a park) - maybe it's granite or something, very imposing. I'm on a little round balcony with a few others (I think men), there are lots more people inside. I feel faint and collapse. They see that I'm very sick, and quickly take me to a car to go to the hospital. (I don't see any of that, the next I know is that I'm lying in the back seat of the car - a sedan - going like gangbusters on a huge freeway. It must be 5 lanes in each direction, lots of cars but not crowded, and all going really fast. I can't see anything else but freeway and blue sky, with a few white clouds. As we barrel along, the road rises, and quickly - soon it changes to steps, which doesn't slow anybody down, and it keeps going up, the incline increasing. Now my line of sight changes to a spot at the side of the freeway (outside of the car), looking across it - and the incline (without the steps) takes a sharp turn up to vertical. The cars are not stopping or even slowing down, and they whoosh straight up. They make it about halfway up on momentum, and then gravity takes over and they fall down. I can see them sort of drop off [rather than sliding down still in contact with the pavement] and fall down way below me.
