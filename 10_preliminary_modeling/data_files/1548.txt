I go into a public restroom. I notice that both men and women are using the same room because the men's room is temporarily closed. I find a stall, no doors. My friend and I are talking. A man comes up and comments on my shoes and I try to ignore him. He follows me out of the restroom. He likes me and wants to get together. I carry straw flowers and a strawberry. I throw away the strawberry. He is very happy and says, "Oh look. She threw away his strawberry and kept my straw flowers." Somehow that means I favor him. So I go into a room and sit down at a table. My friend also sits with me. The man, tall and good looking, appears and stands behind me. I am now in a quandary because I realize that my friend had seen him first and wants him. She goes away, hurt, and I see a small pet animal curled up with bruises near its eyes.
