I was at a place with Dad and Ezra. We were looking for a toilet. One was outside a caravan and I said "I wish we were at Seabird". There was a lady outside her house and her daughter (who was really young) was bruised and dirty and she was holding her by her hair and being really violent. We were going to go and do something, but the lady kept looking at us evilly.
