I went across the street to a neighbor's house. She was lying on the couch and her apartment was a huge mess. She had a baby that was crawling on the floor with all the trash. I jerked her off the couch and punched her. I yelled at her, "How can you treat your children like dirt? You don't even take care of them!" I went and called Social Services. They came and took her kids.
