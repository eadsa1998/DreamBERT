I was on Mom's computer which was really stingy. I was on MSN talking to Calvin. He and Silas came over. Ezra had someone over too and we were mucking around. We were then at school. I was watching a Harry Potter movie. Harry went to Japan and kissed that girl he liked. "I love Sarah" was written on his shoe. It then swapped to real life and I liked him for some reason.
