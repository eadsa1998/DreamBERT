There is an old car which is parked just behind another car and which I am supposed to move in front of that car.  The car has a large clutch on the roomy floor and a smaller brake a little farther to the left.  Just above the windshield is the emergency brake.  I don't know how to start the car, but when I turn a little knob or something, also above the windshield, I find myself hurtling toward the car in front of me.  I swing quickly to the left to miss it and still stay barely on the pavement, then have to fumble around and quickly step on the brake to keep from plowing into the canal or something at the end of the street.
