I upset the Visitors (V) somehow. For a 'fair' fight, we were each allowed a number of people to send underwater and they had to kill as many others as they could in 10 seconds. They had 130 and we had 110. Anna (V) was like 'It starts now'. I quickly went under. There was random stuff in the water too, like tuna tins and stuff. We paired up and I had just got a new fish and I fed it. I hit 'Iron Man' and I said "I didn't mean to kill Iron Man!". Mario and Luigi were down there too.
