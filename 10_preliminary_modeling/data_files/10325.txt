Several fragments: Eating a chocolate Sunday with a friend from Church; -- driving on snowy streets with the wind blowing; -- talking with Jonathan about art and urging him to take better care of himself; He had refused to eat or drink anything, but finally agrees to drink some coffee with brandy. We speak FRENCH as he recognizes a MOSAIC work by a great artist. Vague ending.
