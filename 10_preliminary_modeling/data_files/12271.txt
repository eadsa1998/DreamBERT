I was at school and this explosion happened. Someone and I were okay and there was a baby. Robert de Niro was there and I think he was a bad guy. We were watching dances on stage. The bags were close to the stage. Calvin and I were sitting far away. Daryl was doing a dance. Seamus was in the hospital.
