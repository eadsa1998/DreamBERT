I am looking for a vacant seat in a restaurant that is high up somewhere in a steep place. I have to climb many stairs to finally find a seat. I believe it is a toilet seat and have a huge bowel movement; I am embarrassed and disgusted when a white dog comes to eat it up. I move to another table and there is a catered BANQUET. I finally find Frank and Wendy and we continue our trip....When we arrive back, we find the back door barricaded by Wally who tells us it is a "sculpture." He takes down the barricade and we go in.... Iaughing.
