 I'm at an airport to catch a plane. I am searched by a guard, and drop some coins on the floor while I am being searched. The guard woman is a bitch. My friends Emerald Reinhold, Jana Green, Becky Happs, and Amy Leopard and other people are flying out. After I am searched I wait, and pick up silver coins I had dropped. The lights go out and people rush through the ticket checking area.
