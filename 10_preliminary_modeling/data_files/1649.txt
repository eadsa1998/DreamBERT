Jerome is thinking of moving on to another job. It's time. He's done all he can here. I am a little annoyed at him. He's so arrogant. I notice that everyone has learned from him and everyone has a gift for him. I call it to his attention. He hides by having his head in the Birthday/Goodbye cake. His wife - maybe he's hiding from her. Anyway, I scrape off the frosting and cake to uncover him. Later, I say, "These gifts are all for him." I take them to his office and say in a belligerent tone, "Here is a gift from someone who didn't like you, but who has changed his mind." Jerome laughs. I say, "You were a son of a bitch, you know." He agrees. There are two very long, flat and tall gifts up on his desk leaning against the wall. I give him several other gifts as well.
