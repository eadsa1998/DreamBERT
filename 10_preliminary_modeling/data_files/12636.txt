I was at Nana's which was different. I was in the pool and Ezra was too. I was trying to get dressed behind a curtain. Dad and Daryl were there too. Aunt Sally was on the toilet. I was then at school and this annoying guy sat next to me during media. He sat in Calvin's seat. Evelyn was there. There were lots of guys there and so was Eugene.
