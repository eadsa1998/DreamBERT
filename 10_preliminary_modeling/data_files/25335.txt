 I'm with my friends Tom Napper, Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, and Tom's father Dick. I'm walking towards my house in Oak Valley, down 2nd Street. They go way ahead of me. I am wearing white shoes, white pants, and a white shirt. I get a bloody nose and drip blood on my pants. I run back. I go behind my neighbors the Trammell's house. There is a big fallen tree where a muskrat lives. The muskrat has a shell on it. Part of the shell has been removed, and the muskrat won't live long because of it. I'm a little bit afraid of the muskrat: I think it might be crazy and attack. It swims in water into the bottom of this fallen hollow tree.
