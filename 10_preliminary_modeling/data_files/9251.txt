I was at a meeting at a local school. They had passed around papers that discussed a proposal that someone was trying to get passed. We were supposed to read it and then sign off on it if we agreed or supported the proposal. I just skimmed it to get the general idea because it was so many pages. I didn't see anything that I felt was cause for concern so I signed it. Just as I did they passed another set of papers around, saying that there was an error in the first set. In the meantime, I was listening to some other people discuss the proposal and was now not sure that I wanted to sign. I was somewhat surprised to see Aaron S there. I was thinking that his daughter must be a teenage by now. It had been seven years since I've seen her. I was going to say something to him but then didn't.
