I dreamed that I was in a Spanish city with a group and was too afraid to go upstairs (because it was a rickety ladder) to sleep with the girls. So I stayed downstairs and slept with the boys. Aidan was there and didn't care, but Mason didn't want me sleeping with the rest of the boys. Then Judith and I were at my house and Mrs. Frank made me babysit her sons. We had to make sure the plants or dogs or anything didn't eat them. Billy called, and I hung up on hi, disconnected the phone, and swore off ever talking to anyone ever again.
