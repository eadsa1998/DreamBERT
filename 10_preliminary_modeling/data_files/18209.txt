I and my husband weren't really married. I was sort of his sister because I had been adopted by his mother, but we apparently lived in the same apartment we live in now, only his mother lived there too in some way. And we had our daughter and everything was just like it is except one day he came in and announced that he was going to marry this girl the next weekend, that we had never heard of or hardly ever heard of because even though he wasn't married to me and there was something apparently almost a little bit incestuous about our relationship, he didn't date very much and if he had dated this girl at all, it had only been about four or five times. And it seemed sort of strange to me and then I guess it finally hit me what was happening. The night before the wedding we were sleeping in the same bed together as usual, and I started to persuade him that he shouldn't do this, that I loved him even though I wasn't married to him. I still loved him and we had our daughter and I was maybe going to have another baby. So I was trying to persuade him not to marry this girl. It didn't seem to make much impression on him. He didn't seem to have any particular feeling about it at all or even being sorry or anything. It was very strange and I was very unhappy in the dream. I woke from it still unhappy.
