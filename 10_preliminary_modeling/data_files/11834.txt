I was at the movies and I sat in this chair. It was swinging and I knocked some people and I fell and people were laughing. I was giving Pokemon games and then pictures of me and Ezra to all the people. Then as I went back to my seat, my phone beeped. [It was like Neil's dream in Time (The Young Ones), and I woke up to it, it was my phone was beeping in real life].
