I was living in the town of my university.  I met our cat Buster's original owner, who told us Buster was a girl.  We saw some lasers flying around.  I decided to try out for a part in a play.  It was a group singing part, and that was all.  I made the appointment to try out, but the next time I was there, it was the first performance.  I was there with my parents and my brother Stuart.  My dorm mate Carol was telling them how she wanted to try out for the role of Mary.  My elementary schoolmate Nick was in it, as well as my longtime classmate Mark.  It was a weird play that didn't make a whole lot of sense.  Mary arrived with her servant (or she was the..?)  as well as a big round man playing the Pleaser role, and then work began on a railroad.  It built up, until Mark fell off (as per the play).  My brother Stuart was behind me talking to my father, and I kept telling him to shut up, but he wouldn't.  It was supposed to be the initial performance, and I wasn't in it, but I would be.  Maybe it was just a run-through. In any case, I was given a green paper globe, which was a scholarship.  My dad handed it to me, sounding proud, and gave me a hug.  Then I had to go put a lamp on stage, because they needed more.  It was to look like a candle, but we were having trouble finding a place.
