I was living in a very poor section of town, of what town I do not know. I had to go away for some reason and it seemed as though someone went with me, but I don't remember who it was. When I came back again after about a year, everyone was changed and I was very sad because of this. The next part that I remember was in a bathroom. It was quite large and had a very large bathtub. Two girls were drawing water for a bath. One of the girls was a friend of mine who lives in the same dorm I do. She had her towel around her just as she always does before taking a bath. She was very excited because she was going to take a bath in such a big tub.
