I am taking a physics class at Plainview High School. I get one of the worst grades in the class, on two assignments. I feel that some of the questions were just dumb true/false questions. I wanted to go down to the guidance office and demand an independent study of the subject. At first I thought the usual physics teacher was teaching, but then I find out it was an eccentric man who we called Mike. He was rather weird, and funny. I can't think of any specific humorous comments he made or the things he did.
