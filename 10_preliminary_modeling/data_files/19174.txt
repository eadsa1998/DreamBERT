Three of my friends and I are in this large square building looking for a room in which to study. We got all around the building looking in the rooms to study, but they were all full. When we get all the way around the building, there is an interesting little stairway down that's very similar to the one in the next room. It's day residue. The three people I was with were all classmates. I recognzied them all, there was Shelly, Leslie and Nick. I left the building apparently without my friends and I met another friend, classmate, Ava. We looked back at the building and from the outside there was a deep chasm which was crossed by a wooden bridge which was covered, a covered wooden bridge. Not solidly covered like a covered bridge in New England, but kind of thatched. This led up to the side of the building. Then again the scene changes and I'm sitting by myself and I'm thinking about the process of growing up and assimilating knowledge. It seems to be bloody. My hands are red. It seems to be as shame to grow up and assimilate all this knowledge only to die and lose it. The scene changes again, and I'm now in an auditorium-like affair, waiting to get married, but my bride is late and there are other people using the auditorium now. I'm wearing a gray suit. It's an old suit. It's double breasted and the collar is red. It looks kind of a, like a bandsman's uniform. I'm barefoot. I don't have any shoes on. They won't let us go in the auditorium anyway. I go in, but without permission, but none of our friends are there so we come back out and then we leave.
