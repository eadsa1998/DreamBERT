I am with someone -- I don't know who -- and we are buying flowers. We buy many bouquets of different varieties of flowers. Then we return to a place that looks like a floral shop. We place our bouquets in pots of water, then go looking for Mary.  I find Mary standing on the street talking to her sister Nancy. We present her with the flowers by bringing her over to the place where we have put them in vases or pots of water. Mary is so delighted with the gift of flowers that she starts to dance. It is a funny dance. She jumps up and kicks her legs out from side to side. Her dance is like a combination of a reel and a specialty Country Western dance. As she dances, I say, very happily, "That's like my old Mary." Mary is wearing an evening gown. [It is the one with white polka dots on a gray background, purchased especially for a wedding or Bar Mitzvah that we had attended many years before she died.] After finishing her dance, Mary gives me the bouquet that she had held while dancing. She asks me to put it back in the vase because she has to go to the bathroom, telling me she will return shortly.
