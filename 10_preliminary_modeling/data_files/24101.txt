It is late summer and I am in the mountains. I am there on vacation with some friends (I don't remember who they were) and it is relatively warm and sunny. Basically the next thing I know is that I wake up (in the dream) to find out that it snowed several feet of snow over night. I am very excited and stoked because they are running lifts at all the resorts and snow conditions are perfect. We are supposed to be leaving on this day, but I would rather stay and go snowboarding in the completely unexpected and epic snow conditions. I try to talk my friends into staying and going boarding, but everyone is reluctant to voice their opinions. No one can decide if they should stay or leave and I can't believe that there is even a question. I know I want to stay and ride, but everyone else is indecisive. I want to take advantage of the good snow because we are insanely lucky to even have the chance at snow in the summertime.
