It was really early in the morning and my house was on snowy mountains. I was driving a conversion van and I went to pick up my two friends, one boy and one girl. I let the boy drive the van. It was really icy and snowy. He drove off the mountain. We were spinning and hitting trees when we finally stopped. We got out and I shrunk the van to where I could carry it up the hill. When we got back on the road, I dropped the boy off at my house and me and the girl went to school. I left school early and went back to my house. The boy was no longer there and I paged him and he called me back. He was at the neighbor's house. So I walked over there in a white t-shirt and pink underwear. When the door opened to let me in, I woke up.
