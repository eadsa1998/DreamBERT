I had gotten a Celine Dion CD for my birthday, I guess, and I couldn't wait to play it. I couldn't wait to see what it was. And there was another CD that had her picture on it, but was like a compilation of CD's. And there was this teen magazine that went with it, and it had her picture on the cover, but it had all this little trivia about these different stars and stuff, and it was so cool. And I dreamt that I was looking through it and reading it on the monitor, and then I came across this Celine Dion CD and I figured I'd go and play it and see what it's like. And then Terri rings the doorbell and she comes in, and next thing I know we're dancing to Jimmy Buffett. And then next thing I know, I woke up.
