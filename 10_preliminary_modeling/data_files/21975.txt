I saw a fellow with two keys in a cylinder from either end and was turning the tumblers. Judy was sitting on the windowsill in just her pants and was leaning out and asleep. I picked her up and put her on the bed. Someone was opening the door. I tried to lock it, but the lock would not hold. I saw the results of one racetrack and some of the winners were horses I heard of before but I can't recall them now.
