I'm in a big gym and finished for the day. It's time to go home. I take my clothes I want to change into, a more informal, sexy outfit. I go to the gas station to change in the restroom and see that Jerome has taken over the place and is busily and energetically setting up things for sale. It's a fundraiser thing, I think. I walk around the premises looking for the restroom. I change, to a red tank top and a blouse. I look pretty good and feel comfortable. Now I'm walking to the car to leave. Jerome calls me into a room to say goodbye. He and I had been antagonistic and attracted to each other. He leans me into a wall and presses his full body against me and kisses me. I respond, which surprises him pleasantly. I want to show him I am sexually warm and responsive. Now he has me pinned to the wall and is working at getting me excited. I feel manipulated and pull his hand away from my vagina. I say, "No." He hints I am a prick tease. I say, "No, I just want it to be real, not for games." I walk away with mixed feelings. After all, it felt delicious up to a point. I write his name on a line in a book, last name first, and rewrite it in red ink because it wasn't very clear.
