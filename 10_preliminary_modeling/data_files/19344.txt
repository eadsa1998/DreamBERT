I had a dream I saw a vampire on the apartment across from my house and it turned into a bat and flew towards my back door. I locked the door and ran upstairs because I remembered I had a gun with a silver bullet. Then I came back downstairs with the gun and there were black and white cats everywhere. Then my dream started over and repeated after I saw the cats. This happened three times.
