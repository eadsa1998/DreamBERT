I was at a strange haunted house. I went in there, why I don't know. A few people, who were all friends, had died. The rooms would change around. I went into this room with some others, which was a mirror maze, but you couldn't get back through the door. We all held hands as it kept getting darker. I got to the end and went through door into this waiting room. A friend of mine, called Suzanne stayed with this old man. I left that room. I went in a room with a chocolate cat person. It changed into a fluffy cat. I threw it into a light and it burnt up and hissed and died and went green. I went into another room and died. I was then a ghost. Ariana could see me, but said I was blurry. I helped Dad to find a friend of mine.
