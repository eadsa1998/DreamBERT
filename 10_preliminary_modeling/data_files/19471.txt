Faye and Karl at dining table. Karl explains that all landlords figure $5.50 per month for each missing tenant. I remark that this is easily understandable. Karl said we ought to pay off the mortgages and then sell real estate. Asks whether the school hasn't gotten out a better ruler than the defective (or worn out) one he is using, and Faye answers "Yes, I suppose they have" in a playful tone. They smile at each other in a knowing way, as at some subtle witticism.
