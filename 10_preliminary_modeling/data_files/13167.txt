Mom wanted me to do some trick. There was a swamp thing out the back with an elephant in it. Its back was sticking out. I had to slide off it and go over this fence. I had a suspicion that it wasn't an elephant but a huge tiger or deer. After saying no over and over, I did it, but it wasn't an elephant -- it was a dinosaur. I was on its back and it stood up and was really tall and had a cone on its head. Ezra and I were stuck up high and Mom was down below trying to help us with a cardboard box. I told her to get rope and a better box. I thought that I head Eugene's voice and I could see over the fence, but it was that Salim guy.
