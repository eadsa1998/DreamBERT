I was practicing tennis in a room at the Times Square. I had to sign up for the room. Foxworth and Kevin Shellenburg were very upset ??? with the room empty and unused. Then me using it. I had a army duffle bag of tennis balls. A tennis bag ???/ There was an alley behind the gym, covered with blue squares, made into a huge, block-long bed about 20 ft. wide. A huge penguin with wings walked by and then he flew away. In the fish market I looked for fish. I saw lemon sole--but just the fish head like a baby hammer head. And green vegetables on a stick. Tom Brandon said Clemson had 1 tennis court for the whole university campus. He said he understood school and didn't like art enough to become an artist.
