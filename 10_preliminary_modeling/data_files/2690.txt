I am back at work in an office. I am on the phone talking to someone in this huge house I live in. The dancers have arrived and I say, "Oh, good. I can't wait to come be there. I'll finish up here and get home when I can." I turn and a man has come into the office. He's very pompous and upset about the swimming pool. His friend can't swim and nearly drowned. So he wants us to build a better swim pool. Someone tells him we don't have money budgeted for that. He is indignant, that money would be more important than a man's life. I say, annoyed, "Why don't you help him then?" He is upset and says, "I can't swim either." I say, very coolly, "Then learn to swim," and dismiss him. He's one of those demanding crazies and I want to get out of here and go enjoy watching the dancers. Then several other people come in, and I think, "Oh, well, even if I only get to see the night performance, it will be good enough," even though I felt disappointed. A woman wants to join a woman's support group. I notice Jennifer H and another woman there. I say, "Oh, they wanted a group too; three would be big enough to start one, maybe others would join later." We set a time to meet. Then I start a dream group and it is very full. We start working on a dream. Fred tells his dream. Hands are raised with ideas and answers. I act like a teacher, calling on people and lecturing after their response. One woman in front of me really wiggles her hand, wanting to be called on. I feel bad I didn't get to her. Uncle Lionel stands up and writes on a paper the time and puts it up on the wall, like a good student. It's 8:10. I decide we've gone 1/2 hour and so I say, "It's a good enough place to stop." Everyone starts leaving and I say, "Wait, I'm not done yet." A few stand, waiting. I feel a coughing fit coming on and I see a large cup of water. I wave them away, saying, "Never mind."
