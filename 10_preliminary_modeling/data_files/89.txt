I've just come into a room, from outside, with a male companion; this is a place I've been living with my ex, who is also present, and I've recently broken up with him. I'm here to pack up some things I haven't moved out yet, and my ex is really upset about the whole thing. He doesn't start an argument or say anything really inflammatory, but he's seething, as though his pride is hurt and I've done him a great injustice. The other guy is fairly nonchalant - he didn't contribute to any of this, and we're not any big romance, but he is my friend and cares about me - just the same, he isn't anxious to antagonize my ex. As I face away from them (I think I'm sitting at a table or dressing-table), a yellow kitten comes round from behind something to greet me. I'm happy to see him - my ex and I had just gotten him before the breakup and I'd decided he should stay with my ex because I couldn't have all the cats and my ex would need him - but he's adorable and I'm sorry I can't have everything. The kitten's name may be Schroeder. [While I'm dreaming, I try to think of it but S. doesn't seem exactly right and nothing else comes clear.] The kitten is also happy to see me and wants to go with me, but I think (reluctantly) that it's all better this way, we must do what's best. (And I wouldn't want to take him away from my ex.)
