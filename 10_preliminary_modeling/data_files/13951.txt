Calvin came over with my leaver's jacket, but it had "No. 1 No.1" written on it. He did it as a joke. I was then at school, in class. Eugene was in there. I heard some old recordings of mine coming over the speakers. I bolted out of the class to this room where this girl with a black cloth thing on her head was sitting at the desk. I threw stuff at her. I asked the principal to turn it off. I had had a dream about it happening.
