["Going to Alaska."] I am cleaning up, putting things I want to fix in a pile. A jacket with a torn pocket. Ginny comes in and as I am moving things, she helps. I see she put the things in a suitcase. My large black one. I say no, I need that suitcase to pack for Alaska. So I start to take the things out, fat bottle brushes, empty mason jars, clothes and so on. I go back into my room and into the walk in closet. I choose clothes, asking Ginny should I take this jacket, (the one needing a rip in the pocket fixed). She says no. I say it could get cold there, it is Alaska, after all. She says I won't need the jacket. I choose a few outfits and pack them into the suitcase. Then I find the suitcase I'd used the last time I traveled to Alaska. Some books and papers and projects there I could work on. I pack them too.
