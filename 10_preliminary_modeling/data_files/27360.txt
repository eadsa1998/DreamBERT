I dreamed that I was sitting at a counter at the A. V. It was about 1:30 and I was to meet my mother downtown at 3:30. I was very hungry, but no one would wait on me. Then a sailor sat down beside me and put his arm around me. He seemed to be half asleep. I was very insulted, and immediately walked out. I then discovered I had a book of his which merely said "scrapbook" on the front. I decided to return it, but couldn't find him. I then saw a parade of sailors coming down the street. I wrote my name and address inside the book, and said I was sorry I had been so rude to him. I ran up beside one of the sailors (who was a girl) and asked if she could return it. She said she could locate him by the number on the book (which I had not noticed previously).
