Two coworkers and I are on a stage in a club doing a spontaneous performance for the audience. Carol is the lead singer and Marianne is the backup singer. I'm doing a lot of crazy dance moves on the stage while they sing. Carol is flirting with the guys while she is singing. Then we come off the stage and we're drinking. Next thing I know we're in Hollywood coming out of limousines with long sequine dresses with slits on the side. We're going into a building and there are a lot of fans waiting for us.
