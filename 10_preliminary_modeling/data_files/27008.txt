I dreamed I was back in W-- but the college was on the M-- campus. I drove up in front of a barber shop where the sidewalk curb had painted "student parking." I parked there and went into the barber shop. I almost walked into a stag room on my way past the door. Then I walked through a passage way and ended in a large stadium. I was with some girl of my own age (don't remember who) and we went up to the top of a flight of stairs and looked out over a vast stadium in which the M-- D-- festival was being enacted. This festival (in W--) is written by a student and is usually a take-off on some characters like "The Wizard of Oz" or "Mother Goose." There were many people dancing and running through their exercises. When we left there I took my little sister to the school bathroom. This was in Junior High School. I remember this because I had taken her to the boys bathroom. I can't remember what we did from there but we neither of us seemed too excited.
