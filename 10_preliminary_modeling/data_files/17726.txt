I was working at the detox facility again.  I was going to take leftovers to my boyfriend Jeremy.  Downstairs was a candy shop that I went to with my 'brother'- we were both quite young.  Someone at the counter asked my name, and I couldn't trust them- I told them it was Melissa.  I stopped at a gas station, and was surprised to see my 7th grade math teacher Mr. Madsen, though I called him by my 7th grade science teacher's name Mr. Anderson.  One of my old classmates from then was with me and we called him over to talk to us, and see how he was doing- not particularly well.  Then I was at a dance with my brother Stuart and his wife Sheila.  There was jealousy between them.  I was sitting on a ledge at the side, looking at a lavender-spotted bikini that was mine.  I got to grab Lister's butt. (Lister is a character from Red Dwarf.)
