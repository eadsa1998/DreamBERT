Scene laid in our yard in my hometown. I am feeding birds out of a tin pail full of a mixture, one ingredient of which is peanuts, broken into small pieces. I walk across the yard south of the house, being careful not to approach close enough to startle a small flock of birds, perhaps 8 to 10 in number, most or all of which appear to be starlings. They seem to recognize in my a friend. I wish to attract them to the back yard whence I now go and throw out several hands full of the feed; but the birds do not come, as they are by this time accustomed to being fed in the front yard.
