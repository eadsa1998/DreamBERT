["Fluffy dying."] I am in my bed at the 40th street house. Fluffy rockets in and leaps on my chest to try and grab at some yellow stick pins in the wall holding up a large butcher paper drawing. I grab her and take the pins out of her mouth before she swallows them. I am distressed. She is dying. She leaps off the bed and races upside down on the ceiling. I am very surprised at this. Then she leaps to the floor and pushes herself violently against a large crib on the left side of the room. She is on her back and I see her anus poke out and a carrot like object come out and back in. I realize she is dying and feel sad.
