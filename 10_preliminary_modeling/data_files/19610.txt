A rather long entomological dream, all of it lost except the striking appearance of a burnished gold Carabid, about like a good-sized Pteraetichus or a moderate-sized Carabus. Prothorax with sides sinuate posteriorly. It is labeled U. of Ill., and I first took this to indicate that the specimen had been collected in Illinois. Someone pointed out, however, that there was another label of the pins -- a very small one on which was written in fine, precise longhand "Afton, Va."
