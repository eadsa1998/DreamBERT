My sister and I were at Madonna's mansion, but it was more like Michael Jackson's Neverland ranch, like an amusement park setting in her backyard. We were at the entrance and suddenly someone in a pale yellow convertible, but with the top up, bug drove up very recklessly and sped through the front gates (which happened to be open). As the person drove past, I recognized that it was Michael Jackson, wearing his trademark fly sunglasses and possibly the glove. As soon as he had made it in the gate, out of the woodwork appeared all these secret service kinds of guys. Within an instant out came another yellow vw bug. The secret service men preceded to rush to my sister and put a wig and sunglasses on her and put her in the car and off she drove. While it was happening I was thinking they were using her as an impostor Michael Jackson to make it seem like he was actually leaving when in fact he really was still there.
