I was flying around. I flew to the ceiling in the shop and rested in the air. Wiatrak said he could fly, so I said, "You practice for a month and if you can fly, then I will give you or bet you a $100 that you can't." I got a garden hose all tangled up. There was a big storm coming up. We were indoors just waiting for it to come up. I ran up a ramp to get ahead of two friends of mine who were walking by way of a shortcut.
