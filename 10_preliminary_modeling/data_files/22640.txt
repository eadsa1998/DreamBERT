The time of my report does not affect my story. It is anyway very brief and confused. It was daytime and it wasn't very cold, a regular day with nothing special about it. The telephone rang, and I felt great certainty in answering it, and I said, "Yes?" I felt as though I knew who the person calling was, but it wasn't the person I thought (I suppose).
