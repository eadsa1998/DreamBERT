My wife Bonita and I were in New York or some other big city (possibly Quebec).  Wayne and Joyce were with us, but whether in the same car, I'm not sure.  They had a baby and wanted to borrow our car seat and car bed.  I knew Bonita wouldn't like the idea at all, so I tried to make excuses for not lending those items to them.  I don't remember what excuse I used for the car seat, but I told them the bed smelled like cat urine.  I think we ended up lending them the car bed anyway; I'm not sure about the seat.
