I was watching a movie. A spy lady had been married to this low-life guy. He went after her kid and her love interest (unknowingly). She came to the place he was holding them. Also, there was some special knife. This guy got stabbed and fell into some water and died, but he got back up. The spy lady came and shot them. I was with some people there. There was a big gate and I went to go around and she shot this other dude. I asked "why didn't I hear your gun click?" and she said "no-one can" and I said "Oh yeah a silencer, duh!". I told her new boyfriend she was married to him. I went inside and the guy said something, like "think I've seen this before". The bad dude tried to run me off the road.
