We had a contest giving 1st prize to best way to treat a customer. Mike F. won by saying he would be nice to people and talk nice and softly to them. We were playing ball and I hit them far and hard. I seemed to be the best one on the team. We were in Pittsburgh. I took Judy by the hand and we went on a bridge. We looked down into the water at a boat. There were two beetles flying around. They landed on the ceiling, walked around, then fell to the floor with the paper someone pasted up for them to stick up there. One of the horses I have picked won, but I don't know which one it is.
