I was returning to work after having taken a few days off. I walked in and began to change into my work clothes. I came out of the office and began to notice things were different. All of the managers were different, none of them were anyone I knew. Also, the restaurant was set up differently, almost backwards from what I remember. I was a bit confused but kept going on. I thought about how they had made so much change in such a short time, but didn't dwell in these thoughts. I began to work, me being the only one I knew, everyone else was different.
