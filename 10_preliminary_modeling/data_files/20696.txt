I was living in an unfamiliar house. My mother tied my ankles to the bed as I lay on my back, so that I would not get upset. I looked outside the window. Three shade trees, about 30 feet tall, were outside. Some of the leaves were turning brown. The sun was setting, and the rays shown through the trees making a reddish brown light in the trees. The beautiful light fascinated me.
