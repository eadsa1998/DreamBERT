I was in bed asleep, and when I woke up, our open house was going on.  Peter and Irene Patrickson, and her mother, were sitting at my bedside.  I was embarrassed, and anxious to get up and get dressed, but they began asking me about how Lila was doing.  I tried to tell them about the macular degeneration, but couldn't think of the word "macular," so I said "retinal."  Irene's mother said she had had the same thing, and she really missed seeing things.  One of her eyes looked in a different direction from the other one.  <p
