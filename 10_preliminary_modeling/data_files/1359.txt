I am at a dance. I look lovely in a long dress. A young man comes up and asks me to go out with him. I immediately say, "No!" very firm. I say, "It's my policy not to go out with anyone here." Then I sit down at a table. I am sandwiched between two men, one is the one I refused. I start wondering why I turned him down, aware that it scares me to think of going out with someone. I leave. The other man follows me. He likes me and I am attracted to him. He doesn't ask me anything. He just engages me in conversation and I enjoy being around him. [BL]
