All I an remember is going through a house then into a garden maze. It turned out to be one of those "group" skills activities, but it took me a while to find my group. They had found many clues already, so I wasn't that helpful. I think we won. Setting: In someone's house, there's a maze. Characters: Glenn, Anna, Robin and/or other person. Feelings and Thoughts: Smart. Kind of a skimpy dream.
