I had a really scary dream that I was studying abroad in some small Italian town. I had a weird Italian cell phone that wouldn't make calls, only receive them. I went into my apartment one day and five strange men I had never seen before had broken in. I started feeling like I was choking on the air and couldn't breathe. I tried to grab a baseball bat nearby but it was stuck to the floor. I started freaking out and ran out of the apartment to some building where Michelle and Gus were. They assured me that everything was ok. I left to go do something but when I returned to their apartment, the five men were there too. I was really scared and found Andy, who drove me away. Then I woke up and fell back asleep and had a new dream. In this dream, I was walking through a giant shadowbox that had all these unknown Picasso figurines he had carved as a boy. I picked one up that was a little bird painted purple and yellow. It was so cute and sort of looked like a more cartoonish version of his neo-classical stuff. I was so amazed that I had never seen any of this before --what a disappointment to wake up and realize it's not real!
