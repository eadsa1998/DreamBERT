In the dream my wife and I are living in some city of the Soviet Union. We have done something or other which has greatly offended everybody who were formerly quite friendly to us. I go out of this one house where we were visiting people who were once our friends and were not mad at us. The man's wife is especially mad at me. So I go out of the house and go across the street, and want to do something to make amends. I'm apparently working as an architect and I decide I'll make a model of a new home for her, which will be just what she wanted and will serve as an apology. So I scoop up a big pile of snow and proceed to model a home out of it which stands about, oh, about 3 ft. high, I guess, several feet long. The snow takes on the proper colors the brick house has. It becomes red where the bricks are, some other color for the roof, flagstone on some of the porches; it takes on that color. It becomes a realistic and quite a nice-looking model home. About the time I was finishing modeling this, I looked up and someone was walking down the street and I think it looks familiar. Sure enough, it turns out to be an old friend of mine, Bob Ganders.  We greet each other and I ask him what he is doing in the city where I go to graduate school , and he tells me his little girl is very sick and he's brought her back to the hospital. It doesn't seem incongruous at the time that he's brought her back all the way from a large faraway city to the city where I go to graduate school . I tell him how sorry I am that she is sick, I'd do anything I can. We make small talk a minute.
