 I see a party scene where Tommy, the main character from the movie Tommy Boy, is host. Police come to break up the scene, or just to check things out. Tommy confronts them, tossing them two cups for beer, so they let the party continue. Tommy then jumps in the police vehicle, which is a white truck with a big cargo area, and people pile into it. They drive away leaving the policemen without a vehicle.
