I'm going camping and packing things up for the trip. The girls have tossed in a bunch of their underwear without trying to neatly pack it. I stuff things in a duffle bag. Bonnie suggests we take something pretty to wear for Saturday night. I say I have some thing, but I don't really want to party then, I'll be too tired. Dovre, younger, maybe pre-teen, decides to go explore a ship on the river. I watch her go in and then get concerned. Is she safe? I go to the ship and pound on the door. There's a surly captain and rough-looking crew men. I ask if anyone saw Dovre come in. They shake their heads no. I demand to see the Captain. He comes to me, looking mean and noncommittal. I ask him if he has seen my daughter. He says no. I say, "She came in here." He says, "I'll ask the men if they've seen her." I suspect they are hiding her and intend to rape her later. I say to him firmly, "If you are a man, you'll ask your men that question with authority behind it. If you care about her safety, then they will." He smiles coldly. I don't trust him. I say, "If you don't genuinely try to find her, then I'll get the police." He says, "Id rather you got the police. The men wouldn't like it if I acted that way" (concerned for the girl). I say, "Fine, I'll get the police." He says, "I'll go with you." We walk toward the police station. We sit for a moment and I say something like, "You're just half a man."
