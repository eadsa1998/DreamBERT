At church: I am with people from Church and the Book Cafe and Zena. We sit in the second pew. Suddenly I discover that I forgot my purse; so I have to drive all the way back to pick it up. When I return I see Zena trying on clothes with her friend Lori, and she is annoyed at me but I say "I will only stay a minute" and leave.
