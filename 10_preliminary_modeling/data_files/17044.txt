I had just gotten out of some test or workshop and was outside, on campus. I was walking around, on my way to someplace. Half of the time I was me, and half of the time I was a pretty dark-haired woman. I was walking on a path by a dormitory when I heard a rustling in the leaves. I looked down and it was a snake slithering through the leaves. Then I hear a commotion in the branches of the tree next to me. I looked up and saw that it was the same woman who had been in my place. She was naked and sitting curled up on a branch by the center of the tree. All of a sudden, she disappeared and turned into the snake, which slithered down the tree.
