I am a member of the war underground. Burt Lancaster is the officer in charge. I must go on a mission, using my best sexual charms to allure an enemy to give info. Burt loves me, so this is hard for him. I love him and feel that duty is stronger than my love. I know I must sacrifice his good feelings toward me. Two old, fatherly men help me get dressed up like a matador's dressing ceremony. They are pleased with how lovely and alluring I look. They beam with fatherly pride. They pull open the curtains so the awaiting platoon of soldiers can see me. There is a pause as they are so overwhelmed with my sexy beauty. Everyone approves except Burt, who'd like this beauty for himself. I go up to the streets. After the mission is over, I am returning to the underground. I step into a tiny toilet room. I see flowers floating in the bowl. I flush them down as a signal that I'm ready. Next I step into the bowl and flush myself down the toilet. I am concerned. I won't fit, I'll get stuck and drown. The water comes to my lips and I say, "Go slowly," even though I feel like it should go fast so I won't drown. Then the "other me" gets up off the toilet and goes out, the door a heavy slab of wall that falls into the street. Two young boys (street urchins) put it back. I walk into a store and see a young woman being chased by the police or secret service man (store detective type). She runs toward the back of the store and is blocked by a grand piano in a window. She's very upset and then decides to go around it to the right. She's now in the back work room where the elves put things together. The head elf (fatherly like the men who dressed me) sees her and says to the other elves, "See her?" Do anything she asks as if she were me." They agree. He lets her pass to the secret entrance to the underground. I say, "And me too?" He smiles and says, "And her too."
