I was watching Arrested Development. There was something called, what looks like, 'railpots'. Someone asked "What are they anyway? They're never around when you need them?". And something that looks like 'boat in the water, out of the water'. There was laughing. I was talking to George Bluth and he didn't know what railpot was. Eugene had sold the rights to Mr Banana Grabber and Gob was selling them again and it was in boxes of stuff. Eugene was telling him that he couldn't. There were two Asians and Eugene said he wanted food as a trade. I remember Tobias was around as well.
