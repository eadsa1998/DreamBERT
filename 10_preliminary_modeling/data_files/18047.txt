One day I was in the store with my friends and then something was gonna happen. So we ran out the door, got back in the car and got back home. Well then my friend Kathy she had little tiny bird eggs like canaries. We all got to keep 3 and I put it in something-a little box-a teeny tiny one and then I put warm water in it. Well I decided not to put them in the big box just to put it in the little box not to put it in two things. Then it was time for me to leave my real home and I took the eggs with me, and then when we got home Rayna came over and we found an orange cat laying in our backyard. Then he started scratching me and then we brought him in the house and we started petting him and playing with him and cuddling him and picking him up.
