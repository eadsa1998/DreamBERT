My sister Valerie (15 years old), my mom and I were all in Mom's bedroom. We saw this ghost appear. The door was closed, and the door opened. We told it to go. Then we went in our room and went to sleep. The next morning or the next night we saw another ghost. We thought this was really scary. The ghost was white, and it had the kind of head that Casper has. I told it to go to the light.
