There was a gardening contest going on between these men. They all had flower boxes that were the size and shape of my small plastic paint trays. They were filled with dirt but you couldn't see anything growing in them. Maybe they had planted seeds. There was one in particular that I thought would win the competition but I don't know why I thought that.
