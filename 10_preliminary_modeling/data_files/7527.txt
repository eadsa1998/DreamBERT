Mary and I are walking along a very wide boulevard. I am not paying too much attention to Mary, who is to my left, and very slightly behind me. I am very enthralled by the grand, elegant buildings on the left side of the boulevard. They extend along that side as far as I can see. I am most impressed with their grandeur. At one point I think I see, on a distant roof ahead of us, someone on that roof. But upon closer examination, it is not a person but a statue. On the building closest to us, I can see many statues and busts ringing the walls of that building. I am very delighted with these buildings, and I tell Mary how wonderful they are, compared to the terrible "square boxes" that are being built nowadays. When I begin to talk to Mary, I look in her direction. She looks terribly weary and seems barely able to walk. She is wearing a print (grayish) dress. I immediately go over to her, gather her in my arms, and ask, "You're tired, aren't you, Honey?" She answer, "Yes, Ed, I'm very tired."
