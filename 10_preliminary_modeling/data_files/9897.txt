Frank and I are all dressed up to go to gala performance of the ballet. We stand on a huge bed, like Eric Scott's bed in his opera hospital. There are many people there, including the Pearsons. But Frank gets antsy and wants to leave early, even before it has begun. We run home in the rain. I change clothes and arrange the house. Lots of kids playing around, noise and mess. Marissa Camden comes to visit me. It is Christmas and I give her some presents. She is anxious and still angry at me, she is not comfortable, especially with the noise of the kids. I must take Zena to a play she is in, so I drive her to the play and have to stay or want to stay a while. See dancers and actors, also see the Pearsons again. "We sure go to a lot of ballets together." Then I finally leave, see funny things in the street, like a lady in a blue coat in a wheelchair, being pushed across an intersection with water spurting across and getting her wet. I arrive home and Marissa has left no note; only presents all stacked in a corner in the kitchen; and all pictures taken off the wall; why? I feel hurt and start to clean up and an older lady from Church comes for counseling with her husband. She sees that children are playing and is so happy again, she says she no longer needs counseling...
