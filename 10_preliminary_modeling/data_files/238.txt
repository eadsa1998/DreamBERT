I've got to go somewhere, and I'm undecided whether to go on the bus or not. I drive my car for a while, then decide it would be better to go on the bus. I stop - this is an urban area, but not downtown - and think I'll pick up the bus here. But then I realize this isn't a good place to leave my car that long, they'll tow it away. So I go back to where I started from, where I know I can leave the car, but now I realize I'll be in trouble getting back to it. The bus goes to the garage on the return journey, and it's halfway across downtown from here (which is, like, the edge of downtown, the outskirts - I guess I work around here). I'd have to walk a pretty fair distance, and it'll be late. Yuck. Now I'm thinking maybe it would be better if I go back where I stopped before. But the bus will be here soon. Can I make it there before the bus does? I have serious doubts. I mean, what if I get held up? I'd miss it altogether, and if I stay here I know I'll get it.
