The smaller girl, a blond in pink, was carried in to take part in the pageant. The taller brunette began to cry and say she wouldn't take part because she should have been first. I hurried after her as she left and finally persuaded her to return by saying I wanted to see her and this would be my last chance as I was leaving the next day.
