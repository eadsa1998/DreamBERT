I needed to go to university and Mom wanted to pick Ezra up along the way. I was annoyed because it wasn't on the way there, but I had to pick up some clothes anyway. It looked different and fancier. The beach was different too and there were lots of shops. I went to the movies and saw an animated film with Mia Kirshner as one of the voice actors. I mentioned it to Benjamin later on the Movies group. I was then at the shop and there was a weird bird thing with a baby and you had to let it sniff you or it would attack. It kicked my leg. I left with Dad and Ezra. Then I was at the shop with Mom and there were broken ornaments. Mom asked a lady why and she told us about these people who brought them back saying they were broken but had come back months later admitting it had been their fault. They were back to try and become friends with her to get something out of her and she cried. Jake Johnson was at a shop offering people free samples and called me out and gave me a Snickers.
