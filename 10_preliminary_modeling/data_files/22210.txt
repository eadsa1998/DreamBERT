I dreamed that my younger sister was dead; that is, that she had been murdered. She was in the room, on the floor, covered with blood. I went to the living room and found a man of black race, half naked, and with a knife in his hand. I had never seen him before. I was very scared. I thought perhaps he would kill me too.
