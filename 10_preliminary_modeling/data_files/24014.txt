I always have this dream, about once every two weeks. I was at my old school on the field and I could fly, but I had to get a running start. Sometimes I fell if there were more than one person watching. In my dreams I am almost blind. I can only open my eyes halfway, so I couldn't see the people, but I could hear their voices. My mom was there talking to my teacher. I could see them a little if I'd push my eyes up with my hands. Then she was coming to see me, but I had to go to my next class. So I left into a cave with my 14-year-old sister and her class. Then I woke up in the hallway on the carpet away from my room.
