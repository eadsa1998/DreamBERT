I am captive. A mean, horrible man, his wife and sons torture me. I am tied up and forced to have sex. I'm injured and hurt frequently. I can only go to the bathroom when they want me to. I am tied up to a pulley and pulled up off the floor by my hands. I must pee on command in a bottle. I am terrified of this horrible man who would hurt me just for the heck of it. I am totally helpless and trapped. The wife complains because he's a man so he gets all the best chances to hurt. She's sort of an enabler for him. A young man, a son, weakly protests at the cruelty of the father.
