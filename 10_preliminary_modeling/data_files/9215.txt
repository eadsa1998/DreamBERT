I had someone come to the house to work on my plumbing. The drain in my upstairs bathroom was clogged. After he had finished his work he told me that I should not stand by the sink to brush my hair, because hair is what has caused the clog. He was telling me that I should always stand away from the sink so the loose hair would fall on the floor. I said, that way I can just vacuum the fallen hair. He said, yes.
