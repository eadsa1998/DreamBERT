I was standing in front of the school cafeteria and somehow pricked my finger. Then I was suddenly standing in front of the fireplace at the frat house. My finger was sore so I tied a string around it in order to see it more clearly. Then I saw what I thought was a very short hair right under the surface of the skin of my finger. I tried to pull it out but it began to more and went through my hand, up my arm and to my shoulder. As it began to move I saw that it had an illuminous head. this particular night it was my turn to help with the supper dishes of the frat house. I told one of the boys I would have to wash the dishes then because I had to see a doctor about the thing in my finger. We walked out into the backyard which looked like a desert. There were dishes on all sides that had to be washed but none were dirty. After a short while I got the dishes washed, borrowed a red bicycle and left for the doctor's office.
