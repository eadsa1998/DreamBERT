[c. 1993-94] In bed, I was with my father, I could picture sitting with him in the front seat of his 1987 Dodge 600 and we were going along and he said: "My God I can see the funnel!" A tornado was coming. I said "oh boy!" And we just drive right into it and all of a sudden we're picked up and we're driving and we're spinning around in the air. We're just spinning and spinning and spinning like a top, but still we're able to propel ourselves forward and when the tornado goes away, we're set down just as nice as you please and we're able to keep right on driving. Just as if nothing has happened.
