Inside a building. McAtle, standing at head of stairway, calls down to Kellogg in basement "I didn't know you were deaf in summer." Carrying an index card, on which are stamped several numbers in purplish-blue ink (evidently stamp pad ink) I descend the stairway. Kellogg, his face flushed in characteristic manner, is squatting on his haunches partly behind the stairway. He seems to be somewhat plastered by what McAtle said, but the flush is due in part to anger, as he believes our loose talk has injured his reputation.
