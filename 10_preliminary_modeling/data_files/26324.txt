 I'm with my cousin Melvin Redding flying along Main Street. He is hanging onto me, with his arms around my neck. He may be sick. We fly, going towards my friend Kevin Simpson's house. The wind is really strong, and we can't fly. I yell for Melvin to grab hold of a tree trunk, and I do this too. We cling to a tree and the wind blows furiously, lifting our bodies off the ground so they are horizontal! It seems I'm at or near my neighbor Alvin Broud's house. My cousin Rich Redding is sick. His mother Sheila brings him some noodle-like food that usually makes him feel better. She walks down Hill Avenue, from an area near Broud's, across 2nd Street. Something is done with waffles. I bring Melvin to his home, and Rich to my home. This may be a dream within a dream. I'm on the back of a car with Rich. The rear windshield is covered with dirt and dust. I scrape some off, and suggest to Rich that he clean it, because this may benefit him. We ride outside this car to my home. I suggest to Rich that his illness may be psychosomatic. We arrive home. Rich and Melvin are there, sitting at opposite sides of a huge wooden table that is covered with a white tablecloth, in the kitchen. I start to tell my mom and Sheila about the great dream I had (which is a portion of this dream). There is a huge sheet of beef jerky, about 2'x2', that we have received form people we know that my mom is friends with. The sheet is against or partially wrapped in white cloth. The outside layers of the jerky are dry, and the inside is juicy.
