Mary and I have just moved into this older house. We are in the process of fixing it up -- doing some paperhanging and making some repairs. It is a large house and has many rooms, which are bright and airy. There are many people in the house, including the men doing the repair work. Everyone is making a great deal of noise. I get annoyed with one woman who is jumping or dancing and making lots of noise. I ask her to leave. When I tell her about sending the woman home, Mary points out that that woman is the wife of our paperhanger. I don't know whether we laughed at this, but we certainly did not take it seriously. I can't see Mary clearly, but I know it is she. We are young -- in our mid or late 20's. In another dream scene, Mary calls us to dinner. I see two children who appear to be 4 or 5 years old. I assume they are ours, but neither is Maria, Robert or Adam. As we leave one room to get to the dining room, we have to go through a small iron railing. The railing looks familiar to me. I tell Mary that we had had it in storage but retrieved it when we bought this house where we had it installed. We are using the railing as a partition -- much like a safety gate.
