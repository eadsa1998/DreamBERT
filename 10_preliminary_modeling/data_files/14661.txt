I was in a forest and it was like Lost. I was with some others and we wandered off. There were cabins. I went into one and someone walked past and we freaked out and ran. I got a message somehow to go to this place. I went but then it was like university and there was a huge lecture theatre and awards thing. At the bottom, Raquel and two girls were there. We sat on the floor but then Raquel found chairs for me and her.
