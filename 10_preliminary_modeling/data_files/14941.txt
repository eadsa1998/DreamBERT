Mom showed me this loop/edited video of a tornado. It showed a house with a girl outside and it got blown away to another house and she was still there. Happy Hunting Ground came on and I was like 'I love this song!' and started singing "it's fair, fair game inside" and the last line. Mom was like "I'm glad a song you like came on". I was on IMDb later. Someone was asking who sang Killer Klowns From Outer Space and someone replied that it was The Dickies and the original poster said it wasn't. I replied that it was, although the post was from 2007. I was then with some guy and it was dark. The clowns from Killer Klowns From Outer Space were around. This guy got bitten and his girlfriend tried to go to him and he turned into one of them. She tried to help him but he bit her. We ran. It was hard to see and I had to keep waiting for my eyes to adjust. I ran from one and at one point, it stopped and ran back (like in World of Warcraft, when you get too far from their starting point). I mentioned it to the guy. We got to a soccer oval and hid behind the goal posts (there were four). Then a clown saw me and it started coming towards me. I threw bits of a tissue at it and other stuff to distract it (it had worked with some of them).
