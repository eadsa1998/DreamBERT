Dreamed about going to Angel Island with my mother. I was worried about being late but my mother wasn't. I got irritated with her and asked her to ask my father [who has been dead for four years] to drive us. My father and mother wanted to walk instead of drive. Then we were walking and we saw two Manta Rays swimming in the gutter. My dad almost stepped on one. They stuck out their tongues which were very long. Also something vague about computers in an attic -- a house like my house but different. I think Pearl was there.
