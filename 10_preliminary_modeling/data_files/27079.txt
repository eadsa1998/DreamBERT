In this dream I was in a class room situation. I was standing before the class giving a talk. The subject concerned the problem of learning to speak before a group. I was saying that I had read or been acquainted with a boy who was very insecure about reciting in front of a class, but made himself talk before the class. I told this class that I had felt the same way, and that I had to force myself to stand before a class and do public speaking. As I was talking I could feel myself completely relaxed and very much at ease. There was a discussion following this in which I took a very active part.
