The following dream was filled with anxiety. I had trouble sleeping all night and through the whole dream I was fighting off these aliens. Harry was there too but he seemed distant though he was assisting me in fighting off the aliens. It was as if he was speaking to me through water. We did, however, successfully defend the non-descript city (a mix of two cities I know) from the aliens.
