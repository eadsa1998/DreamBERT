I dreamed that I was walking with Megan in my home state, and I had to go to school soon or something, because I was really nervous. I knew Kylie went to school here, so I called her and told her to meet me at the boathouse, where she could help me. But then I was at the Olympics watching my brother swim. There was an ancient pool table, and you had to use swords instead of pool sticks. I had this major crush on Sam, but Jon liked me, and my father only wanted me to see Jon, not Sam. It was just a big mess!
