["Athletic lovers."] I am a high school girl on the basketball team. A high school boy is the best male basketball player and we are pretty equal in prowess. We enjoy the competition of playing well together on the team. There is also a love attraction. I play forward, and seem to be more in a volleyball stance at the non net area. We play hard and enjoy the speed and power. Then he insists I play catcher in a baseball game, another game he is good at. I put on the protective front chest protector and a mitt. I don't know this game as well. He helps me put on the protective gear. We are playing the game in the high school hall and we are at a t corner of two halls. I have to catch and pass a fast ball and hit a small child in the head. I feel terrible. I race over away from her so my next throw won't hurt her. I have to decide which way down the perpendicular hall I must throw. I feel inept in this game and resent the fact that he insists I do this, changing the enjoyment of our teamwork in the basketball game. Now a cheerleader girl comes over and flirts with him and he upset with me, asks her to the dance. I am very hurt. Sad. I accept a date with another jock, but it is the first man I love. Finally he comes to me and touches a deep bone bruise he had created by accidentally hitting me with the baseball in the game. He is remorseful and tenderly realizes he has hurt me. He asks my forgiveness and kisses me gently. We are back together again.
