I was in a building that appeared to be an institution. I and other men were told to fill in some holes that were in the floor with furniture. I didn't think there was enough furniture to fill the holes and make the floor level and solid. Then a patient named Clew appeared in this dream. He wrote a poem about a shirt that I owned. The shirt had to be put into one of the holes in the floor.
