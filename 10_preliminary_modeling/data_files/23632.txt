We are in a futuristic place with interesting machines that have their own ideas. A woman is there to thank me for coming. And to say how much she got out of it. It has to do with the return, with going back over an enormous distance. We're meeting with this man who is tall and bulky, balding with red curly hair. He says, "Sure we've met before. I know you." "Oh, yeah, I can recognize you somehow," I reply. "You're vaguely familiar." He says, "Yes, you have the other part of John (colleague)." I say, "No," but I remember being at the funeral. John has been cremated and the ashes were split and this man took one part and I the other. He said: "Yes, when you went to the bush you brought the ashes with you." We're standing in some kind of kitchen and my wife has introduced us.
