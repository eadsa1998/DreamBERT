I was working at the observatory again.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in the dorm room, and we had all our stuff that we were going to move into the apartment.  When the time came, I left the dorm room to go out for spotting.  I was carrying a lot of the stuff for the apartment with me.  I had Jeremy's coat, and only a small flashlight I found in his pocket rather than a stronger one; I almost called Jeremy to bring me a better one.  I also had two bowls of soup with me for some reason.  There were quite a few people.  Someone told me to go upstairs to find a book one of the astronomers was looking for.  They thought maybe one of the other guests had taken it back to their dorm room.  Along with someone else, I went upstairs.  There was a young boy playing with lots of stuffed animal key chains.  His father was around the counter.  The other person went to look for the book.  I knelt down next to the boy and looked at one of the key chains.  I asked the boy something about them.  He told me not to touch them.  He was 'taking them apart' like in some TV show- dissection.  I thought that was kind of disgusting.  I asked him how old he was; 9 _.  And he was 'playing' dissection.  I was appalled.  Then the professor who wanted the book came in.  He was a big man; I was afraid.  Something was weird about his eyes.  He was standing in the doorway and on the wall to the left were two green eyes.  I watched as the pupil of the eye on the right changed from round to the shape of an animal.  Somehow they were his eyes.  We went down the hallway.  He wanted to 'burrito' me.  He bent down to touch his eyeballs to me.  They were...juicy.  The whole eyeballs were orange-brown color and there was something very disgusting about them.
