I am with a good-looking man. He and I have had some difficulty in the sexual part of our relationship. I feel a freeing feeling, exhilaration because now I want to make it work. I look forward to being sexual with him. Then we are in bed, but he's Uncle Wilbur. I'm feeling very disappointed. At first I feel, "Oh well, maybe it will work out," and then I feel the old, "Oh well, I'll just fake it again" feeling.
