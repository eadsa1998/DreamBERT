I was at school and it was different. We were getting tickets for graduation. Mom and Ezra got our tickets at the library. They left. I had to get a 'fracture form' because I had hurt my ankle ages ago. This lady had been writing very neat and spaced. It said 'Sydney Fox' who was a teacher. I asked "is it a 'y' or an 'I'?" and she had written 'y', but I thought 'I'. I saw an official sheet and it had spelled it with a 'y'. I was then waiting outside for Mom. Eugene was nearby with his friends. Jeremiah was telling him about Facebook. I got my phone out and took a photo but it wasn't on silent, so I moved it away and the photo was blurry. I put it on silent but he moved. They were sitting on the grass further away and it showed thought bubbles. Eugene's brother Rodney was there too. I took a photo of them. Bradley was next to him. I remembered Calvin saying that Bradley was ugly. Then I had a car. I drove out while trying to call Mom. I was on the road and the speed limit sign said "Q" which meant 75. It was then a bridge, which was right on top of the water. Then there was some really pretty water. It was jelly like and bright blue. There was a lot more of it further on. Then I wasn't in car and I was in it. It was cool and felt really nice. The waves rolled over me and I just lay there. It was in a place called Sublima. Then I had a car again and I didn't know how to get out. There were chocolates in a shelf. Most of them were nutty and one was a Violet Crumble. I waited for Mom.
