I went to a party. The house was like across the road from our house (which was connected to it by a hall). I don't think I knew anyone there, but I had a drink. There were "77" of us, according to someone. We all tried to lie in a circle and I fell asleep. At 3am, I woke up and went home. Mom greeted me. I went to see Ezra and he was on the computer playing a game, which changed every 10 seconds. He said it was Final Fantasy.
