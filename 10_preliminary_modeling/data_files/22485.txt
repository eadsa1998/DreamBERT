I was in a very big, old house full of stairs, mirrors, corners, and big heavy doors with a lot of carvings. The house was not well kept and yet there was a party in which I saw my classmates at the university. The two nicest professors at the university were there with two of my classmates who, even though they are not very pretty, are nevertheless very flirty. Then I saw myself in a mirror and saw that I looked terrible. I had a horrible dress on which didn't suit me. Anyway, I looked awful. When I saw this, I started to run around the house and at last I found the exit, but the exit of the house was precisely the door of the university. Then I turned around and saw the two girls coming out of there with the two professors and they went walking. At the corner they turned to look at me and laughed.
