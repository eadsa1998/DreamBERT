I got into a boat and the waves rocked me so much. I tried to paddle with my hands and couldn't do it. I touched bottom with my feet and got to shore. This water was supposed to be in Mary Lasko's basement. I saw a card where Grandpa was trying to get some kind of pension. He wanted $14 for lodge money. There were two wild horses. They ran for me. I ran away and flew out of the way. I accidentally dumped Mary Lasko's noodles into the sink water. I picked them out of the water to rinse off. I went to a couple of shoemakers to get a pair of shoes fixed and I finally come to one who fixed them.
