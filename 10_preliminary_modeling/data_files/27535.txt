I dreamt that I was in a country club and noticed a number of black-clad women going to a funeral of a young girl, whom I didn't know. She had been murdered at the country club. While I walked down a corridor, another girl was murdered by a knife which someone threw. I began to be terrified. A young, tall blonde man about 25 or so, offered to take me home. He said that I ought to wait while he ordered a taxi. Finally he returned and we made our way out of the place. A middle-aged man was crouchlng before a blue smoky blaze and he mumbled and chanted in a loud voice. I understood that the murdered girl had been cremated and these were her last remains. Suddenly, the man came toward me, as if to kill me, too. Just as he came close enough to touch me, I awoke.
