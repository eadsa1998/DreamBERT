I dreamed I was in the shower one evening around 10:000 when I heard my name being called on the dormitory intercommunications system. I put on my housecoat and ran down three flights of stairs to the telephone. The person on the other end of the line was Howard M. (16, a boy whom I date). He said the reason he called was to tell me that a drugstore had opened up across the street from my father's store and would take away a lot of business from my father. He hung up then and I went upstairs and told the girls that I was very disgusted because Howard had called me up just to tell me that my father had competition from a drug store across the street and didn't ask me to go out.
