 I'm with the Lorenz family waiting for the arrival of Jim Lorenz and maybe my mom. We're in Carter church. A ceremony takes place that involves my mom. I move from the back of church to the pews. My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles is in front of me. My friend Jill Banks is near me. I feel strange being in church, as if I'm reverting to the days of old. I walk, and my footsteps are very loud.
