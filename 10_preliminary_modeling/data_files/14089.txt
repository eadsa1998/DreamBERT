I had this girl friend and I liked her brother and thought he liked me. We were in this place which had chairs going down in steps, and a stage at the bottom. She was on a quiz show and had just won the latest episode. Dad asked me if it would be ok if she won again and I was like 'yeah, why wouldn't it be?'. We grabbed some stuff and left. We were in this carpark with the school at this place. I thought we were doing some Runescape thing. I wrote something on my foot. Elijah, Ezra and others came through this small space near some stairs. I started miming Tongue Tied and doing the motions. This girl saw me and was wondering what I was doing. I walked around the stairs. We had to these activities and take photos of us doing them. There was a trampoline and Silas was on it. There was a shelf with stuff on it just next to it. I got the camera off it. There was a photo of Silas, Samantha and someone. There were photos of me and Ezra when we were younger too.
