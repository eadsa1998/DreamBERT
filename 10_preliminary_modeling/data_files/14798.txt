I was at a park and it was night. Jayson and Ezra were there. Jayson brought a girl and I said to get rid of them after this guy did something that I can't read. We needed to take Ezra to the doctors. I took their car and told Jayson to follow behind in my car. We got there and went inside and then it was a shop. There were traffic lights in the shop and one set was out. We were lining up then I had to go back to the car. There was a photo of Samantha and she was then in the shop with Cyndi. When I got back they weren't allowing any more people in. I called out to Ezra but he couldn't hear me. This lady said they were dead but then she realized they weren't and I was talking to Ezra but she mentioned to him that it was all on file and he wanted to leave. We threw this bit of paper around and went out the door? This lady said they really liked his introduction. This song, "crisp old fingers" came on and I liked it and started singing along.
