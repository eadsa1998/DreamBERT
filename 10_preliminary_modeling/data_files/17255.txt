My good online friend Del (who had just visited for a week) returned, but we didn't get a chance to cuddle.  I had to leave.  Something about my maternal Grandma Jane that wasn't good.  My brother Stuart and I went to the grocery store because they said if you exit and come back you get two free items.  He chose a very large bagel.  For some reason I was upset with him and kicked him in the butt twice.
