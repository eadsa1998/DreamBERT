This dream isn't very significant and I'm running out of tape, but I have a feeling it will mean something some day, so here we go. Last night I dreamt that we at this theater like Performing Arts Center, and this black usher lady was talking to the sound technician to see if she could get us a little closer to the board. And the sound technician says, "Well, I'm not the one to talk to, but I know this area is reserved for military people." And so Mom and Dad recommended that I just go to my seat, which was at at the far end of the balcony where I really sat to see the Zarzuela (Spanish musical play). So I started climbing the stairs, and I got to the third floor, and there were living habitations up there with bedrooms and bathrooms and stuff. And somehow I knew that people lived up there. And I got so lost and so turned around up there that I just, I looked out the window and I was talking to Mom and Dad, I was like almost in tears. And they said, "Just come on down the stairs and we'll be outside." So then I was outside, and this was really weird. I was swinging on this swing, and pulling myself up and climbing the ropes and singing, "Can You Feel the Love Tonight," trying to get up to this little platform thing. And then I woke up.
