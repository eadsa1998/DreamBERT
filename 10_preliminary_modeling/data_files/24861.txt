I was sitting in a candle and I was humming a song which turned out to be the thing that was protecting me. The candle was not the usual yellow but a red-orange color. Suddenly, people surrounded me and started trying to figure out how to help me get out. I wanted to tell them I was fine, but I couldn't stop humming. Setting: In a candle. Characters: Me (and random people I don't know). Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, anxious, calm. It was a weird dream, because during it I felt I knew I was having a dream.
