My friend, Bull (who has cancer) and his son, Don (who died recently) and another boy, probably my son, are sleeping at our house. They are all kids. I know Don is dead and we have to get the body out. Bull seems to be dead also. I am calling Bull by his real name, Paul which I never normally do. His eyes are blank but then he comes out of it and seems to be in a fog but he gets well.
