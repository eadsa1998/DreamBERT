I was at home, which was different. We were sitting in the lounge room which had a window to the driveway on the left and in front of us was the front door. I was telling them how I would stay at home and look through the gap in the curtains and not answer the door. Then someone came to the door and I hid. Frederick answered and it was someone from GBCS asking for 50c for parking. We gave them the money and they left.
