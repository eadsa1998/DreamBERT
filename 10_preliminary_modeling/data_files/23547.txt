There was a female with long red hair who I was talking to. She was comforting me for some reason. I kept feeling compelled to kiss her -- I didn't, but I felt this magnetic attraction to her. I kept imaging her and me doing sexual things. I was embarrassed. We were sitting on a bed with floral bedding; the whole room was pastel and flowery. She was very ethereal and beautiful and nurturing.
