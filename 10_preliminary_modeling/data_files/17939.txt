My friend Ray was laying on the floor of my brother Stuart's old room, demonstrating on himself (mostly to my boyfriend Jeremy, although he was not in the room) how he goes about playing with a woman's nipples.  He had a very systematic order of techniques (rub versus flick, or something), which surprised me.  Watching him turned me on, though, so I left and found Jeremy and we started to make out.  We decided to move to somewhere more private when my parents came in.  I was sort of ashamed, but we had been 'set up' to be caught, and my parents didn't seem upset.  We were in what seemed like a very large tree house, and it was dark.  We explored the city a bit, but there weren't many people around.  There were some carnival game stations.  I met up with my old friend Neil Block.  He was unhappy about something.  We rendezvoused on a platform of the tree house and were going to try and leave.  The tree house seemed to be alive and trying to stop us.  Some large black birds swooped down on us.  We made it away and my parents and I were in a car driving away from the tree house.  I realized we were still missing someone in our party- a girl, but then remembered, as if it had happened before, that we would rescue her partway out of town.
