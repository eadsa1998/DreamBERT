My roommate's "man" proposed to me - told me he loved me, and would prove it but I must go and get my roommates scarf to wear, for we were going to the H. for dinner. I remembered it was 11:30 at night and I had to be in at 1. So I didn't think this was quite like the man as I knew him - so I went inside.
