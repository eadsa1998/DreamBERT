I walked out of the washroom at our country club and it suddenly hit me that I was being married immediately. Sure enough I was in a cutaway coat, etc. I remember looking out across the main lounge andseeing a mob of people all dressed up. Suddenly I got panicky and decided to run out. I saw my girlfriend coming down the stairs on her father's arm and I yelled "I'm sorry but I just can't" and then left running rapidly.
