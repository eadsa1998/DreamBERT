["Accepting the dysfunctional man."] A man and I are attracted to each other, but he is very emotionally dysfunctional from all his traumatic past. I work with him and help him be more emotionally healthy. We hug and I say to him, "I'm glad you can visit in and out for the rest of our lives." Meaning he and I will have an on again off again relationship as he dips back into dysfunction and pulls back out into healthy relating. That seems to feel fine with me.
