I liked this guy, though he was dating someone else. I think he did something that made me think he was interested in me and I kept trying to get him alone to flirt. We were in a car and sent everyone else outside to look after some stuff and I got closer to him and was like 'soo...' but then they came back. Another time I sat right next to him and he moved over a bit but our legs were still touching. Then there was snow. He was in a little hut thing and we were discussing what we were going to do (as it was my first time with snow) and I said 'oh, we're alone'. The TV was on. This girl came in and I was annoyed that we still weren't alone. Later we were near a river. The guy wished for zombies and some came out of the river. We ran. There was a 'balloon' baby and a guy was holding it and it snapped at others. It followed me to the toilet and I kicked it under the door. Then it got bigger and was huge and I ran. A girl said "Alcatraz man" and someone said 'Candyman can'.
