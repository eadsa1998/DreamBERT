 I walk through an old playground. There are several rundown basketball courts there. Some little fat black kids with big bellies play basketballs on the courts. I walk by. I go onto a dock by a house. A small black boy and his friends have been catching bullheads. They have a whole metal barrel full of bullheads, swimming around in the water. The fish are three or four inches long. The kid's father yells for them to bring the bullheads in to eat. One kid is dumping the bullheads out: they are too small to eat, he says.
