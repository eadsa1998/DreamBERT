["Young man attracted to me."] I am now doing two different tasks. I am going to write an outline for my play and I want to memorize my lines for a play I am acting in. I ask for an acting student to come and practice with me. While I wait for him to arrive, I go back to the banquet tables, now with no dishes on them, and sit at the typewriter writing the outline for the play. He arrives, tall young and good looking. He is like Davey in physical shape. He's about 19 and I am in my early thirties. He is very attracted to me as I am beautiful and slim. I suggest we go out on the balcony porch to practice so we won't be interrupted. We walk out, shutting the sliding glass doors. We find a place to work and I lie down on my back on the floor. He admires my beauty. We talk preparing to do the rehearsal.
