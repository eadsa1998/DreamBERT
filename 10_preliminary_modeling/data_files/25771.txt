 I call my friend Kevin Simpson's house and leave a message for him with his sister Melissa about going to the Big Resort Area this fall. I am with Kevin in a canoe near river water. My high school classmate's father Gary Lind is there. I talk with Kevin about the Big Resort Area and about the trip. I say it will be two weeks: September 1st- whenever, and we'll go from Woodsville to the Backcountry Highway. He is skeptical about the trip. We leave and kick paddle our canoes back to a house. We do this by leaning our legs out the back end of the canoes while lying on our stomachs, and kicking. We get to the house. Kevin's father Dilbert Simpson is there. He scolds us for kicking our canoes past Gary. He says Gary was fishing and we shouldn't have disturbed him. We walk up the shore a little ways. Kevin nods and says yes, accepting what his father has to say. I tell Dilbert off. I say it makes no difference whether he is fishing or not. Kevin is standing there wishing I would shut up and shaking his head as if to say, "No! Don't say it!" But I go on. I say to Dilbert, "Whether you are grilling and a boat goes by, who cares? I don't like you! You are cold and impersonal. One can turn to you for any work problem: to fix a boat, car, wall, or anything, but not to deal with people." Dilbert is agitated but remains poised. He says, "I'll borrow a phrase", as if he is too good to use normal language. He says, "I'm pissed off!" He is mad at me. I say to him, "Kiss my ass! I don't give a fuck what you think or feel! You don't know crap!" Dilbert is flabbergasted. He is hurt and speechless. He says nothing in the wake of my angry venting. There is nothing he can say. Kevin is hurt too. He doesn't want me to talk this way. <br/
