I dreamt I was unable to see when I woke up.  I was looking for the alarm clock, paranoid about getting up in time for the final.  When I could see again, I noticed the nightstand had been turned.  There were flowers.  Lots of flowers.  My parents were there.  My dad was in a tuxedo.  They were going to get married again.
