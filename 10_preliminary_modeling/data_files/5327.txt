I had a dream that dreams were a fashion accessory, so every morning when someone woke up, he or she would "wear" his or her dream, and that would be some sort of fashion statement. Then I had a dream that the whole school lived in Granddaddy's house. I was trying to find the hammock outside, but it was so dark that it pressed in on my eyeballs. And then I woke up.
