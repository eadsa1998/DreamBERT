["Sawdust Eating MaMa"]  I am in a garage with Charla. She wants to drive my little red car. She gets into the driver's seat. I don't want her to drive. I tell her she is only 11 years old. But she starts driving anyway, in the garage. Slowly moving forward, she bumps into a large box. She then backs up and bumps into something else. I finally take the steering wheel from her and stop the car. I am sitting in the driver's seat and I feel a strong wind pushing at my back. It's a breezy garage. Now I am walking with my "father." He is human, but my "mother" was a sawdust eating creature. We walk across a flatland area to a huge tunneled out building in a mountain. The halls are white, long and endless. There are unmarked doors where businesses are. Other people and creatures are walking through the halls to get to their work place. I see a big room ahead, no door but a wide archway opening to it. Some of the creatures think this is the sawdust eating room, but as we get closer, I see it is a swim pool. The water is steamy and cloudy and murky. My father and I get in and swim around. The others go to the sawdust eating room.
