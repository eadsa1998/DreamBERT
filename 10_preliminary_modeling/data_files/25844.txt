 My sister Heather is dead. I walk, sliding backwards like I'm doing the moonwalk, on 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I see the sunset. It is snowing and slippery outside. An old man named Tom walks with me. We talk about Heather's death. She died in her sleep, with my mom in the room. We walk through a house where remodeling is occurring. A man is putting in a water heater. My mom is going to counseling a bit to compensate this man for his work. This makes no sense to me since my mom should owe both for the installation of the water heater and for the counseling. She should owe twice. I call out my mom's name to see where she is. She answers from a partially remodeled room with insulation as walls. I break through the insulation to be with her. She is watching the news on television about deaths. Everyone is okay but Heather. A girl has drowned. On the news, her parents fish out something heavy, like croquet balls, and also contact lenses. It seems it wasn't an accident: someone murdered their daughter.
