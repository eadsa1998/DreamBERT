There was this house somewhere and I was there with some other people. There was Mom, Jayson and Ezra. It turned out that Jayson and I had had sex. Luckily, it was just implied. Anyway, I wasn't too worried about it and Mom was angry. Mom was trying to have a talk with me in this room. There was a poster on the bed, and Jayson was on one side of the bed, with a picture of Tinkerbell, and on the other side, a picture of Orlando Bloom. I hid next to the bed under the cover and Mom whacked me with a piece of wood to see if it was me, but it wasn't hard and I didn't move, so she decided I wasn't under there and then I popped out. I left the room and I walked past a room with a poster with 'Ugly Elephant Olyphant' on it. Timothy Olyphant was on it, and I thought it was hilarious for some reason. Then I heard a song playing on TV. It sounded like Red Dragon Tattoo, but then it sounded like Stacy's mother and it was Stacy's mother. The clip was before the small guy and Stacy had dated.
