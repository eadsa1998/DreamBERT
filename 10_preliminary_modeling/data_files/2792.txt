Jock and his wife Melinda and children are at their home and I am visiting them on Christmas. Jock sits very close to me and I can tell he loves me. I feel embarrassed because his family is there and they are being so nice, and I like his wife as a friend and their baby girl is very sweet. The children (two teen boys) bring me gifts. They had taken a few of their own things and wrapped them up for me. I am very touched. I don't open them because I'm not sure they really meant to give them to me. I sit on a couch. The wife (dark hair) is concerned about her baby girl and I talk with her. I want to help with the girl. Then Jock is sitting next to me and he leans over and kisses me. I try to pull back, but he just keeps leaning into me and forcing the kiss. The kiss isn't even very pleasant. I resist and finally pull away enough to speak. He says, "You don't care like I do." I say, "Well, after all, your family is here." The kiss felt heavy and ponderous. I feel caught between a rock and a hard place. His two sons then come up to us and hand me the gifts. I thank them and open one. It is a beautiful, expensive hard cover book on Native Americans, with beautiful color pictures and an object of Native American origin in the book. Jock is annoyed with his son because that cost Jock lots of money to buy for his son and now the son gives it away on a whim. "Why bother to do something nice?" he mutters, meaning his gesture to his son. I feel overwhelmed and caught in the middle.
