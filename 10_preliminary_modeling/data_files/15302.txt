The best movies of some director had some relation to The Room. There was a movie or something of 3 people driving up a hill. One guy was in a long truck. He stopped because some guy had died. He asked one of the people to bury the body and the other one to drive to go see his wife. The latter one went crazy and caused the road to come apart? Then I was there running down a hill. At the end it was completely vertical and I dropped down carefully. I ran away after and went into a room. There was a small room to the side and it said 'Stop'. I had a feeling of being trapped. There were holes in the wall and glass windows and it showed the front of someone's house. I yelled 'help me!'. A little girl nearby asked her mother 'what's 'help me?'. I broke off bits of something and then this duck was out the back and I was trying to catch it and tried to climb through. I was also then a 'duck'. A woman came out and I said I was human and she said she was a 'blackcoat' and I said I was a 'browncoat'. But she was bad and came after me and I ran. Later Dad and I were at a screening of The Room. Someone sent an email with a "blood ring" which was like a ticket. I forgot my shoes.
