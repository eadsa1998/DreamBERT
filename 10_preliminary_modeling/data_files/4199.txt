["Dancing with a man."] I am in some public place, inside. Maybe a cafe. A nice man (like Gaston) and I are talking. Then he gently puts his arm around me and we begin to walk in a dance like step. It is going well, except somehow we clumsily bump our legs together on one of the steps. We do it each time. It almost throws us off balance but we still manage to dance, even though it isn't all fun, with a bit of tension around the ungainly step. It does feel nice to be close to a man. He gently kisses my cheek.
