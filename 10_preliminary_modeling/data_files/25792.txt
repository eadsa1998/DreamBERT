 I'm at Brimson. I see my high school classmate Tanya Simmons, who looks like another woman and has freckles. She has light brown hair. I tell her she was in a dream I had. A woman is leaving for a golf tournament. My classmate Kory Reynolds is there. He is leaving too, though he has forgotten something and goes to get it. I walk up stairs. My old teammate Tony Kramer is jokingly bumping my butt, to get my attention. We are in a crowded cafeteria. There are long lines for breakfast. My mom is there. We were at a table, but she comes over to me with my stuff, so we are moving, I guess. I think they should have more than one serving line, or have several serving areas. It looks like they might have this, but they don't.
