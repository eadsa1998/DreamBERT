Dreamed that a friend of mine (18, lives in dorm) was with me in a large cement girl's bathroom. It was dark and gloomy in there and I was quite upset because a large rat was running around the room. I was afraid he would crawl over my feet so I called to my friend across the room asking her if she wouldn't kill the rat by picking it up by its tail and slamming its head against the cement floor. I felt that she was very strong and fearless. She picked the rat up and did as I told her, however, she only crippled it. I felt so sorry for the poor thing writhing about then that I told her to slam the rat against the floor once more to put him out of his misery. When she did this the second time, the rat looked to me like a possum. With this I awoke.
