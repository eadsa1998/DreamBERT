It was summer and I was visiting my grandmother's farm. The sun was shining and there was a festive air about the house. We were all preparing to go someplace ("we" meaning my mother, grandmother, age 80, my two uncles, 45 and 48, and my aunt age 55) and I was busy sewing a button on my dress. Suddenly the scene changed and we were sitting in the car at town watching the people go by. However, they were people from my hometown and not from my grandmother's town. I saw my best girlfriend (age 22) walking by with my high school history teacher (about 40). They stopped to talk, and thats the last I remember.
