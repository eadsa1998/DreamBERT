I was out the front of Mom's, but it was different. Uncle Gabriel came over to help with the building. There were lots of little things going on, rather than just the wall. One of the things was a 'bomb shelter'. He told Mom it would take at least 3 hours to cover it. There was a ramp of sand. Uncle Gabriel asked me something but I couldn't hear him and we were both like 'huh?'. There were puppies in the sand, and I can't remember how, but one of the puppies came alive and I gave it a pat.
