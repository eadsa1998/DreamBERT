At a FESTIVAL: I see a woman who is wearing a lovely cape with a design of Spanish dancers on it. She tells us many interesting stories; at one point she walks away, and on returning I see Frank help her cross over a small creek by holding out his hand to her.-- earlier I help put a baby to bed, who looks like Dana (our granddaughter).
