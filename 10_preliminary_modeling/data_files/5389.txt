Ross was a wizard who accidentally hexed Skye when he was trying to get me. People were trying to hit me with a frying pan. Then I was at Meryl Streep's house by the pool, and there was a squid in the water. You had to swim across without the squid realizing you were in the water. Skye was disguised as a dinosaur, so I floated on him to scare the squid. Then I started a new dream where I was in school again and Aidan was sleeping next to me. I had to go to history class the next day. I was really excited for some reason when I went into class. We were reading a really important book from the first Church of England. Then I dreamed I got a 5 on the English AP. Then I woke up.
