 I see a man and his two sons. The man makes semi-trucks in England. He earns a good income from it, and his trucks are good trucks: solid and well built. Some of the trucks carry fuel, are well sealed, and have been shipped overseas while full of cargo. I seem to be moving in a vehicle. I hear that a new site is being made on Seaside Hill. The site may be for camping, but the design is such that there is not enough room to camp. The new site will afford a good view through a thin line of pine trees.
