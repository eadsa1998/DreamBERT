I was with Benjamin and we were dating. A friend of his made an in-joke and Benjamin explained to me that it was 'just an annoying in-joke'. This guy did a Peep Show quote and Benjamin said I'd seen that. There was a little nook like kitchen with the cups down low. Then I was at his university, but it was like a castle and near water. Someone delivered a note and it was written by Poppa saying that some family member was dying and it was sent hours ago and they were following up thinking I had ignored them. I had trouble getting to the office to call them.
