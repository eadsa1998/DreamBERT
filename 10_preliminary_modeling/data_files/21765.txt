Marty was making an impression. Nick's marking the bench and said someone told him to watch Hangman. I said play $1 on him. We were walking in the country and there were a lot of creatures like snakes. They had their tails sticking out of holes in the banks about a foot and a half and they were wiggling or waving them. I saw a crab going into his hold in the bank. I told Audrey to be careful. She was monkeying around with the snake tails.
