It felt like we were flying in this plane, seems like there were a lot of people around, by the sound. The plane had to land, and it landed right in our living room. I Guess it was flying up around the ceiling. You need room to fly to move a plane around and so the pilot just took it outside and landed it but I don't know where it landed. It tried to land somewhere downstairs (in the living room).
