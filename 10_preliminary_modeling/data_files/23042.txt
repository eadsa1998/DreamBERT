I was in a small clothing shop on University Drive across from my alma mater, with my wife Bonita.  Helen Gamble was there too, smoking a cigarette.  She seemed much more poised and sure of herself than when I had known her, but she had a rather high-pitched nasal twang that irritated me.  I asked her when she had started smoking, but I don't recall her reply.
