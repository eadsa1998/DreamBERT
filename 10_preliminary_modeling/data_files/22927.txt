My wife Bonita and I were standing somewhere with Elisa Cumpert.  She had on a provocative, low-cut dress, with no bra.  She wanted to put a bra on, but was reluctant to do it right there.  I encouraged her to go ahead, so she just peeled down the top half of her dress, exposing her bare breasts.  I tried hard to see as much as possible without seeming too obvious about it.
