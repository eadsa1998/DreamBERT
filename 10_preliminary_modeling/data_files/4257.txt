["Traveling to France."] A man and I are walking hurriedly down a corridor to find the right plane to go to France. I see a shop on the left and read a price tag that says 2,000 something. I try to pronounce it in French. I have trouble remembering what the right words are but I do finally remember. We find a plane but are told it is the wrong one. We rush back down the corridor and find a second plane. I walk quickly up the stairs. We just as quickly walk back down as it is also the wrong plane. Now we are running to find a smaller plane. I realize I have to go to the bathroom. I look for one on the way and don't find one. I see a counter on the right and we ask directions of the woman there. Then I see an empty beauty parlor on the left. Cute plastic molded cubicles for the client and the hairdresser to be in like basket chairs hung from the ceiling. Then we find the area of boarding a cute little two seater train. Or at least the facade of a train on the back side and two seats like on a train open on the other side. It travels on the curved tracks. I really have to pee and hope there is a bathroom on the plane, wherever it is, and I hope it isn't too small.
