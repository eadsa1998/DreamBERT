I was at school and I was in some weird room. We were going to Berlin. Seamus was around. Calvin sat with me and Evelyn didn't. There was custard coming down from the room. Ms Braun was there. The room was going higher. I was in a helicopter and I fell from it, face down into glass. Something happened to Alejandro and he became strong and could fly and stuff. He was flying with me. I was somewhere and found this ancient artifact thing. He came back. These Chinese people were in a toilet and had some machine. They were writing a letter to ask for it. Alejandro and I wanted it. The letter was convincing enough.
