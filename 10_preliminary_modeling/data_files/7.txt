I'm alone in an apartment - old place, inside the building - it's dark, maybe I've gone to bed - somebody breaks in, there's at least 2 of them and they come towards my room, being quiet, they don't know I'm here. I can't lock the door (or maybe it makes too much noise) but I try to hold the door shut so they'll think it is. Doesn't work. A guy with a knife comes in - black, looks the part of a bad guy, leather jacket, nasty expression. Waves the knife. I say, "you don't need that knife" and he says something like, "Oh, so I don't need the knife, huh?" - sneering-like, and feints it at my face. I am very aware there's nothing I can do to help myself and I'm afraid but stand still. He pushes the knife at me again and I grab his wrist and he sort of turns the knife upward to cut my wrist with it - I'm aware that even if I can kick him I'm probably going to die or get hurt.
