Invited to Father Andrew's for dinner: about 25 people. We watch TV movie. I have brought some buns that drop on the floor--I notice the dust. I pick them up and put them back on the plate. Father Andrew in civilian clothes, sitting on the floor. I sit behind him with my leg just touching his back. I am to eat outside with the children on a square table--chicken dinner--while others are making shish-kebob. We have time to walk by the sea side, see the ocean. Climb down a steep hill, then we hold hands and run as fast as we can along dunes and hills by the sea side. Perfect Joy. Other incidents: He asks about me as a young girl and wants to caress and touch me. Scene in bathroom with telephone near tub with man giving instructions on how to use phone near the tub; hear water rushing from a faucet and try to catch it.
