 I'm at a beach, walking. I use a map of Sydney. Some areas are rocky. I go through some shops. There is a woman fishing who gets a snag. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. He cuts the line for her. Other people are there. There is a photograph of the students in the Raden University group. There may be one black man in the photograph.
