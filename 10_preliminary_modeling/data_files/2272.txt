I am sitting, fully clothed, on a toilet in a waiting room area. I don't have to go to the bathroom, but I feel safer or better there. Twice the saleslady peeks in and asks if I'd rather come out where it's more comfortable. I say, "I'd rather stay here," and then I realize maybe someone else might need the bathroom so I get up and go out. There are two couches and I pick up my mail. There are lovely surprises there: boxes of samples and things I'd sent for. I start to sit on a couch (I think I'm waiting for my van to be fixed), but the sales lady's papers are there so I apologize and start for the other couch. She apologizes and says, "No. Please sit there." So I do. I tell her I was sick in the night, but then I got better.
