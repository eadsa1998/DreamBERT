["Barb's CookBook."] I see a cover of a book like the soft cover of "The Runaways." It has a picture of me and it is a cookbook. I apparently will be asked to star on a cooking show and will publish this book. I find it amusing and strange since I never really liked to cook. But now it seems a fun and pleasing project.
