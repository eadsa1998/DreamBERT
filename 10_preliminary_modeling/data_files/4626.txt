["War ships and music."] I am seated close to an ocean on the sandy beach. I see warships like USS Cole plowing through the waters. I like being so close to the water since I can't walk to actually BE there. I am glad I can see so closely. Now Charla comes and disrupts the sand. I withdraw some distance, unhappy to have to move away from the ocean. I have a guitar and am trying to play it. Another person has a different type of guitar. I try to show them how to play it. Unusual set of strings. Ones more like a bass guitar. I enjoy plucking out rhythm and melodies.
