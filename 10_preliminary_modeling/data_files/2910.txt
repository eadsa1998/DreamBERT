I am moving and packing my things. Paulina is a little girl and I am surprised as I remember she really is 21 years old now. I find miniature things left behind. I tell someone to pull off the blue paper off the wall I used as a decoration. They do it, but also take down the backing on a huge cork board. It's a mess. I see a picture I want to keep. Now I am moving into the new house. There are some stairs that need ramping. An L-shaped hall with the rooms all in a row down the halls. I see a pretty living room at the end of one hall and a fireplace. I go look out the window and see a river nearby with beavers swimming pulling a log. I call to my mother and say, "Come see the beavers pulling a log." I am surprised the river is so close by. My father comes in to help me unpack.
