["President Clinton is so friendly."]  I am in a room, maybe at the White House. President Clinton and Al Gore are there at some reception. We sit together in the first row, and as we talk, President Clinton, in a very friendly manner lies his head down in my lap and cuddles. I enjoy the friendly attention and am pleased he is so charming and personable a person.
