I was at a show with Broken Lizard. My best friend was called Charlotte, who was the redhead from The Worst Witch. They gave us cookies and muffins. This lady asked if we knew what they were called (Broken Lizard). I was the only one who knew. There were puppets. There were movies like White Chicks etc. There was a big pool thing and a shark was jumping to get away. We had stingy McDonald's burgers and we complained. There was an evil lady, she had a piano, and evil dolls that looked like they belonged to Are You Afraid of the Dark?
