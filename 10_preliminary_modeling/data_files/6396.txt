I'm making out with Laura in my room and there's a bar of this white deodorant-like stuff. It's caky. This is supposed to be spermicide. She grabs it and we strip down. She rubs the "spermicide" all over her body, lays on the bed, cocks her pelvis upwards and claims: "I'm receptive!" But I've had to piss the whole time, so I tell her I'll go do that. But as I run for the bathroom I hear my family come home. I scramble and get the key for my room so I can get back in there without letting on there's someone in there, much less Laura in such a "receptive" mood. My brother asks me why I'm locking my room and I tell him bluntly that there are things in there I don't want him to see. I still have to urinate, but while I'm trying to lock the door, Nick uses the bathroom. My mother walks into the bathroom, and then walks back out, assuring me that there is "plenty of garbage" in that bathroom. By now, the feeling that I have to piss is so strong I feel I'll burst. My mother keeps going back into the bathroom and coming out, assuring me there's "plenty of garbage" in there. In frustration I finally just start pissing all over the walls in the hallway.
