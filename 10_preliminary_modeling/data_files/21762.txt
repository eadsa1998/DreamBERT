I was in bed with Ann. We were going to do some loving, but my dad was there. I was in bed again and some rowdy kids came around and I knew what they were up to, so I got hold of them and put them out of bed. I picked up a baby and also threw it out of bed. One of them went out and I knew what he was up to, so I got up and out I went into the big city. I was going under the elevator and I knew the gangsters were there and tried to do away with as I walked under the elevator. They made it come down on me. I was under it on the bottom, but it didn't crush me. They had me under there and were going to finish me off, but I yelled from under there for the people out on the street to make the elevator go up. I was under it. Someone raised it up a little and I knew they wanted me to start crawling out, then they would let it down on me. I put some bricks under the elevator to brace it up and I then crawled out and I was in flight from this gang in a big city. I flew away to another part of the city, but they found me and I was in flight again. This time I ran and ran to get away. I knew they would find me because as I crossed the streets, I thought they were lurking there. I ran across a park. There were kids playing ball. Then it rained and I kept up running in flight. I came to a tree and man with a basket came by me and said can I look into a bird nest, which was on a low branch. He wanted to take or rob the nest. I said no, but some friend of mine said let him do it.
