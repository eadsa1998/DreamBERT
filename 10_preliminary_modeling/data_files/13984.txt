I was at Nana's. I had my Gameboy stuff there. I had slept there. Dad was there. I called Mom to get me at 2pm -- it was 1pm now. Poppa and some others wanted to sit at the table so I sat in the lounge and Aunt Sally was down there. All these flies/bugs suddenly covered the windows and inside [I watched the bug episode of Supernatural last night]. To get rid of them, you had to breed them with other coloured bugs and they would suddenly disappear. We were running through the house, breeding them (it was instantaneous). There were four cars outside and the bugs had eaten three of the engines. The other car was older and had a different thing instead of the engine. Ezra, Dad, Poppa and I drove to this friend of Poppa's, the first path was blocked off and so we went a different way. I accidentally killed him with a stick. I checked the time and it was 3.18pm, so I called Mom to remind her to pick me up.
