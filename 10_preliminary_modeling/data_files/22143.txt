I was at the head of the race, both in my category and the others. It had cost me a lot of money to prepare the car. We were racing for the National Highway Grand Prize. The signal to start the second stage was given and I continued at the head. There were 5 miles left before getting to the "Devil's curve." At the moment I got to the curve, my car skidded and I went off the road and ... I fell from the bed. I awoke.
