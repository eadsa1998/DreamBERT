I am incarcerated somewhere with Dr Who (Peter Davisson) in a rather futuristic place, as though it were an episode of the show. I don't know how we got here but we didn't do anything wrong, and the Doctor is trying to get us out. They have him change clothes into a sort of prison uniform but it's green and has a turtleneck and matching socks and all. We've got an accomplice, I don't think he came in here with us, but he's helping us. We've managed to get the Doctor's clothes back, or we've found them, and he's changing and talking about what we're going to do when someone comes in. We're across a partition from the door, so we can't necessarily be seen, but the Doctor doesn't hear them and doesn't stop talking. I try to signal him, then whisper, "Doctor!", urgently, but he keeps on talking away and I'm getting scared. If we're caught we're sure to be in big trouble because the Doctor's changed almost everything now, except his shoes and socks, and they'll know what's happening for sure. The Doctor can talk his way out of lots of things, but this would definitely raise the alarm and we didn't want to do that. The plan had been for him to get out and then get me out, after he had some help. Is that right? Or were we all getting out together? Anyway, now he does shut up, and the moment is tense - we're about to be noticed by the men who came in - the first one is a typical bad-guy-in-an-authority-group TV or movie stereotype, and he's talking away to the 2nd, so he hasn't noticed right away. I think the Doctor's going to do some fancy talking and cover for me escaping.
