 I'm on a bus with a group of students. People seem to be throwing things out the window of the bus. My friend Stephen Ramos gets a fist-sized rock and throws it. It heads directly for the windshield of a car that a man is driving. The rock smashes through the windshield as the bus drives by the car, while the man is stopped at an intersection. The man quickly yells vengeance, records the license plate number of the bus. We hear him talk, recording the information, even though we're in our bus driving away. We're all shocked. I quickly move out of my seat to a different seat not so close to Stephen to seem like I didn't have a part in this event. Stephen assures us all he'll take full responsibility for his actions and put no blame on us.
