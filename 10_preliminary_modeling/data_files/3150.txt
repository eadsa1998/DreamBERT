I am in my "apartment" and trying to do my breakfast. Millie has been cleaning and has moved things. I see my toaster is clear across the room and the bananas and bread are in a drawer, organized nicely, but I'd have to walk to get it. I see an old Xmas tree and decorations. I know it's four months past Xmas and past time to take down the tree. I say, "I think you should," then I notice she already has cleaned that up. I say, "I really appreciate you helping but you've got to leave things the way I had them so I can independently use the place." She says, "But I'm here to help you. You have so much space here that isn't being used, just going to waste, with all your things crowded up together like that." I am annoyed she doesn't understand that she won't always be there when I need her, and I like to have it ready so I can do things myself so I won't get left abandoned and helpless.
