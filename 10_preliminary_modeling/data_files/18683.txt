I could hear somebody practicing the piano. I knew it was a girl. It was intricate fingering. She was practicing the same measure over and over. There was a 50 meter swimming pool. After a while I jumped in with my clothes on to swim some laps and first I was trying to swim holding a board. It was too hard. It was like a rudder gone haywire. ??? A case worker was going to take my picture. Allison's chair was empty. The Key Food was having a big parade. A Spanish man was drinking lots of juice to advertise the fruit juices and they were filled with fruit--coconut, bananas, mango, oranges ??? trying to impress me ??? I was going back to art school in Florida. I was happy. I was still doing art and most people who were good artists had turned to other jobs. I stopped by the meth clinic to get some change I'd left there in a jar. Dimes, quarters, nickels. They were having a Christmas party but I didn't feel I belonged any more. People were waiting impatiently for their meth. I went back to pack my stuff for Florida. There were 3 rooms, each with a little couch or bed. I had a little kitten. I put milk on me and squatted down over her so she would lick me and it turned into Rudy and we were making out. We fooled around a little and stopped and turned the light on and he said, "You started it. You aren't gonna be afraid to be in a room alone with me now, are you?" and I said no. It was late afternoon but warm and I wanted to go to the beach. my father was gonna drive real fast to get there while I could still get some sun. Dora didn't want to go but I wanted her to go. I took a sweatshirt and a towel 'cause I knew it'd be cold afterward. Marianna had gone back to do her old job for an assignment. She was CEO of a murder investigation of an all white mafia motorcycle gang that went from NY to Hartford, Conn. The 3 suspects were scattered out and William and Mary were helping catch the bad guys. (murderers)
