I saw an immense plain on which there was no vegetation. The time was about late evening for it was quite gloomy. On the middle of the plain was (a) a stone about the size of a pea, and next to it (b) a boulder of immense size. The two objects just stood poised like that for a while, and then all of a sudden, the boulder started to roll slowly toward the smaller stone.
