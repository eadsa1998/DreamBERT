I dreamed I was going through a dark street where there wasn't any kind of light, and I saw several doors that were different from the real ones. There were three of them and one was made of wood, another one of steel and the third one of glass. At one of the doors I saw a woman who was in black and who led me to the glass door. I kept seeing her and several women and beautiful crystals that had my face on them. Suddenly I disappeared and found myself in another place;I think it was a desert, and I had a terrible thirst and was hot, but I kept walking and found a town, and a lonely woman who saw that I was down and came to my help. She took me to her house and took care of me. I saw something in her which reminded me of the doors. I asked her if I had seen her before in that dark street, and she answered me that it wasn't her. I told her that I had seen her, but when she heard this, she disappeared. I called her and suddenly I heard a voice calling me in the distance and I awoke.
