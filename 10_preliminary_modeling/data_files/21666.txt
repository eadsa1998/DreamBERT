I found a sword in our house. Ann said my sister Sue gave it to us. I took it and went over to Grandma's and Sue was there. I walked in like a soldier. Sue said, "Where did you get the sword?" I said, "You brought it to our house," and she said, "Oh, yes I did." I was piling up doughnuts in a plate at Grandma's. I was picking out a horse out of one of the races and Ann and Bob were looking at the notes I wrote. Ann was erasing something. She wrote in my dream book notes. I was going to play Just Waiting. I think #4 was the horse I was picking out of the 6th race. I was working and I noticed we had a gang of visitors. They were schoolboys. They lined up the two aisles. Carl Fisher was sleeping in a sitting position and made off he was looking at some work. Nelson gave me two pieces of his work and I tried to screw them together, but one piece had no thread. I looked inside the hole and there was a thread where the hole was smaller. I was again in the shop and the visitors were still in there. I got the paper from one of the men and I looked at it. I was lying in a bed on our line, a beautiful girl walked by the other line. I was admiring and imagining how I could love her. I took a little run and jumped over a pile of bananas on the end of the line. Fisher also jumped over them. I saw Malley in the dept. It was a jump of about 8 ft.
