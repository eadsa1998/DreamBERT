["Kevin Kline."] My old boyfriend, Kevin Kline, comes to me. He wants to have occasional sex with me. He has a girlfriend. She has some problem that makes her sad. I agree to help her, then Kevin and I can have good sex without guilt maybe once a week. I feel the orgasm. I've missed that good feeling.
