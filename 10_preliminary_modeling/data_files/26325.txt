 I'm at Carter Church sitting with people I know on the north side of the church in the left front section of pews. More people start to walk in. By the pew, I see a person who is grandma Redding, and seems also to be my dad. Later, she is my dad. When he gets near me I leave my pew and sit with him in a different pew. A girl I recognize from Brimson, but don't know, is standing up on the pew where I was just sitting, and I point her out as being Julie, my girlfriend. She seems to be wearing blue or yellow skirt with a blue or yellow top. She looks casual, and pretty. She has blond hair and may have glasses. My dad comments on Julie, in his joking manner. A person in the pew in front of me comments on her as well. I overhear them saying she seems to like men who are tall and hunt.
