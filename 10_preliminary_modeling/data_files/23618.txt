Cable TV will be all over the world. We are building a privacy wall on top of the roof so we can use it for sunbathing. A young Dutch woman friend is there. In the home of a powerful woman who was like an evil stepmother to me. Frightening mystery. Suddenly this "step- mother" is gone. There is a message on the answering machine. Then I go to a roof terrace where I see the stepmother and her daughter. They are both much younger. Stepmother is fifty, her daughter thirty. They look very pasty and frightening. I know that they are ghosts. I scream. They come up to me dressed in red. I don't believe that they are real, but they frighten the hell out of me. I touch the stepmother and my hand goes right through.
