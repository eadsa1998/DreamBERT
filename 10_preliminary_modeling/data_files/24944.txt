 I'm in my talking to Hannah Reed on the telephone. We talk about her school, BCU. A coach of hers is quitting, but is going to help her cheat somehow. In a stern voice I say, "Hannah". I ask her if she has had sex. She is surprised and laughs a little, saying, "What???!", but then concedes that she has. She says something about giving all her male friends fellatio. I think to myself that she never gave me fellatio.
