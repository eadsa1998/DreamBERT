It was Easter Sunday and we were going to go somewhere; I wasn't really sure where. But I was having Mom help me find that pretty Easter dress from Dad, and I don't know what would happen. I put the Easter dress on and we went, and we ended up at the beach with like, I couldn't figure if it was Kristen, Marilou or Aunt Janice or somebody else. I couldn't figure who it was. But I took the dress off and I started swimming naked, and I got out dripping wet. And I can't remember for sure, but I think Mom was playing the "Wee Sing" tape on the little flat tape recorder. And I got out and I scared the ladies and I was buck naked. [laugh] And then I went over by Mom and Dad and dried off. Then I remember we went home and I told Mom that I felt comfortable playing the "Wee Sing" tape, but only when we were sitting down for dinner and we weren't up doing a whole bunch of other stuff. And she wanted to hear it again, so we put it on my sound system on the big machine. And we were sitting there listening to it in the dark, watching the LED jump with the rhythm, and then we went to lay down in my bed, but it was still on the system. And then it stopped and somehow it went to tuner and started playing some rap song from 93.3. And I said, "Come on, I'm going to go shut it off." And I had her come walk with me and hold my hand, and with my other hand I shut the stuff off. And then I woke up. That was weird.
