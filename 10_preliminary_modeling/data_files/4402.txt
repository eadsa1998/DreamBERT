["Looking good!!"] I am in a crowded school room. I have piles of photos I have taken. I am going through them and organizing them. It's fun to find my art photos and look at them. There is a young man near me who is attracted to me. I find a box with sweaters and tops in it. I see them and think they are too small for me. I put one on and discover I look sexy and thin. I am pleased. Now I am trying to leave the building. I weave through the crowd of students. Another man is attracted to me and follows me. I stop to wash my legs, one at a time, I am wearing a mini skirt, possibly leather, and boots. It looks sexy and it intrigues the man. Now I am carrying some photos of mine and a baby. The man is questioning me. Whose baby is that? I want him I don't answer him. I seem to be hanging on to the mystery as it makes him more interested. I walk to a small house which is the day care center. I ring the doorbell. An oddly shaped doorknob which is almost like a tiny stick starts elongating. I know the door is being answered. It opens. I hand the baby to the young woman and say its name Bobby Baker. It is the baby of a friend of mine. Now I leave. The man following, he's very excited about knowing more about me.
