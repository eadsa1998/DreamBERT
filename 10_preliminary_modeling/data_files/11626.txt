At the beginning of the dream I found myself working in a sawmill. I had the job of firing the furnaces. I can distinctly picture myself as I poured shovel after shovel of coal on the fire, but for some strange reason the furnace would not heat up. This continued until the foreman fired me for inefficiency. I explained to him that the furnace was at fault but he did not believe me. As an afterthought I woke up feeling very dismal and depressed.
