A small Native American village welcomes me and we have a party. An Indian woman is my friend. She introduces me to an Indian man. We like each other. He takes me to a wall that has pictures of the history of how white men harmed the Indians. I want to defend, but know I must first listen. It's a test to see if I am genuinely interested, or am going to be just another rude white person. I listen. The man and I make love. There is a huge diaphragm with cream all over it. I kiss the hollow at the front base of his neck. I feel love, but no sexual feelings.
