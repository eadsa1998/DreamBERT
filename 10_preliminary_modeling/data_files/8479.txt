I was walking down a very windy street along the edge, like where the street would drain into the sewer. There was a lot of water flowing along there. I think I was walking towards my house on Lakeland Dr. I don't think the water was from rain. It seems to me that it was from something else. I also had a gallon of milk in my hand. I had poured a little of the milk in this water to make it flow faster. As I walking, I was walking right in the water. I was barefoot. I kept finding pennies. I was bending over to pick them up. I had too many in my hands so sometimes when I would try to pick them up I would drop another one. The water was moving so hard that I was afraid it would wash some of the pennies away before I had a chance to pick them up. So some of them I would stand on until I could pick them up. Once I had put them in my other hand I could pick new ones up without dropping them. Sometimes I would find 2, 3, or 5 all in one place. Someone I knew, or someone walked up and wondered what I was doing. I guess I was kind of in their way. But then they went ahead and walked around me. There was a woman with a young boy. I just smiled at her and kept picking up the pennies. There was also something about me having a little girl with me. She was completely naked. She was maybe somewhere between six and eight years old. There's something about her being upset about something and I was trying to cover her with a beach towel. I knew she wouldn't be upset if I covered her with the beach towel. At first she was getting very hyper, so I just barely got her covered with it, but it was in a very haphazard fashion. After she calmed down I was able to wrap it around her in a better fashion, so it would stay in place.
