A man offers me a present. We agree to make love and I say, "You don't have to give me a present." After we are finished, he suggests I look in the pockets of his raincoat for my present. I am relieved he still wants to give it to me. It's rhinestone jewelry. I find other presents he will give other women. I smile.
