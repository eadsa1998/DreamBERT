Dwight W and Albert S. I was swinging on a tree swing and Albert S was pushing me. Dwight W was standing nearby, jealous because he thought that Albert S and I were attracted to each other. Dwight W was interested in me. I told him there would be no romance between he and I. I remember climbing up into the tree for some reason. I don't know if it was to get something or to get away from something. I think we were perhaps a little older than teenagers. I remember their being a school, steps, and a hanger.
