There was a military display in the school library.  Probably Marines, judging by the uniform.  The center was exposed and the library was around it.  My best friend Emma and I were walking around.  My classmate Mack came up behind us and said something.  I thought he was asking one of us for tutoring.  Then I looked over at the both of them.  They looked back at me.  Mack was asking me to be his Valentine, although Valentine's day had already passed.  I was no doubt surprised.  I didn't know what to say.
