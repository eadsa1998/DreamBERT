Fletcher, Cecelia, some others and I went to Fletcher's house for some reason. His parents were old and white, they looked like typical American grandparents. I asked Cecelia about it quietly and she said it happened sometimes with Filipino's. He seemed to be their natural born kid, but I couldn't really work it out. We left there and were on a street and I think this girl kept dying and we took her with us to give back to someone else later. We went to this ice-cream store which was closed to wait in.
