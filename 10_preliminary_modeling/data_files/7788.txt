This dream was about the research group, about the meeting coming up tomorrow night. Pam Ta arrived early and added her pieces to the group collage. Her and Sophia K put their things on the floor and started working on their individual collages. I wasn't really paying attention. I heard them talking, but I wasn't really paying attention. Pretty soon I noticed that Pam Ta had almost finished hers and at that point I said something. She said she needed to leave early so that's why she went ahead and did hers. I then looked at Sophia K and she had done her individual collage on the group collage. She went ahead and did hers also but she also did it on the group collage. I was frustrated with this because they started without the rest of the group and because once again Sophia K had not followed instructions. Of course, Sophia K reasoned that it wasn't going to matter, there was absolutely nothing wrong with what she had done. With Pam Ta I felt a little better about it because I knew she had to leave early. I started taking pictures and when the rest of the group got here they started discussing Pam Ta's. I said, Now, wait a minute. Can we discuss this without it affecting our own at all. Of course, they all thought that we could. I was out in the parking lot with everyone and saying something to Dan M while he was in his car.
