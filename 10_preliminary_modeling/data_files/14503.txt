Mom was going for a drive. We were looking for keys and then the front door was locked and she was about to leave. We left and went past dads. I went in, but I fell asleep and Mom called me and said "I'm waiting for you". I went out and Ezra was in the front seat. I complained because he was there last time. I went to the mailbox and I heard the door slam open and Dad came out of the house. Ezra's report was in there. There were also chocolates and stuff. I ate a chewy thing and it got stuck to my teeth and really hurt. I was on my computer earlier and I had changed my desktop to a different Scrubs one. I went back on it but it was different. I couldn't find the picture again anywhere. Then I was infected or something and I was locked in the cage and my feet were shackled. I had a toilet and a bed. Then I was someone else and was seeing someone who wasn't really there, but they 'were' and I was helping them. They were an actor, I think, but I can't remember who. There were coffee beans and he dreamt about them? Everything was still and he and I were walking through. I told him to imagine stuff happening -- kids playing with skipping ropes and the like. I then told him to imagine finding what he was looking for. These people had folders and the coffee beans were in it.
