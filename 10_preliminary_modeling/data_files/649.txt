Something about taking a picture of Chris and Jane, two co-workers, to illustrate a story, but they are both sad. I can't remember what Chris is doing but Jane, who is her mother-in- law, is having a candybar and the cutline on the photo is to say something about her having a mid afternoon snack for energy. I learn that Bryce, who is Jane's son and Chris's ex husband, is not sending Jane rent money, but Chris doesn't know this. Jane is punishing Chris in some way for this but Chris is unaware of what is actually going on and is puzzled by Jane's behavior.
