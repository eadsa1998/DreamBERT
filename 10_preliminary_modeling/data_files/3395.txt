A little girl is getting ready to go to school. Her mom and others are fussing about making everything just right. She has an elaborate hat and dress on. A little boy, her brother, is feeling neglected. He plays a card game and runs away to get attention. No one at school likes the little girl and a woman, like Aunt Naomi, says, "Maybe you are just trying (working) too hard." She takes the hat off and turns the dress inside out so it isn't so fancy. I, the dream ego, think, "Boy, what an amazing coincidence. The dress is reversible like that and no ugly seams show" Now the boy has run away and someone on a huge motorcycle is taking him for a ride. The motorcycle has a canopy on it. Later, I (adult) get on a motorcycle to go find him. My mother is riding on the back and I keep trying politely to get her off. I'd say, "Here's a nice place you could stay," and she'd say, "Why would I want to stay at a place that looks like an aircraft carrier?" (a huge apartment complex). I take the wrong turn. I go the left fork. My mother says, "The gravel looks different here." I say, "You're right." I made the wrong turn and I go back to the fork to go down the right fork. I had intuitively felt it was the right way, even before my mother spoke.
