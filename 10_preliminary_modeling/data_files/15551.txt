I was at Midvale shops with Dad. I had this music thing in my car that was expensive. This young Native girl followed my car asking for directions in Subiaco. I tried to show her the bus/train map. This white guy with scraggly grey hair approached and tried to steal it and it was hard to get him away. I went into the shop as it was just closing and they said I had to tell them what I wanted and they would get it, but I forgot what I wanted, so I just got this big block of white chocolate.
