I live in a pension while looking for a house to live in. See large planes on the ice in the lake. My C. City analyst Dr. Feingold comes to see me, speaks German. I apologize for my mess and then we start the hour. Relieved to see her again. Shift: With Edward and Marita. Controversy about Edward wanting to marry a crippled girl who I think is not at all his type; I try to persuade him not to do this; then we walk hand in hand while watching large air ships and steamers in the harbor.
