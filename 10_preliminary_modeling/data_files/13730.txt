I was at home. Dad was working late or staying out. I had gotten some movies out earlier so I went to watch one of them which had Ana Ortiz in it. The cover of it, showed her pregnant, having the baby. Then I heard a car pull up and I looked out the window. It was a blue car with Tooth Pritchard/Tooth Pritchard (one on top of the other) or something as the number plate. I put the chain on the wood door and went to my room. They tried to get in. All I could hear was loud banging. I tried to call Mom but it said the phone was unavailable. I called Darren but he said they weren't at home. I called Dad's work and told him to come home. At some point, Ezra came back. We were outside somewhere and this guy was trying to get in the building. We began to run away from him and we opened this door and were in a classroom. The door didn't lock and I tried to keep it closed, but the guy got in. I got some scissors and I was stabbing him. There was lots of blood. We also had to kill the cats at one point and we kept attacking them but they didn't die and I got upset because Tigger was so scared and I was hugging her. The next day, Mom came over. Some other people were over at first and I was in my car with the air-con on and I had strawberries and Milk Arrowroots to eat. She came and we went to her place, except we kept getting lost and sometimes we were walking instead.
