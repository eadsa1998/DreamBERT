I felt that this dream was the same setting as the last dream, just a different scenario, and I woke up in between the two dreams. I was dealing with a confrontation between my housemates and myself. We were on an outside porch. Both of my housemates were standing on the porch, and I was on the driveway looking up at them. It was a Victorian style house. The female housemate was upset with me and I didn't understand what I did wrong. She felt I did something to deliberately hurt her. What I did was never clear. She was yelling at me and saying that I never cared about her and she never loved me. I responded by saying she was a hypocrite and a fake and I thought she was selfish and self-centered. Then I went walking towards the house and found a present on the front porch and opened it. It was the game Perfection. I left and came back again and the gift was wrapped up again, but then I noticed an antique wicker bassinet holding the game. Then I sat on the porch holding a baby, talking about what was happening between my housemate and me.
