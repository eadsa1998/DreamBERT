A small girl is in danger. I am trying to protect her. A male gangster has a gun and henchmen and is trying to poison or take the little girl. The girl is very afraid. I see a box delivered to her and in it is a bottle like Fiberall and she's afraid of it. She is lying in the box with plastic inserts like ears next to her head. She looks terrified. I take her out and hear the gangster coming and tell her to go into the bathroom and hide. She does. The gangster has a gun on me and I have a gun on him and we threaten each other. It's a standoff. I feel great hatred for him. He's mean and persistent, but somehow he's not really trying to be a bad guy. We keep up the threatening stuff at each other.
