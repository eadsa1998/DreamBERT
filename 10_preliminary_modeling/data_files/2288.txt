I see long rows of tree-like sticks that are my body cells in enlarged form (see drawing). As I pass by the front of the lines, I see lots of dusty debris cluttering up the back portion of the cells like giant lint or dust balls. Now I am looking under a house. I see a talis slope of rocks and a small shelf way up under the beams (see drawing). I see like a zoom lens and I'm coming closer to a corner under the eves. A red and white thing is all messed up in a heap there and I feel terror. I think, "I don't want to see." It's like my childhood memories and it will scare me or be too ugly to look at. But as I come closer, it changes into a sweet kitty and it sits there looking at me. I feel better now. The place is dusty and cold and long forgotten, except for that cute kitty.
