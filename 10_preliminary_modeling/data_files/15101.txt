Ezra and I were going to watch a movie on Foxtel. Michael Emerson was tied up in chains and Terry O'Quinn was standing behind him. Something was possessing them. I found it amusing that Ben and Locke from Lost were both in it. The picture was going weird because the cord was falling out. Then I, except I was now Dana Walsh (24) and it was from my past, was on a computer. I was inside it first and Cole (24) came and he needed some pictures. I had stuff that would give away the fact I was a bad guy, but I had to transfer them. I blew into the machine to clean it. There were a bunch of short films. One was about a plant guy. They said I had to describe it without using certain parts of him, basically all of him. I showed it to Mom and she didn't know how to do it either. A while later someone said 'maze' and I realized it was a maze.
