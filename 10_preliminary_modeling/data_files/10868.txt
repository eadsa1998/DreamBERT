I dreamt that I had applied and was accepted in a nursery school this summer. The hours were from 12:15 (noon) to 1:30 only. The teacher I was to assist is in real life my assistant, f, 25, in a nursery school. I was very worried as to how I could work at both nursery schools in one day. I remember taking the children in for a swim. It was a lake off a sandy beach. Then this head teacher said we would take them for a nature hike in the woods. I remember I only had on tennis shoes and therefore couldn't go with them. I rationalized that I would stub my toes with these thin tennis shoes. Therefore I stayed to prepare art work for the children because I knew the head teacher wasn't capable of it. As I was doing my art work (making balloons for them to color) 2 or 3 girlfriends appeared and we began to play cards. In the midst, my mother-in-law called to ask if we were having fun. I knew she was really calling to see if her son (my husband) was home safely. Next, I was getting my coat to leave the nursery school and I met a girl I grew up with but haven't seen in a few years. I introduced her to my husband and asked about her baby. She said it was a girl called Tonia.
