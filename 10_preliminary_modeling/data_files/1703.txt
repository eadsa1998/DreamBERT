I am playing cards with a woman. I start a bid that could lead to grand slam. She does a preemptive bid, asking about my clubs. I see I have a long suit with no high cards. So does she. (The clubs are pretend.) I am surprised to see us playing bridge because we had started playing some other game. And there are only two of us. I decide to signal that we haven't enough to make grand slam and we play. I am the dummy.
