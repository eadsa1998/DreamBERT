I was working in the shop and there was so little work to do. It looked like a layoff. Shripple said his bearing rubbed on his wheel. I took it off and he was going to pocket the bearing. It was an extra one and valuable one. I told him it would have to stay because the axle would go bad. I looked at the shaft and it was worn bad. I saw giant cigarettes. Someone told me I could take a lady home from work and drop her off at Breckville. Deep came to my vision.
