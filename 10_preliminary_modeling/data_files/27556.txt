In my dream, I was out walking and it started to rain. I kept on walking for a while and then it started to rain very hard. I was afraid then, and I ran up the steps of the nearest house and rang the bell. No one came. I knocked on the door and finally a face appeared, behind the glass of the door, looked at me, and turned away. I knocked again and called out and pleaded to be let in, but no one opened the door. Finally the rain stopped. For some reason I then tried the lock of the door and it opened. It had been open all along.
