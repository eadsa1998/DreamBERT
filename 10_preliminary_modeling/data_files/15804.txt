I was lying in bed with Benjamin and I can't remember if we were already seeing each other or if this was the start of it, but I turned over to face him - and it was like in a movie where the 'camera' would go between my face and a bird's eye view of us lying there and soft lighting and such. For some reason I don't remember ever seeing his face. He kissed me and I kissed him back and we started making out (which was sort of sloppy), and he ran his hand up my leg and when he got to the top, he climbed on top of me. I was thinking that I was happy that we'd resolved our differences and we were together like I'd always wanted.
