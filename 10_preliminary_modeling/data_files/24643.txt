We (my class) were setting up our stuff on a camping trip or something. And the counselor told us to be careful not to kill any plants or animals when we put down our sleeping bags and pillows. I looked under my pillow and found two turtles. Then someone pushed the counselor's truck down the hill we were setting up our stuff on, and then just before the truck was going to crash, I woke up. Setting: On a campground that I had never been to, but it had a very steep hill. Characters: My whole class, a counselor that I don't know, me of course, and two turtles that were probably only two centimeters long each. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, surprised. I was surprised when I saw the turtles, and I was very worried when the truck was going to crash.
