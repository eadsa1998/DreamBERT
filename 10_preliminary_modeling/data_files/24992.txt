 I'm driving to Big City with my friend Tiny Combs, but it turns out that I'm actually driving to my house in Oak Valley with my friend Nate Nelling. The steps up to the front sidewalk are in a different place: right in the middle of the stone wall. The old steps are there too. We talk about the planet Venus, though it isn't visible. Nate has a gift for me. We walk in and I say hi to my brother Wally. He tells me that I've been pinching a pimple on my back too hard. Wally's friends Brian Rappaport and Mryle Madden are there. One of them is on the phone. The three of them are going out. Then there is a hot tub with two couples in it. The couples are from the television show "Friends". Two other girls join them in the tub, and the girls are forced out of the tub.
