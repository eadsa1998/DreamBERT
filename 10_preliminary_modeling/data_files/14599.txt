We found three litters of kittens. There was a weird looking one but it was still cute. I was at university, which was different and I found a magpie with a broken leg so I told a bunch of teachers and they told me to sort it out since I cared so much. Later, there was like a storm and it had been getting worse. Today had been quite bad. I was at dads and it was very windy. I went into the bathroom and the bath and the shower were covered in this orange liquid, which was seeping onto the floor too. It was because the top of the roof was melting and it was coming through the bottom of the window too. It meant that the house had only a few days left, but then the rest of the 'glue' came off and came out faster through the window so we only had two hours or so. Mom and Ezra started packing stuff up. I was trying to keep Tigger and Mittens out of the room.
