I am starting to eat at a hotel. Think breakfast peculiar and can't eat much of it. See green salad and potato chips. Look for place to sit, going to another table, but seats are taken. Look for someone to assign seats. No one. Tell Mrs. McC. I cant eat much of the breakfast account of salt. Could I have toast instead? She says I can for any meal. I see the nicely browned toast and toaster in the kitchen.
