I dreamt that I was someplace in the Orient with two friends visiting a small state which had just been taken over by a dictatorship. The rule was strictly by the military. The section I was in was undermined by huge caverns. It seems that all of the political prisoners, etc. were kept at work in these caves. My friends and I wanted to visit the caves and take a look around so we procured passes from the local chief. After we had seen enough we started to leave. I remember that we walked up a long tunnel. As we neared the guards my friends took out their passes and I reached for mine. It was gone. When I told this to the man at the gate, he looked at me sternly, called a huge subordinate and pointing to me, said, "Take him below." I became very alarmed, protesting that I was an American citizen. Finally, as a last resort, I showed my my war department AGO card. This convinced him and he turned me loose.
