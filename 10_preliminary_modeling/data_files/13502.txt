I was out the front and I saw Jack Osbourne walking next door and I remembered that they lived next door to us. Later, Sharon came out and I said "you don't come out much anymore, not that I'm ever outside". She said something about Ozzy being away. Later, I was at school. Calvin was acting weird. We went to this place outside and Margarita came and wanted to talk to him. I was wondering why and was yelling at her because she was a stupid loser. She was like "I'm not doing anything to you, you're a loser" etc. I said stuff about what her and her friends said and did to me etc. Then she and Calvin began talking and he started crying and said it had been hard for him since he came out. I was thinking 'huh?'. She comforted him and I was wondering why he told everyone else but not me. Then I was thinking that I was right about just picking the loser females to like and was thinking of Sabrina and Mariah.
