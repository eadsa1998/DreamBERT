 I'm at a party with my friend Gino Teavor, cousin Bertha Strange, and others. The party seems to be near where the corner of Mike's Garage is in Oak Valley. Gino wants to leave. He and I go outside and turn left, heading down 3rd Street towards the Milk Stop. A couple has left their vehicle on the north side of 3rd Street and is walking the road carrying clothes, a motorcycle, and other material goods. We walk towards the Mayor's office. Gino has a video camera. There is a police officer by the building, checking things out. Gino is drunk. There is something dead on the road. It has fur. It looks like an animal but the body isn't there. Then we see the body, which is all burned up. The lump of charred flesh turns over, and we see it's alive! It is a young black man. He has a gold watch on. He is severely injured. He seems to look better the more that I look at him. I touch his arm to make sure that I'm not dreaming. The arm is real. I am not. I want to help this young man. The police officer looks like a gimp: an incompetent person. He looks funny. He has a beard. He may look like a man in our community, Fred Buyers, except with a beard.
