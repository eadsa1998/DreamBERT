 I'm at an old and run down building. I walk outside to get away from work. I walk up stairs to a balcony area on the roof. The roof is soft and mushy and the shingles seem to cave in. The building is a run down church. I slide down the rounded side of the barn-like roof. I'm cleaning in the building. Others and I tear off the outside covering of rolls of toilet paper that are stacked case by case into a wall. I clear shelves and desks, removing utensils and garbage from them. I scrub the shelves. Others question why I'm putting so much effort into scrubbing these filthy shelves. I say that anything worth doing is worth doing well.
