We were in a town and still it was like a jungle. There were large trees and lions prowled and would catch a human being once in a while and would devour them. We were up in trees most of the time to be safe. We climbed around in the top of trees. Someone said, "Did you see that lion grab that man and drag him into the underbrush? Then there came a lion down the street. He trotted down slowly, then changed his mind, stopped, turned and trotted back. Someone said a lion attacked a boy and he got away from the lion. There was a record played near the attack. It was loud music and singing. This frightened away the lion. I was lying in wait for some robbers who were to come and steal our money. They finally came in and I surprised them with my pistol. I pointed it at them and they didn't put up their hands at my command, so I tried to shoot and the gun wouldn't fire. So when they saw that I was their prisoner, but they let me go later.
