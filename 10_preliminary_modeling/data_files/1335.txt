I am taking my medicine. There is a lot of different kinds. I swallow a long thin rectangular solid piece (like a piece of square chalk) wrapper and all. It's the last "anger" pill. I have to go get a refill. In fact all my meds need refills. I go to the lady who does that, hoping to remember all the kinds of meds I will need. A. Woods is the lady. She's sort of a witch doctor type and dances around. These are rituals. We must spread a layer of dirt and then hay on top. Another strip of dirt next to that with apples on it. There is also a layer of sewing tools to be spread. I use a rake to do it. She tells us there is a fire for the angry ritual, which I have done before and need to do again. I resent that a little but do it. There is loud incantations and fiery happenings.
