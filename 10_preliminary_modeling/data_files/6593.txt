I am to have some hypodermic. It is poison. I ask if it will hurt and feel anxious about it. Expect will cause death but that doesn't matter. The needle is stuck in tip of thumb which bleeds profusely. Operator is Q, but there's a doctor too. Sit quietly awaiting results. Feel a little queer. Ask if can wash blood from my hand which is pretty well covered with it. Go to basin and find two pair of white stockings in. Start to wring them out. R. objects and will not accept my explanations.
