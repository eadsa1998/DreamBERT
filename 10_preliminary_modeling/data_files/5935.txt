I walk out of a bar in some foreign city and find my small car half buried in snow. Curiously enough, no snow on top of car, but the vehicle sits in about two feet of snow. I open door and seats are covered with slight layer. This I brush away and then start to rock and push car to get it out of slush and snow, and into the street. This is very difficult, but as it slides into street, other cars are blocked and they sit and wait. Car won't start, so I lift hood. I then slip down on ice and in struggling to get up, see that my trouser knees are soiled from slush. This annoys me and I note with additional annoyance that several dozen cars are all blocked on account of mine.
