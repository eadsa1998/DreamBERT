We were being hunted by someone. We hid ourselves by standing still, not making a move, and we were not seen by the hunter. I was on a vacation with my family. We were out of town and were gone two weeks. It seemed like a couple of months to me. I went upstairs to our room and got a rifle. Bob and Audrey brought me a bullet that they seemed to have loaded or changed. I was going to shoot it in the 22 rifle. A man stopped his car on the street and was hot because he said a person couldn't park his car where he wanted to.
