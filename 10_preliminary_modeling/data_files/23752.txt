I had another dream about technological developments.  I had planned a hike or outing with some people I met.  The day after making plans with them, I was waiting in a nice hotel room in the morning, waiting for them to tell me exactly what time to meet them.  Then on a little machine that looked like a plain-paper fax, out came a piece of paper.  I read it and it was a note from them on where and when to meet.  But it was not a fax.  I thought to myself "this is what they mean by electronic mail."  But then I realized that this paper was an original.  It had original ink or signature, and I then realized that the paper had actually been transmitted by them across town into the receiving machine in my hotel room, by some route built for paper transmissions.  I was amazed.  In another part of this dream, I told a nice man I had met recently that I was feeling a little sick lately.  There were a few other friends around too.  He knew homeopathic remedies and he started giving me some pellets or herbs for various things.  He diagnosed by my symptoms, and by looking at me could see what I needed.  Then he wanted to give me a homeopathic herbal suppository, because he believed I just needed to take a good shit.  He started to place it toward the back of my pants, so I could take over and insert it.  I was so emphatic about not wanting it.  I kept refusing and refusing, even though he said it was mild and ok for me.  He said, "oh, have you ever taken two of these" and laughed like he knew the result was too strong.  I told him, "I can't mess with that, or I'll never take a shit.  I make sure I take good shits by relaxing, eating healthy food, and herbs, but if I start messing with putting things there, it stresses me out and I won't ever go."
