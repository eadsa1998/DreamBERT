The February freshman class at Art School was making a tour of the school. We seemed to walk in rows of two's although there wasn't much order and you were walking with a different person every few minutes. We passed the auditorium balcony where the rest of the school was having some sort of an assembly. The doors were open and we heard a boy make horrible noises on his accordion. The freshman class was very noisy, and I thought they should be quiet and not disturb the assembly. I got into an argument with one of the girls and told her she should not be so selfish. We continued arguing even when we passed into another hall. When we were through with the tour, our class met in one of the rooms where a woman was talking. I didn't listen, but talked to my girlfriend about my cousin and showed her a button he sent me from a New Zealand soldier's uniform. We wondered if the woman who was talking would know what the button was. The class was dismissed.
