I was outside of a cave with a crowd of people. We had heard that the world was coming to an end and everyone was trying to save himself by hiding in the cave. I refused to go in, saying that I would rather stay outside and take my chances than get walled up in the cave. My fiance stayed with me outside and the others went in and closed up the opening to the cave. We sat on a stairway and waited.
