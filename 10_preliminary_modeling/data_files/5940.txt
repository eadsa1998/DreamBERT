Am walking down a street with Carl Rider, Editor of a newspaper, and suddenly he puts his hand on my fly. I protest, telling him that they arrest you for that in this city. I relate story of a man who fell down in street and of a chap who walked over and knelt down to help the man up ... and was then arrested by the police. Carl and I stop at a magazine stand and we look at some maps. Later am in my house talking with HH, a well-known stamp dealer, who notices a large calendar on my desk with the number "024" on it. I blush because I realize it is the one I took during a visit to Rider's office. I tell HH it is a duplicate of one in my own office.
