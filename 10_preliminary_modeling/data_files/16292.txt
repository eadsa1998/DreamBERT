I don't remember too much about my dream last night, but I do remember this: it was kind of funky! [laugh] There was this company called CP Dock and Surround Affairs, and I had remembered hearing about them one or two other times and in my dream they were coming in our yard to put a pipe -- for some reason put a pipe from under the house in the ground up to the back of where the computer desk is. And that could have been _____, but I don't know why. And, oh yeah, I was just f____ in the dream. And when Dad got home I heard the reason why they put that, I don't know why they put the pipe there, but there was ________. They had taken a broken dock away from another house and they were going to give it to us so that we could put cement out on it and sit out by the alley and listen to surround sound on the little cement dock. [laugh] That was crazy, man!
