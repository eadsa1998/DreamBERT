I was on a computer and checking on my 'hot or not' quiz. Darren had been the last person to take it. The quiz wasn't the same though; there were actually a bunch of smaller ones, with say, 10 questions. Each question either had two pictures of the same person or two pictures of different people and you pick the one you like more. The one Darren had taken had some celebrity woman called Elene [insert foreign Greek-y name]. He had only answered two questions and had ended up with 4%. One of his answers was 'hot', the other 'not'. Mom was saying that Elene was pretty ugly. Then I was at home. Dad and Ezra were there. Dad had all this fresh breakfast food such as bread, but Ezra asked for McDonald's breakfast and Dad complained. My laptop was different. Dad had this ultra spiffy version which had 'toolbars' everywhere, which made it really confusing. At some point, we were in the car and Ezra was in the back. Ezra mentioned two movies from 2006, one of which was The Departed and I said "Not only are they both from 2006, they both contain Matt Damon!". I couldn't remember what the other movie was though. I was on a computer later, checking all the movies I watched in 2006.
