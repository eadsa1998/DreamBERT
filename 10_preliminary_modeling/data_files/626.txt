I am walking through the town next to my hometown with my son who is a small child in the dream. WE come to the bank which has been turned into a restaurant. It is very busy. A lady with a dress shop across the street asks if I think it will affect her business. Her place looks nice and I say no. We continue down the hill to my hometown. I notice my son's eyes are very blue but later realize they are really hazel, therefore I must have had my oldest son, and not the younger one, with me. At some point I also stop at a kindergarten class. I get to my hometown and realize my son is missing. I go back looking for him. He is not at the school and I think by now he must have found his way home, but I wonder if he hasn't what then?
