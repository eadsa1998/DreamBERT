Something had happened and we lost our money.  We all had to move out- my parents, my maternal Grandma Jane and I (and my boyfriend Jeremy?)  I kept talking to my mother about it as we were packing- I didn't understand what happened.  My dad was still working, rent was only a thousand a month, couldn't we afford that?  She said he'd had some issues with his supervisor about twice a month.  At some point I'd realized that Grandma Jane's house was paid off...so why was she packing?  Somehow it had to do with legalities: the house had to be empty before it could be sold?/moved into.  So she would pack up all her things and then move back in with the rest of us.  While they were closing the deal or something, I went down below.  There were colorful metal bars arranged in squares holding up the table.  Bart and Lisa Simpson were there as 'the other kids'.  We weren't happy, and started shaking the structure, somehow trying to prevent what was going on above us.  Horizontal support bars were falling away, weakening the structure.
