I was at the CAS office building with BJ and a man that I had a romantic interest in. I think there were other people with us, also. I thought the interest was mutual. For some reason we were going to be spending the night there in an office suite, but not the CAS suite. We had come up with makeshift sleeping quarters. BJ decided she was going to sleep with this man that I was interested in, even though she knew of my interest. It didn't bother her. I think he put her off and wouldn't agree to share a bed with her because of his interest in me. I was very concerned about being in that building because I did not want to run into Bill C or for him to even see me.
