I don't remember exactly where we were, that part is a little blurry. I do remember that I was with two friends of mine, Ann &amp; Betty (Note they are lovers). Anyway we were chatting and drinking. I was quite drunk. Ann was cuddling up to me, not too different from our normal activities. Anyway she began hitting on me, and I'm pretty sore. We were kissing. Her girlfriend was right there and was not angry at me, but at Ann. It seemed as though Ann was doing it to get a rise out of her girlfriend. It felt quite harmless from my perspective, and I guess I enjoyed it. During the dream I was a bit puzzled and I tried to figure out to what extent I had been attracted to Ann. I never really fantasized about her previously.
