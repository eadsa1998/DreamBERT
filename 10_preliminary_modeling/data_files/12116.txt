I was at a water place and these people were chasing me. I went under water. At a jail place, there was something about A Bit of Fry and Laurie. They were doing some play. I managed to escape. Water was going to 'appear' at some place. There had been a drought? The water made stuff green. Mr Nixon was or had a snake with no mouth or colour. I was in a prison and I kept saying schfifty five. This guy said he'd cut me up into 99 pieces if I said it again.
