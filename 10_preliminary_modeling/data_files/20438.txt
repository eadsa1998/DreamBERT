I was in an auditorium of a hospital where I was a patient. An officer named DeCaterino told me to go into the hall and straighten a sign. In the hall an employee passed and asked me why I was there alone. I explained, but he didn't believe me. He made me stand in the rear of the auditorium while a movie was shown.
