 I'm in a tent with my roommate Stephen Ramos. I wake up from sleeping and remember a dream. The dream is as follows: We are deer hunting on his land. We are down by his brother Jose's deer stand. We see a huge black bear. We slowly walk backwards. The huge bear wanders away. I see two more black bears. They are smaller than the first, but still big. Then there are many bears all over the place. Stephen and I each have a shotgun with slugs. Stephen puts on a bear mask. It looks like the real head of a bear. The bears come near to me. I shoot three of the bears in the head: Jake and two other bears. Another bear, which is my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, is upon me, and I am out of slugs. I awake from this dream, and don't have my dream journal. Stephen tells me I should have defecated before I went to bed because I was farting in my sleep. I know this isn't possible, but don't say anything to him. We are at our deer-hunting campsite. Jose and Franco Ramos are there too. I look out the door of our tent and see two hunters walking down the path along the fence towards Jose's deer stand. It is getting light outside. I realize we have overslept and are losing valuable hunting time. I get up. I have my Washington University pajama pants on. I go out of the tent. There are two men on the edge of our camp. They are on the edge of the woods. Our camp seems to be between the house and the woods, just south of the house. The men see a buck, and we see it too. It is close to camp, and we are in the line of fire for these men, so we move. The men scare the buck by throwing a flaming piece of two by four wood at it and firing a shot in front of it. The deer runs. Everyone fires at the deer, including Jose. At first, it looks like Jose is using a handgun. The deer escapes unscathed. It runs into the field. People fired shots to make it run in a certain direction, so they could shoot it. I am looking for my bag of clothes. I can't find it.
