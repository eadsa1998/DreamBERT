I was at the Technical College, which was different and I saw Dmitri. We had a quick chat and discovered he was joining our course. Later I walked past him again talking to a teacher and I heard my name and the conversation seemed to imply that he was trying to get into my class. I sent a message to the group saying 'a guy I had a crush on in highschool is joining diploma' and when I checked replies I had a reply from Cecelia and Judah and I realised I'd sent it to the wrong group chat. I was running about doing stuff for a while and was stressed about whatever it was. Then it was a game and this girl was going to college or something for the first time and had a younger sister. They were in the car and the Mom was driving them. She got there and it was weird and she was in her room, and there was a door downstairs leading to this creepy 'hell' type place where some kind of devil guy was. It kept resetting, though she always remembered bits of it and he made things 'creepier' for her each time. She opened a cupboard at one point and these cards were being invisibly thrown around and she knocked a bunch of stuff over to try and make it stop but it didn't. Then there were a few people in the hall next to the stairs and there was a dark tunnel that led underneath the stairs to the other hall. They were waiting for something and I noticed the devil guy standing in the shadows and I yelled out and she attacked him and killed him, but then he came back bigger and she killed him and then he came back bigger and stronger again and with other bosses and I had no idea how to beat this level.
