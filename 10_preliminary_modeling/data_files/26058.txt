 I'm fishing for carp with my friends the Ramos'. We don't catch any big ones. Franco Ramos is a professional raccoon hunter. He hunts from a boat with a dog. We quit fishing there and follow a guide boat with an arrow on it, like a flashing orange road construction arrow. The boat leads several boats, and when it gets too far ahead of the other boats it makes a looping circle, and the boats that were following go on past the guide boat. Franco says we need to be ready to go up to 65 miles per hour. My roommate Stephen Ramos drives the boat, while Franco gives directions. We jump over trees and rocks and break through windows as we go. I'm on the bow. I fall out of the boat when a big bump happens, but I hang onto the bow and swing around and get in the other side of the boat. We come to a shallow bay. It is very thick with weeds on the edges but clear on the inside. We go into the clear area. There are a couple other boats there. I see two smallmouth bass. I cast a spinnerbait by them. They follow it a bit but don't hit it. I know this big yellow and orange spinnerbait is not the ideal lure but don't want to take the time to change lures. I cast several times near them, but don't get them to hit.
