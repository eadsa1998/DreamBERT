I was watching One Tree Hill and Brooke was working in a diner. She was serving food and getting flashbacks of war images due to something that happened to her. One of the foods was some sort of sweet pie. There was an old couple. The old lady asked something and this other worker girl said they would hurry. The old lady said to the old man that his pies were served too rushed and were "put together with shaky hands". He looked at her and cried. Someone tried to give a phone to this guy behind the counter and told him to answer it. The phone was actually bomb. Then we were in this bank and someone said "get the transporter". Then this guy suddenly spun around and kicked all these guns that were on the floor and sent them under these red lounges nearby. He did some other spiffy fighting moves and made it to the other side of the room. I said "effects!". He was handcuffed to some guy and was still fighting. This guy said "why don't you take your handcuffs off?". The guy, who was British, said "I don't know ok!". On Yahoo there was a thing about how Jeffrey Dean Morgan got a call from some woman about some "exciting" film role and mentioned him being a hallucination on Grey's Anatomy and something else.
