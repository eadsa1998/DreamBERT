I was attending some kind of event for adults that was being held in some kind of school. I think an elementary school. I went to find a women room. It seems that there was one attached to each classroom but I didn't want to use that one so I went out into the hall looking for another one. There had been special signs made because of this event and they were hanging on the doors of the restrooms. I found the women room and went in. As I using it I saw a woman talking to her daughter. I looked at someone else and we kind of half-grinned at each other. I don't remember what she was saying. Maybe she was toilet-training this little girl. It seems that some of the people that I knew, a number of the people at this event, in fact it was some people from my own grade school. Paulette W and Cindy S were both there.
