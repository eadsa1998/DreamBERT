[1997-06-08] I was in a repair garage somewhere in the woods somehow it got in the woods. Its not like its echoey...you could smell a lot of, burning smell. Not like gas, but like the tar on a telephone pole, I don't know if its called tar or creosote. My brother Sam was there, I guess it was his car in the garage and he said "Well I can't see anything burning." And I said "Well I can smell it." And I said "Well, we've got to get out of here." There were a bunch of other people, some were blind and some that weren't and finally when the smell got too much, we all ran and he said "Well, I'll get you to where the woods meets the edge of the road." He leaves the dream but somehow gets us to the edge of this road I don't know how I knew the car was in the garage, I just sensed it. It wasn't a color or a specific size, I just knew that it was in there and was burning up.
