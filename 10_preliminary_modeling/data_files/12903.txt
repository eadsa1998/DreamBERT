I was at Oliver Queen's (Smallville) house. I was looking out the window and he was fighting some people. I saw him with an arrow and then saw Green Arrow's outfit and I called out that he should use it. He came back and Lois (Smallville) came in. She saw the arrow and I said something about it being replica. Later, I was sleeping in his bed. Mom took my bag because she thought it was rubbish.
