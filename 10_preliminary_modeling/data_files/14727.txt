I was at the shop getting an almond magnum out of the freezer. At first I checked the fat content of the cookies and cream one. Mom was lifting me into the freezer (I was almost all the way upside down reaching in). My shirt started falling up and there were some guys nearby and so I tried to keep it down. This guy pointed out an acid spill on the floor. We went to the lolly section and I wanted to get some. It was self serve like. I ate some of my ice-cream. When we were leaving I opened a packet of lamingtons. We went to the checkout and then it was like a game. I was in a multistory like hotel but each room had things like poker games going on. No-one was really around and there were some aliens. I kept getting chased out and kept not getting out in time. Then one of the times I got out just in time. To get out though you had to go through the proper checkout and if you didn't you had to go through those rotating metal things. I crawled along the ground and took a photo. Later Mom and I were in a car driving down Beach Road. This cop and a girl were on a motorbike and the cop was trying to make her get this ball and kick it on the grass (so she could arrest her and get a blood sample). She wouldn't do it and said she would only give information to help. The cop slowed us down and then she arrested her.
