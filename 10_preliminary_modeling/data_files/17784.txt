My boyfriend Jeremy and my parents and I were on an adventure of some sort.  We had to climb a wall- the difficulty was not in the wall but in the tiny space we had to squeeze through at the top.  There were hamsters, with longish legs, like Ralph Mouse.  One had a little had on like Indiana Jones, and there was another wearing a vest.  There were quite a few, and very cute.  Finally we managed over the wall and were in a restaurant waiting to be seated.  I talked to someone else waiting about the adventure.  He was asking me which role I was playing.  I was disappointed when Jeremy told him I was just the Amazon archer.  Then I was back in my 5th/6th grade teacher Mr. Man's class.  It was near the end of school and we were supposed to be on a field trip to the beach.  He was out somewhere, and I was with someone sorting the grammar papers into three piles, of the fifth grade, sixth grade, and the class from the previous year.  He was going to change the plans, so I called and talked to him, convincing him to let us go to the beach as discussed.  I gathered my stuff and we went out to the beach.  I was wearing some baggy green sweatpants I had to pull up before putting my feet in the water.  There was a little hut on the water that my old classmate Gabe went to sit on.
