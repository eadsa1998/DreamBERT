Ezra got a baby. We went to the shop and left it in the car. We also had a rat which was dark brown/black at the front and 3/4 down its back was a different colour. At the shop, we got some chocolate for Easter. We found baby clothing, but it was at a food shop so there wasn't much. We asked Mom if she checked on the baby. They had Firefly clothes for babies. There was a quest on World of Warcraft in the Noblegarden area. I had to find eggs. There was also a shooting star which I had to find.
