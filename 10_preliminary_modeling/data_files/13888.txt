I don't remember the start and it was possibly a continuation of the last dream (definitely a different dream), but Eugene and I were running from zombies, but they weren't really zombies. They would mostly walk slow, but would suddenly start running fast. They also didn't seem very zombie like. We were at a big shop, in an outside area. There were lots of dead people around -- slumped over in chairs and on the ground. Their eyes were turning red and their skin was saggy. There was a radio, which was repeating old recordings and it said something about a weapons/military place and I suggested we go there as there would be good protection. As we were talking, some zombies started to slowly come towards us and they sped up so we ran. We ran behind this column and hid there. They ran past and so we came out from behind it, but one was still there and when we killed it we made some noise, so took off before the others came back. We went into a food hall and we were hiding underneath a table, but I decided to run into the next room. Eugene hesitated and the zombies came in and he thought they were going to get me and said "sorry!" because he wasn't going to go with me, but the zombies didn't come for me, they just wandered around the place, looking around, so Eugene ran to the next room with me. I don't know what happened to him but in the next room it was full of zombies. I was alone and some of them were eating. They completely ignored me. I started waving in the face of one of them, who was eating a bloody foot, and I hit him with something. He growled, but other than that they ignored me.
