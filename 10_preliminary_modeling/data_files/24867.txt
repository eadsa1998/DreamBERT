I was at home with my mom (we had just walked in the door), and this lady asked if she could come in. I asked for her name and who she was, and she started yelling at me. Then they broke into the house. Then we were at an apartment complex and I was in my PJs. Those same robbers came and stabbed me and my mom with some bamboo stick. I ran and called 911 and they came very quickly. But when the ambulance came, our wounds had healed and we were all fine. But they caught the robbers, and put them in jail. Setting: In my house, and a strange apartment complex that looked like my house on the inside, but different on the outside. Characters: My mom and my sister were there, and I know them. There were two Asian robbers and I have no clue who they are, and why they were Asian. The 911 operator I talked to was my sister's friend from school. I know the guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared, worried, relieved. I thought the dream was kind of scary because people were stabbed, but I was amazed our wounds healed quickly. At one point in the middle of the night I woke up sweating, but then fell back asleep and the dream started again.
