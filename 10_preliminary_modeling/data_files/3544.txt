I am being forced to marry a man by some irresistible force, possibly alien or spiritual. I try to escape. I do not want to be married. I don't even know the man. I get in an elevator and it starts to go sideways across University campus to the site of the wedding. I try to stay in the elevator but I am forced out, by some force I cannot see. There is no escape. I am now in a wedding dress, the wedding party is there and it is happening even as I fight it. I feel powerless. I don't want traditional marriage. It sets women back generations.
