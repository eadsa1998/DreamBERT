I was staying at this hotel thing. The rooms were small and there was just a bathroom and a little bed with a tiny bit of space. Before we'd come here, Dad and Ezra had discussed places they wanted to stay for something to do with tea. Then we were at the old house and Dad left the car running outside. Some kids went into it and I started banging on the door yelling at them. Dad ran out and turned off the car and it rolled down the hill. He ran to the house across the road to stop it. Nana and Poppa drove past. Then we were at the hotel again. Alexander Skarsgard was there and his hair was wet and down and he didn't look as hot. Then he looked normal and we were secretly seeing each other. Mom was in the room too. When she wasn't looking, he would kiss me or touch my arm. At one point, Mom bent over next to us and he pinched my bum. We went into the hall and he held me against him and the wall and kissed me. I heard Mom coming. My hands were on his chest and I pushed him away. The others left to go somewhere. He went to leave and said that he forgot his coat and he came in and held me and kissed me again. Then I was at Nana's and Poppa asked if I'd gotten rid of 'that friend' and they meant Calvin. I said I hadn't spoken to him in "a year and a bit" but we were friends on Facebook. He said he was the devil. Nana had a cold and I said I was just getting over one (I still sounded like I had one). There was a movie called Dead of Night, but it was different.
