I was at 'Mom's'. There was a bull ant running around the house. I needed one for school and so instead of killing it, everyone was trying to catch it. They were really dangerous. Some boy wet his pants and the floor was really wet. I had told Mr Quinlan that Ezra said he'd seen him with Mom and he said it wasn't true. I said that I didn't think it was. I was in Mom's room and I saw the ant. She caught it with her fingers and I had to get a Milo tin with this spiffy lid. Someone pricked my finger and it hurt.
