This dude, girl and I were on a boat. We had to go fast somewhere and we all had to hold on tight to each other. We did this a second time and the girl was dying, but sometimes she was Spaceman. He kept trying to escape. We ended up at this hospital which looked more like a hotel. It was now a girl again, and her parents came. Her father brought wire to strangle her. I took it off of him. I was upset because she was dying and I was thinking about Vivian for some reason.
