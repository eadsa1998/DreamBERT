When I awoke, I remembered my dream perfectly and I thought, "I'm going to write it just this way," that was about two hours ago, but then I fell asleep again and now I don't remember, although I saw something that stayed with me: I had gone to the third floor of my building where a family lives who are my friends, because it was the birthday of one of them: Chiqui. I went in and everybody was there. They are eight children, but nobody paid attention to me. I started to talk to someone and at that point I got up. I passed by Chiqui and I remembered, I went to where she was sitting and on my knees and hugging her from the back. I sang Happy Birthday in her ear. I wanted everything to go well. I had the feeling I had done the right thing, and that I wasn't going to lose her affection.
