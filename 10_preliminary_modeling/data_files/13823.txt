Mom had gotten a crossword scratchie and got 15 words on it (which was the highest and worth $130000). I was looking at it. She had forgotten to scratch some other stuff (which increased her winnings). We were at this shop and this lady who worked at a clothes shop made these pants for me and they were so tight my legs went red. Dancing in the Dark was on the radio. I don't know what happened next, but I was then in the car with Darren. There were zombies. There were a lot wandering around. Darren went into this little deli and I locked the doors. This female zombie kept hanging around. Darren came back and she attached herself to the window. We went to this place. Then Darren was someone else, a friend of mine. We went to this guy's house, who turned out to be Robert Sean Leonard and we were knocking on the door to wake him up. He let us inside, but realized this zombie liked that house (he had a house, this shed like house and a little stingy house thing), so he sent us to the stingy one because it was safer. There were little, squishy beds. Some little zombie kept staring at me. I started talking to it in a silly voice. She was like 2 years old and I thought she was retarded. I was like "stop teasing me!". Her father started bashing her for teasing people and I was like 'oops'.
