I was listening to the radio at about 8:30 p.m., when I realized that the disc jockey that I was listening to was Bob Anderson.  There was no direct evidence of it, but somehow I knew he was broadcasting his show directly from our office.  I also knew or suspected that he went off the air at 9:00 or shortly before, so I decided to give him a call before he went off the air.  I picked up the phone to dial 699-7469, but had only dialed about one digit when I got an operator who was handling an incoming long distance call to me.  It was from Doug Sterme.  It was about 8:40 at the time.  He was going to be in "West Virginia" the next day and wondered if we could get together.  (I put quotes around WV, because I suggested that I drive up and meet him in Bloomsburg, PA.)  I either had in mind or actually suggested the Hotel Magifore as a meeting place.  (The interstate buses stop there.)  We agreed to get together, but after I hung up, I realized that I should have suggested that we could spend the night at the Lingerman's farm nearby.  When I hung up it was just after 8:45, so I quickly dialed 699-7469 (although I was worried about getting some interference from the radio, which was nearby and not turned down).  I didn't talk to Bob (or Doug) but reached someone else, who promised to relay my message (of best wishes, good job, etc.).  When I hung up, I think music was playing, and I never did hear whether he got the message.  Either he went off the air, or I woke up.
