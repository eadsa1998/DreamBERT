Something about a nude club for teenagers, who are in general better swimmers than those who go to clubs where swimsuits are required. The connection is never explained. The patrons of the nude club are all issued brown towels, hence the nickname of this club, "The Brown Towel". Gah. While at this club I run into Heather. She's older, taller, more slender, has short tousled dishwater blonde hair, and is really desirable. She's basically standoffish towards me. I ask if she's still in magazine work, and she says yes. She's an editor at a small magazine, but soon she's going to move on to something bigger and better. Then she started up a computer and began working on something. I saw her in profile, and she kept changing into a woman with black hair, severely thin, and basically ugly.
