I was in a large classroom, exam going on, but I had a form to fill out and didn't know if it was the right one for a retired person. In a dining room with table set for three. I joined them and the waiter set a fourth place. Then a man came in to call for the forms. I said yes and produced them and asked if this was the right one for a retired person. He said yes and I asked him how to answer one question. He said he couldn't wait. I'd have to return in the afternoon and he walked off while I called after him, "You're an old meany."
