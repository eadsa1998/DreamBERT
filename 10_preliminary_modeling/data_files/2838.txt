I'm in a line getting ready to get into the parade. I start to take my place and notice I'd be walking behind a garbage truck and change my mind. Then I let several people ahead of me. I see Archie, and he has a wagon contraption tied to him and he is dragging a man around as part of his costume. I wonder if that won't hurt the man to be drug around so much. He doesn't seem to mind. Archie leaves to go to the bathroom; the line starts to move. Several women shove ahead of me and I shove them back. We have a shoving power struggle and I win, but feel silly having done that, also feel surprised I did that and kind of pleased. I try and drag Archie's wagon to help keep him in line. He catches up and we go through a gate and he puts his arms around me from behind and says, "I missed you at Asa's house." I hesitate and then lean into his tentative embrace. I say, "No one asked me." He says, "I hoped you'd be there," and then he kisses me and I respond and we roll and do contact improv things as we kiss and embrace. It feels wonderful.
