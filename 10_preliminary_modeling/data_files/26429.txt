 I'm riding in my dad's gray car. My friend Niles Zelling is driving, and my friend Tim Zelling is in the back seat. We're going to Windton. Niles drives fast: over 90 miles per hour. We stop very abruptly at an intersection where we turn onto a highway. Tim and I comment on this stop, which was too jerky. I look at the map and try to figure out how long it will take to get there. There are mileage and time markers on the map between cities. They indicate the trip will be well over three hours. I don't think this is too accurate for us. By looking at the distances between cities that are familiar to me, I estimate it will take about one hour and 45 minutes. The first town we'll go through is named Norton or Horton. On the map, the road becomes a one-way highway to Windton. There is no returning road: it is Highway 15, in Montana.
