I lived in this house with Graham Chapman, his sister [which he didn't have in real life] and his mother. Later, it turned out that Graham and I were engaged. Anyway, I went to a pub place which was joined to the aforementioned Timezone place [but it was a different dream]. I got home the same time Graham got home and so did his mother, we went to go in but his sister, I think, was on the phone and we listened to her conversation which didn't make sense. We went inside and I cleaned up the sister's room with a piece of paper which sucked things up. I went to my room and was cleaning things up properly, when I heard someone whistling. Graham had opened my door a little and was whistling some song. I turned back around, but he continued whistling and it was annoying. I asked him what he wanted and he said "a kiss". It was just a 'peck' [Sims wise] but then it turned into a 'smooch' or 'makeout' (it was extremely vivid, and I can remember how it felt and tasted). I think earlier on in the dream, Graham and his sister had tried out this new trend, which was walking around naked, but Graham didn't like it. Also when we were all walking home, I hugged a pillar near the house and there was 'ae' written on it and I said "I love a's".
