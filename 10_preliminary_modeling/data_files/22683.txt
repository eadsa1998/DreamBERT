We were in a garden (I don't remember very well) having a s√©ance, but as though it were something funny, and we made questions. All of us were sitting in a circle on the grass, each asking about his plans, and the spirit would answer. We were several people (but I don't remember which). Armand was among them. I don't remember the questions either. I only remember that one of them (I don't remember who) was told that the revolution would succeed.
