I was at Mom's and there were three guys who all had the last name "Pritchard". One of them was called Eugene, but wasn't the 'real' Eugene Pritchard. I liked one of them, who looked like the 'real' Eugene Pritchard. Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus were there. I went home to get a video camera. The walls went down. Ezra wanted something, but I don't remember what.
