 I'm in a car with a couple men. We seem to be in a drive-up teller area. They talk to a couple women who are there, one of whom is my sister Heather. As we drive away one of them says the blond woman (Heather) is cute. I say that she is my sister. They seem not to believe me, so we turn around and go back so I can show or prove to them that Heather is my sister. We do, and Heather confirms that she's my sister in her "So what?" manner. I say something to them about the University of Wellington. It hen catch myself and realize that these two men were in New South Wales with me! There is a small underground parking ramp nearby.
