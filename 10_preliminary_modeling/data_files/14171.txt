There were zombies. I was with Eugene and some others. It was dark. We went into this building. There were three rooms. The one we were in had a big red 'foam' mattress thing (like a rectangle) and it almost went as high as the roof. There was an archway leading to the next room, which contained a windowed door leading outside and a normal door leading to another room, which also had a red mattress thing and was like an inside gym. This room had a bolted door at the far end. It also had another door leading to the first room. Anyway, I checked the place for zombies. I opened the bolted door and this black guy came in saying they were coming. Elijah helped me close the door and we had trouble bolting it. The zombies started pushing against it. I ran to leave. I went to go through the door we came through but zombies had already started coming through so I ran the other way. Eugene had gone that way too. There weren't many zombies this way. There were a few steps outside leading down to a carpark, which was quite full. We ran down the steps. Eugene got a car and picked me up. I was in the back. I was about to lock the doors but I saw Sophia Bush in the carpark and let her in (we were friends). There was a guy driving a car in front of us and he was driving really slowly and kept stopping and we ended up hitting the back of him. We got past him but he started chasing us. We drove over an oval and he followed. We ended up losing him shortly after that and drove into an underground carpark, which was also pretty full. We parked and were looking for a fast car. I found this silver one which looked fast and it was hard to drive. We left the carpark and saw Autumn riding in a closed Segway.
