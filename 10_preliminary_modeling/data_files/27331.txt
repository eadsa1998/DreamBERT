I dreamed I was in a Speech Class at M--- and the girl in front of me kept fidgeting &amp; told the teacher not to call on her as she was too nervous. Next I was in a class which was electing some committees. I remember seeing the words, "Christmas" and "Easter" on the board, and I couldn't see any reason for having to hold the election. We all dropped what we were doing &amp; went outside. There was a beach and a bunch of girls &amp; fellows were either building something out in the water or else were trying to hold a picnic on a sand bar. I seemed to be on the committee for the gathering and was called to the phone. It was some boy's mother, &amp; she kept talking continuously &amp; seemed interested in Boy Scouts. Meanwhile everyone was busy carrying things to the sand bar. By the time I finished talking all the work was done, &amp; I remember going out in a boat with a gang. It was dark and the waves were high. Somehow I found myself in a bedroom which in the dream was supposed to be my girlfriend's bedroom. It was quite cluttered up, particularly the top of the dresser, and I was disgusted with the condition of it. The wallpaper was of huge red rose design. (In reality the girlfriend, who is 20 years old, has an entirely differently decorated room--although she is rather careless with her belongings.)
