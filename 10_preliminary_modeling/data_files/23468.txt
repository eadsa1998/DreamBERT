I was involved with food in my dreams. I had ice cream. I saw a chocolate donut being made where they were spraying chocolate on both sides. It was huge. I went to a cafeteria and ate a bunch of food and was left with a bunch of dirty dishes I had to wash afterwards. I learned a new process where you could heat up baked beans with a hair dryer. When I woke up I thought bean soup might taste good.
