I can't remember properly, but my fourth top tooth on my left side was a bit loose. For years, whenever I touched it, it hurt. Dad got a 'bill' from a place for money from a song that I hadn't paid for and it cost like $900. I had to write some people down and Mom said "she's got 15 people". Dad thought I was going to blame Austin for the money. This all had something to do with my tooth. Ezra was there. We left there and I was with Mom and Ezra. I asked Mom which tooth and as she said a 'strong' tooth, I pulled it out. I wiped the gum and this black stuff was on it. I was watching Dexter, I think and Dexter and Deb were talking about their favourite 'team' or something and it was made up. There was something about Torchwood.
