I had a dream that I was riding on a ski lift with other people. I don't think I knew the people. I was going to class but it took a long time to get there. It became scary for a while because something was wrong with the ride. I remember thinking that I shouldn't have gone on the ski lift, that I should have walked instead. I think by the time I got to class, it was over. I remember leaving some of my things on the ride but there was no way for me to get them back.
