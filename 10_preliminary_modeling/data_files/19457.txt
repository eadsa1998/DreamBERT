Two doctors were examining me. First doctor pressed on lower section of my abdomen and asked if I wasn't on a strain. I asked the second doctor (probably Matt) to pay especial attention to my heart. He said my heart was in fairly good condition but, if things went along as they had been doing, I doubtless would have appendicitis in my 52nd or 62nd year. (He mentioned only 1 year, but which is not clear).
