Someone had asked me to babysit their child for a little while. He was a toddler so I decided I would probably be okay with that. It was Matthew as a child. After the parents left I went upstairs to his room. He was standing in his crib, though later he looked to be five or six years old, certainly too old to be in a crib. Now we're in my home. I ask him if he wants to help me move some things. I want to move a bunch of dumbbells from the top closet shelf in one room to another. I start with the small ones that I think he will be able to carry with no problem.
