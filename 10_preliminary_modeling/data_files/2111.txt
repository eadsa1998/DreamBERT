A man and I made a tape of our songs. We are invited to NY City to see the big producer. I find the building and go in. I'm in my wheelchair. Lots of his subordinates hover around me. I tell them to relax and not get so uptight about my disability. They are over-helping. I go into the big office. He's surprised I'm disabled and wants to forget the project. I tell him I only sing medium. Lots of people sing better, but my disability is a hook. Use it. I show him my Enrnestine book ideas. He's interested and says, "Let's meet after lunch." I go out and ask the secretary to help me find two papers. She's reluctant. I snip, "Oh well, don't bother." I'm angry at her, but realize it's probably a good lesson for me. I ask directions to a hotel. She points to several places on the city streets. I go in search of a place to rest and eat.
