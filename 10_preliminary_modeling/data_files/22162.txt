I dreamed that I worked in a circus, that I was a trapeze artist. When I was up on the trapeze, I was terrific. I could do anything and I worked with a very pretty girl. There was a midget who scared the children. He had a very large face and a strange look. Sometimes I looked at him, and it seemed to me that the midget was growing and getting strong. The midget had fallen in love with the girl I worked with. One day he took her away from the circus. He had grown up. I searched for her everywhere, because I couldn't find her. Then someone told me that the midget had taken her away and I laughed because I thought the midget couldn't carry a full-grown woman. But he told me that it wasn't a midget, but someone very tall. And then I ran and was able to find him and asked him where she was, and he said he didn't know. Then I grabbed his lapels and he started to grow taller and taller. Then I awoke.
