I am walking up some steep stairs to an attic storage room to see what the guys have stored up there. There are rows and rows of soda jerk equipment, and way in the back a bedroom for a man. It is rickety and the railing is loose, and Pete P wants to protect me. He has a bed sheet and is trying to lay it against the railing side, so I have something to hang on to so I won't fall. By the time I make it back down, he has it arranged. I'd gotten down by myself with him trying to help, but not really being helpful. He comes to me and hugs me gently and lovingly. He loves me. Then I start to realize he is transforming. He is black with red eyes, an entity and I am afraid.
