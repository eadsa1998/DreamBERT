I was meeting my class for lunch at a sidewalk restaurant downtown.  About six of the students were there, but there were about four others missing.  We waited a long time, and I began to be very anxious that I hadn't given them the correct directions or something.  After a while I got up and began to walk around the streets, and finally spotted them at another sidewalk caf√©.  They saw me and got up to come with me.  I was afraid that the other students would have left by then, but they were still there.
