The setting was filled with small airplanes manned by various people including myself, and they seem to buzz around more than anything else, coming in out of the picture or the scene. This, mixed with a feeling of being in school, was basically the extent of the dream. The number of airplanes was most of the time just one, that which I was flying, occasionally two or three, but they never were present all at the same time on the screen. One may be flying somewhere in the back or at a higher elevation. I'm in the other two and therefore cannot be seen. However, most of the time it seemed to be my airplane that was being followed. I have a feeling at times of being examined and it seemed as if the examiner was visible, but it's possible that he wasn't. It was no one I recognized. I may be just assuming that there are other people in this dream. It's possible the planes are flying of their own accord. However, I believe there was someone in them.
