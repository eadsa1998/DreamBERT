I enter the exit door of a red brick grammar school and sit on the hall steps. See a small child's penknife on step and pick it up and then cannot decide whether to leave or walk thru the school. I hesitate, but don't want to be found sitting on steps, so get up and walk down the corridor. In an open area I see 10-12 women sitting on chairs waiting. As I reach them, one looks up at my hair and then I realize with a shock that I have clips and pins in my hair and am wearing a bouffant night cap. Walk quickly to a dim area of corridor and quickly remove the items. I walk into a library area where there is an exhibit of work by children. One is on the subject of trees and I sit down to admire it. A woman, probably a teacher, walks over and hands me a notice about the exhibit and assumes I want to meet the child responsible. I say Yes and he comes over and I tell him that I had heard about him from his mother who comes to the school each day to look at his empty desk where he used to be. We both agree this is absurd. I look at each tree exhibit and they are well executed. Some are carvings, some show age of trees from slices, and I enjoy exhibit and keep saying it is very well made.
