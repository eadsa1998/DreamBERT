I look at a building that is being built out of a rock face of a mountain. I say, "Hey, it's almost done, you can hardly see the rock face at all." It's a brick and glass building now. I walk toward it and a man comes out from the left to greet me. This building is like the University Admissions building and this man is an administrator type. I say, "That sure looks great." He asks if I'd like to go see the inside, even though it's not completely finished. I say sure. We go to the door, which is heavy and hard for me to open. The man is not helpful, and seems hesitant to even want me to go in now. I get the door open and go in. I walk up some stairs. Portions of the floor seem warped even though this is a brand new building. I go around a corner and see booths like Saturday market indoors. This is City Hall and all the departments have booths instead of offices. The first booth I see is the New World Theatre Booth. A man there, an actor, asks if I know where Derek is, because he'd really like to work with him again. I say, "I'll tell him. I'm sure he'd like to do that." I go to the next booth, a woman and her husband. I think they do costumes.
