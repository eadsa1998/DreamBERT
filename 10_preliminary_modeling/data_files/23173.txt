Someone was chasing two Indians, who were suspected of some crime, down the train tracks, just ahead of an oncoming train.  Since they made no attempt to leave the tracks, for some reason, I assumed they would still be on the tracks when the train made a big curve and approached my location, so I planned to head them off.  When the train appeared, though, they were not in sight; instead, there was a man doing something to sabotage the train or the track-I'm not sure what.  I knew I would need a weapon to threaten him with, to force him to undo what he had done.  I went to a nearby tool shed and decided on an axe.  I told him he had made a serious mistake (at least that's what I wanted to tell him, but said "done a serious thing" instead) because he was messing with the federal government.  He was disdainful and refused to undo what he had done.  Before I could use the axe, he pulled a gun and aimed it at my chest.  I didn't really think he would shoot, but I was scared.  I didn't show it, however.  I looked him steadily in the eye and said, "I'm not scared, because if you shoot me, a million people from the government will come looking for you."  He continued to point the gun at me in silence for a few seconds, thinking about what I had said, and then he fired twice in succession.  To my shock, I felt no impact.
