I was at university and we were doing an experiment. There was a pretty blue solution. Raquel was there. The next experiment involved noodles. I was then walking down a street and some guys were saying something. Someone asked something about "Audrey". Someone said that I'd been having sex with her and I was like '...what?'. I got home and went into my room. There was a girl in my bed and my computer was not there. I asked Dad why there was a girl in my room and everyone was saying that I should know since I'd been sleeping with her. I had never seen her before.
