I saw a cow get bounced from a penna shanty toilet. She landed on the ground and there seemed to be something out of place, because she had her tongue out on one side of her mouth and she lay as though she was being strangled. I looked for my dad to fix her up. I called and Rogers came up and I gave him a bar and said, "She is like this." He motioned for me to go out of the cafeteria. I went into the hall and Ernie was talking with him. He said, "They don't care anything about it." He meant about the shop and its workers and wouldn't do anything. He gave me a handful of ground bars.
