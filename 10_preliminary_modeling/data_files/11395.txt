I was in some kind of a new modern restaurant. My girl, her parents, and I were on one side of the restaurant. When I was by myself on the other side, there I saw a girl I knew through high school but have not seen for several years. She was seated and I sat down and began talking to her. She asked me to go to a dance with her on Jan. 18. I said I couldn't as I had another engagement. I got up to leave her then said somewhat sadly that I was engaged now.
