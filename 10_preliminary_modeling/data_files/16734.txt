Prep Academy group project- I was building a mini-vehicle (farm vehicle maybe) of some sort. All of a sudden the rest of the project crashes to the floor. I look to see what's still ok, but I see everything is broken and start laughing, unable to stop myself. I woke up a few times (or at least had false awakenings) and I was confused. The room I was in didn't completely look like my bedroom- but it really could have been a real awakening. Anyway, I also remember what was almost definitely a false awakening- trying to break my bedroom window with telekinesis. All of a sudden I wake up, and I'm looking at the real window.
