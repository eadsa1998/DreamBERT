Frank and I go to a BANQUET: afterwards I invite the people (unknown) to our house. We find Reynaldo has been painting the walls in the back bedroom; later we find that he painted them mauve. A black man wearing a white sari comes in and brings us 6-8-slices of dark pumpkin pie! We look at the room that Reynaldo has painted and even the ceiling is mauve! Someone says something about "talent."
