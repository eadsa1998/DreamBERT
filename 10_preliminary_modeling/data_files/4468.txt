["Bill Clinton hits on me."] I am at some political gathering and Bill and Hillary Clinton are there. Bill is trying to hit on me. I am trying to avoid him. Hillary is jealous and watchful. Other woman are watching also. He'd come over close to talk. I'd change my position and try to move away. There is a black car. His, I think. I feel uncomfortable. I don't want his advances, they feel slimy.
