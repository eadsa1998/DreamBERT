I dreamt about paintball.  Indoors.  In the second game they started us running and then called for us to stop.  Wherever we were, that was our starting place for the game.  I had just jumped onto a wide beam over the descending hallway.  I was on the blue team; I did well.  I shot out my high school classmate Amy, among others.  I survived both games, and then went to find out if my boyfriend Jeremy had.  No, he'd gotten shot out of both.
