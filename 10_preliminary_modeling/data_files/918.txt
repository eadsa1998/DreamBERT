Ginny is helping me fix up/clean up my house. Will S comes in. We like each other. He starts to caress me and we initially agree, non-verbally, to make love. We take off our clothes and lay on the dining room table. At first, I am concerned because he's an older man and I think maybe he won't feel good, but he's strong and sensual and the experience is very enjoyable. It lasts a long time. There are interruptions. Ginny and her two sons come in and talk to me. We stop making love and I tell her to go away now. She looks hurt and wants to stay. I gently ask her to leave for awhile. Her sons are fighting. Will S tells them how to get along. Then a candle is burning near us. My mother appears and says, "Here, I'll move that, it can burn the wood, or your hair." I say firmly, "Here, give me back the candle," and firmly put it back where I want it. She looks hurt and looks around for something to straighten or fix. She leaves. Will S and I continue. I feel embarrassed because it is taking me so long. He understands and doesn't mind. It feels good. [BL]
