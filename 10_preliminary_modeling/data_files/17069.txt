My housemates and I rented a mansion. There's a big office, a big closet, two huge safes in the closet. It's similar to our house, but much larger. There's no furniture. We need furniture for the mansion, so we go to a coffee shop. It was on a second floor with metal stairs going outside. I walk in. There are people everywhere, and a bar/counter. By the stairs, there is an outdoor balcony with a table and a couple of plastic patio chairs. We already have a couple like that at home. I walk through the shop; it's tables are full with people. Around the corner from the counter is a little curtained room. It is situated much like a dressing room. Inside there is a little table and three chairs, one of them is really nice. I want it, but to take it will be really hard, because I'll have to walk through the entire cafe. The patio chairs.on the balcony will be much easier. I hesitate, and walk out of the curtained room to look at the cafe. I go back and pick up the nice chair. I carry it into the main part of the cafe and walk through the crowd of tables, with the chair slightly over my head. People glance at me, but I look like I am doing what I am supposed to, so they don't care. I walk though the back door, down the metal stairs, put the chair in the back seat of our get-away car. I jump in, and we peel away. Next thing I know, the new chair is in the almost empty mansion. My housemates and I admire it.
