I start out on a motorcycle. Lean far forward and accelerate to a rather high speed. Passing a road to the right, I am hailed by a Maryland traffic cop who waddles out toward main road. I am traveling too fast to stop immediately, and turn on to a track to right for a short distance, then make a U-turn and go back to meet the cop on main road. He is inspecting cars, and my motorcycle has changed into an auto. He examines headlights, and asks me to get into car and hold on to certain things. He also laughs and says that parts which have already been OK. by any other inspector will not be checked very closely. He asks me to turn the window crank on right side, but I forget which is right, .... left crank instead. Then he turns right crank which seems to him to be too stiff, especially as compared with the smooth and easy operation of other crank. He asks my opinion, but I urge him to point out anything that seems in unsatisfactory condition.
