Had a dream that I am a monk walking in an alleyway in a dangerous part of town in a future city (like year 2001) with robes and shaved head. There are some other monks but mostly merchant people buying and selling. It is a crowded, hot, chaotic atmosphere, looks like Bangkok. There are thugs who keep trying to rob me and I shop, they are roaming violent gangs. I feel the danger but I stay on there and stay calm. They could throw me into jail -- it is police state. Much fear. As I try to buy something from a rough, unkempt looking man.
