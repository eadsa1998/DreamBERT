Three NY A walked down a well-used trail over which second platoon had strung a trip wire and hidden rifleman with command detonated claymores. When the flare went off the mines blew. With third platoon I rushed up to watch as the men picked off the enemy soldiers. Their legs were blown off. They screamed to each other, firing their AK's wildly. I knelt and wept at the slaughter. Afterwards, we scavenged the bodies for souvenirs and did not bury the corpses. Mike W. put a live frag with a smoke grenade fuse under the bodies. We moved out. Fifteen or twenty minutes later we heard the grenade explode; other NY A had been killed by the booby trap. 1 am in a familiar house but cannot name it. My brother and I are young. He throws a heavy silver ring at me. I go to chase him but he hides and disappears. I go to a bedroom and look under the bed, but there is only a rumpled blanket. Then to the bathroom, where I see him through the frosted windows. My brother says, "I guess 1 should come out." I agree, and confront him with the ring, which I have found. "If you ever treat me with disrespect again I'll kill you," I tell him sternly. I am boiling with anger. Next, we are out in the open in a desert-like setting. My brother questions if I mean what I have said. I am on edge and angry and seek an excuse to be violent. My brother says, "You wouldn't shoot me." I tell him to be quiet, not to test me. My brother continues, so I shoot him point blank in the skull. My brother falls down dead. He appears ten or twelve years of age. I am older, perhaps eighteen or nineteen.
