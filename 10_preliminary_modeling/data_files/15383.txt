I was a spy, along with the most of the main cast of Friends. Ross didn't know about it and was an engineer and was checking something out about something he had built. While he was there, terrorists took over. A guy was in a pool and went under the water and pretended to drown but then actually drowned. Then we were at this house and a guy said the guy had died from a Japanese disease linked to some machine. This guy had been Japanese and had cut out his eyes. Then I was watching Chuck and Jeff dreamed about Sarah and it was in slow motion and focused on her chest. Then Joey (Friends) had once been really high up in the spy world, but then had become like he is in the show. A sniper saw Ross in the building. My phone was there and I wanted it back. I called him and I was now his sister and I explained some of the stuff. I told him how to escape and that the terrorists were watching him. Then I was home, which was different. Ezra came home late at night with food. Mom was confused and he said he drove and Mom was angry and he got upset and said 'I thought you'd be proud'. I said 'by breaking the law?'.
