I was trying to explain to the man, who had said that the vocabulary averages given in my studies was lower than the others', why mine were. Said I had tried to get average IQ's of 100 and how. I didn't remember the exact averages but my thesis had been published and there was z copy in the Univ. Of Hawaii's library. Then I was going to a psychological meeting in N.C. Suddenly I realized I should have started before. Already it was afternoon and a train from Iowa wouldn't get me there by evening. At first I tried to get the railroad for time, then shifted to United Airlines.
