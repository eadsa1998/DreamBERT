I was thinking about the fact that Matthew did not get to receive his First Communion with the rest of his class. Because he was at his Dad's every other weekend I quit making the effort to take him to religious education classes that year, so he couldn't make his First Communion. I got a book and I was talking to him about home preparing him, myself, so he could receive this sacrament.
