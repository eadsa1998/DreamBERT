I was at a shop. Mom gave me and Ezra these Bopo cards and he bought this stingy doodler thing. I told him not to. This song started playing and I started singing Eye in the Sky and I realized it was that song playing. This lady was selling cats, but she was about to leave. There was a black one except it was yellow, who was like Spaceman. I got that cat.
