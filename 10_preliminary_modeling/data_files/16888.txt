There are a lot of people engaged in an activity, but I'm not involved. In a large house (that might be my house) someone has done something very strange to the carpet. It looks like it has 'grown'. Bits of it have grown wild and long and other bits are bald. Upstairs there are even banks forming, and real tall grass growing on the carpet (which is also green). I look out of the window at the back of the house and it seems I live on the top floor of a large shop that sells toilets and sinks. They evidently have a yard outside which is full of products - there's also a couple of salesmen and customers amongst them. It is lit by flood lights. It's a very large yard. In another garden somewhere else (which is my garden in the dream) there is much activity. A team of people which includes old friends, family and neighbours has constructed a large climbing frame from tree trunks and logs. My mother is in charge of the team, and has salvaged the materials from somewhere. I'm not involved, so I return to the house, and the strange carpet, where I am plagued by songs I have written in the past which go over and over in my head especially the bad parts.
