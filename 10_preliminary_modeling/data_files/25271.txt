 I'm with two women. We are seeking cover because tornadoes are coming towards us. We find a large sturdy church-like building at Brimson College and go into the bottom floor. It is safer than other nearby buildings with people in. The tornadoes go through. Afterwards, we are all okay. We look around. Paramedics are there. Some people are hurt. I go into a building where my friend Stephen was supposed to be. We would be on the bottom floor. The top floor, where I am, has a floor made of a web-like net. I carefully crawl across it. I call out for Stephen. He got out, and is okay. I go down a floor, where people are waiting to get out. I'm going to break a window. A girl says, "No!", not to break the window. A broken window will cost $60. I say to her, "Isn't getting all these people out worth more than $60?" Then we see the window slides open. I open it. The girl then sees the whole window slides open, so there is a larger opening. We can get out. I see a replay of what happened. Three tornadoes moved the whole Brimson campus. The campus slid a long ways across the ground.
