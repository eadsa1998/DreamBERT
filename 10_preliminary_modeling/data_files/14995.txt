I was at the old house, trying to find something to wear, but none of my new clothes were clean. Mom and Darren complained about everything I chose to wear. It got late (it was 10.18, but I had to leave by 10.30 to get to university on time) and I still hadn't eaten breakfast or straightened my hair. I went to my new math tutorial. It was in a small computer room, but there were lots of people, including Autumn and Elijah. The teacher said that the class was bigger than last time and that there were five extra people. I said I changed because I can't do the early one. They said it was too bad and that this one was full, but asked if anyone wanted to change. Heaps of people did because they wanted to change to some boating thing. Ezra got accepted to the Technical College but was going to drop out. It was some sort of cooking course with this old rich Asian guy.
