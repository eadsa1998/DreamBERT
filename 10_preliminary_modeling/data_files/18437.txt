My family and I (father, brothers (s?), mother) are high ranking military officers in our country (not my real mother, father). The country has been invaded by the enemy, although I can't recall any bloodshed, or even shooting. We have always been good personal friends of the enemy commander, tho. In the first episode I clearly remember, my brother, I, and the enemy general are standing on top of a hill of ash and rubble, watching the enemy troops in the town below. Technically we are prisoners. My brother volunteers to go get some personal possession of the enemy general's, which he has left in his black convertible, parked a little ways below us on the hillside. Instead, he leaps into the car and dashes off down the hill. The guards fire at him with tommy-guns, but miss. He drives wildly into the enemy traffic below and escapes. Later I have persuaded the enemy general that I'm apologetic about my brother's actions, and want to go find him and bring him back. All thru this dream I use our friendship to trick the enemy so we may re-win the country, but I have no hard feelings against them -- I really do feel friendly toward them, as does my family. Anyway, the enemy general agrees, and I want some sort of pass so the enemy soldiers won't pick me up if I start wandering around. He offers to give me a child's pocketbook, which has bright mosaic patterns on the side, but I argue that's silly, and want a written pass of free conduct. I eventually make something like that myself. Next scene is at my family's house, where one of the enemy generals is staying over for lunch or the like. Yet we are carrying out some underground activities right under his nose.... That's all I recall.
