We were on this boat thing. It was kind of like a boat and a bus all in one. I think it was one of those duck things. And it was supposed to take us all the way up to the top of the state and then back down, for whatever reason, and it would go on water sometimes and it would go on land sometimes. And we would sit there like we're sitting on a bus, and then we'd get up and walk around and see all this stuff around. And Melinda was there and I was led back in this kitchen area with her and Mrs. Horne was there and she slipped down and she says, "Hide behind me. I'll get in a lot of trouble." And so I kind of like hide behind her because she's so big, I can hide behind her. And they sit down and start eating this breakfast, like eggs and stuff. And she gets up and I kind of get up and I stand and I look at these people sitting on the couch, and then I like go in the bathroom behind someone. And then I woke up.
