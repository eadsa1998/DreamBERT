I dreamed that I was in a room that was filled with bolts of expensive material and hundreds of sewing machines. I chose a rich golden colored satin and proceeded to cut out a dress without the aid of a pattern. I sewed the garment without basting it together. In a few minutes, the dress was complete. The next part of the dream took place at a dance. I appeared in this dress and won the acclaim of everyone. The women envied me because I sewed to beautifully and could finish a dress so quickly. I was happy because I was such a great success.
