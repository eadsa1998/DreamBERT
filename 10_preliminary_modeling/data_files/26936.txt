 I'm north of Brimson on Fish Street or Brighton Avenue, with two kids. We're throwing snowballs at two kids across the road. There's not much snow on the ground, which is soggy with a few ice chunks. I'm surprised at the accuracy with which the boys on my side throw. The boys that are throwing at us are throwing weakly: we bat their snowballs with our hands. I'm walking south towards Brimson with three people, including a man named Alf from my physiology class. The people I'm with find clear plastic bags with stacks of cookies in them. Alf finds a bag, the other two people find a bag. There are different kinds of cookies in the bags. These people may need the cookies for a project at Brimson. I eat one of two of the cookies, and feel guilty because the students need them. We get near Old Avenue. I'm with two people. One of them, a man, says we should hurry to the humanities building to copy the videotape. There is another ground of people. The man in my group says we should hurry, to beat this other group, to do something. I walk near Social Science Hall and Old Main on the way to the humanities building. I see my classmate Julie Adams and friend Sara Miller. I forget Sara's last name. I see a man on a bicycle. He says to me, "I know what you did." I feel guilty about doing _____(something). I just feel guilty. Something was going to happen with the cookies. The plan is to hurry and copy the videotape.
