It was nighttime, and cold; I could see my breath. I was an outcast because the friends I had chosen were not socially acceptable. I was condemned to walk along on the grass and concrete for an unknown time. All of a sudden I meet Angela along the way. For some unknown reason I asked her what her name was. We talked and walked for a good twenty minutes and had a great conversation going. I felt great.
