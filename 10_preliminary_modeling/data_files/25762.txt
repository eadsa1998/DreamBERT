 I'm going to a concert with two others to perform. We are practicing the song "Hotel California" on drums. We are going to improvise in the concert. It seems we're on the Thru Highway in Wilmerton near Armstrong High School heading towards my ex-girlfriend Annie's house. This is a big concert with many performers. I walk down some very steep stairs to get there. Parents and friends of other performers are walking there too. There is soda spilled on some steps, and I warn people to watch out for this. In the room where people prepare their act are my friends Melanie McDyss, Kevin Simpson, Carmen Allure, and others. My classmate Tom Dement is there, later. Kevin does a skit that ends with a big piece of artificial feces. I laugh out loud from my place on the side of the stage. It is like the Talent Show at Armstrong High School.
