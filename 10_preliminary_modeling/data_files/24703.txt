All my friends from school were in a Baskin Robbins ice cream store to celebrate my friend Sandy's birthday. I was trying to choose a flavor, but they didn't have anything I wanted, so I didn't get an ice cream. Then we went to a pizza place, but they didn't want us in there because we were making too much noise. In the car, Sandy was crying and I asked her why, and she said, "I really wanted pizza." Setting: Baskin Robbins, Round Table, and Sandy's car. Characters: My friend Sandy, my friend Jerry, my friend Lynne, and Sandy's mom and dad and sister. I know all of them. Sandy never cries. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad, worried. I was worried that Sandy was crying, sad that she was feeling upset, but happy that she finally cried because she never does.
