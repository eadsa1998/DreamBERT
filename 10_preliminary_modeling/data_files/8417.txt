I was living in the condo, except that it looked different than in waking life. There is something about a haircut and having two different people to choose from. I see a computer drop down list with each name mentioned. Both of these are people that I've had cut my hair before in a dream - I don't know them in waking life. I had narrowed it down to these two people that I allowed to cut my hair, depending on which one was available.
