I had a friend who was an ant. I can't remember his name. There was someone else who had an ant as well. We communicated telepathically or something. We were doing something with them. I had him on my finger and was putting him around to do whatever he was doing. They may have been competing. I tried looking for him at one point and couldn't find him, then I found him and he'd snapped one of his legs. Then he went missing again and I was worried he'd fallen down this big hole. I was really sad. Then he appeared again but he was light brown and bigger and didn't look like an ant. I asked him if he evolved.
