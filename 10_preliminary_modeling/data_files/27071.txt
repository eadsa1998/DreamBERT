This dream was a short one, but one which made me very upset. In this dream I was wheeling my father in a wheel chair. We were in a hospital and I was showing him about. I kept saying that you must get well real quick so that I could come home and take care of him. I started to cry when I was looking at him. I remember how pleased I was when I was showing him about and introducing him. Yet at the same time I had the feeling of sorrow. I woke up feeling terribly depressed and I kept seeing him most of the day.
