I could watch dreams, so I was watching them and most of mine were all spoken in 'gobbledegook'. We used the red, white and yellow cords to watch them. The dream I watched was set in the Gold Coast and there was a bomb in the room where I worked, but it was fake. Some girl drove to her home and then I wanted to go home, but she was evil.
