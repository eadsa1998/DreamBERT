I went into the bathroom.  There were regular toilet stalls, but there were also several stalls for washing hair.  Men were in there too.  I went to wash my hair.  There were three women.  Two, in particular, were adamantly opposed to my washing my hair.  They were very upset.  I tried to be kind but with no luck.  I actually had a few good responses to their mean words.  Finally they got to me, and I wanted to bug them psychically, to get them to leave me alone.
