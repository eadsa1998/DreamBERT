Nathan (Queer as Folk (UK)) was walking home from school and I was walking with him. Mom picked us up and took us to Alexander's (also QAF). We all got in a car and drove to a salvage place, where Ezra brown-eyed some people. A nuclear power plant thing exploded. We had to get away from the air/smoke. I ended up at Kingsway shops (except it wasn't). There was a McDonald's inside. This Native girl and her friend were putting their face on this machine and stuff happened -- they turned French, blind etc. I was getting people and Widget into McDonald's. We shut these glass gate things just in time. Stuart (QAF) was there. There were about 8 or 10 people. I saw a tunnel and said that some people had to go through in suits and close the big shop glass doors and suck the air out. Some guy asked why I was the boss. Three people, including Stuart, said they would do it. We went through the tunnel and a big auditorium thing was there. We kept going and they went out and shut it. Then we were all inside the big shop again. The air started to clear up, so we went outside and saw some animals, and we let them in, but the air started coming back, so we shut the doors, but Stuart and someone were still outside. I ran through the tunnel and saw Stuart feeding this cat. I started banging on the window, and he looked up at me and he finished and ran to the door. I was going back and he caught me in the auditorium. We walked back. Later I saw an orange cat, the air was clearing and so we let the cat in. The air started coming back. Stuart was yelling at me to get back inside. I got back and had to lock the door. Stuart wasn't in sight. I found the keys and locked it. I went to find Stuart. He was in a bedroom.
