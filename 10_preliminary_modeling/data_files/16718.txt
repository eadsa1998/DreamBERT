I dreamed I was going to sleep within a dream, with the purpose of recording my lucid dream when I woke up. I had this device that let me easily have lucid dreams, I think. Then, (now dream within dream) I remember thinking I was lucid, and I was somewhat lucid. I saw some words posted somewhere- I tried to memorize them so I'd remember then when I woke up. I don't remember what the words were, except the letter "E" was probably the first letter in two of the words, and there were 4 words I memorized. Then I remember being in or near a nurse's office, and then going through this room with a 4 foot ceiling and dust floors, where a lot of army men were eating and hanging out. I was just glad I wasn't in the army, and as I left the room I tried very hard not to get dusty. I had a strange feeling that I was at camp or something, and I wasn't going to be able to wash for a while. Anyway, I forget what happened after I woke from this semi-lucid dream-dream, except that I tried to record the words but couldn't remember them.
