The boys were talking about a horse Spokane. Andy B. came over to where we came and asked if anyone knew if he won. Frank said he heard someone say he won and it paid 5 to 1. Ann and I were out celebrating and she was alone with the men and I was with the kids. I looked in the entries and I saw Spokane entered. He was mentioned once before. I aw some name with to wine.
