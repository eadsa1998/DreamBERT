I am driving down the coast highway in my wheelchair and suddenly have trouble going because the joy stick has snapped off. I try to put it back on but it keeps falling off. I go to a store and see a man in there and ask him if he can fix it. I am in N City. Later I see my father and he says he's going into town. I say, "Well, if it's not too far for you, why not walk the five miles with me? Good exercise for you." He agrees and I feel good we will have this time together. Then someone drives up and says to my father, "Hop in, we'll give you a ride," and he does, completely forgetting me. I feel hurt and abandoned. I then suggest to them (my mother and brothers and my father) that if we all went in my van, I could join them. They agree, feeling a little bad they didn't think of it before. Then my mother shows me a present she got me. I unzip the package and see two cute jackets for a child, size 4. They are vest-like jackets in a pretty green plaid. There are words knitted into the waist band, something about enjoying the outdoors and river rafting. Someone says that they'll exchange the clothes for some my adult size since I've decided to like the emerald green color (like I've matured somehow and accepted the goodness of that color and allowed myself to wear this color).
