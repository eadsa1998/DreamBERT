["Social commentary with fun."] I am in some building with a group of people. A class or maybe a dormitory area. I am working on a writing project for class. Perhaps I am editing. I show someone how to do it. Then there is a playful sort of skit going on. I watch as a woman plays a seductive flirty woman with this good looking man. I then take over this role. As I am doing it, I make the usual give and take of favors too broad and the director, a man, comes into the area to tell me the woman isn't a prostitute, after all. So I laugh and don't actually solicit money, just car and house and stuff a wife would get. It's a comment on the monetary relationship of sexual relationships.
