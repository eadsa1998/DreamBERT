I went into a grocery store which was on a corner and which had two doors, one on each street. The store was filled with food on the shelves with only one L-shaped counter of brown wood and transparent glass to see the stuff through them. At one side of the counter there was a door which led to the back of the store. I asked for cigarettes and a fat woman waited on me. When I insisted that they gave me a pack of cigarettes, a drunkard came in and asked for cigarettes and the woman told him they didn't sell cigarettes and she went to the back of the store. As she went in, I saw a tall, serious man inside. The door was closed and the drunkard left and then the lady came out and sold some cigarettes to me and I left.
