 I'm near a mall, which is made partially of glass. It is like a pentagon, octagon, or heptagon in shape. There are stacks of board games at different points in the mall. My friends Nat Miller and Hilary Nano are there. We have to choose an area to work. The stacks of games divide work areas. Then we are part of an acting group. I know my role, and have done it before, but I wait for the group.
