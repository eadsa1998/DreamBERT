A man walks into a room. He is angry and so he gets to throw dishes at the wall. He has to bring his own dishes. He has a box of them, pink and blue. Now I'm in there with my dishes. They are wedding china with our invitation written in silver. I start smashing them. They are round with handles like a pizza pattern. Howard sits at a near by couch trying to get closer to me. I tell him to stop annoying me, I'm busy.
