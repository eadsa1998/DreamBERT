There is a stage with a swimming pool of water in front of it. Pairs of people are being dunked in the pool. One is a real person, one is a mannequin dummy. Each wears identical outfits. Then they go stand up on a stage while the clothes dry on them and we try to decide which outfit dries better-looking. I can't see much difference. Someone else says the dummies outfit looks better. One pair has on yellow dresses with a white lace collar. Another has on a white sweater blouse and a short black skirt, sort of 1960's. I see a side view and the breasts of the yellow dress women are slightly exposed by the now low cut style of the dresses. And now it's time to go home and my relatives start crowding in the car. I see Abner, and Uncle Dale and I are standing up in the front seat between the passenger and driver's seat, facing the back seat. I am behind Dale and almost hugging him, we are so crowded. My father is driving and off we go. A woman like Glenda B is there too. We drive around the house on the yard. Now the car is a basset hound and I'm standing on the loose skin around his sides. He yelps once because it hurts. We rush into the house right behind my father who says she'd (Glenda) get dinner and a book and stay the whole evening reading the whole book. I turn down the hall in time to surprise my father as he's walking out of a bathroom zipping up his pants. He looks surprised. I turn quickly and say, "It's OK. I didn't see anything anyway." His eye looked like the eye of a hawk before it turned into a woman in "Lady Hawke" movie. I see a potty seat extender on the floor by the bathroom door. It is a deep yellow color.
