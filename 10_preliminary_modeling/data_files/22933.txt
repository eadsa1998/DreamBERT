I was going to play football with a bunch of guys.  We were passing the football around, but it was in some small back yard, and there were always fences, gates, trees, etc. in the way.  Besides, every time I tried to throw a pass, I couldn't get a good grip on the ball.  The biggest problems were getting my hand on the right place on the ball and keeping my fingers from crossing when I tried to grip it.  It is very hard to throw a football any distance with two of your fingers crossed.  Every time someone would run out, by the time I could grip the ball properly (if ever), they were well out of my range.  It was very frustrating.  I have had this sort of dream before.  Once, though, when a black guy ran out, I did manage to throw a good one -- over his head, even -- in fact I thought it was too long, especially since he was coming to a terrace.  Just as he went over the edge of the terrace, though, he slowed down, casually stuck one arm out in front of him, and hauled the pass in with one hand, without even looking.  There were quite a few black guys, and about 10-12 of us altogether.  Someone said they knew a better place to play, so we started off through several back yards to get there.  We also had to go through Uncle Jack's house.  I remember talking first to Patty and then to Aunt Thelma.  I guess it was the house where they used to live in my hometown.  Aunt Thelma said we couldn't play in their yard right then for some reason, but that we could come back and play at night.  I thought, "Big deal.  How far can you see a football at night, with no lights?"
