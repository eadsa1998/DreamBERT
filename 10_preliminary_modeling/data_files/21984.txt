I was going to the track with John Yakera. We met Andy P. He also was going. I had a pass and a ticket. John went in and I put my ticket on the fence and then when they were in, I took the ticket and pass and went in. The girl was looking the other way, then she called to me and I said I put my ticket in when she wasn't looking. So I showed her the pass. I said, "We should get paid for going in instead of paying for entrance fee."
