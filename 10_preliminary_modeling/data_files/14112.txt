I went to a newsagency. Dad was waiting outside in the car. It was night. I had $10. I got the Dolly Diary and some other stuff. The guy behind the counter reminded me of Rosso (Freaks and Geeks). It came to $11.10 so I said I had to get some more money. I asked Dad and he threw it on the ground and there was lots of money on the ground so I was grabbing some.
