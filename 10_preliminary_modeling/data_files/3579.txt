I am hearing a radio report about a new kind of ski lift that uses pressurized air to shoot the person straight up to the high place, and then it's a roller coaster kind of ride down. You lean backward on the air and ride down, fast and exciting. I'm up there, having done the first half of the ride. I look down and see Dovre, my daughter, laying on her tummy asleep, on a bench. I see one big crow or raven and four of five little ones sitting on her back. As she stirs, they fly up a bit and settle down on her again. I see the big one go sit on a boy's head. I know this is magic stuff, and realize the boy has been chosen by the raven, the wise one. I call to Dovre and tell her what I see, asking if she can see it too. I say, "There's a prairie chicken in the kitchen too." I see a top-knotted African kind of bird. They all look so real. I wonder if they can be seen by others and feel a slight fear that if they are real, they could just scratch or hurt the boy and Dovre. But I do know they are "dreams" or "other world." The spirits.
