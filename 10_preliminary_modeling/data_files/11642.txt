Myself, and four or five companions of the same age, all male, got out of our car at some place that was like Mentor Park. It was winter and the place was abandoned. Ice was all over the ground. We walked across an open area and as we passed through some passageway we found ourselves threading our way down a sunny mountain trail looking for gold. We noticed other groups coming after us. We finally came out into a great field with a jungle in the distance. We noticed small animals resembling pigs running around. As we got into the jungle proper which was very light and sunny we saw all sort of wildlife. Lions, giraffes, pythons, standing out most in my mind. For safety we decided to climb trees. I first climbed a small tree but found it was not safe enough so I came down and began to climb a large tent pole which I had not noticed before. As I did so I had a nocturnal emission and awoke.
