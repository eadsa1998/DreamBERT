I am given an old grocery/vanity store. I enter it to inspect what I have. I see lots of aisles and stuff, a bit old and dusty. I see a glassed-off showcase room on a side wall. I can't find the door, then I find it and have to move a desk aside to get in. There's lots of stuff. And then I see a high shelf or attic area and look up there. I see beautiful silver things - bowls, jewelry, treasures worth something. I think, "I'll not mention it to anyone just yet." I go back out to the main grocery area. Then I go upstairs and see on a table plastic bubble packets of the Native American religion. I pick up and open it, noticing the two round places where the Peyote buttons (two of them) were supposed to be and weren't. It had been opened already. I read the booklet and saw two headings, "The Lazy Man" and "The Ultimate Man." They were descriptions of archetypes like "The Wild Man." Then someone puts the packet on a cart and I am concerned because I felt a strong connection and didn't want it taken from me. I look at my hand and am amazed to see my fingers are straightening out! I push and stretch my hand muscles and can feel them stretching and straightening until my fingers are now beautifully straight. I am in awe and know its because of my connection with that packet. I say to someone, "Did you see? Look at my hand." The person says, "Do you want people to notice?" I agree that maybe I don't. People will read about the freak in the National Enquirer. I start to go downstairs. A Native American medicine man with glowing amber sunglasses like Mitch's says to me, "You must learn from the packet and then come back and teach me." I find that amazing because I perceive him as knowing and powerful. [Earlier in the grocery area I was saying we should get signs up and drum up business. A woman said, "What's the hurry? Why don't you do inventory first and see what you have."]
