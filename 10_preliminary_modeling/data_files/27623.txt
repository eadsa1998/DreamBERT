My parents and I were at home. We saw we were going to have visitors--the Captain and his wife. But we didn't want to see them, so we tried to think of excuses to ward them off. I went outdoors, looked across the street and saw a field with a high fence around it. I think it was a baseball diamond. So I went over there and found a way in and wandered around awhile. Then I saw there was a large manufacturing plant there.
