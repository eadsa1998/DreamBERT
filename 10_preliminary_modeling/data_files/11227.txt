I was walking along the street when I spotted something green attached to a hubcap of a car parked along the street. I went up to the car and looked and saw that it was money, (a roll of bills). I took the money and put it in my pocket. Looking around the curb, I saw other bills lying around. I quickly picked up the money, picking up about ten here and there. Then I started to run. I then woke up.
