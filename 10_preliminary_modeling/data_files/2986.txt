I am driving a motorcycle "car" with two seats. It's sort of a race. I must stop for gas very often, like every ten feet or so, and I keep forgetting to turn the engine back on. Then I spin my wheels, wasting the gas. A dark-haired young woman in an emerald green outfit is racing me. She is behind me and never smiles. She'd ask me when I stop for gas and then I'd pass her on the road. The road is curvy like a curved staircase. A young man (maybe Dwight) is in the passenger seat. I think I wear the old-fashioned motorcycle hat with flaps over the ears, made of leather. [BL]
