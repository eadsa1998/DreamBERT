Big Brother 2005 hadn't finished yet. I won a competition to go to the final show and participate in the Friday Night Live games. Another girl, called Lucy, was also chosen. The plane was leaving at 8 our time (but it was actually their time). Lucy was the first to go, then Greg Mathew. It ended and we got photos of Greg and Tim Brunero and got autographs.
