I and some girl about my age, whom I can't identify any further, were at the dream conference being held in New York. And after the conference she and I took a train back to my home in my hometown and stayed over the night there, but I don't think there were any romantic goings-on between us. The next morning she got up and got dressed, ready to go back to the conference, but I slept late because today was a special invited address section or something like that, and I wasn't going to give one, so I thought I would stay home. But then about quarter to 8 in the morning it suddenly occurred to me, why couldn't I go and listen to the papers, which was why I was there anyway, no matter whether I was giving one that day or not. So I hurried, tried to get dressed in time because we had to leave the house by quarter after 8or something like that to make the train on time. And I got dressed in one pair of pants and found I didn't have a suit coat to match. I took those off and put on a pair of pants from my suit and found I couldn't find that suit coat. I went through a couple more things like this, and eventually I got dressed and we both -- well, it was too late for the train, so I decided to drive us both to New York. So I drove to the hotel, let the girl out, and gave my car to the doorman. And I took a card from him to take up to the desk as if I was going to be a guest, but I wasn't entirely sure that I was entitled to have the hotel park my car. So I went up to the desk and asked about it and they said no, I wasn't; I had better go around and pick it up. So I went around and picked the car up and so I had to go around and find a parking place. It was as if the hotel was now in my hometown. I was trying to remember where I could likely find a parking place. I couldn't remember. Finally, just by chance, I went up one street, and the scene became kind of rural. I eventually found a place to park in back of a little barn. I think I started walking back toward the hotel.
