I'd gone to jail. It was unfair. They wanted to keep me in. They didn't tell me anything. It was as if my old house during my young teens had become a cell. Justin, a friend from college, had been talking about his jail experience a few days before. The woman was your typical dumb black city cop, just "following procedure" and not thinking for herself for even a minute. He attitude was "I'm authority, and you needed to respect it for its own sake." I was planning my escape, right over the top of her if I had to. I felt the whole system was beneath me and stupid and they had no right to hold me. I began to walk out, and climbed a fence. It felt like one flew over the cuckoo's nest.
