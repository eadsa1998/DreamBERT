 I'm riding on a metro bus with others. I don't know where to get off the bus. It's late and night and the driving conditions are extremely poor: it's very foggy outside. The woman driving the bus is wearing an akubra-like hat. She speaks on the radio as she drives, communicating with the bus station base to let them know we're in dangerous conditions, and that they should check in on us if they don't hear from us in a while. We ride over the Dirty River bridge to the Riverside School area. We're returning then, after having gone somewhere. We don't know whether to get off the bus at my dad and Lisa's house. We drive by and see they are there, so we get off the bus. I have a case of returnable beer bottles. We walk up to the house. It seems to be an open area. I say hi to my stepbrother Gary Lawson and his girlfriend after he acknowledges me. When he sees me we greet each other superficially. He doesn't say much. His girlfriend say they're drunk: they were at a party, to which they are now going back with my brother Wally and his friend Mryle Madden. My stepbrother Nan Lawson is there, as is my dad. I open my case of beer, which feels remarkably light, and see it's half empty. The bottles that are in it are old. There are some dented cans with $5 price tags on them and some tiny one-inch tall bottles: A real crappy stock of beer. Everyone is wearing or changing into bathing suits. Mryle is wearing a light blue Speedo. The others have two or three cases of returnable bottles as well.
