It happened like this. Laura and I were walking through an old, deserted street -- at least, I thought it was a street. There were rows of concrete stairs going up to wooden doors with white paint flaking off of them, as though they hadn't been repainted for years. I look around on the ground and see that it is completely covered with rotting vegetation -- old dead leaves, mushrooms, dirt, etc... forest debris, in other words. This old street had been deserted and nature was taking over. <br/
