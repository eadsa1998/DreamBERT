I was walking down an abandoned street towards an old wooden home which must have been considered more or less of a mansion in former years. As I drew near I felt the urge to cross the street and avoid passing it. However I felt impelled to go past it for curiosity's sake. I did so. Suddenly a loose 2x4 near the 3rd story of the old edifice was blown loose by the wind. It came down and conked me on the head. I lay on the ground paralyzed, i.e., able to see, feel and hear but unable to move. People gathered around and finally an ambulance came and took me away.
