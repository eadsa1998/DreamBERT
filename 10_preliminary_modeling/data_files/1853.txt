I meet with two judges of my poetry contest, Erik and some other guy (Lewis?). I tell them, "I have one hour and then my rehearsal group comes by, so let's get to work and choose the winner." They agree and then Erik starts making funny faces and acting goofy. He hides and plays in my writing office. Lewis and I keep trying to talk him into seriousing up. Then my rehearsal group arrives. Some woman like Mabel really wants my attention. I try to pay attention to both groups. I see a list of author's names and see Dammitt and Akin. I then check the newsletter to see if they are the same as the winners. They are. Lucy comes in and wants to tell me all about the fact that when she falls asleep she acts like a little girl and either masturbates or gets sexually excited and now she's afraid to go to sleep. She rolls across the floor, looking like a little girl with Merle's condition. I half listen to her.
