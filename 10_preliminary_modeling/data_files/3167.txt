I am seated on a couch with Rochelle. We are on a pile of freshly done laundry, clothes, towels, etc. Rochelle is figuring up something on her calculator. It gets overheated and she tosses it across the room on the floor. She throws herself behind the couch and I sit there and wait. The battery pops out of the calculator and then overheats and burns and smokes. The air is thick with bad smells. I get up and walk outside. It's time to leave now and I get in my red pickup truck and drive over to say goodbye to Dwight (Rock Hudson?). I walk into the house and find him. We then walk out the back side door. I see many cars and hub caps lined up neatly. He says, "The used car man next door puts them there during the day." As we walk to the pickup, I remember I didn't take my card he gave me as a farewell. I ask him to go back and get it for me. He does so. I get into the driver's seat of the pickup and see that he has put a store of sugar free snacks in there for me to enjoy on my trip. I am touched. Dwight gets in with the card. I thank him for his thoughtful gift. He smiles. Jake is now in the back seat. He has put a special hand hold on the steering wheel for me to use. I thank him and try to use it. It is uncomfortable. I say, "I'm sorry but I need it back the way it was." He apologizes. I say, "Oh no, I thank you for the thought, but it just isn't working out." He fixes it. Pink liquid and oil and so on pours into the column of the steering wheel and then he fixes it back the way it was. I suddenly remember I had forgotten my wheelchair, crutches, pills and raised toilet seat back at Rochelle's. I was feeling so good, I just forgot them. I send someone back to get them for me. She returns with it. Several aunts are there with babies to wave me goodbye.
