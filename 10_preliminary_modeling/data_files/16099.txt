Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, and that Ryan was over, and we were all sitting in the living room with Dad and talking about something; I don't remember exactly what. I seem to recall having a similar dream before. And Dad was sleeping and Samantha and Sandra and Derek and I were all out at the park, and I was carrying the silvery portable boom box down, and I was going to put it somewhere. And I was sitting on the couch with it, and I was playing a tape of sound effects that I recorded. And then I remembered that Dad was sleeping and I figured I'd better take it back upstairs. And then I said to Mom, "I'm getting my exercise hauling this thing up and down the stairs." And then all of a sudden I was under the water with a plastic bag [laugh] and supposedly I could hear Sebastian and Ursula's eels, and then I woke up.
