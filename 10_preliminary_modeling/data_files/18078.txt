I had a dog and it was a Lhasa Apso, and then my family and I talked it out, and they said I could have a dog, so we went to the pet shop and I said, "I want another Lhasa Apso." My mom agreed and we found a Lhasa Apso. We took it home and it started to growl for some reason, but we went on vacation and went to [big city].. I opened presents there; one was a Noah's Ark and then another one was building blocks. Then on the way home from [big city] in the car-- but it wasn't a car, it was a big, big van--I lost the Lhasa Apso that I bought in the pet shop, but I found it and it was under a blanket.
