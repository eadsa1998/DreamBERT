I was at home in Cleveland only the house was in an isolated section with nothing but trees and shrubbery all around. The only person besides myself that was clear was Franklin D. Roosevelt. It seemed there was a gang of men who were to kill the president. The house was continually under fire and once or twice I was hit by bullets. The most amazing thing was the calmness which Roosevelt kept throughout. We were unprotected for several days in this house and still Roosevelt kept smiling and was serene through it all.
