I was working in Rivertown on the brick road we had the automatics. I was cleaning out the brass chips out of one so I could run it. I filled a small wooden box and the oil ran over, then I sat it on the machine so the oil would run back into the machine. Ed Mucines was working with us. I looked around for empty boxes and I found them one by one. I was picking up a nice young girl, then I would kiss her. I was reading and I saw Robert Pream or Prem, I thought of prom. I held this girl up, her head was above mine. I held her tight and gave her a kiss and hug once in a while.
