I was watching Fringe. Olivia was on a train. Sometimes it was me. This lady said something to her. Olivia showed a girl pictures of these 'aliens'. The aliens were two children with big blue eyes. They had been caught holding hands. I was helping Autumn study for the chemistry exam. We were in a toilet at a university. I was trying to get her to write formulas on her hand. She went into a cubicle and started pooping. I heard her sniffle and I coaxed her out and said we had to leave. Dan (One Tree Hill) was working at the university, but then he was Dad and we passed him as we left. We ran to class. It was 10.24, or at least 24 past something and the exam was at half past. We got to class on time and this popular girl got in trouble and the teacher said something about blowjobs. Later I was playing Guitar Hero or something and there were lots of notes for the song. I had to hold down 3 buttons at a time. There were different versions, such as one where you play as jumpers and all the notes move around. I was then watching Queer as Folk and they were talking about some girl and Tom Cruise and which they preferred. Brian said he preferred the girl and Emmett said he preferred Tom Cruise.
