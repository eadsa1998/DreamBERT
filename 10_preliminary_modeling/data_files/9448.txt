Fighting with dragons and pythons. Meet Frank near a lamp post. He looks lonesome and we go to live in Gill Court (where previously I lived with Edward). Frank works in the garden and knows just what needs to be done. Also helpful in the kitchen, stacking dishes. I am happy to be living with him. Shift: everyone is calling about my Ph.D. thesis. I can't hear well what is being said over the phone. I am constantly getting lost. Shift: Image of Frank standing at the head of the stairs with light in the background. He is surrounded by son and three daughters. Shift: See the new Schlegel house by the sea. See them standing with light hitting them from background.
