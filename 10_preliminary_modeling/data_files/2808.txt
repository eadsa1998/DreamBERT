I am underwater in a pool and looking up. I see snakes swimming on the surface and feel fear. I prod one with a stick to get it away from me but it backfires and the snake now knows I'm there and sinks down toward me. It is huge like a boa constrictor. I hope it will go away and leave me alone. It does. Then I see dinosaurs, lots of them. Then two men are trying to crawl up to the place where I'm sitting and I take a bat and hit at them to make them go away. They persist, and I hit harder and harder. I scream for Jock to come and help me. "Help me," I call as I beat these men up. Jock runs to me and looks at the fallen men. "Oh my God," he says. "You've killed them, or nearly so. These were real people not just 'holograms' or images." I feel very bad. He says, "I'm so sorry. This is my fault for leaving you alone. I should have been here." I am depressed and without reason to live. I go away and want to kill myself. I think I'd take some alka seltzer and die. Jock realizes what I'm trying to do and is trying to stop me. Della comes in to organize my writing business while I'm "indisposed." I get very angry at her. I yell, "If you won't do it my way, then don't do it at all." She was trying to organize my stuff in her style. I realize there are some things I can learn from her, but I say, "If I decide to live, then I will want my writing to be my way. After all, it is the only reason I have to live, except for you, of course," I say to a small girl like Charla, "and that's almost not enough." Jock comes in to support me through all this so I will stay alive. There is a woman with multiple personalities. She is in her "little girl" personality, named Ulysses or something like that. She says she wants to live, being pregnant. She has beautiful, strange eyes. Odd that the love of life was finally found in the little girl part.
