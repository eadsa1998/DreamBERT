I was operating laundry machinery. I was pressing the buttons on the switch boxes. A patient from a former ward, named Farell, came up to me. I had not seen him for a long time. He asked me if I am still so sensitive. (I have worked in the laundry for two months here at the hospital. A laundry was in my May 25th dream in which I was confused. I knew this patient for a year, until two months ago. We often discussed emotional problems, and we attended group therapy weekly.)
