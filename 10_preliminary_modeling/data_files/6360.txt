I am laying in bed and I feel little pricks at my legs. I stand up and start walking. Someone says, "You have blood on  your legs." I take my hand and wipe the back of my legs, and my hand is covered in blood and there is this huge spider on my hand. I go to the mirror and all I can see are spider bites and blood covering the back of my legs.
