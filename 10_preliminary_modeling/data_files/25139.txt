 I'm in a classroom, which may be an old psychology building at Brimson. I think I'm in my professor Jerry Rice's class. He tells us about a few things. The first is that after a person starts recording their dreams, in about a month they usually being "dreaming true". I recognize the term immediately. He describes it as a different kind of dreaming, distinct from normal dreaming. I can't remember his exact words. The second thing he talks about is something called a "wolite". A wolite is when you get a song stuck in your head and hear it over and over. A man says that his dream journal and life journal/diary are in the same notebook. This is the same as me!
