I was sitting in the driver's seat of our old minivan in a parking lot waiting to drive across the street to the post office, to mail my parents cell phone back to them. Right then, the cell phone rang. I debated answering it, because I never use it (I had merely borrowed it for a cross-country road trip). I picked it up, and it was my mom complaining and reminding me to return the cell phone. I told her I was going to do that right now and by her calling, it was only going to take longer.
