I am at a party and my oldest (adult) daughter is there. We are watching movies all night and I forget to go home. It is 6 a.m. and I can't use the phone. A man there finally figures out the phone for me and I get through. Someone answers. I think it is a woman. It isn't my mother, but someone who is speaking for my parents and she tells me not to come home. I have almost graduated (apparently from high school) but I have to get out of the house and start looking for an appointment. I am going to call a man for help. My daughter isn't upset about our situation. I am not sorry about getting kicked out of my parents house but I am sorry about hurting them. As I try to get through on the phone I can't dial but I can hear them in the background and I can tell they are very upset.
