I was waiting for my sister to arrive at my apartment. She was late. She came and we were going to the vet with my cats -- they were having some operation. We were waiting outside for a cab for hours. Then when we got one, it seemed like it took hours to get there (when it should take a few minutes). We arrived -- it was late at night but the vet was nice enough to still honor the appointment. I was told to go across the street to the kitty guest house where they'd spend the night recovering.
