I am at work, but it's the old "grade school room." I comb my hair (red and short). Then, I turn to leave the restroom. "Brenda," Valerie's baby, tries to crawl in. I stop her and pause to chat in the hall with her. She looks adult but sits and talks like a baby. She tells me her grandma is watching her today. I go to play bridge with Jock, Valerie, and others. I get a good hand. "4 clubs," I bid. Valerie responds, "6 hearts." I'm in convention for a grand slam. I recount my cards. They've changed. I find a weak suit in hearts. I decide to stay at 6 hearts, a conservative move. There are too many high cards out.
