I was driving somewhere. I don't remember where. I was driving around. I drove into a mall parking lot. I was blocked by a truck that was unloading for The Shoe Store. It had the parking lot and driving area all blocked with a huge thing that was attached to the store and to the truck. I don't know how to explain what it was. Some kind of a conveyor belt for them to unload the shoes from the truck into the store. I was debated how to get where I was going then. All of a sudden, they must have been done, because this huge thing started deflating. It started to collapse. It started to go in, like starting at one end and moving towards the store as it deflated. There was nothing under it as it deflated. It just deflated little by little until it was gone or was done deflating. All that was left was like these robot things that were running towards the store. It seems that maybe the robots had been controlling it or were doing something for the store but I don't know what it was. There is something, not sure they are robots, but something with headphones. There was something about Gale W. She died. It was as if I was there to work. I grabbed some headsets. I was playing around with it. Moving it around to adjust it to fit me.
