I was at a place that I can best describe as a castle, and home of royalty, with a large group of people. The only one I can identify is Susan J. Several of us, I'm not sure if it was the entire group or not, were in a very large open room. I don't think there is any furniture in the room or anything like that. Along one of the side walls, a long wall, there is a drapery hanging from the ceiling about six feet into the room, not directly along the wall. It is there as a room partition of sorts and runs the entire length of the wall. We are all on the floor with a few feet between each of us, facing the curtain. We are on knees putting shoes into a compartment under the floor. We have been told that we can keep as many pair of shoes as we are able to fit into our compartment. This will be good for me because I am very good at maximizing space usage by the way I fit items into it. I quickly figure out the best way to place the shoes in the compartment so I can keep as many as possible. The floor is carpeted and there is no visible opening to the compartment. We had to feel for a soft spot in the carpet to identify where the opening was. Then we just had to push the shoes against the soft spot in the carpet until they went through into the compartment. We were able to reach our hand through as well to place the shoes the way we wanted them in the compartment. It didn't make a hole or any kind of opening in the carpet because each time we had to do the same thing again, just press against the soft spot in the carpet until they went through. For some reason it was more difficult some times than others. The best way I can describe it is how a ghost would be depicted walking through a wall.
