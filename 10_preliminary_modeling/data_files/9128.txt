Matthew was with me. I was trying to find the church that I take our parish's donations to. They have a little white shed for missions behind their church. I was having trouble finding it. In part of it we were in a car, I was driving. Part of it we were walking through a building. We ended up in a Methodist church. We were sitting in one of the pews during a service. I told Matthew that grandma used to be a Methodist and that their services are very similar to that of a Catholic Mass. We were in an office. We walked down a long hall and into an office directly at the end of the hall. We were looking for someone by a specific name, though I can't remember the name now. We wanted to buy a KTC card. When we walked into his office he was on the phone. He acknowledged us and ended his phone call. When I told him why we were there he looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about. After I said something else he said, yes, yes, and started shuffling through the piles of papers on his desk. I realized that we must be the first ones to buy one from him. They had just reopened the company and just beginning to market them again. He was obviously not prepared as I appeared to be the first person requesting to purchase one.
