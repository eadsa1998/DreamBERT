I am helping a man study some bats. He's a nice man. I like him. We go down to a room where the bats are. We have to be careful. Now we are in a tiny, square room between the down room and the up room, to protect ourselves from the bats, which could attack. Now the man goes upstairs and the other people too, to have lunch. I stay and study the bats. I'd like some lunch, but they don't offer any and I don't ask. I continue working on the bats.
