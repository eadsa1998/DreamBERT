My grandmother and I were near the lake which was frozen (grandmother 76). We were trying to go up a frozen path beside the lake, I was helping her. It was getting dark and she said we ought to turn back, but I said, "Let's keep going. We can go over the slope and around the block and home." She asked me if I was sure I knew the road over the slope and I hesitated somewhat, and finally agreed that we should turn back. It seemed that my father (42) and my sister (15) were worried about us. They were in a tower-like structure which was beside the lake, talking through a speaker system to planes which were out looking for us. I don't know what happened to grandmother, but I went up to the tower and told them I was alright. He called in the planes and questioned me where we had been.
