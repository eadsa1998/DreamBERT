I dreamed that I was out with a girl I had never known before. It was a blind date that one of my buddies fixed up. After having a wonderful evening I stop along the road in the park to make some love. After a few kisses the girl and I had sexual relations and on the way home the girl said that she would see me soon. I couldn't se her because she was to leave that very night for South America with her family. The next day I was walking downtown when I crossed the street and this car came bearing down upon me just as the bumper was about to hit me I awoke.
