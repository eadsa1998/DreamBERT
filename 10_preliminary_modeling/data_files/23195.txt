I was riding down in an elevator at the university where I worked.  At one floor the elevator stopped and a young man who looked familiar to me got in.  There was a sign on the offices on that floor that indicated they were the offices of the San Francisco Giants.  I was surprised when the man was very friendly, as if he knew me.  He asked me if I had any questions or requests, and I said, jokingly, "I want to be drafted."  When we got out of the elevator, it was raining outside, and we sat down to talk before going out.  Then we both realized that we had forgotten out umbrellas.  He got up to go back and get his, but I wasn't sure where I had left mine.
