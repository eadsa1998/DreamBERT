I was flying to get away. to escape without being seen or found. There was a hotel. More than one time I was trying not to be seen. Some crooked guy came into town and was trying to con people and get their money. Someone I knew or was related to said something to him to make his plan not work and he was successful. The bad guy left town. I think he had been a physical threat to me and possibly to some others as well.
