I was at a place with ATMs, though it had something to do with 4chan and I didn't know how to use it. I was playing a game with a girl. I stole a car and had to read the manual. It was a smooth drive. People were shooting at me and I had to rescue someone who had been kidnapped by some people involved with drugs.
