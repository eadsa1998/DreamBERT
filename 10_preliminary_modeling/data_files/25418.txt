 I'm living in a quad room on the third or fourth floor of Moat Hall at Brimson. I live with my friend Stephen Ramos and two other guys, one of whom is the pale-skinned, green-haired weight lifter guy I see in the weight room. I forget their names as soon as I meet them. The phone rings. It is my friend from high school Tiny Combs. He is in Big City with our friend Nate Nelling. He says to me, "This is Tiny C."
