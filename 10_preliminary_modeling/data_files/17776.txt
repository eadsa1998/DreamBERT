I dreamt about going to the observatory.  I was worried about the rain, so went to ask someone if we'd still be working.  I was carrying a bunch of bagged lunches.  Something happened to do with my brother Stuart; he was accusing me of butting in or stealing his lunch or something.  I was with a few people and there was talk about us spotting during an aurora borealis.  Then, they'd found it.  It started small, near a staircase.  It was a very faint orb; you could only see some circles of purple and green.  The green changed to orange.  Someone put his hand into it.  We watched it, entranced for a while, and then it ended, I guess.  There were two pieces of candy made from it, green like grass with orange little flattened beads.  I took one piece and someone took the other, and he wanted mine as well.  I went to the bathroom.  Then I was sitting outside for the spotting, and the rain started.  We were supposed to go home, but I was worried about driving in the rain.
