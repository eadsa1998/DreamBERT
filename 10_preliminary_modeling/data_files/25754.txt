 I pull into a subway. There are three women there. One of them is in charge. I tell her that I'm Kenneth. She knows that I am a good employee, she must have heard about me. It is 8pm. I am there to finish up the work for the night. I go somewhere and forget to punch out. My classmate Betty Carls is married.
