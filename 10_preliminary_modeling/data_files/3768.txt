I have returned to the community college C. department to work a bit. Jerome comes over and asks me if I would be a "P." I say, "I've been gone so long I don't have any idea how things work now. What does a 'P' do? Do they still do registration and center coverage? And office hours?" He says yes. I want to be conciliatory and obliging, so I agree to be a "P." I notice Jerome's eyes look odd, sort of big with wrinkles around them. He is standing at my desk and I go near his desk. He says to me, "Are you intending to use my desk or yours?" I again am aware of wanting to be obliging and say, "Oh, my desk, of course. It would be silly to change desks since yours is already set up." Then I feel uneasy, wondering if this is a part-time job or a full-time one. I hope it is only part-time.
