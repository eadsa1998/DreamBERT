I dreamed I was trapped inside of a plastic cage. I dreamed it was my girlfriend's mother who was holding the key to get out. She and her daughter were laughing at me becuase I could not get out. After that I remember just opening the door, because it was never locked. When I stepped out I felt like I was falling down stairs and woke up suddenly.
