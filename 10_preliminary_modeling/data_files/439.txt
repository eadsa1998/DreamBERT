I was pushing a baby carriage to a meeting at the preschool where I used to volunteer. In the carriage was a girl from the preschool that I used to spend a lot of time with. I felt extremely apprehensive and not sure if I would be welcomed back because I had been gone so long. I then saw the guy that I used to date playing with the kids. I was surprised he was there. Then the scene switched and my two housemates came into a room where a group of people was drinking. A party was going on and my housemates started to yell at some of the people because they were underage and drinking. I had yelled back at them because I was the only one drinking alcohol and I thought they were overreacting to the situation. I told them that they were being really hypocritical, and they just laughed. Then I was in a car with my closest friend at the university and we were going shopping. I just needed to get some groceries. She said, "You get your detergent here." I wanted to go to the grocery store closer to my house rather than the one we were at because it is cheaper. Then I said, "Why don't I just go get the detergent at the other store?" Then she said, "Never mind, we will just go in here, it doesn't matter." Then I had to go to the bathroom. The whole conversation took place in the store parking lot. Then my housemates came by and asked if they went too far when we had our argument before. I said in a calm voice that I thought they did and were being hypocritical. Then they said with a big smile that they were moving out in two weeks. This left me high and dry for a place to live, because I couldn't afford to live on my own. So I replied that I would make arrangements with our current landlords. They were just smiling the whole time like they were happy to stick it to me.
