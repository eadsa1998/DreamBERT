I was on a beach and I was thinking about getting in the water, when there was a tidal wave. It started getting higher and higher and Ezra and I climbed up this big step thing. Waves kept coming higher each time, and we climbed up higher. Eventually it went right over us at the top step. I climbed down and ran to these steps attached to a building which were surrounded by glass. I realized I was trapped there, so I got down and tried to find a car. I found a golf buggy, but it was really slow. A girl was following me. I got off and there was a tent on some grass. There were two weird looking babies in there with big heads. An insane lady grabbed one and bit out its throat and started eating it. Blood went everywhere and I ran. The waves were finally over and I started looking for everyone I had been there with.
