My friends and I are at my work place (Baker Library), but it is past 10:00 pm. We are playing in the dark rooms of the library, running up and down but without making any noises. The clearest image that I have is of my friend David who seems to be wherever I focus my eyes. The place looks different. The books are arranged in a different way. The structure of the inside looks new and clean, but I know it is Baker Library. . . I take an elevator from the fourth floor to go and meet my friends downstairs. When the doors open, I'm in a completely different environment. It looks like I'm in a typical Latin American neighborhood. I'm aware that I was going to go and see my friends who are waiting for me, but I think it is normal to find myself in that place.
