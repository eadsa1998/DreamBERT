I was in a nightclub, in a bathroom, behind a stall, when a woman with long hair came up to the stall door, pushed it open, and began touching me. I was standing up, about to leave the stall when she approached me and I said, "I'm pregnant and I'm not up to this." She didn't care and touched me between the legs, then grabbed my stomach (which was bigger than I currently am). I felt threatened by that gesture, but not afraid. She just seemed menacing and potentially dangerous, but I remained assertive and when I pushed her hands away from my stomach I woke up.
