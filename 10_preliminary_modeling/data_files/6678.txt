I was waiting for a bus, all those passing were for the wrong place. I went back in the house for things forgotten, finally got off, came to home of --. I had no extra things. I was pregnant, was going to have a baby at this place, for the second time. Where is the other baby? In hospital. The room is curtained off from the men in the gallery. Funny the labor pains are not more severe. Mother is somewhere around. How can I have a child. This is the second one since radium treatment at age 50. I must tell Dr. Mill, it can't be.
