It started off and we were going somewhere, we weren't exactly sure where. And I think I was back at school again. Why the heck do I keep having all these dreams about being back at school? I don't remember too much right now, but let's hold off and maybe sometime later in the day I will. Now I remember some. I think it was about somebody saying something about being totally irresponsible. I can't remember what the situation was, but I think it -- oh, I know what it was. Something about putting so much food at the top of the refrigerator and it blocks the light at the bottom on Uncle Charlie's sandwich and then wouldn't we give him enough consideration to at least let the fridge light be on his sandwich. And that was something that Dad was saying. And [laugh] this dream is full of bits and pieces of nonsense. And I think another thing was -- let's see her now -- oh, there was this picture, there was this still picture of one of these American Idols standing on stage. I think it was like a freeze-the-tape shot, if you know what I mean. Somebody was saying something about that it was going to start up a second time this year, but it was going to be a lot sloppier and a lot goofier. And I'm trying to think, there's something else. Something about a machine that wasn't really adjusted right, and you had to do something really weird in order to adjust it. That's about all.
