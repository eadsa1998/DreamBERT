I dreamed that I was going to have to work on the night shift in the reservation office of U-- A-- L--. I knew nothing about the work, but since no one else was able to make this shift, I was supposed to go. I planned to drive my father's car since the office was out at the airport, although I didn't know how to drive. However, I figured I wouldn't have too much trouble driving, out there, since there ought not to be much traffic that late at night--but I was worried about coming home in the morning since I had had no previous driving experience.
