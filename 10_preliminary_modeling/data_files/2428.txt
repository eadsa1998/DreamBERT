I'm at a high school or church, at an assembly. Everyone is sitting on wooden benches like in a church. A woman holds a huge boa constrictor snake which she has brought to show us. She wants me to touch the snake and get to know it, but I'm afraid to. So I start backing away. She follows me, insisting. I start to move among the seated students, ducking down so she can't see me. She just keeps coming. I run and hide, run and hide. I end up among the 7th grade girls, hoping she doesn't notice how much older I am, being a senior in high school. She smiles and says, "How young you girls look." I think maybe I should give up and touch the head of the snake, but can't get over my sense of fear which I now think is perhaps not warranted.
