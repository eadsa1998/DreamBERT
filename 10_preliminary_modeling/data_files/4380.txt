["Going on a date."] George and Mrs. Bush are in a house. I am their teen daughter. George opens the refrigerator and pulls out a platter of turkey meat and hands it to Mrs. Bush. They are rearranging the large freezer, with the glass door like a flower display cabinet. There are two children running around and George says he can get them to eat some of the picnic food. He is jovial and fun and the kids like him. They do eat some nutritious food. Now a young teen boy is at the table and George gives me permission to go out on a date with him. As we are walking out the door, we pass some framed pictures on the wall George notices that one of the frames should have been changed to a framed version (like a web site page) The children should have done that. Now he is pulling out foods from the refrige like a magician doing tricks, I know the trick, but indulgently watch to make him happy.
