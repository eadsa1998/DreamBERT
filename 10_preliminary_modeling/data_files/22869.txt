I was driving on a highway sort of like Veterans' Highway.  I was going pretty fast but had to slow down going around curves because of the loose gravel.  Soon I came to a small town-the neatest, whitest little town I have ever seen-all along one little street and only a block or so long.  There were two soldiers in the street.  I went by very slowly, and they didn't move.  There were soldiers everywhere, I don't know why.  I went up to one white house and knocked.  As I waited, I looked around.  The town was surrounded by trees, and the sky could just be seen in patches.  It was a beautiful sight.  Ronald Dunnington came to the door.  I asked him why the soldiers were there, and he didn't know.  He also didn't know why the houses were so neat and white.  I rubbed my finger on the side of the house and got a white smudge, so I figured they must have been freshly painted.  Some girl was making up the bed in Ronald's room.
