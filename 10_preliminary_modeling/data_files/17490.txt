I was in my housemate Drake's room, sitting on the floor playing a game.  They started a weird version of Othello.  Then we were outside, and high up, like in a courtyard.  We took turns taking something out of the pile and eating it.  Different colored Pop Rocks, etc.  It was supposed to be 'fuel' for something, and my Tuvan teacher Jim Hale was telling us to.
