 I'm in a car with my friend Tim Zelling. The steering wheel is on the right side of the car. The car is a stick shift. I'm sitting on the left side. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is in the back seat of the car. I steer. Tim accelerates. I brake. We are going really fast through a quiet neighborhood. We arrive at a car dealership. I may be on a moped. The love between Annie and I is still there. We make out in the sports car as Tim drives. At the dealership we stop doing this. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. We are having a taco dinner at the Hacker's house. Bubba's mother Emily is on the couch resting. We wash up in the bathroom.
