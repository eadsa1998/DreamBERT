My boyfriend Jeremy was asked to walk on some sort of 'rocks' which were actually stilts.  We walked a spiral rock path.  At the end, my longtime classmate Mark and my high school classmate Elvis, as well as someone else, had my old best friend Candy and me and someone else lie down so they could jump over us.  After that, I went back to the dining room table where I read a note from Candy.  She got hung up on the spelling of 'excel', though she tried many different spellings.  I'm not sure why she didn't try the dictionary or asking someone.  They called me back, and my mother said I should go and find out what they wanted.  The person sitting next to me said something about eating my butt.  I didn't go back, though.  I went the other direction, off to the right.  There was a Dilbert cartoon that I started to read, about the double-sized people.  They were paired up with the smaller people for dates, most of which, upon further inspection (the people were now real, not a comic strip) were women.  There were titles, like a news report.  They were saying how poorly the matches were, as by last name.  The Macs.  Egg-Counts.  Weigh-Melons.  One set went to the drug store. I saw three women sitting in the back of a car, bored.  A girl to the right asked me if I wanted to help the sex, things like that.  I went to one of the girls at the threesome, and was going to pair her with the one who'd requested me.  I cradled her in my right elbow and started to rub her between her legs, then her nipple.  I moved to kiss her but she started to pull away.  I tried kissing her soft lips again.  She was trembling.  I asked why, and she said she was afraid it would hurt.  I told her I didn't want to hurt her, but to pleasure her, and asked her if my rubbing between her legs had hurt.  I wanted to continue; I myself was throbbing.  I woke up then to the sound of thumping.
