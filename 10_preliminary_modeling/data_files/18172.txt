The dream took place in some strange house and I and a few other people were there. We were speculating on this deep problem which part of an orange was the most important. Was it the seed or was it the juicy pulp, or was it something else? We came to the conclusion that the seed was the most important. From that you could grow new orange trees. Then this dream went into a second episode which had to do with something about friends. Telling your real friends from your false friends or something.
