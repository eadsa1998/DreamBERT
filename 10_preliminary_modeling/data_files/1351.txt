I am waiting to go to work. I sit at a restaurant table. On my left is my "boyfriend" and to my right is a man that wants to be my boyfriend. He is courting me. He asks me for kisses, hugs me, buys my dinner. I refuse him loudly and directly, but let him pay for the dinner. I need to know what time my next work shift is. I look on the pencil it's printed on. It's been scratched off. I am angry. I say, "Who did this?" knowing it was him. He apologizes, and yells out, "I believe in abortion." Then he is embarrassed because everyone in the room heard him. They laugh and applaud. A couple of the booths close their glass windows to silently say they disapprove.
