I was at a school. I had taken this dance class for university and I could've done it externally (just theory) but I went in anyway. This was our last performance and I was chosen as the 'lead' dancer. This guy and I were supposed to dance together and I didn't want to do it. At the start, we weren't dancing together and I copied other movements. Then as he started to go to the front, I ran. There was an area under the building where I went to hide. I lay on the sand but they saw me as they walked past. The teacher threatened to fail me and I protested saying that I'd done well until now, I had been chosen as the 'best' etc. They eventually gave in and I ended up with a B grade.
