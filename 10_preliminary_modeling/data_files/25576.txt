 I'm at my roommate Stephen Ramos' house with our friend Esther Thurman, my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, and others. Someone suggests we go to a movie at 4:45. I have a pimple on the left side of my nose. I want everyone to go to the movie except Annie, Esther, and I. I want to be with them so we can make out. People need to get a ride home that night or the next day, as if we are down in the Metropolis.
