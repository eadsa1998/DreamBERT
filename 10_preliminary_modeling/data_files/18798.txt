In this dream I was working in an office somewhere, but I felt I didn't work there permanently, but just temporarily replacing someone. I was working with just an undershirt and slacks on. They had a small stairway in this office that would take your to offices overlooking offices on the first floor. I remember frequently running up these stairs to do something and upon descending I noticed a piece of buttered bread that was lying on someone's desk and it made me very hungry. When walking to my office even, I noticed pieces of buttered bread all around and there was even one on my desk. I ate it but was still hungry. When leaving to go upstairs again, I went over to a few desks with the break and broke off a piece and ate it as I figured they wouldn't miss it.
