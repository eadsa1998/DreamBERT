My parents and I lived in a hybrid of the apartment and their house.  A girl from choir was there for some reason and was taking food outside for dinner.  I was in the kitchen for a while and finally realized that nobody was coming back in- they were eating and nobody bothered to tell me dinner was ready.  I confronted them and they gave a poor excuse.  I went back into the kitchen, mad.  Then under the counter facing the balcony, a squirrel ran by.  There were some coated almonds sitting out so I offered the squirrel one.  Surprisingly, he came and took it from my fingers.  My boyfriend Jeremy was there, and he managed to pet the squirrel.  I was slightly jealous and wanted to pet it as well.  Some more squirrels appeared, and I managed to pet them.  It was neat.  Then my parents came back inside.  While everyone had been gone at some point the door had been left unlocked.  Some punk teens had broken in and lifted a few things, as well as vandalizing the place.  I went to the bathroom.  There was graffiti over the walls and etchings into the bathroom mirror of "I hate ___".  I was upset- it wasn't our fault.  Ink could be washed off, but what about the etched mirror?  Would it come out of the deposit when we moved out, and would we have to live with it until then?
