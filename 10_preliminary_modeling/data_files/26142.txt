 I'm in my room about to masturbate when my housemate Stephen Ramos barges in the door. I have a bottle of Horse's Hoof beer in my left hand. I say to him that I was just about to masturbate, and that it's a good thing that I wasn't doing so at the time he entered. I decide not to masturbate and lose my erection. I'm wearing my white boxer shorts with red and green stripes.
