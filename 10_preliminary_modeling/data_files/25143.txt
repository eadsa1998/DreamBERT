 I'm at home. Something is happening with my friend Nat Miller and softball. I'm in my sister Heather's room. My girlfriend Annie is there. We're in a big bed, and have been up all night. It's 6:50 am, and I've gotten no sleep. She is wearing her flower underwear. We playfully push and shove each other. I wonder if I should kiss her. I turn the television on, and adjust the volume, then turn it off. I hear people outside the house, a tapping sound. It is my classmate Molly Villareal and others from Brimson. I go outside to kick their ass. I get to the bottom of the stairs and Annie grabs the back of my shirt, holding me. I am mad. What is she doing, I think? My siblings come out. They are having a surprise second anniversary party for Annie and I. I am surprised! I punch Annie in the chest, fairly hard. I also punch my brother Wally. I am in an awkward position. There are four candles, two for Annie and two for myself. There are in a small plastic cup of 7-Up.
