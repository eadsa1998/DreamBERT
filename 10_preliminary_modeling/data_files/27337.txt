I dreamed I was driving a car. It seemed I was sitting up high and close to the steering wheel. At times the car had only two wheels and other times it resembled a bike. I was driving very fast and confidently. I don't remember who was with me, but I was not alone. It seems I was driving around the block in front of my fiance's house and also in front of my girlfriend's house. My fiance is 23 and the girl is 20.
