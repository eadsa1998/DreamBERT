I was at school and it was year 11. We went to this meeting place in senior school. There weren't many people there. Dmitri wasn't there. Calvin and Samantha were in my class. The groups were supposed to be in alphabetical order, but we weren't. We had to watch a Romeo and Juliet play. I was too scared to go over the roof, so I hung a shirt over a wire. This girl looked like Teresa, but she wasn't. I knew she wasn't really Teresa. I had computing with Calvin next. We didn't know where to go, or what to do. I left my bag in class. Calvin went looking and I got my bag. Cayden was there. We climbed through a tunnel thing. We were then outside and this guy looked like a terminator from The Terminator. There were lots of black guys. Calvin, Samantha, someone else and I were hiding in a car. He started coming towards us. We drove off and there was chip oil. This guy threw this chip oil bomb thing but it missed. A science teacher Calvin liked walked past. We went to Ms Quintana.
