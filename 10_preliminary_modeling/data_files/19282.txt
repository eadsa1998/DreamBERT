I was at my cousin's house (she is a female and she is 14). She was having a birthday party for her little brother turning seven. Our family was there and all the teenagers were downstairs. It was getting hot so I went to the bathroom to wash my face. When  I came out my crush was there. He's also 16. We both sat down and talked. I was so happy. He was telling me jokes and I was laughing. I did realize that I was laughing; then I woke up feeling weird.
