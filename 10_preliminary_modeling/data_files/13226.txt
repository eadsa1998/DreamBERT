I was at school and was watching heaps of movie previews. I wrote something on this piece of paper. Later, mine and Eugene's were next to each other. Eugene had written something on his page at the same spot, with similar writing. Jeremiah pointed it out and said "Why have you got something written there too?". I said that something was gay and Eugene laughed.
