I was looking for a restroom. I was in a hall with many doors. I could not find the restroom. I defecated in my trousers and it ran down my legs. I had to hurry because I was to leave for somewhere with a group of people. Later, outside, I stepped down some concrete steps. A wall was being built around it. I accidentally knocked a piece of wet cement ornament with my shoe. I noticed that it was of wood set in the cement. A worker thought I had loosened it, but he saw that it was tight. The one on the other side was loose instead.
