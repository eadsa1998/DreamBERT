I have been having a problem __________________, a problem which I have never really had and I only really _______________________. But basically when I got my cleaning and my xrays from the college back in May, they had given me a referral to go to my dentist because they said that it looked like one of my fillings on the lower right was wearing out. Now wearing out, that doesn't really sound like it's a cavity or anything. So I said, "Well, I'll just let it go; I don't want to go deal with that." So now it's the end of August and in the past few days it has really been getting my attention, and I've been finding all kinds of ways to deal with it, like tipping my head sideways or having Listerine in my mouth for a while has done a pretty good job of numbing it for about an hour, not really numbing it, but making the pain going away. And ibuprofen doesn't really work that well, but I dug through the cabinet and I found _______________ does work, and I took it before John came and it worked like a charm all evening long. So I'm telling you all of this because last night I had a dream about teeth. And [laugh] I mean, that would stand to reason, right? There was something else going on, and I have really no clue what it was, which is unfortunate. I woke up in a "blahhhhhh" state of mind because in order to go to sleep with all those issues, I had to take a pill, which really made me feel like a dead fish in the morning. So I couldn't remember most of what I dreamt, but what I did remember was that I had lost several teeth. I mean, they just started getting looser and fell out, just like they did when I was little. And then the one on the right, which was bothering me, in my dream it finally came loose and fell out too, but what it was, was instead of a normal-sized tooth, it was a huge oval chunk thing, and I said, "Well, how in the world could this be in my mouth?" And as I held it and studied it and examined it, it got bigger and bigger and bigger, and it was like it's the weirdest thing. I mean, it was an old, old thing. It was almost like a picture frame and the outside perimeter was a little bit more raised than the middle, and the middle was sort of indented and kind of lumpy and bumpy, and it was kind of like one of the big molars in the back, I guess. But I looked it in the _______ and it had like all these colorful sparkly things in it, and it just sort of crumbled and it was falling apart in my hand and there was gooky stuff and it was the grossest thing ever, and it was kind of funny. And one thing ______________ because I was having a funny little memory of when I was about 10 and Samantha came in 1995 and _______________ for some reason kind of ___________ at the time. And I guess I was losing teeth or something, and Samantha said, "Oh, I know, you're going to have a dream tonight that the tooth fairy is going to bring you an amplifier in the shape of a tooth, and it's going to blow you out of your bedroom." That was funny.
