I am at an event at a house. Myself and several other people are in charge, perhaps hosting the event. We're outside on the front porch. Some are sitting on chairs and others of us are standing, some standing by the rail surrounding the porch. They are several steps leading up to the porch. Someone comes up to the bottom of the steps and asks us about someone, though I'm not sure now if they were asking about an individual, a couple, or a family. Whoever it is that they're asking about has something that clinically might be considered a personality disorder. Someone immediately replies that there is no one around like that. Someone else then points to the house next door to our left as we're facing away from the house and tells us to take a look at what is going on over there. It had been sitting empty, but now there are families, but maybe just one family, staying in that house. They don't own the house nor did they receive permission from the owner to be there. They just showed up, found a way to get in and then just began living there. Apparently this behavior is very typical of someone with the type of personality disorder that was asked. So the person who pointed this out to us then said, see, there are a lot more of those people around than you realize. He said most people just don't pay attention to notice it.
