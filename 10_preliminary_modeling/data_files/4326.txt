["Going to a conference."] I went to California for a conference. I am going to return now and get into my car, a red cute convertible. I say goodbye to some women friends. They leave and I realize I will need help. My purse is in the very backseat on the floor. I can't get the top up by myself and it will get cold and perhaps rainy. I sigh and begin to drive toward the road. I veer to miss a picnic of a family. I then stop the car and decide to be smart about it and try and reorganize things as best I can before traveling down the road. Usually I go and suffer the consequences. I see some food in the glove compartment and start chomping on a head of lettuce. Aunt Bridget pops her head in the window and says Hi. Jerome is around somewhere. They can help me put the top up.
