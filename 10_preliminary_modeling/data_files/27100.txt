My friend (age 23-male), my mother (age 45), my sister (age 22) and I were in my friend's car on B--- Road in front of the M--- Administration Building. We went around the corner on F--- Drive. I was driving. Then suddenly my mother was driving and I was very angry because I wanted to drive. She drove around the corner of F--- Drive onto E--- Ave. Then, again, I was driving. I drove as far as the Church of the C--- and then I stopped, having remembered that there was something at home which I needed. I wanted to drive my friend's car home by myself (30 miles). Everybody was trying to find a solution and it was all very confusing... The scene changed to a room in a dormitory (I don't know where). There were three girls in the room and my friend and I were standing in the doorway talking to them. The next thing I knew my friend was pulling me along the floor by the leg. I got up, ran outside, got in his car and drove off into the sky (as if I were in a rocket ship). Then I became a bystander in the dream and I saw my friend frantically pleading for me to come back. I seemed as if I were going to some distant place to which he could not get.
