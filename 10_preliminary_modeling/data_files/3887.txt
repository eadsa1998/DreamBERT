["Yelling at Ellie."] I am trying to be supportive of my girls (they are 13 years old or so). It is a school function, like boy scouts. I get into a line and Ellie is being a noisy impolite pain. I am trying to ask questions of the women who are running the thing. They are at a table handing out information. One of the women reprimands me for being noisy and disruptive. I am now very upset. Insult to injury, after all, it was really Ellie's fault.
