It seems as though I went back and forth between observing this dream and being in it. Though, I don't know what my role was when I was in it. This family lived in a large home with a big yard. They were getting ready to transplant a small tree or plant. They were somewhat concerned about how difficult it would be to dig a hole that would be big enough. When he started digging he broke through the ground into a large hole. In looking further into the hole they realized that most of their house had no ground foundation. It was sitting on a few inches of dirt. They were so angry that the builder had kept this from them. They realized that they were all in danger by living in this house that could collapse at any time. They confronted whoever was responsible for this. Now the house is on a beach. It is long and narrow, and very natural looking. It has wood floors, exposed wood on the walls and ceilings. It wasn't completely closed in. In fact, the outer walls were far and few between. Every so often there was also a wide set of steps leading down to the beach. There are five or six children in the family. They all become ill and are experiencing nausea. The parents are also ill. A male friend arrives to look after everyone. Something happened and I thought to myself that I remembered this from another dream even though it was not a dream I had recorded. There was a room with at least one wall that was all glass. There was hardly room to walk in the room because it was full of piles of boxes and storage containers that had some kind of paperwork in them. There was a desk in the middle of all of the piles. A man was standing outside talking to another man who was inside this room, sitting a the desk. The man outside was responsible for the boxes of papers, but he had not processed it the way he was supposed to. He took some kind of short cut to finish quickly, knowing that he hadn't done what he was supposed to but believing he wouldn't be caught. He did get caught.
