I was at Mom's and all the guys from Monty Python were there, except Gilliam and Idle (ie Chapman, Cleese, Jones and Palin). It turned out that John Cleese, Michael Palin and I had this sort of love triangle going on. I also went to school and my English teacher, who was called Teacher-M-02, but wasn't him, and I also had some fusty thing going on and I was doing well in English for that reason. I was also in a class and the people were singing the Lumberjack song and I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts except it said something about work. There was also a big stage. Something bad happened though. Then or before all this, we went on a school camp thing. Terry Jones and I were sharing a room, why he came on a school camp I do not know, but we had this little room. Anyway, someone knocked on the door and it was a guy with a creepy mask on. I kept screaming and laughing. Then he left and I said "now a real evil person will come". The door opened and an evil person thing was there. Then Terry ended up on a cross, upside down, but he was ok.
