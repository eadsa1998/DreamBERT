I was with Dawson, Jack, Joey and Jen (all from Dawson's Creek) in a dorm or something. This guy came in and said he just got tested for HIV and we should too. We decided to do it now. We got to the front of the building and realized Dawson wasn't with us. We kept going. It was night. There was a van in the middle of the carpark and it had this big gun looking needle and you had to do it yourself. Joey and Jack went first and put ice all over their arm to numb it. Jack said it would hurt like hell in the morning. I decided not to do it. Jen anxiously waited for her turn. Then I decided to do it. I got in the back of the car and asked Jack what to do. He said to make a small cut on my hand, so I tried but I couldn't get it big enough so I asked what next. He told me about the ice. Then there was this thing where Jack had written about the experience and someone had said the hard thing wasn't the pain but being tested.
