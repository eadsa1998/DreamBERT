I was using a cardboard box as a car, driving through BR. People were driving on an area between the buildings and the sidewalk. It was very narrow and in waking life a car could certainly not fit on it. It kept getting more and more narrow. I thought that it was easier for my box/car than it was for people in normal cars. I got out and kind of folded the box up and continued because it became so narrow. I then realized that I was walking head on into cars coming from the other direction. So I turned around quickly and headed back the other way. I decided to go around the other side of these businesses to get where I was going. I'm not sure how it happened but my box/car got soaking wet and I was afraid it was going to fall apart. It brushed up against my bare leg. It left a dirty spot that I wiped off after pulling the box further away from me. I got to the restaurant where I was meeting someone. I unfolded it and set it up and then entered the restaurant for lunch. When I came back out it wasn't raining anymore. But I was concerned that my box/car was sturdy enough to transport both of us since it had gotten all wet. However, it now looked more like a car but not a regular car or even a convertible. But there was a portion that resembled the front seat of a car. It was very sturdy. The person with me, a woman, said it had dried out some and was good and sturdy and would be fine.
