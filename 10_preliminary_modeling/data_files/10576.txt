       --We are about to renovate our home: only the kitchen floor, or more? We are to use a "New Age" method that involves many prayers, symbols and seminars. We return from one of those, but cannot decide whether we want to do it. I say "Let's see what happens, we don't have to decide right away." We mark our calendar for December 17th.
