I saw men get stabbed in the back and blood oozed out. Hank was one of them. A fellow had a turtle. It wouldn't walk for him. I said, "Put a fire under him and he will pull out his head." I lit a match and put it under the turtle. He came out and did he run and was he big. I had a hard time keeping up with him. I was in the old neighborhood. We were driving to church to St. Francis on Superior Ave. I was driving thru the street. There were a lot of people walking thru. I stopped my car and got out. Then I walked for the car and it was a baby buggy. That's what my car turned into again. We went into church and it was full of people. I was home. I had a compass. I held the compass in my hand to see it point north. I picked up an air rifle that belonged to me. It seemed small compared to what it was when I was a kid. I thought I would shoot it. I saw a robin on a tree nearby. I was tempted to shoot him. I aimed, but didn't shoot.
