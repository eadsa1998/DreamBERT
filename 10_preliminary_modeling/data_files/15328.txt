I was watching something. Coach Beiste was in it and was a tough woman and she was complaining about stuff. She asked me if someone had a diabetes shot. We rounded up everyone (we were in a shop) and stopped the music to tell people about the diabetes shot. A guy did something near me that made something poke me in the head. She said she was giving away free shots at a place in the city. Some guy was like 'we don't have to listen to you, don't have a medical certificate'. Then she pulled a certificate out and he walked away. I went to talk to her later and this 'village' for all the teachers and students in Glee. She was in this little house. I told her to stop being mean. I said I was a well behaved student and was never in trouble and didn't speed because I was scared of police and said 'when you yell it makes me want to laugh and press stupid keys and be naughty' etc. I said 'here's $100 and 3 weeks break'. She laughed and said ok. Then it was Glee and it showed pictures of everyone on a door of a house. They were all around a pool. I only recognized Rachel and Finn. I was there too with no shirt on. The water started pouring in and was cold. I held something against me and someone said something to me about cold water. I ended up at some fancy house. There was a stage set up for a performance. There was a rope and Rachel swung to the ground and started singing.
