The other night I dreamed that I was calmly sitting in the living room hemming a pair of summer shorts when all of a sudden I heard some shooting. I looked up and it seemed as though I could see right through the walls and there were two men, one on top of the basement stairs and one at the bottom and they were shooting guns at each other. I didn't know the fellas, but I was aware of a plaid shirt that a boy across the street always wears. I kept telling them not to fight, but I wasn't overly excited about the whole situation.
