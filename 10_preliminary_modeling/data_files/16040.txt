I was at school with Mom, and her and I were up at this little mixing room type of a thing, up above on the third floor of the main building. But it was really supposed to be a computer lab. Anyway, sorry about that saw in the background. Anyway, Mom and I were in this room, and she bent something like a computer that makes it really stand out, and she has to get help from Uncle Larry. I think this is how it went. It was so complicated, I can't even remember it. But anyway, she makes the computer stand out, and Uncle Larry comes up and is criticizing me because I don't ever work with him on anything, and isn't going to help us now. Matter of fact, he threatens to activate the alarm system. And then I think somebody was riding around outside in a little golf cart thing like the administrators do, and for some reason or other we had to get out of there quick because he did something else with the computer that was going to start this virus thing going around the school. And so we got on this golf cart and we just drive, and I didn't recognize, and we went downstairs via the elevator into the library. Then we were talking with Mrs. Talmadge and she said that I had this problem with rocking back and forth, which I don't, but that the problem was common with blind people, but I don't have it. And Mrs. Talmadge said that I had a problem with rocking back and forth and that we needed to work on that.
