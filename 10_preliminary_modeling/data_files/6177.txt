I went to a 25th Anniversary party somewhere on the water at night. When I got there everyone from school was there even though it was for a family member. I had to crawl under electric fences and past attack dogs and also climb on rocks that were on the water edge holding on for dear life or I would have fallen in the ocean at night. When I finally got there someone dressed weird was spitting into the grill and the flames were getting big. Then everyone started doing it and the flames were huge. He then picked up the grill and folded it in half and it turned into a portable plane with flames coming out of it. He was playing with it and waving the flames at everybody. My grandmother is scared of fire so she made me walk with her over to a neighbor's yard so she could get away. I put her in a chair at a table so she could eat but it was too low and she couldn't reach. Plus she kept falling off. I was getting more and more cushions to stack but it just did not do. Then I was getting dirty laundry to put under her but she still kept slipping off.
