I was at university. I was in a building that looked like a shop. I had gone there earlier to put three water bottles in a fridge but I couldn't find a place to put them. This girl told me to put them 'behind the shop' and I had to lift something. When I went back, I didn't know which ones were mine. There was something on at 2.30pm the next Wednesday -- something to do with Kiefer Sutherland coming to help you when it's 'hot'. I was thinking that I wanted to go. You had to order tickets. Adam Baldwin was also going to be there and he was interviewing people for plays and he was a playwright. I was also home at one point and I was watching TV with Mom. Supernatural was on, but I only remember seeing Rover and I saw Serenity (as in, the actual ship) and I got excited.
