I am going for a merit badge, or an award of some kind in "beauty" or something of the sort, something girlish. Andrea is there and I know one of the requirements is that I have to drive a car. I don't quite understand. I say, "What, do I have to drive you girls to the mall?" We are in my front yard and start running, and eventually get on a bus (I don't know where we are at this point). I almost miss it. The door closes behind me, but opens again to let me on. We are riding on the bus and I am looking out the window. I take photographs, also hoping to be able to take these back to physical reality. There are street signs on the road. I see all of these signs, and stores. I see the names of the stores and everything, and I wonder, "If it's my mind making up the names of the stores, why can't I be so creative when I'm awake?". The last thing I remember is looking at a guy that looks like Mr. Levine, and then a slightly familiar looking blonde girl walks by me.
