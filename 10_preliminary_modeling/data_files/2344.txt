A long dream with Uncle Joel and Aunt Jillian. I meet my parents in a restaurant in Dover. It looks familiar. We've been there before. I'm in Joel and Jillian's house, lots of glassware. I then watch Joel on a river boat. He's chasing a young woman and then has an epileptic seizure. I watch his face and think, "I love to watch his face." It's a sweet face, but then he wants me to say we are together so people won't know of his affair with this woman and I say haughtily, "I'll read my diary, if he was there, it will be in my diary." I realize my diary and journal could be an embarrassment to me if people read it. I walk past a field of corn, touching the plants as I walk by. Then I'm near an empty field on a mowed down path and the sky is brown. The clouds are roiling around and I'm scared. That is the worst storm sky I've ever seen and I could get struck by lightning, out in the open like that. I keep walking fast, hoping to find safe cover in time or to somehow avoid the storm.
