I woke up from Mom and this guy talking loudly. They said it was 7am, but it was actually 11:30. My phone said 8:40. She had been cleaning up and had chucked a heap of boxes in my room with 'my' stuff in them. I took them all back out. She was standing in a towel and was annoyed about me moving the stuff back. Ezra had bought this blow up chair with doopy things coming out and it was motorized and dangerous in races? It was blue. We went to the shop where this guy friend of Mom's used to work as he supplied us with the chairs. When we got there I asked Ezra what his name was and he said "Silvio". There were other people we didn't know working and they told us it was dangerous. I was sitting on it and bouncing around. We walked into some girl shop. As we left this group of girls pointed and laughed at him and he threw the chair at them. This other girl hit him and he punched her. I said "you totally head crabbed those girls". We went into this shop right next to the exit (around the corner from where he punched the girl). Ezra was talking to the guy about some shirt and asked if it was the 'same'. The guy was Jared Padalecki. I was going to ask him for a photo but was waiting for the right time. Ezra didn't seem to notice who he was. Supernatural was playing on a TV in the shop. Dean and Autumn were at a clothes shop and it was a new episode. I was about to ask if it was weird watching it when I got a tap on the back. It was some lady and she said her husband was going to make her eat a horn and something else and needed someone to watch and wanted me to follow her and I said hell no. She kept insisting and Jared said he'd go, but the lady said no she wanted me. I was later reading a list of Brad Pitt's favourite movies. They were mostly weird ones I hadn't heard of, but also had Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Get Real.
