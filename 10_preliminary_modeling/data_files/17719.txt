There was a biracial celebration at the high school.  Everyone was having a great time.  I was frustrated and left out.  I gave up and left, and was crying when I talked to my friend Celia on the phone behind a classroom.  I was frustrated to be left out, because all the European countries are just considered 'all the same' and aren't attributed any separate cultures.   Celia counseled me and asked me why I didn't talk to people about it.  I was afraid that my reasoning would not be considered justified and I would just be left out even more, or laughed at.
