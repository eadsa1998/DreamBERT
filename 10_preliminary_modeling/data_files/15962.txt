Winifred made a short film for that festival thing with a prompt. I can't remember what the prompt was but she had two guys who were similar looking and they were flirting with each other and were shirtless and rubbing each other's chests. Then some guy got a finger through his ear to the other side of his head, then the finger got chopped off and the chopped off bit was so long that you could tell it wasn't actually part of the finger. I edited it slightly so it made it look more real.
