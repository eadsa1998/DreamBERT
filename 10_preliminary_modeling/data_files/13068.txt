This girl and boy (who were brother and sister) could travel back in time. They were gone for a while at one stage and when they came back their mother was really excited. She had moved house since then and they wanted to bring her back in time. They chose the 1700's. Then we were there, sitting at a table outside somewhere. There was a poster with classical composers. I was saying that Beethoven and Mozart rock. The cups were really solid. They were hanging people there. I spoke with a British accent and was saying how one place I went to thought that the accent was rude.
