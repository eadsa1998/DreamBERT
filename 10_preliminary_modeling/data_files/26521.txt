 I'm with my friend Binky Ahmed at home. We have smoked marijuana and are high: we're goofy. My mom is there with one of her sisters, who makes a comment about being high. I tell her that her description is how I thought being high would be until I actually smoked marijuana, when I found out that is not the case. We're all about to leave somewhere in a car. My sister Ramona is mad because there is no gas in the car. I was supposed to put some gas in the car because I drove it last and the gas tank was empty. I grab a couple snacks from the red basket under the countertop. Binky is high, and is lazy. There's a reward of some sort, of two items.
