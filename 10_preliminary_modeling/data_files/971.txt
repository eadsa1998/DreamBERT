We're making a 60 second T.V. public anouncement. Donald Duck and I and some other people (men, one black, one white). It is humorous. We laugh and enjoy as we creatively think it up and then act it and then play it back. First, I draw a tracing of Donald Duck for the camera. Then, the men play Donald Duck when the shots involve not seeing the face (stand-ins), one in a tuxedo. Donald Duck picks up a bra made out of 2 top hats and holds them up to his chest. I'm in a cage playing my baby banjo while Donald Duck drives a broom around the outside of the cage and the person in the tux drives a motorcycle. I'm tracing Donald Duck's webbed feet. Now his body is the coast and a technical decision has to be made about how to differentiate the fish in the ocean from his body. Donald Duck is highly dramatic lamenting that he's not unique. He's not the only "genius" or genus species to cry. I'm trying to trace the leg of Donald Duck and I need to connect Route 66 with Centennial Blvd. I make a mis-tracing, but then I figure it out.
