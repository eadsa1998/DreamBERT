Lucy, Mirabelle and myself are going to do a program for teachers in a school. We come early and wait all morning until lunch when it's time for our program. This is annoying. A small orange and white striped kitten is with me, perched on my head. Mirabelle has a black and white one. I like the kitten. It is playful. A small mouse and the kitten are being used to demonstrate a point to me. The kitten eats the mouse and then lets it back out unharmed. I feel a bit uncomfortable and nervous for the mouse, but the mouse is OK. [BL]
