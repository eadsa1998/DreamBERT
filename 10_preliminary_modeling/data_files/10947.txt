I was talking with a group of people. Suddenly I heard a crunching noise and felt something drop into my mouth. I spit it into my hand and saw it was a tooth. It seemed to be an eye tooth, but resembled a three-legged individual salt dish. I remarked upon the oddity to my friends only to feel a sudden avalanche of falling teeth. My mouth was completely filled with teeth and they hurt my mouth. Again I spit the mouthful into my hand. Yet the minute they began dropping, other teeth came half way into my gums. A second time all my teeth dropped out, but again they seemed to be forced out by new teeth growing in. I thought in the dream that this was ridiculous because no one can have two sets of adult teeth grow in.
