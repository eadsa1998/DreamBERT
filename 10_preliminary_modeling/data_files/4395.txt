["The poisonous head."] I am in a small square cabin, one room. A woman is dangerous. She has a severed head which if shaken around someone will poison them and they will die. The head is blackened and ugly and scary. I feel fear because she is trying to shake the poison onto me. I manage to avoid her and force her out of the cabin. Then I shake the head at her watching drops of poison fall off the head onto her. Then I throw the head at her and slam the door shut. I struggle frantically to lock the front door. I succeed. Then I run to the back door and struggle to lock it. Two locks. Then I check a window lock. It is locked. I feel afraid.
