Now I am going to the bathroom. A black family is in the area with me. The father doesn't approve of me. I say, "I am going to a show at the United Brethren Methodist Church," which is black. The mother approves. The children, a boy and a girl, about 12 years old, or 10, like me. We roller skate together, the boy on my right, the girl on my left. The scenery is breathtaking: horses, wide open spaces on the right. We get to the church and they take me to a small office room where a going away party is going on for a white woman who is playing a character of mine in the show. They are all very happy to see me. She hugs me; they are very impressed with my work. Now a young man, the actor John Ritter, is in love with a young woman and he courts her. She is going to declare her love of him and she hands him a gift. It's a joke gift that teases him and then she hands him a real gift, a box of baby things and so on. He takes this to mean she is pregnant and they will be married. He is thrilled. They embrace, and I lay next to them on the floor feeling much sadness and poignancy at being this close to that kind of love, but not being involved myself. Now I'm the young man, who is chosen as the "Ron," like a homecoming king at high school. I stand in the back of a pickup and wave to the crowds who cheer me and want me to stay. I want to leave to be alone with my love. I am torn between the two needs.
