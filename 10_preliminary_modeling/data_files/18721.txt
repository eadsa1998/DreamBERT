Me and Rudy were looking for 2 things. TV Guides to a dry cleaners. It was raining and we drove underground. I thought it was a newsstand but it was a dark basement dry cleaners. When I went in I couldn't remember why I came there. Rich was waiting in the car. There was a cat there. I was petting the cat. It was a big cat. Sheri had said she was going to adopt the cat, but she never did. She kept saying she was gonna take the kitty home, but she never did. We stopped at a church service. It was an old dark big Episcopal Church. Catholics were weaving in and out. People were hovering around the center aisle and there were refreshments out front. The priest was back in the middle of the aisle, like a crowded grocery store aisle. Mary Ganther was there. There was a TV movie. Sort of animated about a stupid clown and his side kick. The colors were lots of purples and greens. There were subtitles. Some silent. I flipped the channel and this same cartoon was on every channel. Some channels had Chinese subtitles. Some channels had other foreign languages. Always the same clown in glasses and his buddy. The real film was starting. It was a weird sort of drawing, sort of like old master drawings--sort of black and white photos of little boys legs under the table, not wearing any pants. The drawings showed their little penises and how they changed from infant to boys, about 10 or 12 years old. I was at Marianna's. Mary was there. I was trying to get some work together. I needed to go to sleep, but it felt too uncomfortable to go to sleep there. Marianna kept saying mean things, about that I had farted. I wanted to take a shower, but I was afraid to ask. I was going to Jasmine's talk. Marianna had said she was going to go with me, but she didn't go. She hurt my feelings. She kept saying things to hurt my feelings.
