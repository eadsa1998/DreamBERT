I am trying on some new glasses: pink-rimmed, expensive, $60, but they are not bifocals. The salesgirl takes me out for a "run" with the glasses. OK out-of-doors. We run in deep harsh snow, I put my foot into a pile to measure it, it goes up to my knee! It is like a hard crust, dirty snow on top, but softer below. She keeps saying "Take your mind out" and "Let go." We run back and I decide to buy the glasses. I put $30 and promise to pay $30 later. I see Frank coming toward me. Stern-faced, I sort of bump into him, and he asks if I can read with these glasses. He hands me a newspaper. It is all blurry, so I say "I guess I had better get cheap glasses at the drugstore."
