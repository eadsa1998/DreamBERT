I was up on top of a high building. Eddie Lasko was there with me. I walked into a showroom where there was a contest on grapes. I saw a woman walk into the place with a beautiful bunch of grapes and she said to the other woman, "This should win." I had to squeeze thru a small opening and I got myself dirty. I was looking for Bob. He was lying in the basement relaxing and I didn't see him. I met Tommy Lasko and he asked me where Ann was. I was working in the shop. I looked at a big rack of stock of bars. I won something in a context on TV. It was worth $5,000. I said I was going to go on and take the $5,000, not try to win more and lose what I had won.
