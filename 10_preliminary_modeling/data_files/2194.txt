A man had bought a used tractor cheap for me. Then I had to pay for pieces of equipment to repair it, and then he tells me it won't work. He has his hat down over his eyes and I say, "Move your hat up. I want to tell you what I feel. I know you tried and you did some good things, but I got dumped on here and I'm angry and frustrated." He looks sheepish and I feel a little guilty ragging on him.
