Later things changed into a warehouse/factory setting. There were peopling hanging around milling about. Caity Norton (an artist who I knew from home who went to an art school near where I now work) was there for some reason. I asked her to consult with me about a web site thing I was doing. She was sidling up like that drunk blonde chick from the train the night before. It had to do with me trying to write a story about a massive train station that people had turned into a picnic area. The only light came from long banks of far-away florescent lights, and everything was rusty. The picnic tables, the ground, even the walls and ceiling. The whole cavernous place reminded me of a rusty manhole cover with calcified drippings all over it. The place was shaped like a hangar, and the floor was pebbled and wet (almost like bumpy terrazzo). In the dim distance there were chunky steel grates blocking passages leading to god knows where. Caity comes in as I'm sitting at a round stone table trying to post my story to the newspaper's Web site. I'm having trouble, and she sits down and offers advice. I don't know if it worked or not, because I woke up.
