Paulina and I are going to the mall and ask directions of this man. He walks us there. We enjoy ourselves talking. We get there and he says, "You have to turn right and cross the bridge." He is going to turn left. We hug and kiss goodbye. It is a sad moment because we realize we like each other, but now must part. Bittersweet.
