I am holding a small naked baby, my hand on his little skinny butt. Charla and Ellie and I are trying to get into a restaurant. Ellie goes in. I try but there is a counter. I try to lay the baby on the counter so I can pull myself over the counter. A man is working there, like a matrie de. He says no, you can't put the baby there. That's not safe. I ask him to hold the baby. He refuses. He's afraid the baby will pee or poop on him. I am also concerned about that. I go back outside. Charla is there. Now Ellie comes up to me and begins to clean my butt. I am sitting. I say, embarrassed, did I poop? She says gently yes. She is cleaning up the mess. I am surprised because I didn't feel anything happen. Now I and Ellie are in a building. Some welfare workers are showing us clippings or video of us trying to get assistance illegally. I feel caught. I see a clip of me wearing a blue with white Pokka dots on it blouse and a small peter pan collar. The pants are a bright floral pattern like yellow daisies on a dark background. I am doing gymnastics stands with Charla. She's on her back with her legs up and I am going to lean on her feet so she can raise me. I hesitate. I am so heavy. My tummy is plump and protrudes.
