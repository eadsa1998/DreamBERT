Something was kissing me on the lips and it was like a spirit. I couldn't see it, but I could feel it and it was taking my breath a little. So I started to move my arms slowly. Then I moved and slapped at it and it let go of me. I was driving a new car. We went over a little bank and we all jumped out of the car. It seemed to disappear over a cliff. We stood there and listened to hear it hit way down below, but didn't hear anything. We went over to the dealer, which was about 200 ft. away, and told him what happened. He told us to look over the bank on the opposite side of the hill and I looked over and under where I was lying down and there was a garage underneath the hill and where my car went over, it must have gone into the garage.
