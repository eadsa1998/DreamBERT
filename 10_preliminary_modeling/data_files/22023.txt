The dream I had last night went like this: I was walking around the Plaza de Armas, looking for a store, restaurant or bar that was open in order to buy some matches, but there weren't any. There were just clothing stores, shoe stores, etc. I continued walking when suddenly I found myself in front of a big store which I remembered from having shopped there and the name of it was Sears, but it had another name which at the time I'm writing this I can't remember. I pushed the door and walked, passing by some places typical of the area -- a place where they make roasted peanuts and popcorn, very delicious. I smelled the good aroma and decided I would buy some. I put my hands in my pockets to take out the money and took out only 5 cents with which I was going to buy the matches earlier. I asked myself, "What am I going to buy with this? I better come back with more money, but maybe they'll close up the place. No! I better ask." I did this and the girl who was serving answered me; she had a white apron on with a small inscription on the left side. I wanted to read what it said, but couldn't make it out. The dream ended here since I can't recall anything else that I could narrate.
