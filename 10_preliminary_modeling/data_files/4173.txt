["Calling a friend for help."] I am trying to call Ernie to find out if his wife is at the University to help me Xerox my manuscripts. I can't find her. I am at a public pay phone. I am putting in coins, dimes, and they won't work. They keep coming back in the coin return slot. It is very frustrating. By now, I am sitting on the ledge the phone is on. I finally reach him. When I do, a large Mars bar pops into the coin return box as a reward. I get his answering machine. It goes for a long time and I patiently wait. Finally he comes on and I say About time!! We chat.
