I am approaching the door of our house ... although it seems a strangely short front door -- and I see a rodent dash inside the partially ajar opening. I dash after and am sure I can see him inside up and close to the ceiling. I run up steps and look back at sill above door. There is a squirrel crouched in fear. I look for a tool to kill him, and pick a 1/2" diameter steel bar with a point, sort of a star chisel. I jump for him and he lands on landing near front door (inside door), where I manage to pin him down with point of tool. But he twists head up to bite and I move away. Door opens and my daughter Nancy is looking out to see what goes on. I yell, "Stupid!" but the squirrel grabs the opportunity and runs inside where my wife is setting the table in dining room. Squirrel lands on a chair and crouches there -- a small, thin pathetic thing. (Dream ends abruptly.)
