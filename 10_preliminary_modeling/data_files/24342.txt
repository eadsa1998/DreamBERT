Wound up back on that first island. Things have digressed into chaos. This might have happened before the other things; I don't remember. There were people trying to take control. And there may have been foreign people, with much better technology, trying to take control of the island also. There were teams. My team was few in number, and not prepared. We didn't even know there would be such conflict. I made the best of the situation and acquired several weapons by theft or force from the other side. I wanted to resolve this without violence. My guns -- an assault rifle, sub machine gun, laser pistol and a .50 cal barrel -- looked intimidating. But I knew they were all very low on ammo. I had to use them to maximum effect. I told the bad guys, led by a witch like woman in a torn black dress and long black hair, that they should all back down -- I had firepower and could use it. I flashed the assault rifle, which shot laser type beams. She said she wasn't afraid and her people moved in. I said ok , that's it. I pulled out the big sniper rifle and began firing at them. I wanted to save the more affective assault rifle for when I might actually need it. I was hoping the much bigger and louder .50 cal sniper rifle would scare them off. It didn't. The bullets, white tracers showing the trajectory, zoomed all around them, under arms, between legs, over shoulders, as they ran toward me. They never did close, and I seemed to be getting away -- but then, from high above, more much more accurate shots rang out from a ledge high above. It was one of the more advanced people raining down bullets. I got out of the way and took cover behind a rock. There I found one of their advanced wet suits, which were the color of pink coral. I didn't know how it worked, but kept it for later. I tried to fire back with my pistol, but it was too inaccurate. I didn't know how to calibrate the scope on the big sniper rifle.
