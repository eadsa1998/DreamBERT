Mom was pregnant; sometimes she was at the start of the pregnancy, but sometimes at the end. The hospital was at school. Dmitri walked passed the window in Mom's room and Mom was looking and then she reckoned that I liked him. Calvin said that this scary lady was his mother, and I was like "No, it isn't!" and then she was like "Hey, Calvin!". I had left a message to everyone to tell Ezra about Mom and Eugene had gotten it first. Theodore was playing some game called Jacks and Randall. He was dressed as Jacks. There were aliens.
