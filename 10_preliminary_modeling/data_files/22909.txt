I was with a large group of people at a sort of party in someone's back yard.  We began to play soccer.  The back yard was so crowded with people that it was difficult to maneuver in the mob.  As I dribbled the ball, it took more effort than seemed natural for me to reach it with my foot every time I kicked it -- but even so, I had more success at it than anyone else, and was finally able to score a goal -- by kicking it against the backside of the house-if just barely.
