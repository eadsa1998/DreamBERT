I was going to some meeting with my parents, talking about some colored jelly stuff. Apparently I and both my parents were in Girl Scouts. I'm not sure what my father did, but I said to him, "Oh Daddy, you're so puerile."  Puerile is a word I don't recall encountering before, so I noted the particularity of it.  I saw it mentally written and knew there was an E next to the U in it.  I imagined from the context that it meant juvenile, and noted it to look it up when I woke up.  After the meeting, we went home.  We walked down the street and there was a big sign like the dragons at the mini-golf place.  It was colorful and impressive.  Once back at home, my boyfriend Jeremy's old online friend Starla was visiting.   Jeremy and I were going to stay in my brother Stuart's room, and Starla was going to stay in mine.  She was sick, though, from drinking, and tried to run to the bathroom to throw up.  Her vomit was orange, and it was everywhere.  Somehow she couldn't get to the toilet in time, but she managed to open my retainer case and vomit there.  I was disgusted and upset.
