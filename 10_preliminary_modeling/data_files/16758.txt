I remember repeated visits to a buffet. It has completely different foods every day I'm there. I'm in a mall store, where there are a lot of girls who are lesbians, or at least talking about having sex with each other, and they're all girls I know in real life. I'm looking around, very interested in some of the things they are selling. I have a bag with a book or something in it, and Frank tells me to get going. I tell him I didn't pay for everything yet, so he says, "Run!" and about three of us run out of the mall as fast as possible, and we're running through fields and everything, where the dream slowly fades, either to another dream, or to waking.
