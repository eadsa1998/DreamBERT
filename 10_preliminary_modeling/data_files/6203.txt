This dream occurred on December 7. The topic was a phone call I was going to make on December 20. One of my buddies from Maryland is getting married on December 19, in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Unfortunately, I cannot attend the wedding because I will be flying down to Miami the next day from Boston. My ticket is nonrefundable and to exchange it for different destinations (i.e., Washington D.C. or Virginia Beach) would have cost a fortune. Anyway, my friend called me up about four days ago wanting to know if I were going to attend. I explained to him the situation and let him know that there was a "gift" on the way. Furthermore, I let him know that I was going to call him on December 20 from Miami. The day had arrived. It was December 20 and I forgot to call him. I felt extremely guilty when he ended up calling me instead. I could sense the disappointment in his voice. Then I woke up!
