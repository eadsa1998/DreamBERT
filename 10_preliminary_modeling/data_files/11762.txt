I was at Nana's. She had this dragon thing. It turned into a girl after a while, who decided she liked me. I was then at a shop. Jayson and some people I don't know were all chasing each other. It was Sims like and relationships were going up. I hid somewhere and when I came out, everyone chased me. We went down in a ditch and I killed these two guys. The dragon girl, who was called Louise, said to some people that she had killed the guys, not me.
