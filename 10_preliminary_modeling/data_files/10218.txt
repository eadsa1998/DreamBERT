Long dream about returning to my Church in M. City. Father Andrew sits at a table at the right side of the altar studying his sermon; he is constantly being bothered by an old, somewhat senile woman; he is impatient as he brushes her away; then I see him walk about the parishioners, who sit in seats like in a theater and he comfort them; We have to WAIT for the liturgy to start; a young boy rides a tricycle very noisily around; I slap him on the cheek, he cries and rides off; Father Andrew looks at me very angrily, and I remember his hazel eyes blazing with anger; I am evasive and ashamed. Finally the Liturgy begins: we pass the Peace of the Lord by embracing each other like at the Retreat Center (we don't do it in our Church). There is much CONFUSION. As I look up at the ceiling I notice a huge mural of the HOLOCAUST -- graphic scenes of people tortured drowning (like a painting by Delacroix) -- I see Marissa Camden. she looks older and wears a white wig; short talk and embrace; then back on a train going where?
