This guy wanted to be a magician. It was me though. I was then playing this game, although it played out live. I was in a police station and I had to unlock this thing and hide behind a wall for a certain amount of time. I started unlocking it but then this guard came and I hid behind the wall. Every time I went to leave I did it too early. It would then reset. Then the magician guy's friend got blown up, but he thought it would reset, but it didn't. He was ok though. I was then outside a shop with Ezra and we were walking around to get somewhere. I saw Milo Ventimiglia and I hugged him and stole his car keys as this was part of a timeline (we were time traveling or something). He had a blue car.
