I was watching a horror movie set on a ship that was sinking or had some kind of issue. Some people had gone on it (I think it was a ghost ship to begin with), and there was a ghost on there killing them off. One of the characters was played by Karl Pilkington and he had hair. They were in a part of the boat that had filled with water and there was a little gap for air. As he went to get some air, the ghost filled it with water and caused him to drown. I was like 'you can't kill Karl Pilkington!'.
