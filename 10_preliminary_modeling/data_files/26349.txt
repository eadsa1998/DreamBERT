 I'm with a fat old man who is wearing blue overalls. He is stern, rigid, and abusive. His daughter is moving into our house. My housemate Stephen Ramos is there. I write out a check to the man for $240, and then it is $235. I write on the check: "Two Hundred Thirty Filthy [Five]". I'm concerned the man won't cash my check soon. I tell him this. Stephen just wants me to pay him: he is excited, and doesn't care about the financial aspects of this deal. I'm concerned with looking out for myself, and I tell Stephen to calm down. Then I tell the man to cash the check the next time he's at the bank. The man is unreliable, but I say this firmly and give him the check. Then that part of the deal is over, and I turn to the girl. I am happy and excited to have her living with us. I ask her if she wants to see her room and take a look around.
