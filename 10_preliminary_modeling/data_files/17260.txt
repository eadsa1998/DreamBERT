I dreamt my mother had cancer, so she was going in for surgery.  I wasn't given a chance to see her before she went in.  Later on I went back to visit her supposedly after the surgery.  But she wasn't there.  I searched a lot of places for her before I finally found out the doctors had done something wrong in the surgery and she died on the table.  I was left bawling, sad at the loss and angry at the doctors for screwing up, and very mad for not being able to see her.  I was treated horribly and nobody would tell me anything.
