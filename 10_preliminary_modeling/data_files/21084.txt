I was running operating the b and s and I fell asleep when I awoke. It was dark and I was alone. I walked along the tracks, felt my way till I got to the light switch, then I put on some lights. I wondered if I should stay because one should not stay long. I put on a light in the telephone booth which I didn't know of. Robin Hood came to me when I was half asleep. I was helping a lady to operate on Bob. The sharp knife cut so easy. I had nerve to do it.
