In a sort of basement, another man and I are combating a large industrial oven. Its grill is advancing toward us. We can see the blazing fire and embers inside it. The oven advances closer and closer. Finally, the other man grabs me. I say to them, "Get me away, boys." And they lift me out of danger, at the same time inspecting me for burns. My fingertips are burned to the bones; they glow like embers. Otherwise, I'm OK.
