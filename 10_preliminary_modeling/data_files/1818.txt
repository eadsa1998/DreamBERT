Ellie and I are at school and are visiting a friend at her house. The friend tells Ellie she's been taking advantage of her and is selfish. Ellie had asked for some food and stuff. So Ellie gathers up some toys and gives them to the friend's kids. The friend says, "Good, you needed to give up the toys anyway." I then see a pack of Lucky Strike cigs and ask for one to borrow. She says no. I then say "Ellie, why don't you go to the store and buy me some Salems?" Then the friend is packing to go to Europe. The TV cameras are here to get our reactions to her. I put on a scarf. And a woman says, "You look good, scarfed." I see that it is shaped like a veiled Arab woman's scarf and all you can see is your eyes. Then the scarf keeps slipping and becomes a piece of wet folded up newspaper I hold over my mouth. It's my turn to talk to the cameras. I had watched a quad man fall to the ground and tell a man he loved him only to discover he was talking to a brown paper sack with a wig in it. I go to the camera and say, "I first met ___ and I had to think hard to remember my friend's name Lisa, in class. I had my Masters in Counseling and she was getting hers." I said how much I loved her and her family (lots of siblings). I describe her huge house and the ramps and all her nice brothers and sisters.
