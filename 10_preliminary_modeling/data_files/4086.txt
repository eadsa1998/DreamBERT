["Fire!!"]  I am with a group of people who somehow time travel and drop into a battle. At the moment we drop in, we are making shooting noises. At that same moment the real soldiers are shooting. So we are not noticed. Now, I am watching as a  general (sort of Sean Connery) is sleeping in his tent. The enemy sneak up and light small fires in the corners of the tent. The fires smolder. The general doesn't notice. A woman and a man come to the tent and see the fires. They want to warn the general so he can escape with his life. But instead, the woman, in an attempt to help the General, pour gasoline on the fires to get them to flame up big. Her thinking is to make the situation so bad that the General will notice the danger and escape. He does escape.
