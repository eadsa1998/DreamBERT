I was at church listening to a slender woman preacher. I thought it was strange she should be preaching on Gilkey's last Sunday. She suddenly quit and left the pulpit. And an officious dressed woman followed her out. Something about sunstroke. The church seemed wrong, Like that in Ningpo and I wondered why they had changed the pulpit from the center to the side.
