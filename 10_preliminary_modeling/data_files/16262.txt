I was at the aquarium, and I was kind of going up and down in this elevator and we were walking along these hallways and there were fish tanks on either side. And I had the notion that they were going to serve us lunch and I had to get down there in time for lunch, but the elevator was doing some crazy stuff. And we stopped at one of these floors where they had this like little sitting area, and I dreamt that we were, then all of a sudden, juxtaposed, I was at home with the monitor reading this children's book that was like a variation of Little Mermaid. I keep having dreams about the Little Mermaid having slightly different details to the story, like this time I dreamt that instead of Eric being saved from drowning, for some reason Ariel needed CPR, and in order to break Ursula's spell, instead of kissing her, Eric had to give her two breaths of human breathing so Ariel could stay a human forever instead of a kid. Now that was rats, man! [laugh]
