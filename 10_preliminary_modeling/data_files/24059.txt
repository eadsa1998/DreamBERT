I'm in some strange mall with Joey and Shawn and we're looking at sweatshirts that are on sale. They're like Hurley and Vulcan and others and weird clothes too. Then Shawn says, "Let's go surfing," so all the sudden we have our wet suits on and our long boards and we're walking through the mall to the center of the mall, and now we're standing waiting for something to happen. With a rumble a huge tidal wave crashes through the mall. I miss it, but Shawn and not Joey, but Kyle get it, and when the next wave comes, this time I do catch it and start riding through the mall. I get hung up on a wall, but somehow keep momentum. When I reach the big room where I was trying on sweatshirts, I go airborne and fly high into the air. As I fall down, I grab onto a structure and don't land hard. Then I see all the "regulars" that most surf this mall all the time, and they seem unimpressed, like it was lame of me to fly through the air like I did. I'm just like, "Whatever!" and then I wake up.
