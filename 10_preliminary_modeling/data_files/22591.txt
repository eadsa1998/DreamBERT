I dreamt that I was in the school yard with a friend of mine. In the yard everything was the same, that is, the same way it was three years ago when I left, with the plants and the flowers. But there were signs on blackboards referring to the wedding of one of our classmates -- I don't remember well what it said, but I found it funny and laughed. Then I saw that a girl was approaching us and telling us to read the announcements, but this girl surprised me because she did not belong in the school but rather in the university which I am now attending where she is a librarian.
