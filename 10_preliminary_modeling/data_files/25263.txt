 I'm at a funeral for my friend Mark Long. As I leave, I shake my friend Gino Teavor's hand, and we grab each other's forearms. Then he hugs me, in his grief. He is wearing a big fluffy winter jacket. I ask Gino if he wants to go and visit the Longs sometime over break, since we have a 12 or 14-day break for Christmas. He says no, he can't handle it. <br/
