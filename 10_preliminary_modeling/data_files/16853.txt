It's my friend Reece's wedding. I'm at the location, but they are still getting ready. The preparations are going well. They are planning an outdoor wedding, and they have an unusual and quite beautiful landscaped garden for the ceremony. It includes a small moat with a garden in the middle and overhanging clipped trees and hedges which they plan to stand under to say their vows, and beds of unusual exotic flowers and shrubs. In my dream Reece is going to marry his ex-girlfriend rather than his real life fiance.
