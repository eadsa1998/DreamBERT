It is a repetitive dream I've had since I was small. I'm in my backyard. The way it is set up is there is my house then a small hill leading down to a large area of land. I'm in the large area playing around and my mom comes running out, saying there is a tornado coming. Then all of a sudden a tornado appears. My mom says I have to clean up the backyard before I can come in (there are toys and balls everywhere). I start cleaning up and the tornado hits. I try running up the hill to go inside but I can't make it up the hill. I try to run up the hill but I can't. I like freeze but I'm trying to run.
