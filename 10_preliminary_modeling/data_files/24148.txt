I was on vacation during spring breaks, this is true, and I had just returned to Santa Cruz. There was a guy that I was seeing/dating before I went on vacation and during vacation I had mixed feelings about whether or not to continue this relationship. In my dream I was in a friend's car (I'm not sure which car or with what friend) and we went to a beach. This beach is unfamiliar to me. At the beach, parked next to us, was Sam (age 25), the guy I had been dating, and his car. We had my dog in the back of his truck. This is normal since he often takes my dog to the beach. It was unpleasant/awkward since I hadn't told him I was back from vacation yet. That's all I remember.
