I am at a school. A square cloth on the ground is my room. I am picking up the clothes and folding them to clean and organize them. The rival school come and tell us we are being poisoned by our water. An animal died in the water pipes and is rotting in there. We need to clean the water. A man asks us if we have a safety person. We say we don't. He is shocked and concerned. We agree finally we will get one to protect the children. Two children are to be in a boxing match and they are prevailed upon to rinse their hands in clean water before they fight. We finally understand this is important for our health and comply.
