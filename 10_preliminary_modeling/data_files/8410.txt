I was married and living along a river. My husband had gone horseback riding in the river. I think there was bad weather coming so myself and some others went after him to tell him that he needed to come home. When we went to get him we were walking through the river as well. I was wearing a thong bikini, which of course I would never do in waking life, especially not at my current weight. The people that were with me had brought horses along. Oh. He wasn't on horseback. When we found him the people that were with me gave he and I both a horse to ride home. They didn't have saddles so we had to ride bareback. Mine was a beige color horse. I climbed on and was having a bit of trouble getting situated because it was very uncomfortable since there wasn't a saddle and I was wearing a thong. The horses did all have a bridle and harness so we could hold on to the reins. We started down the river and I was surprised at how comfortable I was riding this horse and that I wasn't having any trouble at all. The horse seemed to naturally follow the other horses. We started riding them through the river to the house.
