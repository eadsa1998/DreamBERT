I'm standing in an open field. It's the safest place. No trees can fall on me, etc. There are many space crafts in the air. We are launching a car at the moon. A large rectangular craft throws the car. It is difficult. I watch the car slowly lumber toward the moon. I hope it is successful. 3 men escort me to a "safer" place. I protest. I was in the safest place and I want to return. One of the men (a friend), tells me about his father having a heart attack last night and I feel badly. I tell him that it wasn't his fault. I go back to the center of the field and stand. I see a huge Japanese ship coming close. Then I see many small round space crafts. One comes right over me and hovers over my head. I feel nervous and protest, "This as an invasion of privacy." It reads what's in my mind!
