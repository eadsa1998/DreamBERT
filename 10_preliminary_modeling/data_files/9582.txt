About Dr. Smith. Go up in elevator to his office on 3rd floor to office which he shares with others and his wife as well as his children. He looks like Dr. Clark (my doctor). Dr. Smith is rude to me and calls me "wolf." He implies I am still as I was in B. City; then he is hungry and I cook some hamburger for him, then he eats and says goodbye to his wife. The analytic hour starts: I say I am desperate and want to get at the bottom of things. Tell him how difficult it is for me to cook. "The best is not good enough." Then we walk into another room and I talk about cleaning. How I don't know how to do it right... and want to change. Then he undresses completely and asks me to undress; he is stocky, very hairy (hair on legs and back?) He sprays me with perfume. I am embarrassed and ashamed, but instead of embracing him, I make a long pirouette (toe dance) which really impresses him. He asks, "Are you really the beloved?" I say "Yes." He lets me go home and I embrace Frank--very, very warm glow of love.
