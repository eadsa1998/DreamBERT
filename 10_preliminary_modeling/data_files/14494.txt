I was in a shop. I can't remember properly, but the Janitor (Scrubs) had this grape like thing and I had to plant them (it was like in the game, Wandering Willows). There was another plant too. Some didn't work out though. Oz and Willow (both from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were there. Some of the plants started working and she was getting hopeful.
