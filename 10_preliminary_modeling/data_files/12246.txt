I went to the movies with Dad, Calvin and Ryan Cartwright or Daryl. Dad ended up being replaced with someone. We couldn't find the movie we wanted to see (which was called Dynasty Digger). I was thinking back to a previous time when we went with Jayson and Ezra. Ryan or Daryl and I were making out and messing around. We went to KFC. Later, we went to a McDonald's and Dad was making out with some really ugly new girl. We were eating, and some girl didn't want meat. I was playing this annoying Mario game.
