I had a dream and I had a dog. It was a sheep dog and she was brown. And we were on a farm, and we always played together and stuff like that. And then one day, because we lived right next to a railroad, and then one day she ran away on the railroad track, so we went to find her. And we found her, and then I went in a spaceship with her and we flew away, but we ended up in a pool in a spy's office and we became his spy, so we worked for him. And we had to write stuff and my dog, she sniffed out like the person who's behind crime and stuff, and that's really it.
