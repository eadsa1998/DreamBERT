I was guest in the hotel where I worked this summer as a waitress in Lake Placid. My parents were also there. We were seated at a table with one of the guests I waited on last year. His name in my dream was Mr. Bernstein, but afterwards I remembered his name really was Mr. Saferstein. I wanted to stay in Lake Placid, but I knew I had to go back for graduation. Then I felt like crying. I looked for more people I knew and saw three friends from Montreal, who had offended my parents and therefore we do not hear from them any more (really). I wanted to talk to them very badly. Afterwards outside I saw one of my parents with them. I don't remember which parent it was. I waited for them to come up the steps to the terrace, but they got into their car and drove away. My parents then told me they were going back to Canada. I was very disturbed because I had wanted to talk to them.
