["Pancakes and poop."] I am in a big group RV traveling with this man and a woman who travel with groups of people. I am seated on a portapot toilet on a counter top of the kitchen area of the RV. I have several bowel movements as I am chatting with the man and while the woman is cooking pancakes right next to where I sit on the counter. I feel embarrassed hoping I am not noisy or stinky, but in general am OK about this situation. I wipe myself being careful not to expose myself as I do. And get up, closing the lid on the toilet. Then the woman says she is going to serve the pancakes now to the group waiting outside. She asks me to continue cooking more pancakes. I say yes and pick up the spatula. I turn the pancakes over, having fun doing it with flair. The man chuckles and enjoys how well I flip the pancakes.
