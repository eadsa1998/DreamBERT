Many people were at a house. In the dream it was our house, although there was no similarity to our real home, except perhaps the yard. Again my horse Tom enters the picture. I had left him tied outside in the yard and went in the house for something. Looking out of the window, I saw to my horror a young girl on Tom riding down this yard with 2 adults a man and a woman who had evidently given her permission to ride him. I was furious when I saw her on him (I never permitted many people to ride him as most people don't who use their horses for show, due to the fact that their way of going can be spoiled for the person showing). I believe I was a bit jealous too. These 3 people were running the horse very fast down a hill. My shouts to them to stop were useless. Struggling fiercely, I tried in vain to get outside, but people held me back. I hit at people and cursed them, but both blows and words were also useless. I remember one elderly lady seemed to be very shocked at my vulgar actions. She couldn't seem to understand my feelings to the circumstances involved. Directly outside the window was a tall steep wall, evidently the banking to a lawn. The wall must have been 12 ft. high and over the top I saw my horse plummeting downward. I was terribly upset, but still my struggles to get to him were futile, although no person was actually holding me back. Tom didn't seem to be hurt too badly, but someone evidently thought he was in misery and shot him. I was terribly hurt, depressed and sad.
