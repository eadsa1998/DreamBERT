Mary is "doing" her hair. She had let it down and is busy putting it up again. In the process, her arms tire and she gets "fed up." And just as I remembered her, she makes a remark that describes her frustration. She stops working on her hair and rests awhile. Then she continues again. She takes several more rest stops before completing the styling to her satisfaction. We are in an extremely large, rambly, old, dark house. It is not well furnished. We are hurrying to go somewhere -- to a funeral(?) We had to be there at 5:45 p.m. and it is already 6:00 p.m. We are late. Another scene in this dream shows Mary and I searching through the house, looking for our clothing. As well, we are worried about Robert. He's just a little boy and is missing. We can't leave the house until we find him. Suddenly Robert appears as a grown man, as he is today. He comes over to me, smiles, lays his hand on my arm and assures us that he's OK.
