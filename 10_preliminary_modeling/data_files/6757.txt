I was at Tanner's. When ready to leave over her protests. I started out one door, down a wide wooden bridge with no rails but at the other end was a group apparently in conference in a glassed in lanai that blocked my way. I returned and asked for another route. She told me to go out the other door, turn left and to a bus stop. While I gathered up Thursday's paper and separated it from theirs which had colored comics, I decided I need not take one page of mine since it contained my work out crossword. Austin said the bus stop was now at Keeaumoku and fifth so I started walking along some distance.
