[1997-06-25] I was on some sort of trip with Willie, my seeing eye dog, and I was in a truck and in the back of a truck. The truck stopped, on the side of the road and then all of a sudden this big, fat bear came up and tried to attack Willie and Willie just whined and I was trying to pull them apart and the bear would let go and Willie would be all happy and then the bear would grab him again.
