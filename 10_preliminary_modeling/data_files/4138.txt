I am entering a store that is similar to a cement parking garage. I am there to choose a free gift. Before I can find the gift, a huge wave of water floods the entire area and I am walking down an incline. I realize I am in danger and turn to walk back up before I drown. I struggle, holding on to a curb to guide my way. I see a white water wave coming at me. I grab a plant from under the water and get out of the store. Now I am walking to find my van. I see it is parked safely up on a hill. But the way to it is cut off with a swelling river in a canyon. I will have to wait before continuing my journey. I think Ginny is there now.
