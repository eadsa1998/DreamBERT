I am at the airport; I see the plane move through to the waiting room, breaking dishes and turning over tables. But the plane is back outside; There is a very dark,ominous sky -- a big storm is approaching; I am afraid.== Later in a boat, I see a huge sea wall moving from right to left; I feel the impact on the boat; scared....
