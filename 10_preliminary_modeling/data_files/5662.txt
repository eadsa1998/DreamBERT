[1997-07-13] I was back at Guiding Dogs again although Sammy was still alive, she just couldn't guide anymore. I don't know if she couldn't or wouldn't because she was just tired of it and so I was getting a new dog. They gave me this huge dog, I think the person said it was a "Masty" dog, but I believe the correct word is a Mastiff. It was a huge dog and I was disappointed because I didn't want a huge dog, they're hard when you take them on buses and things. I told the instructor. "I really don't want that kind of dog." And they said "Okay, we'll give you another one." And they happened to have another like Sammy, another Chocolate Lab. I remember training with the dog and then coming home and then I introduced Sammy to the dog and they were friends and I woke up.
