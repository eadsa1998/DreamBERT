We are driving with some counselors from camp quite fast; we come to a curve in the road and a NARROW place. I see the trees in all their FALL COLORS; my heart goes "thump" "Not already, it is still summer!" It feels like a premonition of death. I ask "Where are we?" One of the counselors replies: "This is CRYSTAL CITY."
