There's a battle. Initially it's between me and a group of people in the park and it's light-hearted but growing more heated - like an over competitive game of trying to hit each other with a frisbee. Actually, I'm not trying to hit anyone - just trying to avoid being hit. Then it gets nasty and more surreal. The opponents become 'monsters' - kind of sci-fi creatures, part animal, part machine. The attacks become viscous and violent: parts of my body are cut off in the process. At this point I came 'out' of my body and was able to watch the action from outside. My body was now unconnected to me, so I couldn't feel the pain of the physical injuries. It was as if my body was now a game character, and I could cheer on from the sidelines. Eventually, my body is reduced to just half a skull and a limbless torso. Somehow my brain survives, and I manage to grow back arms. With some strategic help from the 'real' me, I pick off the attackers one by one, and against all the odds, I regrow my body slowly. By the end of a viscous and successful counter-attack I have killed all the attackers and regained a complete head (but heavily bandaged) and a full upper body.
