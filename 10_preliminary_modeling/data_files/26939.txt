 I seem to be descending from floor to floor of a building. I go from the upper floor to the middle floor. Here, a group is singing songs. My friend Nat Miller is there singing. We move to the next floor down. Cookies and snack items have been placed out, but now there are just leftovers. They were set out earlier and have not been replenished. I walk over and grab a few of the cookies. Jordan Clemens and Jim Ryan, two psychology professors from Brimson, are there.
