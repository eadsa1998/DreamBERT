I was suppose to meet Mary at the airport. We had a trip to go on together. I was waiting for Mary outside, playing in the fountain. There were 2 ostriches. A girl ostrich and a boy ostrich. The girl ostrich was running down the hill to jump in(to) the lake. Then she ran by me; I reached and yanked out 2 ostrich plumes. When the ostrich feathers ???, I looked and saw that the 2 feathers I'd yanked out were not feathers. They were fishing poles. ??? I showed the ostrich beautiful long plumes and she said, "Those aren't mine. Those are fishing poles. They grow on boy ostriches." I said, "But I pulled them off of your back." I remembered Mary was waiting for me and I said to Mary, "How long till take off?" She said, "20 minutes." I said, "Oh, I've got to go home and pack." Dora and I had to go to the bathroom. We went to Kentucky Fried Chicken's bathroom. In line Dora was raving about what a great meal powdered doughnuts and milk were. "But don't ever mix Jello powder and Cool Whip," Dora said.
