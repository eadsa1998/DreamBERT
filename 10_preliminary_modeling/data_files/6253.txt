I dreamed of being at a social function with a lot of my relatives. I don't know where the location was but I know that it was unfamiliar to me, but in my dream it was familiar. My relatives, whom I very rarely have a chance to see because they live in different parts of the country, were all having a really good time. The location seemed to be at a dinner type function in the dining room of a large cruise ship. Everyone was eating from a large buffet and were drinking cocktails.
