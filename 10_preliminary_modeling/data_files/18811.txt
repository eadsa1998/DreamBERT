The first part of the dream I can remember started in a monstrous hunting lodge which, for some reason, had live deer walking around. This did not seem to excite me or the others who were there (all male and only one I knew in real life, a man I used to hunt with). The deer were mostly doe, but there were a few bucks. Only spike horns, however. Later, I went outside and saw two hunters and told them about the deer. Then a doe came out, and one of the hunters shot it, but only I could see this since it went behind a tree right after he shot. I heard him say, "I missed," and then the next thing I knew, he had hit me in the ankle, but only with a couple pieces of buckshot. I went to a hunting store to get a first aid kit, but ran into a Spanish-speaking saleslady that couldn't understand me. Finally, I got the kit and fixed myself up. I really have no idea what this means. All I can say is that I used to love deer hunting in Vermont, but I never got one. The only time I ever fired the gun was at a spike horn buck--and I was afraid it might be a doe ($300 fine). The Spanish saleslady is most likely a result of all the Cubans I have been trying to sell to lately. [I'm a Fuller Brush man.] An interesting sideline--I remember trying to think of what I was dreaming all through the night--but in my sleep.
