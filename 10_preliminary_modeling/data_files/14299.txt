I was watching Torchwood. Their hideout looked like an office building. They had two females at a desk at the front to watch who came in. Two people came but they were invisible to them. At one point, Jack thought he saw someone but they made themselves invisible again before he got another look and he shrugged it off. Rhys looked a bit different and was less chubby. Gwen was cheating on him with someone. There was a dark room thing there and I can't remember what happened properly but Tosh went in and the invisible people were there to get rid of her. I think Ianto had a boyfriend and also liked to wear women's clothes?
