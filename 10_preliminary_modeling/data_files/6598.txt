I find myself covered with small grassy plants. In folds of flesh on my thigh, I find and draw out a long bark-covered stick about two inches in diameter and one foot long. Then I root out one of the grasses growing out of me and say to someone, "I wonder why so many varieties of grass grow on one person."
