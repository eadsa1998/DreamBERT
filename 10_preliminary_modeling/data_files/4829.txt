["Curly headed."] I am riding a very powerful frisky horse down a very crowded street. A parade is forming. Now I am returning against the traffic. It is exhilarating to keep the horse in check from all the stimulus going on. My hair is permed in lots of soft ringlet curls. It sticks out all over like an Afro. I am looking for curlers to help smooth the curls down a bit. I find a few small ones, but can't find the rest of them.
