I was in Penner's house. He was asleep. The water was turned on and at a distance I could see the water spraying out of the windows and Penner was outside looking at us. He had a shop of handscrew machines and all the White boys were working for him. I came late to work and was changing my clothes. My bare rear end was exposed and the girls could see me if they looked. A fellow told me, "Will you go back to White's when they settle in their new place?" Han Sergert told the boss, "Why don't you burr the pieces first, then thread them?" but he didn't pay any attention to Hank.
