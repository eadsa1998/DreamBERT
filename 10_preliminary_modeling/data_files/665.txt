I am in the town next to my hometown and I am standing on the corner of First street complaining to Laura, a co- worker, about ny nose. She says I should have done something about it when I was growing up. She says she had scoliosis and wore a brace. I have to blow my nose and don't want to do it there. I get on my bike to ride back to a park on the Rice Lake Road. I ride all the way through this town and into the next town and suddenly I am in an alley full of junk and I have to turn around and come back. As I come out of the alley I see a well dressed woman comforting a small child who has fallen. She appears to be home on her lunch hour.
