I was sitting in someone's home in the living room. Nothing was familiar. There were about eight men and women there, none of whom I recognized with the exception of a girl I know about 23 years of age. We were all sitting watching home movies when suddenly this girl pulled out a pistol and shot one of the middle-aged people in the center of the forehead. Everyone was surprised but they did not know who had committed the crime. The dream then ended.
