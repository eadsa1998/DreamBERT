I am taking the wet clothes off a baby. She is lying on a bed and is a mess. I look for a clean shirt and find several. I choose one that's lacy and pretty, but hard to get on her. We struggle getting her hand in the arm and finally succeed. Then I take off her messy diaper and clean her up. She shits when I don't have a diaper on her. I clean that up, shuddering. Now my mother says, "Give the baby to me and you count all this money on my bed." I see piles and piles of coins (change). Most of them are foreign currency. What a tiring task. I say, "I'd rather hold the baby. I haven't had a chance to." She says, "Later, you can do it later." I sigh and start working on the money. Then I'm helping a woman pack. There are lots of snap shots laid out on the bed, some of Willie, some of her lover. I am concerned that her husband will come in and find out! I try to gather them up. Then I must hurry and I choose the shoes to pack, discarding several "Baby Jane" shoes for little girls. [BL]
