Eliza and I were working with developmentally disabled kids. Eliza was sitting at a table with 3 kids doing arts and crafts. I sat down at the table with them and started talking with Bob (a kid I used to work with in real life). Bob was happy to have my attention, but he seemed to be doing fine without me. I figured Eliza had it under control, so I decided to go work with a kid who needed my attention more. I found an autistic girl from a place I used to work sitting on the floor in a corner by herself. I was never good at working with the autistic clients, but I was determined to reach this girl. I felt like I was finally breaking through. She was talking with me and laughing. We were doing her laundry and I couldn't figure out how to get the washing machine to work. The girl came over and showed me how. I said, "Wow, you're so smart. You know how to do this and I couldn't figure the thing out." She giggled with delight. She then pulled her pants down and started masturbating. Then she tried to pull me close to her. I pushed her away, but I felt bad because I didn't want to hurt her feelings. I said teasingly, "Stop that. Come on, you're going to get me in trouble. I'm a staff you know."
