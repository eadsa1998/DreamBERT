Last night I had a dream that I was boarding at a different school. There were kids from my Spain program and my high school there, and I think it was summer. Anthony visited me, and he was wearing a maroon college sweatshirt. Sue also had a boyfriend over. I asked Anthony to come sleep with me, but he refused because he had a paper to write. So this drove me a little crazy and I went to bed angry. And no he did not crawl into bed with me later; he had left the next morning without saying good-bye! I was really mad.
