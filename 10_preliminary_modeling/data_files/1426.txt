I was in the woods, sort of hibernating. Ginny and Ernie came by. I picked up my money and noticed it was square and odd shapes. New money. I pulled up my tent stakes and packed. We went to a house. A "tyador" walked by out front. Ginny and Ernie built a huge, hot fire in the living room for me and 2 outside in the back yard for them. I suggested turning on the heat, but they said the fires were better.
