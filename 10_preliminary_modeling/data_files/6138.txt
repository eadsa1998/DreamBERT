I dreamt that I went out with my friend to a local bar where I usually hang out with my boyfriend. We were there and he showed up later. He was acting like he didn't know who I was. It began to bother me a little but then I chose to ignore him. Later on in the evening I started to walk by him on my way to the ladies' room. When he winked at me, I proceeded on my way and was a bit confused by all this. So from there I decided to go over and talk to him. I walked out of the ladies' room and all the way over to the bar to confront him. He turned around and said really loudly that the chick won't leave him alone tonight. I said, "Oh, really," and gave him a very dirty look when he said that the only girl here that can bother him is me [illegible]
