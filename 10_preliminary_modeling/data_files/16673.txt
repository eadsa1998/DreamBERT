it was Mom's birthday, and we were going to go to a museum or some kind of an art festival and we were riding two school buses _____________________. _________________________ We walked in this ________ and we caught a bus _________________ ___________ _________________. And I remember this one place where we went in a building and we had to go up an elevator to the bus station, up on a platform like a ramp sort of. And it's kind of where all the buses were stored, and it had nice brick ______________. And I remember when we were at this point, when we were on the elevator, we kind of lost Dad. So in the beginning we had all three of us, and then when we got to the bus station we were like running because we were afraid we were going to miss the bus, and we got in the elevator and Dad was still back in ______________. And I don't think we ever really caught up. Mom was, and then we got to the bus and Mom was kind of diddling around, and I was walking around and I was saying, "Ho, ____________ bus 19." And one of the drivers said, "Oh, that's me." And she came over to me and offered her arm, and I saw that there was nobody really on the bus when we got there. And I said, "Well, I don't really have to get on yet. I just wanted to make sure I could find you and not miss you." And she said, "Well, _______________ yet." Okay, _______________________. So we, Mom and me and this driver walked around for a little bit, and then I don't know if we ever got on the bus or not, but next thing I knew, we were in some kind of beauty shop and I can't remember, Mom was trying on clothes and I was trying on clothes. And I think we got our _________ or something. And the last thing about this dream is instead of riding the bus, I was in the park kind of walking some of the time, and some of the time I was sitting on this little raft with wheels, if you can believe it, pushing with my hands to get some momentum going, and then you're just rolling for a while. That was weird. I think I had this dream because yesterday I forgot to set up my cab for work, and in the morning I took a cash cab, and in the afternoon I called Keith from behind us and he didn't answer his cell phone, so I called the company again and ordered another cash cab, and waited for like an hour and the cab never came. There was one point when I saw the cab, I could have sworn I saw a cab go by in the parking lot, but before I could yell or get up or anything, he was gone from view, just like that. And so at that point, I thought, "Well, he must have come around but was too stupid to see me waiting over here, and he didn't even come over here." So then I called Keith again and that's when he answered his cell phone and I got to go home with him. And I heard buses going by, and I thought, "Well, gee, I wonder if I could just go on the bus and go home." And then I figured, "Well, that wasn't such a good idea because I don't know where that bus is going. And I was thinking about how with a cab you just tell them what you want, easy to use and reliable, while riding the buses would not be fun.
