["Robert Redford and the priest."] I am enacting a scene in a play over and over. Now I see Robert Redford sitting. He smiles and asks for a kiss. I think a kiss would be fun. I walk over to him and sit in his lap. We have a long sexy kiss. I get back up. Robert indicates he'd like to meet me later for more. I agree. Even though he is married. Later I am talking with a priest. He makes some cliche statement from the doctrine of the church. I say to him as an aside (while the entire congregation listens in), isn't that superstitious? Not even faith, or mythology, but flat out superstition. He agrees, a bit embarrassed. Even the congregation nods their heads in agreement. The priest has an idea. He wants us to act out or pursue an idea. But he knows it will mean I can't meet with Robert later. He feels bad for me as he knows I am looking forward to it. I wish I could be with Robert, but I also am interested in pursuing this idea. I follow the priest.
