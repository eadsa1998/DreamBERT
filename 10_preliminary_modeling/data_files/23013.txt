I was returning from somewhere with a footlocker full of clothes in my car.  As I neared home, I met Mary Gardinier and some fellow going the opposite way in a little green sports car like a Sprite or Triumph.  She was driving.  We both stopped and had a short conversation as I was trying to stuff clothes back in the trunk, which I couldn't get to shut.  They never got out of their car.  When I got to our neighborhood, which was single-family houses, I noticed Mr. Kramer (the tenant below our apartment, who just moved out) in front of the house next door, along with a couple of other men.  They were red-faced and extremely agitated, jumping up and down, shouting, gesticulating at me, and waving boards.  When I stopped, just beyond them, they came rushing up and started flailing at me with boards, some of which contained nails.  I was really mad and almost hit Kramer with a big rock or piece of metal nearby, but I was afraid I would kill him, so I just tried to fend off the blows.  He finally revealed that five dead bodies had been found in my apartment, or our building, and I guess he suspected me.  My immediate thought was for my wife Bonita and my daughter Christina.  I ran into the building screaming and crying, going from room to room.  The rooms were empty except for big piles of used kitty litter in each room.  Beth Hooper was there.  There were no dead bodies, but I was very upset at not finding Bonita and Christina.  To my great relief, I finally found Christina walking around-naked--but I never did find Bonita.
