My dad was moving to Canada. He was going to move earlier in the year, but since we got our dog, he couldn't afford to go. Since my parents are divorced, I was only going to see him in the summer. I remember that the house was on a really big hill. And the house was gigantic. Also my dog kept acting weird. I don't remember what he was doing.
