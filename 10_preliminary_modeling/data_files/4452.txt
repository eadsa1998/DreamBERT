["Actors create a dinner play."] There is a dinner evening where actors play the roles and the dinner guests interact with them. The scene is an old war hospital. Some actors are lying in hospital beds on a big ward, moaning from their "wounds." Women in evening dress wander through and chat with them. Then some of the women actors are lying in a large open refrigerated box with their heads lying on the ice cubes spread out. It helps them have permanent curls in their hair. Seems uncomfortable, but they are happily chatting with each other. One woman in a lovely evening dress comes up to the woman owner of this place and says that in regular life, she can't meet men who she likes. She doesn't expect it to be any different here. I watch out the window as she, another woman and a man are climbing up a large rock. They are in long 1920's evening gowns. The woman and the man seem to be liking each other. They are attracted. The other woman is walking with a large furry black and white spotted cat in her arms. It is a pleasant scene. The woman owner is happy the two people met and are going to fall in love.
