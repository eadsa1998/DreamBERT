It was again a dream on the Bahama island of Andros. This time, though, it was a quasi-race, like the gumball rally, only on foot. It began like a 5k run. I began at the head of the pack, and challenged myself to stay that way. I always start that way. I have no patience. But because of the technical nature of the course, my head kept in the game. It was over streams and things, then it took a right turn. We went up a tree and into an abandoned mining house, like the kind at Disney world. We went across a synthetic board linking the roof to a rail system that had palm frond particleboard instead of ties. They did things that way here. The linking bridge -- I was certain the course organizers put them there -- they looked too new and custom-made, like tar-paper-covered boards on a mountain bike trail. Eventually, things began to get mythical. We needed to get onto the roof of an old woman's house -she had the ancient aura of Amelia Marshal, but she baked goods instead of made baskets. There was one runner guy who had lead the pack. I was behind him for most of the way, but still up at the front. When we got to the dead-end house part -- we didn't want to disturb her from sleeping. We had to get permission to go through. So we had to wait until she woke up. But I got a better idea. There was a tree next to her house and one in the yard. They had long branches. I climbed and pulled down one branch. Another competitor jumped for it. Grabbed it, and made it to the roof. Another did the same for me, but it was really far -- and I was in a different place. It was a skinny branch, and there was a chance of it breaking. Instead, I went inside and asked her nicely. She baked me a pastry. I ate it, but then things changed.
