["Getting taken care of!."] I am staying at a hotel, perhaps some convention. Jim E. writes me a note, asking me to have lunch with him, or to go to a dance. I want to change my clothes. I am very contented with the special luxury service at this hotel. I paid a $15 charge and they will do anything for me at any time. I love it I laze by the pool and then call them up and they meet me at my room to help me choose what to wear for my date. The woman who is helping me is Terry, my past personal assistant who says this service is nearly at an end and If I want her to continue I will pay her $7 an hour. I don't want to have to pay so much but I'd gotten quite used to enjoying this extra service. I look forward to the several hours in the morning when I am giving her instructions and she is doing the work. I'll probably spring for the money because I like the pampered feeling I have when she does it for me.
