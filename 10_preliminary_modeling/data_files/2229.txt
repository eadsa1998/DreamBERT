I'm in a movie on a huge floating dock. It's a small part and I'm almost through, kind of routine stuff. Suddenly a huge whale breezes through and I am catapulted around and thrown into the water with the whale. He wants to play. He likes me, but I am terrified because I don't know if he's going to eat me or accidentally drown me or what. The water is nearly black and dark. I slide under and am afraid, and then I find a place to crawl back up on the dock. Someone else is out in the water and I am relieved to be "safe." The whale seems to want only me. He has a crush on me.
