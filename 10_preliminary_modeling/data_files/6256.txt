I dreamed I was in a mobile home in Florida. It was my grandmother's, who lives there now, but I don't remember her living there at the time. It was just me. I didn't fit in in the neighborhood at all because it was in a trailer park with all senior citizen residents. My presence was causing a stir among the residents. I remember doing a lot of water skiing and people looking at me coming home to the trailer with my equipment and not being happy with me at all.
