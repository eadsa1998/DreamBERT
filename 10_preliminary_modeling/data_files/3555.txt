I am working for a company where you play water sport games and that lets the officers know who to promote and who will be good leaders and workers. I play good and hard. I am approved. Now we go into a buffet where the food choices are endless and bountiful. I am filling my plate with breads and pretzels and I'm looking over the vegetable tray but I don't choose anything. I wonder how I'll be able to eat all this food. I seem to choose only the things I usually eat.
