I was staying with my boyfriend Jeremy and his mother. His 'mother' was a blonde-haired single mother of a 3-year old girl.  The little girl was sitting eating, and she said she wanted ice cream.  She asked if she had to sit at the counter for it, and I asked her if she could be clean enough to eat it where she was.  She said no, and I told her I was sorry but then she couldn't stay where she was to eat it, and thanked her for being truthful.  I asked her if she could have Cheerios instead, and she said okay- but I remembered I was at her house, not mine.  I went through the cabinets looking for some.  I was surprised at how much junk food there was.  Crackers and chips and pretzels and cookies..I couldn't find anything reasonably healthy.  I thought about what a bad mother this woman was, and thought no wonder Jeremy had problems growing up.  The woman sort of disappeared.  Out the window was the side of a mountain with a small stream running down it.  I saw a squirrel with something riding on its back- for some reason I associated with the squirrel and when told the scene to Jeremy, said it was on my back.  The place was very dark and dingy.  For some reason Jeremy and I went downstairs to the basement to get something.  It was supposed to join with the neighbor's apartment, but Jeremy told me not to worry because there was a screen separating the areas.  I was naked and fortunately holding a pillow in front of me, because the screen was pushed off to the side, and a woman was standing there doing laundry.  We said hello briefly and fortunately the woman and the man who had come in left.  Jeremy and I picked up whatever it was we had come down for...an old leather envelope, I think.  I opened it and there was an old piece of paper- a really old cashier's check for 240 billion dollars.
