I'm a prisoner. I'm chained in a line with others. Our chains are a large slice of whole wheat bread. We are encased in it and have to eat a hole out of it to breathe and see where we're going. Together we all make up a loaf of bread. We walk around. I can only see a little bit so I have to be very quick and good at staying on my feet and moving around obstacles. If I fall, then I'll just be dragged around by the others, most painful. The British guard sees how well I'm doing. He calls me "Andrew" and puts me at the head of the line. I am challenged and want to show how good I am at this. I call out orders to the others and in precision, we go up and down stairs and duck obstacles. Later, I'm walking in a park (free of bread). I see Sylvester the Cat. I call to him. He is nervous. He comes over to be petted and then goes on his way. I walk on. I look for a bathroom.  I find one. The door isn't there so I get a poster, and write a message to Howard and tape it to cover the door area. I see raspberries and packages of perfume in the toilet. I look at the package. It's a pretty, naked woman with long flowing hair and flowers coming out of her navel. I look across the street. I see "Liberace" and call him "Finn" I say, "Hey, are these yours?" He says, "They are." He's working in a store and makes pies. He has a pot belly and steals these things and hides them. He tells me that he must have loved his first wife because he married her.
