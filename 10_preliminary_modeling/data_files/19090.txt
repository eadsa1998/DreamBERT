First I was watching television. I was in a room, my bedroom I guess, late at night watching a program. It was a children's program of cartoons, but very well done, very witty. The television was rather loud. I was afraid it would wake someone in the house, but I continued watching, hoping, I guess, that my mother wouldn't come in here. Then, I don't remember the transition, but there was a woman. Yes, my mother was there. It was a woman asking my mother and me certain directions in the Grove, how to get to Ponce and 34th Avenue or something. So we were in Coconut Grove and we were starting to tell her how to get there when I was awoken.
