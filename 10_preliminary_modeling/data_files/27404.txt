I remember walking out of a house and continuing my walk down a main thoroughfare. A man (short, middle-aged, shabby) unfamiliar to me is following me. He has something wrapped in newspaper which he wants to sell me. He says something to me and I remember the word "cotton." I tell him "no" and cross the street. He follows me. Then somehow he gets ahead of me. I throw a glass at him, but miss. I see a group of people gather around a woman who is stretched on the ground. A young woman is crying: She says her mother's hand has been cut off. I draw close and see a huge scar across the hand of the woman. There is no blood. I keep repeating "I did it, I did it." I was awakened abruptly by my father at this part--it was 7:10 in the morning.
