 I'm on the lawn of the house that is on the corner of Slope Avenue and 3rd Street in Oak Valley. I have a handgun, and am waiting for someone. I am holding the gun up. People see it as they drive by so I put it in my pants pocket. I am wearing my brown corduroy pants. A guy I know from grade school, Cory Bark, and some of his friends, drive by in a car. I try to hide behind the garage. The car tries to follow me, driving around the block. The Thomas family (Annie, Jessica, and Tina) pulls up in a car. Their dog may be with them. Tina runs up and gives me a hug. I bounce off her and fall over and roll on the ground, jokingly. Annie says something about three days with no mountain or three days of no clouds with mountains. She also says something about no dreams for three days. She says this, I think, because of something I wrote on a postcard to her. But she misinterpreted the dream portion of this: It was supposed to be one day of no dreams. My friend Kevin Simpson is there with Annie and my third grade teacher Liza Minikel
