Something went wrong with my old car on the right rear wheel. I was by Fred's garage. We put the wheel on and let the jack down and the wheel, then bent to one side like it was a broken axle. I said jt was a broken axle. Fred said he didn't think so. When the axle was taken off, a big, flat bushing of brass was cracked. I said I would buy a new part. He said, "You can solder it." I said it wouldn't hole. He said he would. He did some kind of filing and it got hot. He said there was a liquid solder that would hold. A lady ran across the street and bought some solder. I opened up the bottle and Fred wanted to pour some liquid on the cracks and Fred squeezed the cracks together, then when he let go, it came apart again. I said, "I told you it wouldn't hold." There seemed to be an atomic interference in Big City. I saw a man in a window. Another man outside gave him two cans to hold and he tried to hold the two cans while the man tried to pull the cans apart. He pulled the man out thru the window and dragged him along, trying to pull the cans apart.
