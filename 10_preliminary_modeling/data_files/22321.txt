I remember the first one vaguely and it was related to something that happened to me a few days before, as though it were a continuation of reality to correct a slip. My father had lent me his car that night and in my dream the car was just as it is, including the color and everything. I went out to have fun, I don't know where or with whom. But the fact is that I arrived home later than usual and with the car all dirty with mud, a uniform layer (thin) of it, as though it had been splashed on the car along the way. I knew that I would be scolded for this, so I planned to get up early in the morning to throw water on the car with the garden hose, and leave it somewhat cleaner. I was very upset about this and I really made an effort to think that everything would turn out right. I don't remember what else happened.
