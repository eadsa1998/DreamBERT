["Searching with kittens on my head."] A man shows me a video and tells me to watch closely. I watch trying to memorize all the objects and sequences. It's a test of some kind. The man watches me closely to see how I will do. After the complex video is done, he places many objects in boxes and pouches and tells me to search for a knife. I remember seeing a plastic like knife similar to a letter opener. On the video and begin looking where I think it might be. I search through a box, then along the table and then in a pouch and can't find it. I am frustrated. I keep searching over and over. Another woman now joins the search. It's a contest now. A small kitten is nearby. I think it is cute and pet it. I pick it up. The man adjusts its position so it is right under my chin to cuddle up by my neck. I would have preferred that the kitten be in my arms so I could enjoy looking at it. Now there are two kittens. Now they are on my head and I balance them as I continue the long search. Another man enters the room. I signal to him secretly where's the knife! I had found a pouch with a regular looking knife, but my memory was of a letter opener type. He points his head at the pouch. I mouth Is it the regular knife. He nods. The watching an is watching this even though we are trying to be hidden from him. I'm just not finding anything. It isn't going well.
