I was in school and at lunch.  I sat next to Bryce, and he put his arm around me.  Then, I went to find my technology room, but I couldn't find it.  Wherever I went, it wasn't anywhere.  I went down to the basement to look for it, but all I found was a custodian.  He said, "I don't know where your room is, but I'm pretty sure your class went outside."  So I went back upstairs, but I found myself in the chorus room.  I saw Mrs. Gilbert teaching a class, so I got out.  I went back to the lunchroom, and everybody was still there.  Bryce hugs me again.  I went home and I started packing for the trip to the lake with my mom.  I packed some money.  Then I looked in my closet, and there was over $200!  Then I woke up.
