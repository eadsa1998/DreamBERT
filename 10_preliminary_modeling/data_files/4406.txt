["Student cries rape."] I am a teacher in a middle school. My class is large and noisy. Another woman teacher left her class and is sitting in on mine, for the fun of it. I am trying to figure out what lessons I am supposed to be teaching. English, possibly Math. It is not very organized but OK. Now the next class comes in. A much smaller class. All girls. I check my lesson plans. Looks like English lessons. The work "is" is being examined. I try to call them to order. The woman teacher is as noisy and disruptive as the girls. I call her to order and she smiles and quiets down. Now I ask one of the girls to do a speech. I decide this is speech class. She can't think of anything to talk about. I suggest she wait and let it come. Well, suddenly she begins to sob and tell us the story of her rape. She is a black girl now. I feel great sympathy. I go to her and hold her caringly and hug her, rocking back and forth. I feel sadness for her and I feel proud that she is talking about it.
