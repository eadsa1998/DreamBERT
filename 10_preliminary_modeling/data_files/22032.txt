I went to Callao to visit a foreign ship with some friends from my high school class with whom I graduated. We were fooling around, making fun and playing. At one point I made Ronald, a friend, get wet because he asked me to push him over a board in the direction of the ship. The first time his pants got wet, the second time he got wet all over. He started to chase me and we started to run. We went through some tubes to another ship and a detective from the F.B.I. stopped me and another boy; the rest got away. I was detained all night and they didn't even question me, and they told me to go back in the morning. The next day I saw the car of two twins -- friends of mine -- who were also in Callao with me. It was at a house that wasn't theirs, very different from their big house. I went in to talk to them and I don't remember any more, except that before I went in, I had some silverware in my hands and I put them inside the car through the side window.
