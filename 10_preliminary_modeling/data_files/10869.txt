I was returning to a former nursery school I once worked in, as a teacher again. Only the children who were assembled as a class, I recognized as the children I have in my present nursery job. It was a period following a long vacation and I couldn't get the children's attention. I began a story and the next thing I knew the children were running all around a large grassy playground. Then I would chase them together again and try to begin the story. Next I was at a rehearsal of the Cleveland Symphony. I was there to conduct the orchestra in Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Szell, the conductor, showed me the score and then he left. The first page of the score was words only, no music, and I was perplexed. I turned the page, lifted up my right arm and began to conduct. It sounded terrible, as the players, who said they knew it so well, played without music. I had to stop several times and once I reprimanded the piccolo player for not coming in on time. Szell returned and yelled at some of the players. The players told me secretly when he left that they were playing poorly because they didn't like Szell. Leaving in defeat, my husband begins to conduct and do a good job. I woke up and remembered part of the melody of that 5th Symphony. I heard the entire symphony in my dream.
