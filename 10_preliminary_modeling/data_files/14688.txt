Some friends and I were in a building, but we were playing an online game. We had to clear the area with the mouse. Then we realized that the people had left and it was going to explode and I yelled "duck!" and fell to my stomach and then it exploded. I got up and everyone was ok. I was then at dads house and the fridge was in the kitchen where the breakfast bar is facing the dining room. Dad was moving out soon. I took Tigger and put her in a bag, which her sticking out over the top. I left the house and just outside there was a cat head on the ground. Ezra was there. It joined to the body and I was like 'what the hell just happened'. I can't remember it properly, but Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and his girlfriend were pregnant. He was busy somewhere and she and I were going to the hospital to get it induced. We took the bus there and she contacted Pacey (Dawson's Creek) to tell him to get there but he had forgotten. She sat in the seat in front of me next to some pregnant African woman. Sometimes it was Aliyah and she was pregnant and she said that she went to France and slept with her boyfriend. When we got there he was waiting outside though. Dawson also turned up as we walked in. His girlfriend was filling in forms to get in. Someone asked him "what are you going to name her if it's a girl?" and he said "Samantha". I said "I'm sick of Samantha [as in the name]" and I mentioned Samantha Mueller. Dawson looked really worried and was standing close to me. I was annoyed about the whole situation because I liked him. I was going to ask a friend of mine for their mobile numbers, thinking that I couldn't get them because in the 90's they didn't have mobiles so I couldn't get it from the show.
