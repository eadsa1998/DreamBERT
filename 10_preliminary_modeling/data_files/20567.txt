I was at home with my mother. A hurricane came and the part of the house I was in was blown through the streets. It passed between two walls and then landed in a gully. After the storm I went back toward the house. The other houses were not very much damaged. (I awoke, and then when I fell asleep again the dream was continued.) I saw my sister and I told her how the wind had torn off the section of the house. (The house part that broke off was like the dinette in the last house we lived in.)
