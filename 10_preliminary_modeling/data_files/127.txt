I'm in (an?) apartment with (My brother?) and someone comes to the front door to sell some service - don't know what kind. I certainly don't want it, and I'm rather suspicious of him. But he isn't going away - he's looking towards his companions not far away (in a car?) as though they're getting ready to do something. I shut the door and lock it in several places - it's even 2 doors, and they each have at least 3 locks. My brother comes up, and I explain what just happened. He says he'll take care of it. This has to do with cats (MB?) again.
