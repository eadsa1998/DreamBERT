I was smoking a cigar. I sat in a field smoking. I looked and saw the trees trimmed down quite low. A girl told Barbara to go into the house, that someone might throw something at her because it was getting dark. There was a gang trying to get me. I would throw them off. Then I got a gun and gave them a few scare shots, but they wouldn't scare easily. I got into the house. A big fellow came at me, but I held him at bay, then flew and lost the gang. I fired up the furnace because it was getting chilly and over night it would get cold.
