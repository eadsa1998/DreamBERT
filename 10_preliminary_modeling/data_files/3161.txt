I am a woman and two men harass me. I run away. I steal one of their bicycles and then they chase me and we are in traffic and I peddle. Then I abandon the bicycle in the bushes behind a gas station and go into the station to call someone and the two men come after me and I try to hide in a room. They come to the door and I hold it closed against them. He has the keys and gets them out and I hold the door hard. He pushes, and then as he pushes to get in, I slide out and into the next adjoining room. They come to that room and I quickly hide up in the attic area through a crawl hole and replace the panel and hope they don't find me. Then somehow I am Marilyn of Northern Exposure like and on a horse wearing a beautiful whit fur cape. The chief of the tribe says, "You can have it; take it away for all we care. We prefer to not have it around." I am angry because I had been harassed and hounded and feared for my life because of this cape. We (the two men and I) ride out into the snow. Finally, in tremendous anger, I force the one man off his horse. He is shocked. I scream at him. I am angry. We'll finish it now. He is going to strike out at me and I don't care. I am livid with anger long held in from his bad frightening attacks on me. He is Indian and hides in his yellow fur parka and I made some sign at him and say, "You stay in there; you can use the shield." Somehow his spirit was going to come out and kill me and I am fighting it. It's like I've gone berserk from the pent-up up rage. They aren't going to treat me badly any longer.
