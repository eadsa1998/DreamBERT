I was working in the shop. I saw Margie S. I looked at her and her eyes were on me. I went to look at a house that was being built. I saw whiskey bottles lying around partly full. I came to a pond. It was clear water. I walked thru it, then I saw something jump on the bank. I looked there and saw two eyes of a big frog. Ed Stebner was sweeping a green caterpillar at me. It landed on my shoe. I shook it off and took the broom and swept it back at him. I got a bite on the shoulder from a big mosquito. I saw Bill Berringer drilling holes in fresh grapes. I had a new Pontiac. I was backing it up and it didn't want to stop like the other dreams of backing my car. I came close to a parked car, just touched it. I was on the square. It was so bad driving, the bus drivers couldn't see thru the windshields, and they were running over the curbs and the lawns. I saw one bus down on its side tipping over.
