I see Sparky and ask her to stay for a few minutes and hear the dream I had about her. As I describe how she was willing to back my play in the dream, I realize its like asking her to back me now. She smiles and says like Celeste so name the term you want to be in another play. I say OK. That will be fun. It will be nice to be in the Center for another performance. I ask her to list the future productions coming up. I also ask her if I can submit a play to her for consideration. She agrees I can submit it. Then she offers me a couple of vegetarian like hamburgers with some purple like cabbage like veggie on the side. There are four varieties of this slightly hot and spicy veggie. I taste it and it is very delicious. I eat it all. I thank her for the food. Then there is an actor, Richard Gere who visits.
