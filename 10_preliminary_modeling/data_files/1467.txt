I am in a small cabin. It's so small, it's like a dressing booth or stall. Hank is in there with me. I get a phone call. It's a client. She asks me if I've had any boating experiences. I tell her about my Acapulco cruise. Hank is smiling at my stories. I then ask her if she's thinking of boating. She says yes, she's thinking of joining the Navy. That was why she called, to talk over that decision. Hank had tidied up a few papers off my cot. He gets up to leave. I feel surprised that I like him. Then I go to get in an elevator. I was looking for my guy but I can't find him and it's important to leave here. In the elevator, I see up in the sky a helicopter. It's air draft is rattling the elevator. I get out and run.
