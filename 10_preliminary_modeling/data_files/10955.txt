I dreamt I was going on a trip to Chicago along with my sister and girlfriend Marie. She was as usual very slow to get ready, then she could not find her purse. The train was right behind our house and we barely made it in time. Two friends from our dorm were there to see us off and I was quite excited. When we arrived we went to our hotel and found that our father had made a reservation for us. Our room was on the 9th floor and we were surprised to find our two young brothers asleep on cots there. We then went out to find a place for dinner and saw our other brother 13, standing in front of the hotel. We then had a talk with the room clerk who told us what to be in night, where to go, etc.
