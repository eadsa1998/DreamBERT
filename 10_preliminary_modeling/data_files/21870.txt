I said Wampus when I awoke. I was watching boys play ball. The catcher threw a fastball to the end basement at every pitch from the pitcher. I was supposed to be a little off the mind as I saw it. How I was being treated by some friends and I was thinking they were off the beam as I saw it. I was supposed to be very strong and they knew it and were very friendly to me. I think I heard one was the only one I had my eyes on the people who thought I was off and I could see their eyes looking at me.
