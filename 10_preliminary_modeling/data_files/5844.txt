[1997-07-06] A fairly real dream about the wedding, sort of a reenactment of the whole day that went on. We had a wedding in a church, it was not a big church but I can remember walking my daughter down the aisle and going to the ceremony and then we jumped to the reception which was outside in the back yard. I remember there was a wooden bridge in the back yard and I remember walking over the wooden bridge to go to a table to sit down and I remember cutting the cake and dancing with my daughter and I remember eating and all around me I could sense that it was a beautiful, sun shiny day and not too hot. I dreamed it exactly as it took place that day. It was very late by the time we left. It was a very realistic, vivid dream.
