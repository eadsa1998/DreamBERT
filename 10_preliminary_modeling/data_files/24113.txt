I was watching TV with a couple of my friends. I do not remember their faces only that I felt close to them. The room was supposedly one of my friends'. There were pictures on the walls of forests and other scenic areas, and there were many areas on the wall where the paint was cracked and peeling. We were all sitting in a comfortable couch and I was crocheting a red blanket when one of my friends threw the ball of yarn across the room, somehow it ended up in the TV and I was being pulled across the room by it. Suddenly I was entering the TV. I could see all the different particles of the television pass me by in complete detail as I fell further into the television. I was then in another world, one which I was scared of and knew that evil existed. There was a man there with a shaved head and yellow teeth and he was very evil. This room that I was now in was very dark with pictures in the background which melted together. When I went up to one of the pictures it passed through me. Then the man laughed and I knew he was the center of evil. I knew he wag going to make me do evil things. The colors and the background started swirling together and my vision was becoming misty and blurry. I started panicking and I knew that I had to get away. Then I was sitting at a typical kitchen table, however one not familiar to me, and I was explaining to someone how I could not stop slipping out of reality, even while I was explaining it my friend started getting cloudy and unreal, and she said "Well you keep eating the food they are giving you, they are slipping  you shrooms. I remember being relieved because I realized that she was right. Then I glanced out of the window that was right beside us, which for some reason I had not noticed yet. As I glanced out the window I saw the trees outsider melting. Then I woke up. This was the second time I had this dream.
