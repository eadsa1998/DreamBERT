I was asleep and I heard a knock on the door. I woke up my mother. I don't remember who was at the door, but I looked far out and I saw twisters. They were glowing blue as if they were electrical. As they got closer, we guessed which way they would go and we ran the opposite way, sometimes barely driving to safety. I was horrified. They continued to come, one after another. I was getting so tired I couldn't take it much longer. We ran and ran and came to a building. We ran inside. Inside was a peach twister coming closer. I pushed someone out of the building and ran to a car where a policeman was saying, "Stop, you're messing up the shoot! That twister is not real. It is just a computer projected image."
