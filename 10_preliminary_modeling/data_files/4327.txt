["Studying a boy."] I and some other counselors are studying a boy. He needs help. We are in the boy's home to observe. I watch him and he sees quite normal. I don't see a problem. A young woman counselor like Beth of The Interview is there. She is talking with high praise about my reputation as a very good counselor. She hands me some papers with written comments about my work. Now several hours have passed and it is time to leave. I am gathering up my papers. I see a drawer full of apples. I will eat one. I have an orange in with my pile of papers to take with me. Now I am leaving and discover this whole time I was on a river boat, but it is anchored and not moving. It will move soon to go back to it's dock. I'll even miss that little ride. I am disappointed. I would love to take a nice vacation cruise. I see groups of people in Scottish kilts playing bagpipes on the river bank. I need to go now. I have work to do.
