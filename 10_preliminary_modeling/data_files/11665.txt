In this dream I dreamt that it was raining very hard and I was walking in the rain with another young man who I did not recognize. There was a road down which we were walking and which was lined with tall straight trees. The scene shifted and I was walking around a muddy cliff but the youth was still there. We were standing there in the mud and I saw a huge snake crawling in a crevass in the cliff. I told the youth with me and we walked to a car where I got a gun and a pocket full of bullets and began walking back to the cliff. One the way we went through a covered bridge and I began to fondle the rifle and the bullets in the pockets of my jacket. I began to load the rifle and to laugh. We got back to the cliff and I saw the snake again. I fired the rifle and it did not go off, but the snake suddenly seemed to split open.
