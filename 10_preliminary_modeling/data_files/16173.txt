We were going to this party with the fire people, and we were driving along in the car, which for some reason our car had a siren. Anyway, we were driving along and I was supposed to call some chief on the radio and tell him we were going to be a little late, and so I did. And it started out as a professional, short transmission, but then it turned into a long-winded friendly, teasing thing. And I never did get to the party. I don't know any more. It was kind of dumb.
