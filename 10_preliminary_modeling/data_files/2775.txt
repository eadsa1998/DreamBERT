I see a baby girl wearing a sweater, and Howard is around and I get concerned and want the baby to change and not wear a revealing sweater so someone won't get the idea of playing with her breasts. A woman tells me I'm being silly and jumping to conclusions. I realize she's right. Now I'm somewhere and want some information. I've been invited to go to Africa and at first don't want to, too much energy and trouble, but then I realize this is a great opportunity and want to go, even though it means risk. Howard goes up to a man to ask a question for me. I know I should do it myself but I let him. The man grins and grabs Howard and hugs him in a New Age enlightened syrupy way and Howard sends me a speaking glance because this makes him feel silly. I laugh because it's so silly to see him standing there. It's a shared moment. I am eating a hard boiled egg and think, "Now I'll have to share this with him," and then I want to share it with him, he's been so helpful.
