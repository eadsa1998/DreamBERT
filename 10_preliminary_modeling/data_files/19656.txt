James (my nephew) and I are in a small boat, or canoe, rowing toward something like a houseboat -- or rather, we are not actually rowing but by shaking and jerking our bodies we slowly edge along. When we reach the (?houseboat), which is a flat object with cross pieces, James crawls up on to it, but I stay in canoe and pull myself and boat around by holding on to edge of houseboat. There are other boats and people here and there around us. The people are watching us. James does not sit down as my pulling on houseboat has submerged one edge and the water sloshes about on the flat, raft-like craft. Presently I find myself on the raft with James. I have a lighted lantern which I turn in all directions (inside a cabin) looking for something. The lantern gives an exceedingly poor light, and I ask what's the matter. James finds that the wick is turned up several inches too far. Finally I succeed in directing the light toward a cupboard from which James takes a pair of skates. There he starts to put on. Next, I offer to carry a pitcher of cream and 2 glasses, but they are very slippery and almost slip out of my hands. I then set them down in order to get a more secure grip. About this time someone begins to advise James to have a good time while he is young, and I say that I've already suggested this, and that James has been following the suggestion -- and that his youth was well spent. (During much of this dream I seem to be laboring under a feeling of diffidence or inferiority, as I used to be in the presence of Dave. Hardy.)
