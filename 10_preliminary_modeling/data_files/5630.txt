I am at a social club that I belong to listening to a woman that I know, a very poor reader who always screws up names and mentions people on lists who have been dead for years. She is reciting poetry to the room which is full of people who are all in wheelchairs. She is reciting the poetry very badly and everyone is so bored that they leave, except for me. I stay and listen to her.
