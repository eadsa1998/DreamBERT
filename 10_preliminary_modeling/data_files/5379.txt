I had the scariest dream that I was under the imperius curse (from Harry Potter). I was asleep (in m dream) and there must have been a bug crawling on my leg in real life, because in my dream, I thought that if the bug reached my belly button, I would start hallucinating and die. It was a scary combination of Batman Begins and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
