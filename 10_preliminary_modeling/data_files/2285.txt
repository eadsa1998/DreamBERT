I want to clean up things in this storage area. I'm painting a sort of closet/box. Someone comes by to help. They start painting the outside wall green. "No," I say, "Not there. On the front inside panel." (It looks like the enclosure around my heat pump.) Then there's a wall toilet, long and narrow like in some public restrooms, the kind you can't figure out how to sit. The woman says, "I think I'll flush it before I clean it." I say, "Go ahead but no one's used it." I look in to see urine and four used, but not bloody, sanitary napkins. I'm embarrassed she saw that. I blame Ellie.
