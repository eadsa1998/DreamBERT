["By bike or by car?"]  I am in a house. It is supposedly Lucy's home. I am cutting out articles about an incident in the newspaper. It's her newspapers and the article is about something, an accident, that happened to her. But I want them so I take them, rationalizing she can't read them anyway. I am packing to leave. I have a bike and a car. I can't decide which one I should take home with me now. I decide on the car and then change my mind and go on the bike. I coast down steep hills and pedal hard up the other side. I stop at a wayside and rest, feeling guilty about taking the articles. I should have asked permission. Now there are people around. I am going to sleep on a cot. A girl, like Charla is with me. She brings me a box of Kleenex. I say thanks and offer the little boxes inside it to others. Soon lots of people have boxes of Kleenex. Then I realize Charla had taken the box without permission and it is the supplies for the vending machine which sells these Kleenex boxes to the public. Now I owe a bunch of money for having given them all away.
