I was busy straightening up and trying to get myself ready to go to work. I was having a hard time making the bed, there were stains all over it and the blankets were heavy and bulky. Ed made fun of me for trying too hard. Then I was trying to fix my hair and I realized my bangs were way too long, going all the way down to my chin, so I had to cut my hair and I worried if it would look okay. After I cut my hair, I realized I had a beard growing and my mom said it would have to go. I realized I'm going to be very late for work.
