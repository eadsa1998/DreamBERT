I was watching Entourage. Vince was offered a part in a porno. Turtle didn't want him to do it. They went to this drug dealer (who I think was the director of the porno) and pretended to want drugs. One of them said he liked liquid. The guy said he could do that and took his belt off, tied it around his neck and vomited (off-screen). Ari was on the phone to Lloyd and said "your dream came true of me being blown by space monkeys" and Lloyd responded "Space monkeys?!" and it had something to do with a porno with monkeys. Vince did a screen test and then walked away and Eric was relieved. In real life, there was this 'robot' and you could choose its personality etc and then it would just look like a person. The trial version had limited opinions and didn't last long. Teen robots couldn't have romances with adults and some guy did an advert about that. A robot was chosen with 'good, easy romance' personality traits and it looked like Rhys Coiro. It lay in bed and disappeared after a few minutes.
