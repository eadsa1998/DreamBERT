I found a bracelet on the floor and Audrey said it was a girlfriend's of hers from school. I said, "I want to try it on." She didn't want me to. I gave her a tough answer and sister Ann was there with Mitzie. Ann gave me a sarcastic answer. I bawled her out, told her she had a big mouth like and worse than her sister Mary. I ordered her off my porch. She went off, but came back and got a handful of silverware, including a bread knife, and held it above her head threatening me. She was a big, husky woman, taller than I. I took all the silver out of her hand and she picked up more. I was kind of afraid of her. I saw a movie of a man sitting on a large scale. He had a pile of cabbage and lettuce. He talked and then ate the cabbage. I had a head of cabbage and ate it. Arnold came by and said, "If I had a chance like you, I would make good use of it." I told him I did. I ate. I saw a small boy run across the street in front of a car. Three women walked down the street. Mickey M. wanted to take me as a prisoner. I picked up a small copper hammer and gave him a couple of hits on the head, but it didn't faze him. There was a big assembly of White workers at the plant. There was dust at Rivertown. I told the boys it was from the cinder roads that the company made. I lay on the bed with my small son and I covered him and just his small head shown.
