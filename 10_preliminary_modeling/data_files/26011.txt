 I'm with others preparing to go out. I had previously joked about not wearing underwear, but now it seems that not wearing underwear is the norm, is expected, or at least one is to wear bikini briefs. I have on my blue Girbaud shorts with a wife beater. I don't like that no underwear is the norm. I have an erection, and it sticks out the top of my wife beater in front of my chest. My cousin Rich Redding is there. He thinks his hair looks very funny, all slick and combed. I am watching a movie with others. One of the movie characters is going to kill another character in a certain way using a large spear with an arrow-like head. I'm the person that is supposed to kill the other. I wait with a spear. Others that are watching the movie leave. I still haven't killed yet. I'm out on Home Avenue in Oak Valley. It's very icy: slippery. A car passes the car that is in front of it, and then slows down. I think the driver of the car that passed is dumb and a jerk. A police car goes by. The police car stops one of the cars involved in the passing incident. I'm at the top of the hill at Home Avenue and 2nd Street. A woman needs help getting up the hill. Another man and I push her car. Then we are pulling the woman up the hill. The man is really strong and does all the hard work. I try to pull but don't help that much. My aunt and cousin Shelia and Melissa Redding are there. Melissa gives me money, which may be for helping the woman. An ambulance spins its wheels as it nears the top of the hill: it can't make it to the top. I talk with the Reddings on the southeast corner of the intersection. My uncle Rusty Redding is going to Los Angeles. It is Thanksgiving time.
