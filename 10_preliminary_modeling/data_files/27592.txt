I was in a crowded elevator with some people I know &amp; some strangers - I don't know how it happened but I suddenly knew my father was dying behind me - he was being carried in somebody's arms, &amp; I knew I mustn't turn around to look or I'd never forget it, but I took one quick look - he was blue &amp; gasping, it didn't look like my father, but I knew it was he. &amp; I looked quickly away. We got to the floor we got out on - by then he was dead. The man holding my father said, "Take him" - I was terribly afraid even to look at him, &amp; I was afraid that the people in the elevator would notice. I heard a voice proclaiming down the hall (the hall was wide, bare, &amp; echoing - like a hospital). "Wait - wait for S---- H----! " but I knew it was really S---- A---. He ran quickly toward the elevator, but the doors closed &amp; we moved down. But what was lying in my arms (to my surprise) was a large sawdust dummy with an ugly papier mache face. No one noticed anything - the dream faded out.
