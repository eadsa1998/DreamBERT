I was on duty doing registration on a river boat. I am dressed in an English "bobby" policeman costume. A young man likes me. He wants to kiss me and take me out. I am flattered. We go to the back of the boat to watch an extension raft that has Dixieland musicians. I pat my new haircut and want my "bobby" helmet that I left somewhere. He says, "Don't worry, you don't need it." I say, "But I want it." It appears on my head. I pat it. The banjo player is central in the group. They have some difficulty staying on the raft. I agree to go out with the man. I suggest we exchange addresses. He agrees. I get teased by other counselors about my affair, but they are supportive.
