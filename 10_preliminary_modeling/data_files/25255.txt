 I'm going to a Three Tenors concert. I am with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling, Nat Miller, and Tom Napper. We drive to the concert in a big, fancy red car, which is kind of like a Cadillac, but isn't. We leave it parked where people give their cars to valets, but we don't give the valet the keys. I go back later, when there are two valet employees, and give one of them the keys, which are on my Brimson key chain. The car is to be parked in a subway garage. I have a new suit for the occasion. I wear a t-shirt under it: no shirt or tie. I have nice new black shoes too. I don't wear a shirt, only the pants and shoes. My roommate's girlfriend Natasha talks to me as we watch part of the show. The Three Tenors are women with violins. The concert turns into a lecture, and one woman puts up an overhead projection and draws complex note patterns on it. All the people leave because it is boring. The Bough parents are the last two people there. My classmates Sonya Nittles and Fariba Touse are there and talk to me. As I leave, I wave at Sonya, who went out before me. We are going back to the car. There is a Santa Claus cake with hard frosting on it. We smash the cake on the sidewalk.
