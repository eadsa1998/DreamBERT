This dream took place in a railroad yard. I remember somebody was going over, some unidentifiable person went to the switch and was turning it and something in the background, a boxcar, loose boxcar was coming down the track and I guess it was going to crash. It came into this thing, into where the switch was or where the junction was, and I just remember running after this boxcar as fast as I could. The person was a male.
