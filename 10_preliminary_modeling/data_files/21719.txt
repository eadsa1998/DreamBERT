I was flying low and had a hard time going up. I was in Rivertown behind the schoolhouses of my boyhood days. I flew between apple trees and I noticed the apples were square shape. Then there was a commotion in a tree and two squirrels were fighting. One seemed to be the tougher. One bit the other one on the soft part of the mouth and also the squirrels were big or large as a full grown cat. I was in a space rocket with a space man. He was ready to take off and I said, "How do I get out?" He told me how. Ann said, "Now I will not tell you how to use the detergent in the washers. You use it yourself and learn how."
