We were in writing class, and we had to write a brief speech because we were going to this funeral. It was for my friend Nina's grandfather who just died. We all were sitting around a table reading our speeches. One of the lines in my speech was "Even though I don't know you, I feel your pain." We then got up to go to the funeral. Setting: In my school classroom #1. Characters: My writing teacher/school headmaster Steve, my friend Nina, and the rest of the 8th graders at my school. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad. It was a weird dream because my friend Nina's grandfather just died awhile ago. And her other grandpa has a brain tumor now.
