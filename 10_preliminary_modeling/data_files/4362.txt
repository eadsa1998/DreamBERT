["Dwight needs class in sex and love."] Ginny and I are at a conference or vacation. We have one more night and day to go in this swank hotel. Ginny decides she's done and wants to go home. She sees no reason to stay the last night and spend so much money. I am frustrated and annoyed because I am enjoying being in this swank hotel. But she really wants to go so I acquiesce. I tell myself I must control my frustration and anger for the sake of the friendship. I choose not to, say anything then. Now we fly home. At Ginny's house, I am aware I forgot to give my used ticket back to the airplane personnel. I want to do things right, so I ask Ellie to take me back to the airport and I will try and fix this mistake. Ernie comes through the room and says he's really proud of Dwight. He's struggling with difficult people in his life (his wife Corinne). He is going to counseling and one of his tasks is to watch a movie on Sex And Love With Difficult People. I'm kind of glad I don't have to watch that movie. It might be racy and embarrassing. I try to be proud of Dwight and respect his courage, because Ernie does. Now Ellie and I are at the airport. I remember leaving a folder of papers here. I look to see if it is still there. I look on the top of a pile of papers on a desk. Not there. Then I see a long table where I had put it. Luckily, it was still there. I pick it up and look for the ticket. I don't find it, but I find a script and a wig that I need to return to Dwight. They are his and I borrowed them. Then I remember I left the ticket in my purse and find it. I feel good and pleased that I managed to fix all my mistakes. I feel good about myself.
