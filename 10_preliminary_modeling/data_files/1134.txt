I have attracted the interest of a very wealthy man. I am a quad in a chair. He has a Cadillac convertible limousine. He puts me in the back seat with him. He asks me, "How do you like it?" I laugh and say, "But it's soo big!" A black man is the chauffeur. The rich guy smiles and says, That way you have room for all your friends." He says, "I got this car for you because I don't want you to have to drive." I laugh and say, "Oh ho! Well, let me tell you, I will too drive. I'll buy a van with hand controls with my own money." He looks upset. I say, "Well, that doesn't mean I'll ever drive it, it just means I have to power to do it if I want to. That's called independence." I look at the black man who is driving and we exchange meaningful glances at my word independence and being in a southern city. "In fact," I say, "people have been known to fight wars over this very issue!" We're now walking down a boardwalk where very poor black people live and we can see into their tiny rooms where they are terribly overcrowded. I comment that a part of one drawer is each persons private area and they would kill to preserve that privacy. As I talk, we walk past people who pee on the sidewalk. One woman pees on my leg. I am annoyed with the odor and wish I had thought to walk around behind her instead of in front of her.
