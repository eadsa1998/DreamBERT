I am in a performing group. We are painting the set. It takes lots of paint. When we get one set done, one of the guys moves some to make room for a moveable screen. I complain, "Hey, don't move things without asking first. We haven't any paint left." Then my boyfriend and I kiss and make out. It is very pleasant. Then it's show time. The group holds hands and runs up on stage. A guy and I tap dance and sing. It's pleasant too.
