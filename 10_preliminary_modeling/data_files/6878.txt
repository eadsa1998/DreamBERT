I had come to the mainland to enter a swimming contest. As we filed by the desk, I gave my name and "from Hawaii." She asked for my application form. I said I had received none. She, "I mailed it." I say, "Probably not in time. Remember it takes a long tom if not by air." She, "I sent it by air. Two days should have been enough." I asked for form now. She, "must pass test first." One test is to build a boat. She passed out clever two headed screws and told us to find our boards. He and I started. He found an old packing box and screwed two boards together. I picked up two slender pieces. We came out to the light. He said he had built a boat with twin beds for the boys and three other bunks for the rest. We stood on the beach near a scaffold like structure. The sand breaking gently on it so white and the sky so blue. I say, "let's try the boat."
