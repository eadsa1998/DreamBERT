I am waiting my turn to see Mrs. J. After meals, start to take medicine. One white pill looks rather dirty like roach tablet. It may be poison. Then I realize all the medicine is wrong. There is no rhodixin but a big flat red tablet. No capsule but 3 white tablets, 7 in all. Go to tell Mrs. J. Tell her of my recent intelligence test and say if I can detect errors in medicine, I am responsible enough to take care of my own. Waiting to get the right medicine, I realize I shouldn't have received any at noon. (Here at KD they have taken my medicine away, deal it out and have made at least 1/2 doz. mistakes and I have resented it. )
