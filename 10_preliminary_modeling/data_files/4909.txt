["Mom, Howard and Charla."] I am at Charla's school trying to work with the teachers to help Charla get her work done. Charla is apparently going to be done soon. I need to help get her things packed. Then I am seated at a cafeteria table with some teachers. Then Howard is there across from me. I wonder why it's been so long since we've been in relationship, or had sex. I wonder if it will work if we try again. Then my mother is there. The image is like she's lying down but there's no furniture she's on. She gives me an odd cuddly sort of kiss on the cheek. I am glad to see her. She tells me we only have a few more days to get Charla packed and moved. I tell her I've already started on the packing at her house, Charla's room. I'll get on doing the rest now.
