I was staying in a hotel with my son and my girlfriend. It was on the ocean. My son and I went swimming but then suddenly we saw that the waves were starting to get huge and were up to the second floor. We were terrified and I held onto him. We couldn't remember where our room was. I wanted to find my girlfriend. We got on a bus and I told the busdriver "I have to find my husband," so I wouldn't have to deal with homophobia toward us. My son was scared but it comforted him to see I was scared too.
