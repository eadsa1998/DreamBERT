Thursday I had a dream that our sound system needed some rewiring. It was not at its full potential, but it could be run. And Dad was going to run a wire down through the wall at the northwest corner of the living room and under the floor for some reason. And we had baby chicks and Loretta was the mother. Loretta is a chicken that we have that's very ornery. And we couldn't pick up the baby chicks because Loretta would peck the dickens out of us if we did. [laugh]
