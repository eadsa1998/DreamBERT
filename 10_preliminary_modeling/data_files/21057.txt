Gramp, Steve and I were lying on the ground sleeping. I awoke and looked up and saw a monstrous alligator coming our way with his big mouth open. I yelled at him, then a monkey came near him and they monkeyed around and I got my 22 pistol. I looked into the barrel and saw a small paper was there. I yelled at the animals, then shot once and the animals obeyed me. I noticed half of my barrel was shot off and was red hot from the paper wad being there. It was dark and overcastted from smoke and clouds in the daytime. I saw a big girl bowling and did she have the speed. There was a big boy exercising. He was spinning or whirling and he made himself turn into many smaller or little bodies and they did the same, all of them. I looked into Ernest's coke oven and it was burning and half of the oven was loaded, the other half was half coke and half coal. I heard a fellow yell Rock Rock. He was lying on the beach under sand. He got up because there were all kinds of frogs around them. There was a small boar attacking one of the men.
