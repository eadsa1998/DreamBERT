I was lying on my stomach in a high sand dune in a vast western desert. It might have been Nevada. It was evening and the sun had just gone down and it was very cool and comfortable. Far off in the distance I could see a purple range of mountains. I was very comfortable and peaceful. I remember thinking, "I'll have to think it all out. No, there's no need for thinking any more. The whole problem is resolved. This is the final solution." I was conscious of a gentle swelling and sinking feeling as if I were drifting in the sea. At the last minute, just before I awoke I was suddenly filled with a nameless feeling of fright and dread.
