 I'm looking out a window with two other people. I see a scene where a crowd of people is entering a door-like area. I know it has to do with Australian Aboriginal dreamtime. Out the window and down a bit is the earth or moon. I'm on the moon (or earth). I can run and jump to the other, and I choose to do this. I think briefly of the hazards, but I just go. I run and leap out the window. I fall very short of the moon, but I know that I can fly and can utilize my dream body. I float up onto the target destination. I encourage the others to do so and they do. My friend Nat Miller is one of them. We enter an apartment stealthily; I lead.
