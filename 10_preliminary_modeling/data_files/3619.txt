I go into a church and I find Derek lying on a leather chaise lounge kind of couch. He is staring contemplatively at two or three paintings set up on easels. They look like his dream pictures. I walk past, greeting him and put something away and then come back. I look at the first picture and see a horse. Then as I look at other details I am struck with how dynamic this picture is. As I shift field of vision, different depths become active, vital and to the forefront of my awareness. The middle ground becomes illuminated and I look at it, and then I am drawn into the background, which happens to be horses raining from the sky, and mountains. I turn to Derek and tell him what I saw and how amazing this sifting of perspective is. I like the picture very much. I sit next to him as we talk. He is silent and contemplative. He adjusts his position to make room for me near him. I reach for something across his chest as I am talking, which places me in a sort of hug position across his body. As I do this, he touches my hair tenderly and says very softly, "Will you....marry me?" I hear the "Will you" and guess that the words are marry me, although I do not actually hear them. I say, "I can't hear you. What did you say?" He touches my hair and I can't tell if it is just a casual caress or a real sign of affection. I want it to be, but I don't want to respond as if it is unless I know it is, so I won't scare him and embarrass me. I touch his hair in a caressing manner. The feelings are very confused and mostly I feel ambiguous and he is ambiguous. It is tender and I like it. Then he gets up and moves several of my file cabinets for me. I guess I'm moving my office to this area. He is helping me place things. I examine the placement and say, "Would you mind if these two cabinets (which were mine) are first in line with the others (from a previous office owner)?" "No problem." We move them.
