We are playing cards. O.M. offers to play if needed. He looks rather anxious. I smilingly agree, But he thinks I mean now and enters the game. Some one yields his place, although I offer to give up mine. Now there are 7 about the table, one is mother. But the deal won't come right. There are many different colored patterns on the card backs. We pick out one design but 5 or 7 of the cards are torn clear across.
