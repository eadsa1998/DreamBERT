I was talking to my ex steady girlfriend. We were reminiscing. I said I had to leave soon. She acted sorry. I asked her what her plans for the summer were. She told me she would join the circus. She said her knowlege of Hebrew had come in handy in getting the job. She asked me about my schoolwork and on parting smiled, saying, "You'll do all right."
