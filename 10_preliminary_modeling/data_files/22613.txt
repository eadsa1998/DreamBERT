I remember clearly that a group of friends and I (there were men, women and poor people) were at a camping site. I don't know why, but we installed ourselves on a bridge, or rather a rock waterbreak which was separated from the sea by a few yards (high). There were dogs and people with their children on the dock, fishing. Suddenly night came and the tide started to rise. It rose so much that we all woke up and tried to run. At that point the waves got so high that they inundated the bridge with great strength. Many people fell off the bridge and drowned. My fianc√© started to jump on the rock because he was at a lower height than we. We shouted for him to come up, but he could not do it due to the waves. The waves hit that rock furiously, and I was desperately shouting for him to come up, and then he slipped while jumping and blood was coming out of his knees. It was very cold and we couldn't get out of that place. In the meantime we could see beds and houses floating in the water against the rocks. There was a terrible noise. We were all terrified. People screamed and cried. When the tide lowered, we were able to get down and we got in the car, after walking quite a bit. On the way back home I remembered that I had a party (maybe the shower party I did not go to the other day) and asked them whether they could stop. I went in and ate a lot and took some food out for the others. Then we continued on our way and arrived at another beach. I was deathly afraid that the same thing would happen to us there, but this place seemed safer. This place had houses around it and gardens. But just as in the other place, the sea came up and we started to run towards the highway. The waves started to flood the houses and many people were running and screaming, even though nothing happened to anybody. Only the things inside the houses were lost.
