I find a business card that says "BLUE LENS." I wonder if it means the color blue on a camera lens or the Blues Music. I'm told its a special elite video crew that only records the top talents of that company and they are coming to record on video, me. I feel surprised and honored. So I go to the house and a woman/maid shows me my room. My little girl has a room down the hall. I'm supposedly getting the VIP treatment. I go in to "#23." It's a lovely room. It's time to take a bath, but first the maid shows me a tall, fancy French chest of drawers. In one drawer is a couch in case I have company. (high school friend Dora is in the dream somewhere.) Three drawers are full of pillows. One drawer has a green army blanket in it. Now the drawers open up like doors (French) to the bathroom. There is a fancy bathtub. I get into it. It's very narrow and tall, with black handled faucets. The maid fills the tub with water. I hope it doesn't go over my head when I sit, because the sides of the tub do. She offers to soap up my legs for me. I notice I have hairy legs. I choose to do it myself.
