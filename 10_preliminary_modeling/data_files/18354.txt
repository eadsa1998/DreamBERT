I am at my home in my hometown, don't know if anyone is with me or not, but I get a telephone call wanting to know if I want to go out to supper at a certain restaurant. And this call is from a boy whose identity is not quite known, but he reminds me of a fellow I knew in college, Sheldon  Simpson . So he and another guy, who I can't quite identify at the moment, come by and pick me up in a car and we drive over to this restaurant and go in. We already got some hamburgers as soon as we get there, which are part of our meal, and then we go on and order some other stuff on the menu and we start talking about the advantages of not being married, and I'm joking with them because I don't think too much of the advantages.
