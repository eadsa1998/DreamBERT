Ted Bundy had disappeared for some years. I went to some jail because I had to go do something quickly and I went to this room with people doing a test. The teacher came in and was annoyed that I was there, but then kicked out this guy who looked like John Cazale, and told me to sit the test. I said ok, but that I needed to go to the toilet. I found Ted and we left. John Cazale and company were hanging around outside somewhere. Some girl started abusing me and Ted. I said I was sorry for what happened to John, though I actually wasn't. They left and Ted was like "What the hell?" We were both trying to avoid him. We were then at a hotel. Ezra was there. Ted and I were sharing a bottom bunk. The bed was actually in the wall, but Ezra was taking the one on top. Ted put his arm around me and we were making out. We ended up having sex. All these people were watching through the windows. I closed the blinds, but they weren't really helpful.
