 I'm with my friend Hannah Reed. We're going south on Home Avenue towards the restaurant on the corner of Home and Main St. I am on rollerblades. She is walking. We're talking about our classmate Gino Teavor. We turn around and go back towards my house. It is night. Hannah is now on rollerblades too. She is in front of me; I'm kind of pushing her along. I have my hands around her, and I feel her breasts, which are large. I'm aroused and would like to have sex with her. She laughs and says no. I urinate in my pants as we continue. I'm with my friend Mark Long as I approach my house. It's starting to rain hard. Mark goes to the front door and I go to the back. I think that I'll beat him inside and unlock the front door while he's still waiting. I rush inside and when I get into the dining room the Long family are all sleeping on the floor. Kari Long, Mark's youngest sister, is awake. Their mother Murielle is awake and sitting facing out towards the street. I walk over to her. She has a partially shaven head: the sides are shaven, but are growing back. She is worried about gray hair. I tell her don't work, just grow old gracefully like my mom. Kari has a car made out of playing cards. Murielle and her husband Gary talk to Mark, who has just come in, and I about a project. It involves something in Hawaii with a piranha gun. The family doesn't act strangely seeing Mark. But I know he is dead. I say nothing.
