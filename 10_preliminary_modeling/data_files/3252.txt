I am trying to take a bath up on the mantle of the fireplace, in a tiny ceramic bowl, white. My feet barely fit in. It is slippery and small and I have nothing to hold on to. It is very difficult, dangerous and frustrating. A large mirror is on the wall facing me. I try hard but can't seem to stay balanced. In addition, people keep opening the door and walking in. I am naked and don't wish to be exposed like that to passersby in the hall. I ask them to shut and lock the door. Then I realize others have keys to the door, so they won't be stopped. I call out, "Help me, help me," as I hang by a rope, having slipped off the mantle. A man comes over and I get back on the mantle. He holds out his hand to steady me and I grasp it desperately. Then I let him help me off the mantle. I say sadly, with strong feeling, "I've never given up before." I am devastated and slip into a non-feeling, non-caring sort of trance or coma. He helps me to the next room, trying to encourage me to wake up. I do not respond. He brings in the straw or hay Xmas tree with gifts and messages from my aunts on it. I do not respond. "Mom" is looking through the hay for the broken set of keys to make sure none are lost, because I loved my car and when I wake, I'll want my keys. I see one small key has slipped deeper into the hay, and automatically start to reach out to point to it so she'll retrieve it, but remember I am in a coma and don't do it. I see what's around me but don't respond. I notice my aunts gave me pretty ornaments that are shaped like different kinds of shoes. They are pretty shoes, but why do they think I want shoes?
