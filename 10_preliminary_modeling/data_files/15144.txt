I was studying somewhere. My chemistry exam was in a few hours, and my math exam afterwards. I was talking to Mom and she was going up that way and could take me there and then back home, but then the exam was now. She finally came with Ezra. Dad came too. Mom decided to let Dad do whatever it was she was down there to do. There was a bridge over some water and there was some traffic backed up. It started to rain and it was dark from the clouds. She drove slowly and I was worried I was going to be late. I started up making up some notes for the math exam in the car.
