I was with my friend Peter. We were walking in what I thought to be Copley Place but it didn't look like Copley Place. It had other stores and restaurants. We were trying to decide where to go to eat. I was trying to suggest and figure out how to get to this restaurant that I thought to be originally in the complex but then I realized you had to go outdoors to get to it. I remember thinking it was complicated to get to but very near. But somehow I thought it was all part of the complex and related. It seemed as though I knew about this restaurant from a long, long, time ago in real life, but I can't seem to figure out what it reminded me of. (It has been sort of bugging me since the dream.) We then had to walk through quite a nice hotel lobby and there were formal dances going on. We were still trying to get to, at that point, an unknown destination. We were trying to figure out elevators and other things. A maitre'd asked us if he could help us but we thought we could figure it out. The restaurant didn't seem to be much of a priortity at that point. We ended up going outside with this unknown destination and there was a confusing, complex highway system that was impeding our journey. I thought I knew how to go under the highway to find my way but ended up going past the crossover and being confused.
