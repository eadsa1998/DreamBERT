["Rosie O'Donnell."] I am teaching a class. There are three adult students left to do their final work for the day. They are lying on a couch/bed. It is the end of the afternoon and I want to finish the day of work. I ask Rosie O'Donnell a question. She seems to be unconscious. I shake her to wake her. She doesn't wake up. I look at her more closely. There are words appearing on her skin, like she is answering the question or talking in writing. Meanwhile a student like Mateo asks permission to go to the bathroom. I am annoyed because he wears a glove like paint (blue and white) on his hand and he is waving his hand up in the air. I realize later this meant he wasn't coming back. I continue to try and wake Rosie who remains unconscious. I am frustrated.
