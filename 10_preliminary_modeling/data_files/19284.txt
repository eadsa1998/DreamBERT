I'm in our family's station wagon and it started driving down a hill towards a busy street and the brakes don't work and neither does the steering wheel. But just before I hit the busy street I reappeared in my house. I headed toward the kitchen which is down a hallway. As I leave a long dark mink-like animal came out from the other hallway that is perpendicular to the one I was in. I knew it was going to attack me but I also knew I needed to get to the kitchen. The creature leaped at me and bit my stomach and I died. Then I started floating away but I got caught against a clear ceiling sort of thing which kept me from floating away. Then I woke up. I felt odd but not really frightened. Just disturbed and rather puzzled and odd.
