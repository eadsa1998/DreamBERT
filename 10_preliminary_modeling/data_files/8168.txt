I was sleeping on the left side of my bed, facing right. Someone came into the room and had climbed up on the bed on his knees. I was trying to move my arm to swipe at him to see if he really was there or if I was imagining things. I actually felt the mattress go down as it would if someone else climbed on the bed. I finally jerked my arm.
