It was the future and it was very dystopic. I was with a girl friend and we were staying in a house. While we were out, we came across two other girls. They said they were 'good guys', but we realised they were lying and had this green rubbery thing to put over our hands. They got out while we went looking, but we got them back. We slept and kept our hands on them. Sometime after, they left during the night. It was my birthday and when I woke up, I saw they had left a note. I let one back in. One of them lived at this house. We said she could leave. We went to the front door and there was no back door. There was another opening. We threw something out and there was smoke. It was thick and started filling up everywhere outside. The backyard had wired fencing around it. We tried to breathe and choked. I ran in and grabbed scissors and cut the wire and it started to go. My friend went to the roof to fix the air filter thing. I saw other people on another roof.
