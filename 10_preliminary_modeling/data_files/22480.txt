I was in my classroom at the university and I had to take an exam, which was scheduled but which I hadn't remembered and therefore I hadn't studied for it, but had to take it. I was desperate. I didn't know anything and the professor was standing in front of me so that I couldn't even cheat. I knew absolutely nothing. The strange part of the dream is that I kept turning around and saw how all my classmates were writing, but among my classmates from the university, I also saw classmates from my high school taking the exam.
