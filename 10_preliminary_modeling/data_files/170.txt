I'm with my brother, at a fair coming up to the zoo building. There are some Highland-games sorts of things going on behind, I can see, and I thought my borther would want to see but we go on in. There are several cute furry animals we look at, and I want to get quite close, but they're pretty vicious and they want to bite me. The keeper has to keep a good hold on them.
