I was watching Firefly. They were competing against another group for something and Jayne was like "Yes! Yes!" And he was a vet and it was actually because he was getting qualified for something. The other team was like 'it's 45 to 44, it's only one point' and they thought that he cheated. Mal was looking on. Then I was with a huge group of people from different movies and shows and we were at prison and we were trying to do something (like break someone out or something). I was in a toilet with Jayne. I opened all the cubicles looking for this bad girl but she wasn't in there. I walked out and then there was a small room just before you got outside. She was in the corner and we fought. There were locks on the door and I tried to lift one up again and unlock it so that Jayne could get through. She set off an alarm and we dealt with her and then I got Jayne out of the toilet. There was a window and all the others that are climbing out the window. I thought everyone was getting away and I looked up and every window had police helicopters near them (there were heaps of people; around 50 odd). Eddie Jemison was there. At some point, Jayne and I were in bed. He kissed me for a long time with is hand under my chin and moving his hand up my leg. Then he turned and said "goodnight" and we laughed.
