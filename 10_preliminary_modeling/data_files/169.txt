I'm on a bus with a friend, very late at night or early in the morning, we've arrived at a bus termina and we're stuck at the diner - the only place open - with no transportation. She's called her boyfriend, who's come to "rescue" us, we've really had it, tired, draggy after the long ride - he takes us in hand, his poor little waifs - buys us breakfast. (He looks like Richard Masur.) Buncha food, bacon and eggs and that, piled up on those plates - he passes them magnanimously. I have to move some tables around in this place so I can eat facing away from the other customers. Coupla groups like families with kids and I can't quite fit in the middle. There was hardly anybody here at first, but lots more people are coming in.
