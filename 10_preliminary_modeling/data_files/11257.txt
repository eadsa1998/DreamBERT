I was given gas to reduce a dislocated shoulder I received playing baseball. I was trying my best to keep my mind alert throughout the anesthetic. As I was going under the effect of the gas, I remember trying to yell out that I should be recognized. There was no one present that I can remember, and I had the feeling that I was suspended in space. There was no sound, and it appeared to me that I had been able to force myself out of the gravity of society, and I was at last on the outside looking in. Everything was at a complete calm until suddenly I was jarred by a loud noise, a high pitched voice that struck me and then disappeared and finally reappeared again, going through the same cycle many times. Then I awoke with a start. While I was unconscious, I seem to remember doughnut shaped forms that kept getting brighter and darker, first the doughnut itself and then the hole seemed to change its brilliance. The light seemed to be self-contained and not reflected.
