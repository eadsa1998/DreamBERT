Mom, Ezra and I went to this shop like place. There was ice-cream which looked glow in the dark at first. This lady made us one. It was cookies and cream and was nice. There were these robot hairdresser arms. Then I was at a house. I had to leave so I pretended to storm out angrily (I wasn't allowed to leave) and I jumped into the car. I was someone else sometimes. I was combining photos of people and I did Evelyn and Darius. I had recent photos of people at school. I showed Ezra. Mom disappeared and went to this place for bad adults which was next to a place for bad kids. She got out to deal with some killer person. There was some flaming Indian thing. Someone asked this person on a horse how he could only stay with one girl. Something happened that was actually a joke and had something to do with radios in 1980.
