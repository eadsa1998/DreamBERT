I worked late and came home at night. Ann was in a room with me and other friends. She was putting on a smock and she had her back turned nude. She tried to shake down the smock and did she shimmy shake her body. I bawled her out for being overexposed in front of people. My sister Ann was there also and she was nude also. I came home and Andrey and Bob were sleeping on the floor. They awoke and wanted to come upstairs. So they did. I was walking home. I saw two newsboys put down paper money and they were shaking their papers in place. I looked up at the sky and day was beginning to break. I was driving my car. I had to stop and all at once I was standing on a hill with about 8 or 9 rows of men and about that many deep. The cop counted the rows and said ok. We ran down the hill across the tracks, then I stopped. There were two fellows running down the hill racing. One that was ahead was yelling as he ran he won. My wife walked thru the room later and the smock was open in front and she was exposed to my friends.
