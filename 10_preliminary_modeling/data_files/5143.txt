I want to attend a seminar, like the Chopra one. I line up very early to get a good seat up front. Then I am told it is being held in another spot and I go there to discover I'm a bit late and only get a spot in some other more distant section. It even requires another entrance at another field, called "Hunsaker "or something like that. I start to try and find the place to go and am told I have to take a shuttle bus thing there. As I am going to the bus stop, I tell some woman the story of how people resent people with disabilities and tell the Chopra story of the woman who said, "You have kind of an advantage, don't you?" I find a bus stop, but I'm not sure this is the right spot and I do not want to miss the bus. One comes from the wrong direction and stops and I run over to ask the driver if this is the right one or not. I nearly get hit by the bus as it pulls up to the stop. It is "articulated." He looks down at me and I can't seem to understand him, whether this is the one or not. I finally decide this is the one going to the station and go back to my spot to wait. The seminar seems so distant now. [BL]
