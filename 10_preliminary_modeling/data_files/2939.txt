I am in a small group of people who are coming up with story ideas. It is my turn and so I think back to what I'd been experiencing in the dream before and use part of that as the story. I say, "There's this military man whose father was into nuclear stuff, a professor, and he doesn't want to have anything to do with that stuff. He meets a woman who is excellent at different sports and an outdoors type. The challenge is..." I don't remember the rest. I then say, "I know it's similar to a movie I saw once." Then there is an interruption. Two teen girls come into the store to buy something. I turn to see what they need. The teacher says they are in the wrong store if they want jewelry. I say, "Oh, no, there is jewelry in this store; you just can't see it from where you are sitting." I describe what I see, which is a long wall filled with jewelry, and then the far right end has the ribbons and buttons and sewing notions he had seen. I get up to wait on the two girls, who seem to want to try on all the pretty jewelry and obviously don't have the money to pay for things. I want them to finish so I can go back and work on the story.
