I have chosen to stay behind while Frank goes on a trip with the boys; we say goodbye and I feel rather lost... shift: A former client of mine says I can use her office, and Frank and I go in a want to be alone, but she keeps returning with various tasks, i.e. bowl with yeast for bread to rise, to use the phone, etc. I feel frustrated....
