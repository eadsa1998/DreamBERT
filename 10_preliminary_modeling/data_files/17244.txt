Dreamt that, as she said she would, my obnoxious roommate Chelsea, was rearranging the furniture in our room.  She re-bunked the beds and put them in front of the windows where my computer is.  It was incredibly 'wrong'; she never asked my roommate Sally or me.  Sally's father was there, with his shirt unbuttoned.  For some reason, I hugged him.  My mother said later that it probably looked bad.  Sally was sympathetic to my plight with Chelsea.
