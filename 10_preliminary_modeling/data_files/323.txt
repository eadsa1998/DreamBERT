Robert Urich is also a gourmet chef, and he's gotten into a bet with a famous-chef friend of his that he can do something just as fast his way as his friend can. They set up a private contest, and Robert wins. All quite friendly, but the friend puts on a little miff. Robert has long hair at the moment, which he is lately wearing in a ponytail. I have been sent to go get something - his trophy? - and go to this building with an outdoor patio or something, next to a bit of parking lot, a level up, maybe head-height, and as I skirt this there's a fluffy white cat and I'm hearing (or singing) "Grizabella". I have the idea this cat is called Grizabella; I think, it's kind of a matter of taste, huh, somebody thought she was a glamour cat. But she is pretty. Inside, I'm looking for something in Lorren's apartment when she comes in - I'm surprised, I thought she was gone and I find myself thinking she thinks I shouldn't be here. Then I go to collect the (trophy?) and Robert Urich comes bustling in to get it himself, and I'm confused, but he's never one to do things the simple way anyhow - he's always like this. Later I'm going somewhere in a neighborhood and I see 2 guys I know, one of whom says something that the other should know, but as I pass him and call out, he doesn't hear me or doesn't respond. Typical of him. Later, I'm talking to someone (who's probably a therapist) - Jill and her roommate have just been here, and their problem is Jill's gotten a job managing a rock band and her being up all hours is bothering her roommate.
