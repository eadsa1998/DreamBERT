Sharon Ferguson and I are sent on an errand from Latin class.  We have to go to two teachers, and we take a hall pass.  Neither teacher is in her room, so we go out on a balcony on the second floor and accidentally drop something off.  I holler at a boy down below to throw it back up.  He throws it high enough, but way off to the right.  I don't figure he can do it, so I go down after it myself.  Then I start doing some acrobatics with some girl on the grass in the yard.  She is heavier than whoever I was previously accustomed to doing acrobatics with, and I can't hold her up.  While we are trying, two men come by in a car.  I don't know them, but I am afraid they might be from the school.  They don't stop, however.  Sharon and I finally return to class.  In a few minutes I am summoned over the loud speaker to come to Mr. Kevin's office.  I look worriedly at Sharon and go on.  I hear that I will get twelve hours detention or so.  I go to Mr. Kevin's who said " If your names are on the passes, I will let you go."  I show him our passes, and sure enough, our names are on them.  He says o.k., I can go.  I start to explain how both the teachers were gone, but he ushers me out of the office.
