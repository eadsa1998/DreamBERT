The dream for this day went like this: I was in a very big avenue, full of trees and at times full of people. At other times I was alone. And I saw a girl who is my friend whom I haven't seen in a long time, and who is now the wife of a boy who was my boyfriend. When I dream about her or dream that I see her, I am never angry at her, just interested to know how her new life is going. And the girl about whom I dream never wants to see me, or perhaps she hides from me. When I awake, I have the feeling that I am going to see her, but this doesn't happen.
