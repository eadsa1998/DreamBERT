I dreamt that we bought a drug store on the west side. Next to our store was a grocery which had the sign --J-- C-- The store waslocated on a corner and there was an empty store right next to us. I had a temporary anxiety that another drug store would move in here. Someone assured me that this wasn't true. A C-- restaurant was located not far away from where we were. We were glad that a clean eating place was close at hand. My parents and I went there for a meal. That is all I remember.
