I was in some caravan and everyone was in groups which were parts of the body. Charlene and Farrah were staying there too. I didn't have any clothes on but they were wrapped around me. This lady came up to me and two boys and said that we should join the vagina group. You have to touch the part they say to join. We got in trouble for saying no. These little beds were in one corner and there were lots of blankets. Under my breath, I said "Stupid cow". As I was getting dressed (I covered myself) I heard someone say "Look what that kid's wearing!" and I looked up and saw Eli (Children of the Corn 3).
