I am with Ernie and Ginny at some sort of concert and am walking down a gravel aisle in the bleachers. I am looking for pretty rocks and find three. I show them to Ernie, who is impressed. The first one is a single line of quartz crystals in a row. The second one is a geode kind of thing with a hole in it with crystals inside, and a third one has unusual and pretty things in it. Now I am going back up the bleachers and I see Cary Grant, who is offended by a man's political statement and Cary uses his left arm to throw a punch at him. "How Male!" I say sarcastically and witheringly. He walks down the bleachers and I follow, almost slipping on the carpeted steps.
