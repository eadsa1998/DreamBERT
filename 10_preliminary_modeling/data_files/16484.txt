I felt like I was in a house that was kind of like our house and kind of like somebody else's house. And there were a bunch of people that I didn't really know, but I felt were friendly, and they were like people I think I was trying to get to know, like college age people. And I dreamt that in my Basic Electronics class, when we passed the final exam, we were given a little card that said that you were like a certified basic person, basically. And it was shaped just like my Best Buy gift card and it had the hologram on the front, and the credentials were printed on the back. And it had a little tiny picture of the music major down in the lower left-hand corner of the back, and a little further like in the middle of the card there was a little tiny picture of like a UPC symbol on the bottom right. And I was sitting kind of in a big roly chair looking at something that was kind of a combination of a computer and a CC TV. And I put this card under my tray and I was looking at it, and three boys and two girls all around were like, "Oh wow, cool, you actually got one of these cards. Oh, my gosh!" And there was this big dog, but she was real friendly. I had a feeling it was a she; I don't remember what they were calling her, but she was big. Her shoulders came up to my chest. She liked to kind of make it so that my hand's looped in her collar, and she would pull my chair along with her as she walked. And she pulled me back a little bit.
