I was down the flats. I was in the old White building that I worked in and as I was coming out, there was a lot of broken glass on the sidewalk. I looked at it and it was the door windows and there were window washers washing windows. I said, "I guess your ladder slipped and it fell on the windows and broke them," and he said, "Yes, that's it." Audrey was eating long pieces of hair. They must have been about 14 inches long. I was driving a new Pontiac, the highest price one. Ann bought it. I didn't want a big, high priced car like that, but she did it. I was looking underneath the car and I noticed it was kind of rusted and not so good. One of the tire valves was leaking air. I tried to stop it by inserting and pushing the needle in and out of the valve stem, but it kept on leaking air. My car, an old Pontiac, was leaking oil. It was all over the dah in puddles. I was cleaning it up.
