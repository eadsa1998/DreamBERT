I called Zack to see what he was doing and if he wanted to come over. He said he was jus coming from the dollar store and he was on his way to 24 hour Nautilus to work out. I said, "By the time you're done, you will fall asleep, so forget it." I hung up the phone and was disappointed. I got in my car and went to town. I was going 31 mph in a 25 mph zone. I got pulled over by a cop I know. He came to my window and said something smart. I said, "Get real, no cop would ever give a ticket to someone for 5 miles an hour over the speed limit." He said, "It was 6 and you're lucky that I don't give you one." His attitude was mean. It made me feel even worse. I went to my mother's house, and told her what had happened. We went to dairy Queen and got a milkshake. She made me feel better.
