I went back to California with my people-to-people delegation, and the delegation from, North Carolina.  Me and Erica got to ride on these jet pack things with our partners, and we flew around the airport.  When we got to Yosemite, I had to go to the bathroom.  When I sat on the toilet, I saw this boy I know next to me going too.  I looked around and there were boys everywhere!  I was in the boys' bathroom, so I ran out.
