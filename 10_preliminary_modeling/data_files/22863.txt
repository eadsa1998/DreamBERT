I am at Grandpa's house.  Charles Wallers and I and someone else (Joe Duggan, I think) are in the front yard.  I look up in the sky on the Creagar's side and see a big, black cloud.  It forms into a black funnel-the first tornado cloud I have ever seen.  I start to run into the house, but can't get my legs to move very well.  I holler to the other two guys that a tornado is coming, but can't get much volume out of my voice.  They finally hear me, and Joe starts for the house.  Charles starts home and tries to get me to go with him, pulling me by the arm.  I keep telling him to let go-I don't know how soon it will before the tornado reaches us.  I finally get away and get to the house.  It gets pretty windy, but I don't think the funnel actually hits us.  Grandpa and I go outside, and there is just a wispy black cloud left floating over.  It is almost dark, and something hot and glowing drops onto the back of my hand, and another falls on the ground.  One is a sort of miniature jeweled dagger.  Both are 5 or 6 inches long.  By the fence in front is a saw with a yellow handle and some other tools.  I ask Grandpa if they are his, and he says no.  I can't figure it out at first, but then I remember how objects are picked up by tornados and deposited elsewhere.
