I was in a forest. Somehow I think if the hills and forests of Ireland. I came upon a clearing, where people were gathered. They all seemed strangely familiar to me, yet I could not recall who they were. They never spoke to me, nor I to them, yet I felt a deep bond with each of them, on a spiritual level. They led me to a cliff, where I could look down and see a swirling mist of colors. I fell down into this mist, and this is all I can recall.
