It was the first day of the MUPC and it was right near where school is. It was a big place. There were about 20 people altogether and we were all staying there. We also had uniforms. There were three girls including me. The other two had done drugs and stuff in Year 12 and that was their reason for failing. There was a little booth outside and I asked the ladies behind the glass if I could change a subject, as I had drama, and I also had health as one of my subjects (it was like a normal school day). We had a fridge which would contain all our food. Elijah was also there. There is a Light That Never Goes Out was playing and I heard this of it: "and if a ten ton truck kills the both of us, to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die" and I was thinking there was something wrong with the lyrics (the two sentences are from different parts of the song).
