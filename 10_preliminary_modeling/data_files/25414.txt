 I'm doing classroom observations in an English class with someone else. There is a female teacher, and the students are around 10 years old. I rip up my observation form in front of the teacher. She says to me, "Don't you want your six points?" I don't like doing the English observations. I'm not good in English. I do want the points, but I'm not going to do something I don't like and that I'm not good at. She gives me the six points on a white ripped up piece of paper, like those I have been using to mark the pages of the books that are sources for my associationism paper.
