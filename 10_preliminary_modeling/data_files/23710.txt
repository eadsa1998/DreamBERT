I dream I have gone back to the (Blue Ridge) fire crew to finish the summer.  They're playing volleyball.  And they are not happy to see me.  Also there's a dorm there, like a big college dorm and at the front desk is a young woman who I knew already and wanted to be better friends with.  But I can't remember her name.  I like her and want to be close.  I ask for the directory so I can look up her picture and find out her name.  I'm looking but another woman keeps shoving in, turning pages and interrupting me.  Finally I tell the other woman to get out of the way, I'm trying to find out this woman's name, and I'll give her the directory when I finish.  She leaves me alone.  Back outside, near the crew, all our boxes of belongings are being stacked up by delivery people.  I ask a friendly person who the woman is (at the dorm desk) and she says her name is "Slaundry Rolls". [what?!]  The woman looked like Stephanie Sloan [my friend in 2nd grade, who was more popular than me] would look if she were older, [and I can see a faint connection with the names now.]  The crew is all moving its stuff into dorm now when I realize I don't have to do this.  It suddenly dawns on me that I had quit the fire crew earlier and taken off, and was now back to work with them again, but why put myself through it?  I thought "I need the money", but then told myself I should just go apart from them and stand there and think it over and decide whether I really wanted to do this.  Later moving boxes into dorm.  I try to get info from crew members, I ask questions.  But I get poor answers, they're mean to me, and won't let me in on anything.  I hear my alarm/music in the dream.  "With You" (Tony Terry).  I like this song and tell myself again to go stand apart, think about it and Jeff (former fiance') and maybe just leave the crew again right then.  Scenes of carrying boxes up stairs and down little rungs.  And thinking 'what a hassle, I just unpacked'.
