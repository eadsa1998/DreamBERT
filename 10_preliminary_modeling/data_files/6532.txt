There was a nightclub on the penthouse floor of Smith Tower. Everyone called it "The Smith". Brad said that he for one was getting sick of stepping over piles of dried vomit, passed out drunks, and "other excretions" in the elevator every Saturday and Sunday morning, when he went downstairs to buy a paper. From now on he would take the stairs, since he only lived on the third floor, and drunk people never take the stairs.
