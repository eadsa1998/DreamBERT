I was in a    , fellows from whites, home and his mother was going to get married. He said jokingly that he would rape his mother, but she said he knows he was married for 3 months. I got some broken eggs in a container and spilled them around on the floor. Then she gave me a shot of whiskey. I wished her luck. She said, "You have to kiss the bride," so I said, "I must have another shot," and the floor and place where the glass was. It was sticky and slippery from the eggs. I was picking up drills by the handfuls. Some were glass drills. I was looking at used cars and Ernie Kolpin was driving a long car. Then I saw one. It seemed to be about a hundred feet long.
