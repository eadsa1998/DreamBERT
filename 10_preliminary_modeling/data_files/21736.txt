There seemed to be a lot of flood water around. We came to a town and the water was flooding the town. Water was running thru the streets and homes. I looked at some homes and the water was above the first floor. Mary Lasko was with us as we walked around. She jumped into a deep waterhole and as she did, she was yelling for help. I ran down close to the hole, but I couldn't reach her from there. Tom Lasko took a dive in and brought her up. I helped him to pull her out of the water. We put her head down and drained the water out of her. Then we gave her artificial respiration. She finally started to breathe. We saved her life. Tom said, "This is the 4th or 5th time her life was saved." Mary didn't like this. She walked away and there was a man who drove or rode a bicycle into the water and yelled for help again and the men around rescued him. I looked into the farm and I saw Ascot.
