I go down a flight of stairs and see a pile of scrub brushes. I drop my scrub brush on the pile (it looks exactly like my pool table brush.) The janitor gets upset and says I can't leave my brush there. I am angry and annoyed. I go down the hall with my brush and go into what used to be a classroom. It's the janitor's headquarters. I find his boss and complain about the janitor's behavior. I feel a little like a tattle tale. The boss agrees that he should have accepted my brush.
