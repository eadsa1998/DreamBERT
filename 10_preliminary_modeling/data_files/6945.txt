I went to be assigned to my room. Mrs. Jaco (manager of apartments left Apr. 1960) was at table but some one else there went in the dorm. A woman asked if I could help. I told her I was waiting for an assignment. A man came in and he was assigned his bed. I protested I was there first. A second woman in a blue print dress said she didn't know if there was any left. I looked over rumpled beds, partly occupied.
