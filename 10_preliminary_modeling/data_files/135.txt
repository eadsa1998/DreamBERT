Another bus ride, out on the edge of downtown on a dumpy little road with shacks - actually I'm with a group of women and we're waiting for a bus, or going to one, and we see a little house with a porch and a lot of clothes for sale - advertised as "Amish" [though I'm sure they wouldn't be], with lots of embroidery on cotton gauze. Nice but dubious - I'm encouraging us to go on, we need to catch our bus. Later: after a King's Feast, it's dark, lots of people I know there including Jimmy and Amanda, plus Peter Lawford and Elizabeth Taylor. Everybody's pretty drunk and leaving one by one but not going but just outside the gates and flopping on some benches to rest up. Even the serving-people are drunk. I'm hanging out with Peter Lawford; we're giggling and joking - he's still got a bit of wine in a little glass, and somebody else has a bit in a same-size glass but it's got a top like a lily with petals. Makes it hard to drink out of. I try it myself and you can't quite get it all in your mouth and it dribbles. Funny. I drunkenly remark "Hey Peter, look! Do you know we're the only ones here except for Elizabeth Taylor and...this young man?" ("This young man" is one of the serving-men, but I've forgotten his name. I'm concerned about that because I know him from somewhere else and I think his feelings will be hurt.) We shortly make our way outside - the night is quite pretty, clear, stars out, and we're all relaxing and being quite companionable. I sit down between Amanda and Jimmy, telling them to move over. Everybody's out here; the serving-people have all changed clothes now - there's Griff, sitting on a bit of fence; they're all seeing us off, sort of, watching out that we leave safely.
