I was in a gym, waiting for a free court on which to play basketball with some friends-from high school, I think.  Ronnie Engles was in either this dream or the other one.  While we were waiting, I was looking for my tennis shoes-in my closet.  I expected to have a lot of trouble finding a pair, but there were two pairs, and I got them with no difficulty.  I was really excited when we got a court.
