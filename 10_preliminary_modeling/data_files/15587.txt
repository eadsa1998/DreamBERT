I was playing a game. I escaped from this farm and jumped onto a horse, while an evil horse was trying to escape. I had to run next to lava and 'beat' the lava a lot. Then I was in a street in real life. I was with Benjamin and talking to a lady when I saw a car fall (like following a direct 45Â° angle from the ground), from the sky. No-one saw it. Then it suddenly came headfirst down into a tree near us across the street. I said 'maybe someone strong threw it' and Benjamin made a joke about The Hulk but then we saw this giant rock/clay monster roar and we ran. I hid behind a pillar and some steps but Benjamin said we needed to go high. We ran into a building across the road and up steps. We could see the top of the monster's head from the window. The roof had these 'monkey bar' type of handles to swing across. There was also a game, like a card game going on. We watched for a while. Then we had to hide and went into the other room, which went lower. Someone pointed out this giant snowman in the window who was smiling (a fellow monster, but a nice one?). Then I was in Benjamin's apartment sitting on the lounge with him. He poked my knee and I complained and he did it again and I said 'you're as annoying as my Mom' and he kept poking and we started wrestling playfully. He also stroked my leg and put his hand up my pants but I let him.
