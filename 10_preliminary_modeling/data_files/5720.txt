[1997-05-30] Then I dreamed I was sitting in front of my wife who was in a reclining chair and we were talking and started kissing and my son was supposed to be going to an amusement park later that morning ands I was asking her how he was going to get there. She said she was not riding him and we began to make plans for the rest of the day. I was thinking that we would be alone later and that it would be a good time to get some lovemaking in.
