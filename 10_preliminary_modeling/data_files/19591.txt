In Biological Survey, McAtle is influential enough to have arrangements made for certain examination (probably bird stomach examination) work to be done, even after more than a year has passed since this should have been completed. says that Mc Atle has done real well to accomplish this. My brother is in Biological Survey and he asks whether the pay in the Survey is about same as in Entomology. I say yes, about the same -- possibly a little higher in Division of Taxonomy than in Division of Food Habits Research.
