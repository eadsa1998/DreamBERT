Last night I dreamed of a sailing ship, I don't know if it was a schooner or... it was like the USS Constitution that I saw so many years ago. And I watched it sail off over the horizon, over the most beautiful bluish-green ocean and brilliant blue sky and turned around and walked away and was in some kind of field or meadow where this very, very tall lamppost with 4 lights coming out of the top of it very oddly shaped, I can't describe the shape and the lights were pointed in the 4 directions of the compass, north, south, east and west and they were on, they were bright but very, very pretty.
