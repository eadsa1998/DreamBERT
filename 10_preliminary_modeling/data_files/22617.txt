I dreamt that all of my family was at my grandmother's house and that all her grandchildren and great grandchildren arrived. I was playing with my nieces and nephews and we were talking about the present government. Then a fight got started among my aunts and uncles (as usual) and my aunt X started to talk and to criticize everybody, including my grandmother. She was furious because she felt she was being restricted by all the reforms made by the government and because she was not going to be able to travel with the same comforts as before.
