I looked at a winning sheet and I saw a wood horse as winner. We were living in our old home on #68th St. I was putting rolls in the windows and then I said, "Why did I do that?" It was for Joe Prince. He owns the house. Then Ann and I were out in the street. It was dark. We could hardly see. Ann dressed herself in a pretty dress and put on makeup. Was she beautiful.
