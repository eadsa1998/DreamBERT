I was outside at night with Mom and Rover. Rover barked and then lay down on the front porch to sleep. Mom said he barked to let her know what his bark sounded like. There was some game with a guide dog and a torch, and you had to move from area to area and I think you had to do something too. If you were caught by the torch, you lost. I had a cute little terrier thing. It kept running away though and went to sleep under Rover. I had to walk through a tunnel with train tracks. Someone had set a path, which I followed. When I got out, I saw a torch flashing outside I started down a nearby path. I went into a room and then didn't know what to do. The torch was coming closer and got me and it was Alexis Denisof and he seemed happy to get someone. His accent kept changing from English to American. I asked where I was supposed to go and he wasn't sure. My dog ran towards me and I fell backwards and almost toppled off a ledge, and it barked.
