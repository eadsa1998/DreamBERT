Reality: I am in love with a neighbor named Miriam. I dreamed that I had taken her to a movie on a Saturday and there I had declared my love, which she accepted with the condition that I wait for one week while she broke up with her boyfriend. After the week was up, she sent me a little note in which she said that she no longer wanted to break up with her boyfriend and asked me to excuse her for lying to me. After I read the note she sent, I went to her house to beg her and just at that moment, her boyfriend appeared and we had a fight at that point. I was desperate when I awoke.
