Now I'm a mobil oil gas station owner. I'm putting gas into a tank. I realize that my numbers in my pump don't register so I can't prove how much gas I give this person. I explain the situation to the owner of the pickup and ask him how much his tank takes. He looks suspiciously at me, then says, "48 gallons." I write it up. Then I call up a special trouble shooter number 00-XXX, to report the situation. I'm in Alabama and I own a gas station, motel and swimming pool and I live on the premises. Behind my beat up greasy place is a huge empty acreage with weeds. I look it over with an eye to expansion. The pool is empty and is a mere wading pool. I change it to a different place and larger.
