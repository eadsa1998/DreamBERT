I was walking down a street that supposedly was Euclid Avenue. The street greatly resembled Euclid Avenue, but was not exactly the same. I was near 105th I think. I was walking past some houses, and went into one. Then I was in what seemed to be a ground floor room of one of these houses. A boy I liked very much was being called on a loud speaker. (I do not know who this boy is, though he resembles someone I recently had a date with.) A woman was there also--she was his mother, I think. There were several puppies in a basket on the floor. I thought of playing with them, but I don't believe I actually did. Then the boy was there behind me, I believe. I think he said something about the dogs. Then I was walking down the street again and I think I waved goodbye, though no one was there. The entire dream is difficult to recall, as are all my dreams, especially since I've been trying to remember them.
