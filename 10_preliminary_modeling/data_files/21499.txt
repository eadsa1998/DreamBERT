There seemed to be an insight of an uprising. We were on St. Claire and E. 79th St. A large crowd was gathered. Two girls drove up in a jeep and threatened the crowd that if they started any trouble, they would replace this jeep into a cannon. So they went to work on the jeep and up came two cannon barrels which they said they would use if we started anything. The crowd started to disperse. I stayed and then went to look at the cannons. They seemed to be made of wood. I bought a pair of underwear, long ones, and after I had them on for a while, they seemed to be tight. I said, "I bought them large enough, but they won't stretch." I was working on the B and S and there seemed to be trouble. A fellow had a screwdriver with a round metal handle and it kept on rolling away from the job it was to be doing. Two of my machines were replaced with rebuilt ones or ones that had new, replaced parts. We were in St. Charles Church. I won a check prize and it was $10.00. It was the 2nd one out of the last 3 raffles. Come Through won and paid $23. I'm not quite sure it was this one, but I'm almost positive. Bob, two men, a woman and I were walking down a steep mountain trail. We got down so far and I changed my mind. Bob and I started back up the trail. It was steep. There was a railing on the trail and a cat went by us up the rail.
