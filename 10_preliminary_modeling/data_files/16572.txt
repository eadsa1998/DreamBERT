I can only remember bits and pieces of it, though. I woke up in the middle of the night and kind of laid for a while, so some of it got lost. But I remember first that I dreamt that I was here and that Jill's parents were coming to take care of a signature she needed on a check or something. And she was vacuuming my room with a little dust buster thing that made kind of a high squeaky kind of sound, and when they walked in, everybody said, "Hi." And I said, "Hi" back. And she said, "I know Jasmine will enjoy having you." If they really were coming, I would have enjoyed having them. And before that, I think I was back in Westport and I was standing on the back hallway, I actually was in the kitchen looking out at the back hallway and there was a kitchen standing in the back hall, looking in at us. I remember saying something like, I don't remember, I think we were going to go somewhere and do something, I don't know. After that we were in this fancy restaurant with a family that we knew. I think it was Melinda's family. It was Mom and Dad and I and Melinda, and we were eating this fancy food. I had this little stuffed dog that I was thinking of buying from the restaurant, and it was $90. And then I decided, that is ridiculous. I am leaving that darned thing. Before all that I have a vague memory that I dreamt that I was in this, in the area, in the balcony area that overlooked like this big open space. I was up there with a few other people and Alex was setting up this live rig and he was going to give a demonstration to people that gathered down in the open space. I think I was standing around in the way watching. He had a mixer and a big, heavy PA system, and that's about all I can remember.
