I dreamt I was going to the university. When I got there some students were starting to riot due to a fraud that had been committed. The university was the Museum of Art, and the students were assembled in a round park in front of the Museum. Suddenly they started to throw stones and the guards who were policing intervened. They started to shoot and then I started to run. I ran and ran through a street with no pavement and suddenly I was in a big avenue where I found my grandfather who asked me where I was going in such a hurry and what was happening. When I dream about streets and avenues, they are sunny, including the park and the art museum In the dream are in a combination of yellow and beige tones, a sunny kind of day.
