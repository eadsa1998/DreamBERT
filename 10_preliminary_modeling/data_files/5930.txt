Am in a supermarket and smoking a big cigar. Everyone looks as I walk by and seems delighted with odor of smoke. One elderly lady in particular looks up as I pass and smiles. I ask clerk for two 20-lb sacks of flour. He loads them on a shopping cart and I note one is leaking badly. He says it is only a small leak and I protest that it is a large leak, and I hold up the one bag which by now is only 1/4th full. He gives me another full bag and I walk towards exit. There is a can of coke in the cart and I am now eating an ice cream cone. Decide to drink the coke and exit from food area with one hand holding the coke can and cone as I swig from a straw, while other hand pulls the cart.
