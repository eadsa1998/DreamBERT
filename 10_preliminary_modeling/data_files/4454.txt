["Studying for a test."] I am in a room and preparing for a test. It seems to be about Geography, Flowers and Making Candles. I am looking through papers in a notebook to find info and read through past homework. I can't seem to find the papers I need that have the important info. I enjoy looking at the different candles and flowers and then realize I need to be focusing on the geography information. I feel concerned I am not studying properly. I won't be prepared.
