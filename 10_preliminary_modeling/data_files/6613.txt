On a steamer passing many islands. I identify some of the lesser Hawaiian islands but can't one. Inquire and am told it is "A-pi-it". On the rocky edge of a crater climbing. It is dark and dangerous. Ask, "Isn't it usually dark?" "It is." We are trying to get photos. Looking at two photos of mountain scenery, very like each other but of two different places. "Come around this point and look up the valley and you'll see the falls." It is the we reach the crater edge. Ask if we can't get in from lower story. Then see some of our group running across the floor of the crater. They look very small. The third person descends to catch. She is so foolish to run like that when tired from climbing. See a long flight of stairs leading into crater. Person turns into insect... At a party set table showing Pit-Pat pictures in my big scrapbook. Her mother calls her by some other name. Ask her about her name and am told several nicknames for her. There is a fussy doily put on and off the table. Pit-Pat wants a drink. Jr. Is complaining about a rusty buckle. Can't keep his pants up as buckle is broken. Has to wear old suit. Marked contrast to well-pressed new blue suit and the shabby old one which is not good enough to wear in the steamer. Heavy dark man, a German, is talking to me about his planned trip East to see Edison and various 'phone business' places.
