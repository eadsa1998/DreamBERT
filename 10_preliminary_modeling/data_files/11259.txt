I was sitting in a large banquet hall which was unfamiliar to me. There was a group of my friends around me. They were all males. Connie Mack was sitting on the lap of one of my fraternity brothers. At the same table I was sitting were three of my friends, all of which I haven't seen for about a year. One fellow in particular was a friend that moved to the west coast nearly two years ago and whom I have failed to correspond with for these two years. There was food on the tables, and I could make out the fruit salad and the natural colors of the fruit. Nothing in particular was being done by anybody present. It was as if I had an instantaneous picture of what was going on.
