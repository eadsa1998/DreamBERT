I was watching Supernatural. Sam fell asleep and Dean woke him up. They were after something that wasn't human (I think it was a dog or something). It could so something 'supernatural' and they were trying to talk to it. Sam was then in the car with some girl and Jess was in the back. These police told him that his car was leaking gas. Sam was saying to someone "it is better to tell the truth than lie".
