Marissa Camden = Frank's mother in looks, behavior and speech. She visits us for dinner. Frank has made a wood coffee table out of two pieces of scrap wood. I compliment him on it, but laugh. He offers to serve dinner, he carries many trays in an elaborate balancing act! He falls and spills something, but picks them up. I help him. Then there are two girls waiting to go to the Sr. Prom; I send them away; also see Zena play in brown mud - planting??
