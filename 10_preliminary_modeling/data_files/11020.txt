This dream was completely confusing and uncorrelated. Only a few of the details stand out in my mind, while the others remain obscure. I recall being in Saks 34 St., a department store in N.Y.C., with a few friends of mind. We were all trying on dresses when suddenly we heard an explosion coming from the distance. At this point my dream began to wander between two definite themes--one having to do with something concerning the United Nations building and another having to do with a boat smuggling dope in N.Y. harbor. I don't recall any of the details, except that it was a Coast Guard boat firing on the boat with the dope, which seemed to cause the explosion, but where the various details met I cannot seem to remember.
