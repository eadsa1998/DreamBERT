 I'm moving into the new house Whitman House near Brimson. I arrive, and am living with my friends Norman Noman, Stephen Ramos, and a woman named Katie from the Seafare Restaurant in the Big Resort Area. Katie shows me upstairs. Norman's room has lots of sports equipment and other stuff on the floor. Stephen and I are supposed to share a room upstairs. It has brown carpet and walls. The color seems like it's a cheesy brown from the 1970's. There is a bed for me. Stephen's things are all set up, including shelves and posters. I want to check out the room in the basement first before I move upstairs. On the way upstairs a woman comes in the basement from the outside through a door. Outside the door is dirty, broken glass bottle area. Someone commented on how we should be sure to lock the doors.
