I was at this place outside and it was night. I had this job which Chuck (Gossip Girl) had gotten for me. We were at this gate which we had to guard and he gave me a beer. These guys came and they asked me if I wanted to be working here and I said not really. Chuck then was a Jason Bateman look-alike, but didn't really look like him and he said "Why did I have to roll you!", which I deciphered as he had to choose someone for something and had rolled a dice. I was arguing with him and we both stormed off together. We were then at this place with computers. He said something about us getting married and I said "We don't have to get married" (he figured because we were 'enemies' we would get together). I was trying to make a sandwich.
