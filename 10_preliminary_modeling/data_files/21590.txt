We were painting the rooms and wanted tos ee where to start, so there would not be a mark. One room we couldn't find a mark, so we were going to paint that room for the finished coat. I was lying in bed thinking who would win the d.d. at Ascot. 1 for the 2nd race and 3 for the 1st race. 31dd. I went over by Frank Zypanick. His blonde wife seemed to be stout. I was going to wash walls and windows. Then Mike Catcher came over and two other fat men. They were bragging who was the stoutest. There were some stout or fat horses won and I played them. I was working next to Otto who was running an acme and the spindle was high overhead. I told him if a short fellow was operating it he would have to use a stepladder to get a bar in. There was one acme that had 7 or 8 spindles. I was going to ride on a streetcar, which all the employees did. It was waiting for me.
