I was signed up for a film class.  I was trying to exchange it for Calc BC.  Someone asked about my book and I told him if I successfully switched classes he could have it.  My longtime classmate Gabe was there, and it sounded like he was planning on teaching a piano course.  I was somewhat interested and asked him when it was.  He started listing a bunch of different times; it depended on how things worked out.  I realized it was unlikely I would be able to take the course.  Then I was with my mother, but still at school I think.  My left eye felt irritated or dry, and my mother suggested putting something in it.  I found our cat Buster's Genteel (eye moisturizer) in my pocket, and put some in my eye.   I looked at the tube again and saw a warning, "Lethal to humans" on it.  I held a glass of water to my eye and tried to wash it out.  My mother took me to the campus health center. We were worried, but having attempted to wash the medicine out we didn't seem to think I was going to die despite the lethal warning.  I looked in the mirror while waiting for a doctor.  The iris of my eye seemed to be yellowish and disintegrating.  A woman nurse or doctor came in and looked briefly at me, and then we went to a further part of the room.  I looked at my eye again.  Now my iris appeared intact, but my pupil looked as if it were melting.  The doctor said something and I looked back.  I was sitting naked and looked down at myself.  My breasts and thighs were bright red and my nipples looked swollen.  I looked back in the mirror at my eye.  I was worried about what would happen to it.  My pupil looked like a heavy black bubble hovering low in my iris.  It was really interesting to look at.  I was intrigued by it despite the danger I was in.
