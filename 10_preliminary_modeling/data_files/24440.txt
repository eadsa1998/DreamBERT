I am trying to squeeze into a small English sports car. It keeps moving and I say, "Fuck You" to the driver. He returns and challenges me to a fight. We are in the garage of Bob's parents. I am full of confidence and cunning. Outmaneuvering the other fellow, I stab him in the back with a knife and say, "Give up or I'll kill you." He yields and I help him outside and dress his wounds.
