       I'm leaving, and Lisa is with me. We're going to get something to eat together, and she's driving. We're going into an old neighborhood and it's dark and the feel of the place is that I've gone back in time to Grandmom's neighborhood. Lisa says something, responding to me, that is very typically Pleasing-type, and I react amused, and comment on it. She doesn't know about this, so I explain a bit and also make clear that there's nothing wrong with it, it's just that it's so recognizable. [What she said was in response to me expressing some kind of discomfort and she offered ways to help, but I don't know what it was that I'd said.] We get where we're going, which is a kind of drug/grocery store, small, old-timey, and I live there, or at least I keep my groceries there. I have an ice chest and something else and I'm looking at a couple of large chocolate cakes, sheet size, with chocolate frosting and nuts on top, they're probably more ie than cake. I don't remember how I got them, but I wonder what I can do with them besides eat them all at once like a glutton. I have an inspiration: I'll keep them and have them at a party! No, 2 parties! Considering how big they are, they'll do very well - even cut in half they'll serve a lot of people. I can freeze them until then. I'll cut them in half, and they'll fit in the ice chest better since they're a little too big the way they are. I open the lid and see that the ice is mostly melted. Oh dear, I can't put cake in there. Even wrapped up the best possible way, it won't prevent it from getting soaked eventually. I'll have to think of something else. Meanwhile I notice that my space is being a bit further limited by the produce/cold case that's been shoved further forward and now forms a part of my area = I remark to Lisa that what's in it isn't mine after all, but the store people probably just didn't think how awkward that is.
