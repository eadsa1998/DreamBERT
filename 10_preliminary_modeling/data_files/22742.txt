I dreamt of my cousin (girl); she and I were going to follow her brother because he was going to be with his gang and I think that the motive for us following him was to see if he was going to smoke pot. The surroundings in which this took place were kind of dark, because when I looked at her, all I could see around us was black. There was nothing around us. My cousin suggested that we each go different ways (I had thought we were going to go together), but I got scared. It was 10 o'clock at night. Then she told me: "You follow him, I'll go by bicycle, through an unknown place." Then I don't remember.
