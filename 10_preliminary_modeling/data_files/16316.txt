I was at the stadium with Melinda and I was looking for Benjamin's office and I was going up these stairs and we had to go up the stairs in the dark. And I was like totally making sure that I did not lose my balance. I was like crawling on my knees going up these stairs. And I had to go up to the fourth floor and there was like nothing on the fourth floor. So I came down to the third floor and then I got on the elevator and went up to the fourth floor, and which I found their offices. And I went in the office door and I looked around and I didn't see anybody I knew. So I turned around and I came out and I went out into a parking lot and I went back to school with Melinda and Mom and Dad were waiting there. They said that they had been waiting there for about two hours and they were having a little t______ on where I was. And they had been sitting there like having a picnic, and then we all got in the car and we came home. And I had this like -- I don't know what you want to call it -- this like walking, talking stuffed animal that I had to test. It was like a Furby except it had a man's face for the baseball team for some odd reason. [laugh] And I was getting ready to test it.
