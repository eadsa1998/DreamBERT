I went to the shop. I was in a car/motorbike with Ezra, a guy and a girl. Ezra and the guy went in and we waited. Two guys were trying to seduce us and she went with them. Then I was in a church and she was a cop and was Torres from Lie To Me and it was a set up. Then it was One Tree Hill and some of the characters were in a car. Nathan thought it was a set up, but they started walking and he jumped out in front and fell. He got hit and ended up with a pole through him and a big snake wrapped around him.
