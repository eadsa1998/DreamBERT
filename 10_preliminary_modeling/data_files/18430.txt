In the first dream I recall, I was visiting a friend in what seemed (at times) to be my hometown. The friend was somebody like Buddy Krone (who I haven't seen since I was 13 or so). The two of us alternated throughout the dream from being kids to being young men-about-town types. We got some sorts of ice cream cones at a stand on the street (except both chunks of ice cream came out of some sort of bottle) and then went upstairs (3rd story) to his apartment (his parents' apartment for a while, as we seemed kids). He seemed to have quite a bit of $ and a fancy apartment, with castle-like attributes. He was showing me around. There was a woman there who was his mistress. We all watched some people in the next apartment (which looked like a window in a cliff) do some rock climbing up and down their wall. The place seemed to be a tower now, and I was suggesting to Buddy that he needed some colored floodlights in the most to make it look pretty at night. Buddy goes off somewhere, I am staying at his apartment several days. I am not sure whether his mistress stays. I have a fantasy in the dream (with some reality to it, but not much) about going out with some prostitute for sex, but finding it dissatisfying. There was a recurrent theme through much of the night's earlier dreaming. I and my wife would be with some other couple for both social and therapeutic reasons, and there's always something written out which I should do to get things going according to the program, but I never quite get a good look at the program or remember what it is I'm supposed to do....
