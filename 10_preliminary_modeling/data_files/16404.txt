I was in bed in this strange place, and Mom came up and I was kind of half asleep and half awake, and started picking the scab off my foot with tweezers and it hurt so much and I screamed. And then she was gone. So then I was out to find her. So we were staying in these like three or four level house unit things, like we were exploring across the street from the park on 5th Street and I saw that it was becoming daylight by the time I got out there. And Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce had one and they were sitting out on their front porch. But I couldn't find the one for Mom and Dad and there were a lot of them that didn't look like anything. So then I was just trying to run back and find mine and I couldn't. I couldn't find -- there were like ten of these things in a row and I couldn't find mine. And then I sort of woke up.
