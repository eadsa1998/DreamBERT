I was in Hawaii with my husband. My husband was Craig T. Nelson, from TV. We were at an outdoor cafe or restaurant. We were sitting at a small square table, for two or four, I'm not sure which. We were sitting across the table from each other. The waiter at one point brought some lobster. He said he had two for each of us. I said, oh no, one is more than enough for me. He went ahead and gave me two of them, or he gave me one and gave Craig my second one. We were eating this lobster. We were very much in love and being very affectionate. I decided that when the waiter came back I was going to ask him to move my place setting to the side of the table so I could sit closer to Craig. They were also playing Island music. At one point it was very, very fast. At this point it was as if I had a bird's eye view of the island. I could almost see it vibrating, see the earth vibrating. I said, Gosh. If they keep this up they are going to create a whole separate island. There also seemed to be a child, maybe 9 or 10 years old, maybe younger, I don't know. I don't know who the child with. He had been putting food down this hole in the ground. He had been doing it because he realized that there were people living down where this hole led. So he was giving them food. When Craig realized that he had discovered this people in there, he told the boy not to tell anyone. that it would have to be our secret. When I looked at the whole, it was as though you were looking into someone's basement. You could see a tile floor that you might see in a home basement. That's where these people were. I have the sense that they weren't supposed to be there but they were living there and hoping not to be discovered.
