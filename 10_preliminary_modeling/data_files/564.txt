I am eating at a Cafe which was a high school hangout when I was a kid. But it seems I am working since I have to cover a Christmas party at the grade school in my hometown. Jerry, a former boyfriend, gives me a ride. He seems to be a new boyfriend in the dream. I decide to walk to school. It is 12:40 p.m. and I realize I forgot my computer glasses at the cafe so I walk back. On the way I meet some girl who is upset because her mother wants her to act like she is 11 years old when someone comes to see them about buying a house. She doesn't want to do this. I get the glasses and the cafe is still crowded. I have a clear, pink uniform on and something like long underwear underneath. I go back to the school and work.
