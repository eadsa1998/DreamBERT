I was in Bali, and only Bali people were allowed to food after 5pm. I was there with school. I was in the bath watching Mr and Ms Smith. There was a wasp like the one from Donkey Kong Country. I was also at these netball courts and I sat around. There was a big K-Mart and a McDonald's nearby. Mr Nixon was around.
