A man has found a diamond or gold mine. Lydia and I are black birds. We are going to follow the man and find the riches. He sees us hiding and picks us up. We become his pets. Down into the mines we go. Other men try to follow but he loses them. There are 27 turns to get to the "Y" and then 145 more turns after that. He gathers up the diamonds and stacks them up. He sneaks them past the men. One night it becomes clear he can't sneak past the men. He has to try and remember the 145 turns to get through the other way. We go. He nearly dies. We see the opening, and we drag him to it. We turn into 2 beautiful women to help him. She has black raven hair and snappy black eyes. I am a perfect blonde, with blue eyes. We feed him water from our hands. He regains consciousness and falls in love with me.
