I awoke (in the dream) and asked what time it was. A woman replied, "Quarter to 3." I asked why she did not wake me earlier. Can't recall her answer. The room was unfamiliar, yet I thought or acted like I was at home. When I got up, I found a lot of kids (college age) in the living room. They all were students who were actors in a play now being produced at the Ring Theatre. I looked at each person trying to identify them by their role. They were paired off and I felt let down when a girl I was fond of was with a guy. One fellow named Larry, who is in my Drama class, was the most distinct person recognized. I said to them all, "I just want to tell you how much I enjoyed your production." Then I left the room. [angry, surprised, pleasant, no color]
