I watched a Finnish movie called Lichtenstein and it was really good. I was watching The Big Bang Theory and Sheldon did something 'bad'. His father yelled at him. He took his shirt off and held a button out and Leonard said to Penny 'he wants you to do it' and it was a symbol of kindness? She took her shirt off. I said to Ezra that 'Sheldon was like me at the beginning, now they've just turned him normal'. I was secretly putting on foundation. It was over almost all of my face and was red. It was going a weird green colour and was scaly. I washed it off and got some on a towel.
