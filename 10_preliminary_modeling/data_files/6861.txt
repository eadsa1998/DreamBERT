I pass two people sitting in the patio and start up the very wide steps of the Home (King's Daughter's home where I am now and where Miss Drum has lived and where I then visited other friends. Quiet hour really 1 to 2:30 p.m.) to see my fiend. They call to me I can't visit now. It's quiet hour until 4 p.m. I thought it was over at three. I came back and said I wanted to find out if Miss Drum (now dead) was still in 132. They said I could ask at the office. I find no one there and tell them so. One of them rises and says she will phone Emily, does so and I learn that Miss Drum is still in 132.
