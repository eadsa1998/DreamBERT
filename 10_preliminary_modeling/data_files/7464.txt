Mary is dressed in a very loose-fitting, old, one-piece dress. It is slashed in the side and she's wearing nothing underneath. We are each in a pleasant, teasing mood. I think Mary has something in her hands ---a large platter. It's as if she's preparing a meal. I approach her, take her in my arms and kiss her. I reach under her dress and feel her soft, warm body; just as it had felt when she was alive. I felt good -- happy -- holding her.
