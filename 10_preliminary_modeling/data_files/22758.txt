After about two hours, I remembered another dream. I was going up a carpeted staircase and I wasn't wearing any shoes. On the first floor there was a beauty shop and on the second floor there was a doctor's office. I went up, I went in, everything was carpeted. It looked like a beauty shop, but inside there were all kinds of medical instruments. In the lobby there was a secretary who asked me some things in English. I understood everything and answered her in English also. I felt happy about that.
