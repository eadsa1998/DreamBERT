I am a famous movie star and occasionally lecture at grade schools. I'm in my wheelchair. My chauffeur picks me up, in my van. We talk as he drives toward my mansion. He's new and takes the wrong turn. I give directions. I tell him to turn into the left land before we pass the columns or we'll be on the wrong road. He doesn't understand and doesn't turn in time. We curve around another way. I say it's o.k. even though I'm annoyed. I've made that mistake before too. Up here, turn right. I ask for my mail. He gives it to me and I open a small cardboard envelope that surprisingly has sexy black little bikini underwear. Another has a lace see through under skirt. I will it to be red. It slowly changes. I hold it up to me and I'm a little plump but I slowly change until I look sexy. The driver is smiling and asking what did I get in the mail? I see a toenail clipper and say I got that and industriously clip my toes! We turn right on 7th street. I say, "This isn't the right way." We have to go back to the intersection.
