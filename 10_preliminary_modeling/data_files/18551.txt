There was a hot air popcorn machine on the counter. I was making popcorn. Jack was holding the electric cord from the vacuum cleaner next to the socket, waiting--ready to plug it in when the popcorn was done, because it would blow a fuse if they were both on at the same time. When I finished the popcorn it was in a bowl balancing in the sink and I accidentally turned the water on the popcorn and it got all squishy and sogged down to crunch kernel mush in very bottom of the aluminum pan, so I had to do it over. Jack was very annoyed with me because he was losing valuable vacuum time. I was getting ready to go running when Janeesha came by with her buddy and invited me to go along to supper. Her friend came with her and I heard her mention a Bleffel gathering from South Carolina. And I said, "That's my family." And she said, "You know Jimmy Bleffel?" And I said, "My grandpa was Charlie." She turned white and had palpitations and she had to go back home. We waited an hour and 45 minutes for her and I was mad. I missed my run--so I decided to go running even though it was getting dark. On the escalator off ramp, girl tourists were sitting on the ramp and I screamed, "Are you crazy? Don't block the ramp!" A guy with crutches was trying to maneuver around them. I went to get my running shoes and they were hanging from the ceiling from a string. Guys getting ready for football practice were there and one had very powdery lemonade. He poured 1/2 full of a plastic cup and he said, "Kill it." And I said, "No. I'm going to pour it on my blisters. He said, "Oh." They were suppose to be decorating the Christmas tree but they were doing a lazy, half-assed job. Flags were stuck out to the sides. They were in a football pile-up and I was trying to rig the Christmas tree flags (red) up vertically at least.
