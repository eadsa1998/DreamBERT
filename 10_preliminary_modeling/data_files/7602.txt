I was the owner of a new restaurant. I was going around to the tables asking the patrons if everything was okay. At one table were two men. I sat down with some friends at a nearby table and could overhear their conversation. One asked the other what he thought of me and his answer was, "Magnificent." When they got up to leave, he came by our table to say thank you and shake my hand. After shaking my hand, he held it for a few seconds. I was having trouble with some of the employees not getting along with each other. They wanted to quit because of that and/or because of changes at the restaurant. Through conversations, they all convinced themselves to stay. There was some problem with the customers. We were serving too slowly. We also rectified that situation.
