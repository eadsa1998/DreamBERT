I was working on html coding for the CAS website. Some kind of code that was a response to people filling out a form or placing an inquiry through our website. I don't know if it provided the person who was filling out the form or placing the inquiry with a response or if it just provided us with some kind of notification that people either A) did not fill in part of the form or if B) they wrote something specific in the form. It seems also that toward the end of the dream I started thinking, Oh. This doesn't work the way I think it does or It's not going to work the way I want it to or the way I thought it would.
