In this dream I was in a large room, which was filled with people, it seemed as if it was some sort of a rally. I remember borrowing a white soft sweater from one of the girls, who is about 24 yrs old and also a nurse. Then I went over and sat on the floor, and I found that I able to sit with my legs crossed which I can't do in actuality because of a congenital condition, and I was so amused and surprised -- I kept telling every one and showing them how I could sit. In the dream some one was displaying objects which could be sold, for some purpose or another. She held up a pair of stockings, nylons, and I remember every one made a rush to get a pair. But I did not go, but remained sitting.
