I am at a Marilyn Monroe show with people dressed in fancy clothing. I am playing a trick with the fancy gowns, trying to fool some kids. I get into trouble with my husband. The Marilyn Monroe show plans to show people with a "psychology start". I have a question about the show and try to call a 300 number (yes- 300 is correct). Someone answers and says "McDonalds" and they ask how late are you open? Somehow I get an answer from this.
