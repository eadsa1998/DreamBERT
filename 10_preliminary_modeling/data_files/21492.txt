I went down to see the boys in the flats, my friends or fellow workers I worked with over 30 years. I saw a foreman setting up a turret lathe. He was driving flat pieces of steel on pins on a big Chuck. Then one of his many oil nipples was clogging, but he finally got it going. I met Laddie and Charles C. I talked with them. Charles was up near the rafters and so was I. I sort of slipped and grabbed for a ladder, which was up past Charles. I yelled at Charles, "Get hold of it because I'm going to slide it down to the main hits right and stops," which it did and we climbed down. Charles made a flip over on the ladder and then climbed down. He was dressed clean and then he stuck out his chest. I said, "Are you boss now or did you change clothes so early?" He put his finger up to his lips to be quiet. I later was taking out some chips to one of the trucks outside in a shovel. I met Cecilia Lippert outside. She was talking to a friend and said, "I haven't got it." I spoke up, "Can I look and see if I can find it on you?" Her face got red. She blushed and so did I. I looked at a car parking near and a policeman was watching us. I was going to go talk to her, but she now sat in a car with a small baby in her arms and a lady sat in the rear seat of the car. Bob and I were in church.
