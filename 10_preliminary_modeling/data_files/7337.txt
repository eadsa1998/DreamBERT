As she left, I said, "I hope you are prepared for rain as it is raining now." But it had stopped raining so we went to the meeting at the church next door by the side entrance. We took armchairs in the front row and R. was to have a part in the service. There were four chairs vacant so I asked Jo and F if they couldn't share one so as to leave one for mother. I thought I saw Miss Wh. coming with her crutch but as she drew nearer, I saw it was a stranger. After a while R went looking for mother and on her return said she was back there with L. I thought I should sit with them but when I went back, their pew was full so I returned but then my deaf ear was towards the speaker so we went to a pew nearby.
