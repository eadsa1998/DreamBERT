We were eating dinner at-the dormitory. The menu was baked beans mixed with spaghetti, cole slaw, and rolls. The waitress was giving out extra rolls, and gave three of the girls at our table four or five extra ones, putting them in their laps. The rest of us were angered at this, for that left only a few for the rest of us. When the plate was then passed to me, I took two rolls, feeling a little guilty but rationalizing by observing that they were small. Later, one of the girls who had received the extra rolls said that she didn't know why the waitress had given her so many, and that she didn't think she could eat them. We continued to eat the rest of the meal, and just as I was chewing the last mouthful, I woke up. Also, somewhere in the course of the dream, I was telling one of the persons on the news staff of the R-- how to go about chasing stories that hadn't come in by the deadline, I told this to him in greater detail than I remember thinking it out consciously.
