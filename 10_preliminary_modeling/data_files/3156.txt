I am doing an absurd skit with Justin. We run about the garden looking at trees and making jokes. He says we must only look for the A tree and the B tree. I run around in an English way with an English accent and say, "Oh where could the 'A' tree be? Oh, here it is." He follows me around closely, trying to be the tree. I ignore him. "Oh, where is the 'B' tree? Here? No, here? No, ooh here it is, no, that's a bee, an insect, not a tree. Then here? Now here's an interesting tree! Look over there, it has a very interesting root structure, if we only could see it. We lay down on the ground and he picks up the bottom of the raised root structure (like mangrove trees) and I snicker and say, "Oh I must be wrong," but if it were the right tree, then it would be all raised and interesting. We are laying there next to each other, teasing. A man opens the door and stares down at us. Finally we get up and he glares and says, "Are you going to do this again?" We humbly say no, trying not to laugh. "Good," he says dourly and slams the door. We giggle and Justin says, "Where is a kissing tree?" I laugh and go to him and put my arms around him and kiss him saying, Here. I found one, a kissing tree." [BL]
