I'm talking to a woman. It's Mary. She asks me to look at her face and shows me first one side and then the other. She is smiling and happy and asks me, "How does it look?" She explains that she had had something done to her face (I can't recall what) and she wanted feedback from me as to how she looked. I say she looks fine, and indeed she does. It seems to me her face is heavily tanned -- her skin color is darker than normal. Then, next, I am searching through the house, looking for Adam. I'm standing in the doorway of a room and looking in the direction of another room -- or is it a washroom? The door of the room I'm looking at is closed. I call out, "Is that you, Adam?" and a voice answers, "I'm in here, Dad. I'm coming out." Before he comes out, I can't figure out whether the voice is that of Adam or Robert. Then Adam steps out of the room, assuring me that he's OK.
