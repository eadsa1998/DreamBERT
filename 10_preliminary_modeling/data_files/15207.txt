Mom opened up a pet shop thing. There was a small circular ramp leading inside and you had to crouch. There were mice and snakes etc. Ezra was there. A snake climbed inside a mouse. I ran up and asked Mom what to do but she wasn't listening. I asked why I hadn't been given a job there. There was a new band called 'New Brothers' and it was made up of 'the three remaining Beatles' and another guy. The only dead Beatle was George. Someone mentioned that one was no longer with us and everyone was silent and got upset.
