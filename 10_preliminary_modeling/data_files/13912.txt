I was leaving 'school' with Ezra. I called Mom to ask if she was here yet because I needed her to look for some X-Files thing, but she was already there. I got in the car. I Wanna Be Your Dog was on two stations on the radio. I was reading That's Life and this girl won a date with David Duchovny. There was a video of it and he kept looking away from her and looked bored. I asked Ezra about the 24 parody with the day off and he said "Is this your card?" and I didn't understand and he said "take it to the left" and I realized what he was talking about. Ezra had broken stuff under his bed so it could get fixed.
