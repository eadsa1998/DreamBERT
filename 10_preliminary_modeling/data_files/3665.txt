I have hired two men to work as my personal assistants while I am in class. One is Paul (from acting class) and one is a Chicano man. I come in late and fuss with my stuff and don't pay much attention to the teacher. Then Paul comes over. He is angry at me. He says I don't want to work with you any more. You're not really interested in the classes, you only want the attention. I am offended and uppity. I say, "I don't care if he quits, I hardly use him anyway. I do things myself." He walks away, but hangs around watching me in disapproval. Meanwhile I ask the Chicano man to do something and I realize I haven't bothered to pay him for weeks. I try to figure out how much I owe him. I hadn't really used his services for a long time but I did keep him on the payroll. So I write a check for $45, after deliberating if I should given him the third week, since I couldn't remember how long it was since I paid him. I decide to do the right thing and guess on the generous side. He is happy and Paul is impressed that I still have some humane values left. I try to enter the class like a regular student, not being late and making a fuss.
