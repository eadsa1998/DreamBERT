I was in a schoolyard (the schoolyard of my 12th year). It was very sunny out in the yard. There were a great many students in the yard. They were not grade school pupils, but they were instead college students. I felt that it was Indiana University. I then went into the office as they handed me a class card. I then found myself in another room. This was a classroom and I found that I had signed for a course in typing and Dr. Harris of the philosophy dept. here at Reserve was the instructor. I asked him if he hadn't taught at Reserve and he said that he hadn't. While talking to him I was making side comments to the class. One that I can remember is that I said I'll bet I COULD pass this course if I played football. And they replied, "Well, why don't you?" Then they noticed how small I was and laughed. Here the dream ended.
