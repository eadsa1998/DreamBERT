Somehow I am out in the driveway behind my childhood home.  I look down and find some of the Matchbox cars we used to play with out there when we were kids - that purple one, a truck, others.  I remember these cars, the names we gave them, how special they were.  I think - 'they have been hidden or lost out here all this time' and I start to pick them up.  Then my middle sister comes around from the front yard.  She is drumming (Taos drum) and excited about discovering this new drum technique with her hands.  She shows me and finishes it off with a flourish, with a plastic ten-inch square cookie-cutter type thing that she draws along the bottom of the drum for a final roll / swish sound.  It's beautiful but I am preoccupied by something else - an earlier dream image, the toy cars, or it being out of character for her.  So I don't join in her enthusiasm, just watch.  Mom appears on my left then.  Note:  The cars - when I woke I felt the cars had to do with letting go of old (childish?) attachments = Jeff maybe; old loves.
