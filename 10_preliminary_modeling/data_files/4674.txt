["Greek school."] I am in a group of people in an open courtyard thing. We are learning different things. At one point I observe a policeman presenting a delicious all white cake with lots of sweet frosting to a young woman having a B'day. But I see the cop take the biggest and best piece out of the center and eat it. This is unfair, but the woman does not protest. I eat a small remaining piece. It is very sweet and soft and delicious. Now I see a large gargoyle statue climbing up an outside wall of this Greek like building. Some large being at the top kicks at some rubble and it all tumbles down on the gargoyle. Now a group of people are discussing issues. I watch one man in particular in the group. He watches me with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. We are attracted to each other. I listen carefully. Then someone from the group asks me a question. I am surprised because I'm not a member of the group. But I answer. The man wears a Greek fisherman's hat and moves closer. We are sexually attracted. Apparently at the end of this festive occasion there is a conga line dance and everything is sexual. He has a dildo massage unit and suggests we take turns with different ends on it to best pleasure each other. I'm looking forward to it.
