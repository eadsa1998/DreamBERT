I was going shopping with a girlfriend for a present for a boy I date. We were in a store which itself was a cross between a department store and a dime store. We looked at a couple of ties first. One was a narrow gray tie, the others were white with a design in a slightly darker shade. I didn't like any of the ties and we then looked at sweaters. The one sweater which I did consider was a brown plaid sweater. While deciding, we also picked out a roll of gray wrapping paper with blue ribbon. I couldn't decide whether or not to take the sweater because it had to go with a cocoa brown suit which I knew the boy had. The salesgirl came over and cut off a piece of ribbon so that I could find another piece of ribbon that length which would match the color of the suit. We decided not to take the sweater as it was wool and too heavy and left, taking with us the wrapping paper and the ribbon. We sort of sneaked out as we were afraid the salesgirl might see us. We then decided to buy a nylon sweater instead, a sleeveless sweater.
