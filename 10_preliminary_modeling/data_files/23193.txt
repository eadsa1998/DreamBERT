It was time for our farewell open house.  When the first knocks came at the door, my wife Anita and I were still in bed.  The bed was in the living room.  Somehow we could tell that it was Frank Dryer and his wife.  I tried to quickly find something to put on before opening the door, but I couldn't, and I had to duck into the bathroom (which was also adjacent to the living room) while Anita opened the door.  Then I was stuck, because I couldn't come out, and I was embarrassed to call to Anita to bring me some clothes, because Frank and his wife were in the same room, and they would see that I wasn't ready.
