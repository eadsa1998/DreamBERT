 I'm selling watermelons on the side of a road. Two men drive by in a big red truck. They are standing up while driving, and their bodies stick out the top of the cab of the truck. The driver is really skinny and tan. I have a nice wooden sign that I use to advertise the watermelons. My dad is there. He wants to buy a watermelon. He tries to talk me down from $3.00 to $2.00 for a large watermelon. I say I'll sell it to him for $2.50. I may drop my price to $2.00 as he is leaving.
