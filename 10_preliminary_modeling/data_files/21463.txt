I was doing a fellow a favor with Joe A. We took the blame for a murder charge. We were supposed to be exonerated but the fellow who did it was a politician and was going to let it go, and we would be really guilty. Joe had an angle which would prove that the man framing was the guilty one. When this man found out, he put his henchmen on us. We went in flight and were chased and pursued. We ran and walked up hill and down thru cornfields of fodder, stocks. The pursuers were so close that they were about 100 ft. behind. They had swords. One of the swords fell down a small cliff. I picked it up and threatened the pursuers with it and they ran back. Then we went on our flight again thru cornfields, over a hill and then down. Now it was Bob, Jerry and I who were being pursued. I had my car parked in a big garage. There were other cars there. I told a woman, "Look at my car, how rusty it is, and at the holes in it." I had another car. There it was, a new Lincoln. It was mine and still not. It started to back up and ran into a parked car, but just hit the bumper and did no damage. I saw a lot of beautiful pottery. I was swinging on a swing. I pulled myself up the rope, up the tree to where there was a caterpillar. He picked up some kind of small bottle and oozed out a white matter and it expanded like foam. Then a spider came out and put his jaws around the caterpillar, but didn't harm him. Peter A. was supposed to be in a hospital. Helen Solander was here and I talked to her. Bob and I were sweeping or cleaning up. I looked at the wallpaper. There were ash spots all over the walls and ceiling. I asked Bob who did that and he wouldn't say anything. So I said, "I know who did that. It was Jerry." Jerry came in and I was getting angrier and angrier till I flew off the handle and I started to cuss and yell at Jerry. I told him to get out and stay away from here. As I was pulling myself up the rope, my little granddaughter was hanging onto me.
