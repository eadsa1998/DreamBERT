I was in the movie theater. There was a camera with a person in it. She was staring at the alien. There was a man in a different camera. Then there was some old show. I was with my mom. She said, "I think John Travolta was in this." Then they started to show this old show but I never knew what it was. Setting: In the movie theater. Characters: A man (not known), an alien that looked like something I saw on TV, a girl (not known), my mom, and a picture of John Travolta. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I was scared a little in the alien part, and happy with the old show.
