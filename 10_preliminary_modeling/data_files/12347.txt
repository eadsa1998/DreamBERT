I was at this fair place with the school. I saw some place where this girl was getting a toasted sandwich. I was thinking 'what the hell?'. I was then with Calvin and I saw Dewey and Daryl. There was a dog place. I was then at school and it was term 3. We had gotten to school late. Then I went and got breakfast at the aforementioned fair place. Leroy worked at the place I got food and 'Get Back' was playing. The timetable had changed and I was only in two or three classes with Calvin. I lost the timetable but I had something that said what classes I had but didn't tell me where. I asked some people. The people in the office let me stay in there until that period was over. There was this thing with a father, a little girl and the wife, but she didn't care.
