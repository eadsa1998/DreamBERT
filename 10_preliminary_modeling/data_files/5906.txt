A man is riding around in a red Thunderbird, apparently looking for an enemy who lives in New York City. He has the address written down on a piece of paper. With him is a little girl and he is anxious for her safety. It is nighttime. He stops near a house and places her in a crate standing up high near a window and hidden. On other side of window one can see another little girl sleeping. She is about same age and sleeps on her back and is wearing a false nose. The man drives away and tries to remember the address. He takes long knife from seat and places in pocket and also puts a long bayonet-like tool in his belt. Then fishes out piece of paper and looks at address. Sees that it is East and he is heading in wrong direction. He turns into an apartment-hotel driveway and turns around, heading East. Next the two girls are seen inside the house, the one who was sleeping leading the other thru the rooms.
