[1997-05-07] One of the women in the building named M and I were baby sitting this beautiful, little boy 5 or 6 years old, he was just adorable, and for some reason I needed to get some chocolate chips and so M offered to take me to the store in her car which she has done a few times, except that her car was a convertible in my dream and we went for miles and miles and we were so concerned about this little boy that we were supposed to be caring for. And we got the chips and we came back and her car, a bright teal color, as it is in reality, the sky was blue and the sun was shining, and we got back to where the little boy was, and he was just fine and the boy's father was there and he wanted to know where we'd been and why we left the boy un-watched and then went on to another subject and to my relief we didn't have to answer him, and incidentally, this is the third dream I've had lately about baby sitting. The other two just drifted in and out and I had no memory of them.
