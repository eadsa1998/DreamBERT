I am visiting Hector in Mexico. He and I are talking. I ask him why hasn't he written? Aren't we friends any more? He moves away from me and crosses his arms. I feel sad and curious and frustrated. Then we go downstairs to see his family. I see a list of what each son got on his 15th birthday. They get $1000 or a car. Both sisters got a party. I didn't think it was fair. I notice they have remodeled their house. We go upstairs, passing another stairway going down. I am intrigued but don't go there. I see a window and outside, a push cart with books and gifts on it. I go out to see if I shall buy anything. I decide not to. I ask where Roberto is. No one knows. [BL]
