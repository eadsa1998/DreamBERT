I was making some changes to my personal websites. It had something to do with Matthew and his roommates, maybe. Definitely Matthew. I was talking to Matthew as I was doing it, telling him that yes it is tedious but if it's kept up, and all the changes are made on all the appropriate pages that it is certainly worthwhile doing.
