Went for a weekend retreat with Macy F at the BE Retreat Center. Lisa from the TV program dance with the stars was there as was her husband. It must have been a family retreat as there were quite a few children there. Macy F and I each had our own room. She asked me about going to dinner and I told her, if she didn't mind I would like to stay in my room this evening and spend some quiet time alone. She was fine with that. There were a lot of people there. Sister Betty was there. I had met with her briefly. They were hosting some type of social. Many people were drinking champagne. I had picked up several bottles, looking for one that was open. As I was doing this someone walked up and very easily removed the top from one of them - not the way you would normally open a bottle of champagne. I thought that if I had known that I could have done it myself. Someone had taken a champagne bottle that was only partially full and added something to it. It looked like a root beer float might look except that it was shades of red, white, and pink. It did have ice cream in it. I took one of these and poured some into a smaller bottle to take up to my room with me.
