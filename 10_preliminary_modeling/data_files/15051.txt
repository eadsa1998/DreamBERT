I lived at this weird place like a hut but there were lots of doors and people etc. I shared a bed with some guy. His fingers were touching me and I pushed him away, but then he did it again. I asked him if he had a pen. The people below us did and I reached down and took one. The guy kept putting his arm around me etc. Then, he had told me he liked me. We were friends, but I didn't know how I felt about him. Some girl friends and I had to go to this Science Museum place. It was huge and there were a lot of elevators and halls to places far away. They were trying to get me to talk to the guy and I didn't want to so I ran away. This one girl in particular chased me. I went behind this curtain and she followed. It was very dark and I jumped over this thing into another section. The other girls gave my hiding place up. Eventually I gave in. We went to this elevator and we had to stand on a seat and step into this TV (it was a perception thing). We were then outside a building and there was a vending machine with lite Mars Bars but then I realized they were Kinda Bueno's. There were lots of people around. There was a question on an assignment and this guy was asking if anyone understood it -- it was about measuring the 'safeness' of these two parties. There was another elevator which took us into this dark hall. This lady came out of a room and we asked where the exit was. She pointed to it and said it was 4am and asked 'why are you on my phone?' [I think, that's what it looks like it says].
