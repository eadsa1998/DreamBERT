Tony S and Dorothy S. Darren and I. Recycling. Tony S and Darren walk off. Dorothy S stays in the house with her girls. Bathtub with a shower. Darren has left a huge mess. It is decorated in various shades of blue. There's stuff hanging over the shower rod. I could hardly even see the opening of the shower curtain. Instead of one single shower panel there are two panels that opened in the middle instead of on one end.
