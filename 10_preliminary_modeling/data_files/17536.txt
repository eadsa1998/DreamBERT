A scary dream.  Entering a dark worn down house with someone.  It was laid out similar to our house.  There was something about a Legend of Falsity, that if you don't believe in it, the evil will be real.  I believed, but I saw something moving in the shadows, coming toward me.  I woke up a little shaken but felt better when I put Sol's arm over me.
