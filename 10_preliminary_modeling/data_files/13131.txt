I was at home and I saw a burglar out the back so I banged on the window to scare him off. He saw me and I realized he was going to come in. Ezra went to the laundry and I went to my room and music was playing. Later, I went out armed with a fork. I stabbed Dad by mistake. Ezra was at the hospital and he had been stabbed in the arm. I called the ambulance and Ezra wanted to confirm it was me talking, by asking me about some story about a swing at Nana's. Dad's laptop was still there. There was something about Valerie and Precious and Tinkerbell.
