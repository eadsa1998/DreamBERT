I was taking a long walk around my hometown, generally via the freeway.  The whole walk had overtones of a cross country walk, though, and I actually thought of Charles Kuralt's "On the Road" feature on CBS.  At one point I was consulting a U.S. map and figured I had walked most of the way around the coast of Florida, and wondered if part of my walk hadn't been down the coast to Florida.  Anyway, I had left Uncle Joe and Aunt Wilma's house.  I never walked on the beltway, but my route followed the general direction of the beltway-i.e. I was never far outside it or far inside it.  I kept anticipating having leg-collapsing problems at any time, but never did.  At one point, I was walking through a wooded area and my path converged with that of another guy.  Soon we came to a tunnel.  I was apprehensive that he might make homosexual overtures, but he didn't.  We entered the tunnel and turned to our right.  When we emerged from it, we were in a construction site, sort of like that at National Cathedral, with big chunks of ornamental marble and concrete lying around.  The other guy picked some up and carried it on his back for a while.  He suggested I do the same, but I refused, expressing amazement that he should help someone else do the work that they were getting paid for.  <p
