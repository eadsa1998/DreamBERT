I was on a train in Hawaii, and as I remember, I was in the army, because there were all men on the train. As the train passed by a pier, I remember showing someone standing near me my ship. I did not dream that I was on the ship at any time. As the train progressed, we passed huge piles of scrapped equipment. Large number of men would jump off the train and attempt to hide in the scrap piles, and armed guards roamed through the scrap piles and found the men almost as soon as they had hidden. I do not know where the train was going nor why I was on the train. I remember that I tried to escape from the train and hide, why, I do not know, unless it was because so many others were. I was successful in finding a place to hide, I remember running into an old barracks building and thinking that it was a good place to hide because somehow I knew that the guards wouldn't search in the building.
