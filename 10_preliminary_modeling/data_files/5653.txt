[1997-07-02] I was in college again. It was summer and instead of enjoying the beach, or sitting outside reading or going for a walk, I was stuck in a hot un-airconditioned classroom. We were reading Shakespeare and my books on tape hadn't come. I had a small tape recorder with a built in mic in my hand and the tape was moving, I could hear the motor and feel it moving. We were all yawning because it was so hot and the professor never came and so we left. I walked out of the classroom, into a hall and outside into the warm sunlight.
