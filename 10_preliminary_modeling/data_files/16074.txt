About two weeks I had a dream that I was at school and I was with my Mom and we were headed to the bus but I had to use the bathroom first. And the bathroom in the building on the first floor had this thing in most of the stalls where it would have an infrared beam of light coming down from the ceiling, and when you would go in, it wouldn't do anything; but when you would come out, it would activate this two-tone back-up alarm sound that would just fill the whole bathroom. And I was so afraid to go in there because of that. And I finally went in, and nothing happened.
