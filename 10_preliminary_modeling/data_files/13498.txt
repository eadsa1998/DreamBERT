My neck had been cut so I had to be careful not to open it up. I was then at a school and we had to wear dresses. I was going to say that I couldn't but a teacher said I didn't have to. Then I was in a gym and I was going to join in with sport but then remembered about my knee and got out (they were playing badminton and ping pong). I was in a class. Autumn was going to sit next to me, but moved over to the back. Later, I grabbed a newspaper to get a discount on a game. Dad was in the car. We picked up Ezra and Emery and they were in some play.
