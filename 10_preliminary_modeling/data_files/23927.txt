Julia had just been married. I was supposed to be getting married too. I went home with all of my friends. People slept all over the house. An attic was filled with rows of bunkbeds. Eric slept in the garage with a little red MG that he was rebuilding. I put on Julia's wedding dress. My mind went blank. I couldn't remember who it was I was going to be marrying. Where did I meet him? What's his name? I began balling my eyes out with my mother. Crying and crying and crying. I didn't want to get married - I'm only 20 years old. Who was this guy anyway that I was supposed to be marrying. The wedding invitation said Mark Fasta was his name. The wedding party list had a name called the "Fasta Mouse" - an advertising slogan for his cheese company. Apparently one of his groomsmens was going to be the Fast Mouse - a guy dressed up in a mouse costume. I was outrageously crying. Finally I told my mother, "I've changed my mind, I don't want to get married". I went to go seek the comfort of my friends. I wanted to see Walter, but he was in the attic with Shirley. All of my other friends were doing stuff. I heard the tail end of the conversation with my mother telling my father that the wedding was off. He went berserk, pointing out all the things he had paid lots of money for - he was almost broke because of it....he said, "Well, if she isn't going to marry him, she isn't going to live here and continue to suck money from me". I kept balling - I was being kicked out of my home for cancelling a wedding I didn't even remember the details of. I had a lawnmower and was pulling it to this field I was going to mow. Hal yelled funny things from the building, "Hey Baby..." but he couldn't see that I was crying. [Julia = my sister; Eric = my brother; Walter = ex-boyfriend; Shirley = Walter's new girlfriend; Hal = friend]
