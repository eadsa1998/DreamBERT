["V. house remodeled."] I am in a house that seems to be a remodeled and enlarged version of the V. house in A City. I think Susie owns the house. I go into the bathroom and comment that the toilet has been moved and shelves added but it is the same configuration as the original. I look in a mirror and am startled that I don't see me. I see Susie's reflection. Only it doesn't look like her either. Dark short hair, greenish blue eyes. I see this reflection several different places and am confused as to why this is my reflection. Now I go from room to room looking at the changes. Now I think the house is Aunt Millie's. The rooms are light, large and airy. Book lined walls. I go outside and come toward the house down the dirt driveway. On the right I see expansive fields, well cultivated and a row of filbert trees along the driveway. They are in bloom. This is what's left of the filbert orchard. I see the front of the house and a long wing expanding from it. I walk along the edge of the wing exclaiming on the lovely patterns in the stone wall. I see large windows and bookshelves behind glass. Old antique books, lovely to look at. At the end of the wing I even see bookshelves with books on it outside. I say they must be old unwanted books if they are left out in the weather. I am very impressed with Millie's remodeling of the old house.
