I had to leave a gathering of several M-- acquaintances at which we were seated around a table singing. I had to take part in a Valentine's Day program to be given at my former elementary school. The girls handed me what they thought was my coat, and then another, and then another until they finally came to mine. I remember that all of the coats were dark green although they differed in style. Arriving at the school I asked one of the children how to get on the stage and he directed me. I know I had a costume, but I don't remember it except for a Mexican blouse, and I don't remember my part, The face and name of the Master of Ceremonies kept changing, but he was always the same person. A professor of psychology whose course I took in another university walked down the aisle from the audience with his notes under his arm. He walked to a magazine rack which was at one side of the stage and picked up different magazines, all of which had a cover design depicting winter and snow flurries, sleighs, etc., and one of which was titled the Philadelphia Story. He then walked to the Master of Ceremonies, they kissed, and he took over the remainder of the program.
