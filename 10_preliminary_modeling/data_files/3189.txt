I am in a house and become aware of a dangerous man outside who is going to come in and hurt me. I must hide. I open a cabinet and crawl in with the blankets. I have a pet dog with me. Together we hide, knowing we'll get caught anyway. We wait in fear. He comes in and stands near the door to the cabinet. He is going to rape and kill me. Then I think the dog makes a noise and he finds us. We are standing in the room and now the man is a tiny deformed midget woman. I have a baby girl who stares at her and ask why she has such short legs. I try to shush the girl as I don't want the woman to be offended and hurt us even worse. I decide to make a run for it and grab the girl and go. It's so hard, like each step is in slow motion and painfully slow and difficult. Now I must return to get the police and pass the house. I choose to take a side road to not be seen, but I'm still so close she sees me. I then think, "Why don't I just bus to town and then she won't see me?" I change this and do that.
