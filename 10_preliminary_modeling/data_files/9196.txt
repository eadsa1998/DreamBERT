I was at ITI. Yet, it seems that I was in my bed. Jo R came in and sat down on the edge of my bed. She said she had some news for me. She gave me the impression that it wasn't good news. My immediate thought is that my temp assignment was over. She said that it was time for her to go be with her sister. We were talking about that and someone else walked up and joined the conversation. We were talking about what was going to happen with me and my temp assignment. Jo R thought Kimberli would likely take over the director position.
