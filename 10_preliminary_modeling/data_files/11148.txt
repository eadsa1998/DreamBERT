All I remember is coming to a lake in rather the dusky part of the evening. Looking down from what seemed to be a diving board, I saw to my horror, my boyfriend lying face down in what appeared to be the water. Thinking he was dead, I rushed over and as I drew near he looked up at me and motioned for me to go away in what seemed to be a rather disgusted attitude.
