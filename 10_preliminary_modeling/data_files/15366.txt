Dad, Ezra and I went to the movies and were seeing a Star Wars movie. Ezra wasn't feeling well. Nana worked there and she offered him a choc top. It was busy. The seats moved and had a tray underneath and I had to reach over and get it. The film started with some ghost train but then there was nothing else. Dad went to go see what the problem was. Stash was there with some boys. The movie just turned into Lord of the Rings. Merry and Pippin were in it and played by the same actors.
