I'm walking through the woods and I come upon a cross with a young blonde male on it. He is mutilated and he is screaming for me to help him down, but I can't. He screams this deafening, high-pitched cry and then I wake up. I got this dream from The Exorcist. I was at Blockbuster last night, so that's why I think I dreamt it.
