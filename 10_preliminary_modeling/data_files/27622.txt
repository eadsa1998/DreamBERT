I was going visiting to someplace on the other side of town. So I boarded a bus and met one of my girlfriends that I hadn't seen in a long time. She told me she was going to meet someone and when she rot off the bus she left a piece of paper with me. Finally I got off the bus end began to look for the street I wanted. I passed so many streets, but I still didn't find what I wanted. While I was hunting for it, I saw and Mexicans who evidently lived around that section.
