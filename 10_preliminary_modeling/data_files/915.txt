I am a reporter. I am interviewing both of the president's wives. There are a lot of reporters there. The older, wiser wife does most of the talking. The young pretty one just smiles a lot. I try to get her to talk. Her name is Trixie Beldon (a name of a book I read as a 13 year old or so). Then the interview is over. The pack of reporters start to go to the next room. Lots of them are saying, "Mr. President, Mr. President." I'm on the edge and plan on sneaking away to a bigger and better story. A man, also a reporter, watches me and follows me. I run and get a taxi. He jumps in too. I am annoyed with him because I'm about to scoop the whole pack and he's blowing it for me. I see that I'm stuck with him, so I tell him, "I have to change my clothes. I'll be interviewing tough mob types." I'm wearing a tailored woman's suit. I tell him to not look and I take off my suit. I ask him to hand me my other clothes out of the briefcase. He does. He peeks. I'm crouched down so no one can see in the windows. Some tough mob types try. Then I'm trying to interview them. I now have to go to the apartment of the leader. This guy and I (now attracted to him), go to the apartment and ring the door bell. A strange looking "outerspace" creature (a pet), comes to the door. It's a living rock on 4 legs or a tiny hippopotamus. The guy pets it. Then I pound it on the head. I figure to pet it, you'd have to be rough so he'd feel it. It hurts him and he pounds me to show me how it feels. Now he's going to teach me how to be gentle and nice, so he pets me nicely on the head. The man and I are falling in love. The man is glad I'm learning to be sensitive. Then he and I are kissing. When I feel the saliva in his mouth, I can read his thoughts. It spooks him. "How did you know that?"
