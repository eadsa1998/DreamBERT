 I have a glass of Goldschlagger. There is aluminum foil around the bottom and inside of the glass. I am stirring it trying to break the foil up so I can drink it. My friend Stephen asks for a drink. I tell him to wait until I'm done stirring. People are going swimming. It is dark and kind of cold. I have my bike there. I want to hide it. My roommate Jens is there and he wants me to leave my bike and go swimming. I brought my razor with on my bike. When I do head down to the beach, there are people coming up the hill drying off. They are cold. I don't have a towel. I was going to ask to borrow one.
