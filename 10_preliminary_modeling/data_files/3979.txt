["Too much stuff."]  I'm in a public building, having helped someone teach a class. A student needs their schoolwork gathered up and delivered to them. I see a table with piles of papers and books. I begin to dig out what I think I should take to her. A woman comes. She is my ride and then another class lets out and people are walking through. It is necessary for me to get out of the way but at the last moment I decide to grab some of the papers I want for a later meeting. I shuffle through the piles having a hard time deciding what to take. I feel frustrated. I give up and decide not to do this, and not take much with me. I walk out to my waiting ride.
