Samantha, Calvin and I had these capes and when we put them on we turned small. Calvin grabbed onto the back of a car and we grabbed on and were flying around as it drove. We ended up getting off at this busy street because we were getting too far away and I said we should get back. We were in a grassy patch in the middle. There were two lanes on either side of it. At the top of the road going back towards home there were then stairs leading up to a gate. There was a black prisoner there and he tried to stop us. Then I was at a house with Dad, Ezra, Nana and Poppa. Nana put a raw sausage on a plate and said it was dog. I said I wasn't going to eat dog and said "dogs are for pets and chickens are mostly for eating... unless you're Asian". Nana said we had eaten it before without knowing. I left. I went with Mom and Uncle Vic was at Granma's and I had read this on Wikipedia about how it happened (it hadn't happened yet). We stopped at a deli.
