[1997-06-01] This guy Harry came and put my cuckoo clock up, because I had a cuckoo clock that needed to be repaired. I heard Harry with a hammer, audibly, the "bang, bang, bang." But Harry, wasn't a human being holding the hammer again, he was like a spirit. There was no body, no head, face height, his voice is the male voice of Harry and the hammer is the typical sound of the hammer, but the hand part holding the hammer is just spirit. I guess he was putting the wall hanger in the wall and he told me that the cuckoo clock was all set.
