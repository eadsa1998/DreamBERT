I was in an office. My student helper was assisting me getting some info I needed. I seemed to start on an errand but I would forget something and not be able to complete it. Then, an old man walked in, the boss. He was upset. He wore red silk pajamas tailored like a suit. He took them off to show red veins marked on his legs. They went to the heart, like a blood poisoning line. He was scared. He was in poor health with a bad heart and this meant he was going to die soon. I assisted him into his office. I called the doctor. I had some trouble getting his name (Rexford), and trouble dialing the number. A secretary found the number for me. The man was scared and moaning, lying on the floor in front of the desk. The secretary left the room and then a girl came out of the closet and exhaled lots of smoke. She was almost caught smoking and had hidden. She thanked me for not squealing. I nodded. Then the doctor came on the line. I told him what had happened. The doctor was crying, distraught. I said, "Is there anything I can do for him?" The doctor said, "Oh yes, there's lots you can do. Give him some milk." I looked around the room. I saw a glass of milk on the desk. I thought about giving him a breast, but I had no milk. I went back to the desk and got the milk. I talked to him as I went, soothingly. He said, "I don't want any milk." I said, "If you drink your milk, I'll give you a kiss, a French kiss after every gulp." He said, "Then I'll drink a gallon." I then found a bottle of beer. I took that to him. I asked the doctor if beer was O.K. Maybe the beer, or my kisses, would be too much and he'd die. The doctor said, "The beer is fine." I asked the man how old he was. He looked at me and said, "10 days old." I said, "Huh?" He laughed and said, "You've been here 10 days and I feel like I was born when I met you."
