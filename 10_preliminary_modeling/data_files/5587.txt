[1997-06-02] We were about to sit down to dinner and it was about 50 degrees out about 5pm and I said I can't now, I have to take Betty out. So I took Betty out and then came back and ate. A while later we were walking and Betty did something really strange, we had started to cross the street and she stopped about two thirds of the way across the street. I couldn't get her to go and I was really frustrated. I tried repeatedly to get her to go and she wouldn't go and then somebody said there's a dog on the other side of the curb, the up-curb on the left hand side eating kibble and Betty wants to get the dog's space so she can eat and I said "oh that ,makes sense then". Then we were in some kind of a store and this lady said she was going to buy some kind of shampoo for her dog, but it was a grocery store and I didn't think they had dog shampoo. I said "if you can buy dog shampoo here for your dog, maybe I can buy some for Betty too" And then we bought cards but we had to take them home first and write some stuff in it, we couldn't just give them away as they were, so somebody helped me do mine.
