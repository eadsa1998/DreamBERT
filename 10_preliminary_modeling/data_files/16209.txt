I was making a CD for somebody and I was in my room and it was nighttime and it was dark and the LED for my sound system shone brighter than the sun. And my porcelain dolls were like I had tons of them and they all had little spotlights on them that were mounted on the edges of the shelves and that were so neat. And there was this orange spotlight on my sound equipment and this doll of Celine Dion that was sitting in like a teacup on top of my sound CD burner, and the body was like a small baby doll, but the head was like not in proportion. The head was like the head of like Celine Dion's age, and it had her hair and everything. And I took the doll out of the teacup and then I realized I was making the "Falling Into You" CD, recopying it, and I had the doll on my lap and the doll was much bigger. Again, the body was like a baby doll and the limbs got a little bit longer, but the head was like of Celine Dion's age and it looked just like her. And somehow I had the notion that in order to move forward and backward on the CD, I had to like squeeze her hand, one or the other, to go forward or backward like instead of the skip buttons on the unit. And it was totally bizarre, and before I knew it, this doll was talking to me and stuff. [laugh] Hmmmm, that was weird. Maybe it was because we were looking through Mom's dolls and stuff, and we saw her Corky doll that was like gay.
