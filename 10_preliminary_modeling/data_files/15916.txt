I was at the Technical College, in class, and people were doing something with acid at the front. They had different mixtures, so some were diluted. Justus, I think, didn't believe that it was acid so started drinking it and I was expecting his throat to just burn through, but he just kind of gagged a bit and everyone rushed to stop him.
