There is a manmade 'fish trail' set in a rock pool environment with a path that runs through a series of rock pools. The path is set into high-sided rocks (or fake rocks). Many large fish and perhaps reptiles inhabit the rock pools. The public are encouraged to physically handle the live fish, picking them up and dropping them back into the pools. Some of the pools are set into the walls at waist or shoulder height. I'm wandering through this strange place. My brother and his girlfriend follow close behind me. My brother is keen not to miss anything. His girlfriend is keen that he doesn't miss anything to keep him happy.
