I wanted to make a surprise for Rudy. So I decided to align window blinds while he was asleep. They went from the ceiling to the floor and had to be aligned properly to be right. I dropped a bottle of 'Duane Reade' suntan lotion in the toilet and I didn't know what to do so I flushed it. A lady in a wheelchair had balancing rods like a cross between 'Wheel-O's' and perpetual motion machines. She was trying to balance a cup of coffee on the iron spokes, but the bottom of the cup was round, so it would NOT balance. I went to the drugstore to get some film and when I got up to the cash register after waiting in line so long--that I had to balance mathematical equations while in line. When I got there, I said, "I need a roll of 400ASA 36 exposure tri-X." The guy found it. I said, "Oh, I forgot. I don't need it after all. Jasmine will give me a roll in class tomorrow. I'll get some plastic notebook sheets and some tape." He brought back a 6-pack of tape and after he rung it up, I said, "Oh, I only need one." He was angry by this time. But he got the plastic sheets wrong anyway. I did not ask for the other kind--I hadn't known they existed but they were exactly what I needed. I was so excited about working in the darkroom that it was hard for me to keep my clothes on. Next to the east River, Rudy had just gotten home from boxing class. His girlfriend was standing on the left. I didn't see her at first. I'd planned a breakfast picnic for Rudy. I had fixed scrambled eggs for breakfast but I accidentally turned the water spigot on and got water all in the bowl of scrambled eggs so I drained the water out and pretended I had not screwed up breakfast. No one ate the eggs. A deranged homeless guy was throwing a pitchfork at the cop next to the railroad. He screamed, "Aim for the eyes!" I had been crying over Dora on top of my bed. Sidney did not know what to do so he rode his bicycle out the door.
