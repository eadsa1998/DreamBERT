 I'm out in front of my home on the sidewalk with some guys. I am really drunk. I urinate on the sidewalk. A police officer sees me and pulls up to the house. I act like I'm playing football with the other guys I am with. The officer doesn't buy my story. A guy I am with, Andy Jones, tells the cop I urinated on the sidewalk. M friend Kevin Simpson tells the officer there are 16 to 18 other people in my house. I didn't know there was anyone else inside. The officer goes to my mom's bedroom and looks in. My friend Bubba Hacker is inside. He is trying to make things seem okay. I am in deep trouble, and I know it.
