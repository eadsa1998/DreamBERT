I had a job interview at McDonald's. It was done by two girls. People in the shop were being loud and people were coming in and one of the girls yelled that the job interview was taking place. I was embarrassed and I wasn't sure how it was going. The meaner one left. The chocolate in the sundae machine was spilling and mixing with the ice cream and I warned her. I was only allowed to work for a maximum of 20 hours a week and I was thinking that I needed to change it so I could work longer. Some cop/forensic guy did something and someone called him a "douche"? He marked this thing from 100 down to 71 thinking that no-one would notice and it got people in trouble originally, until they realized it measured itself automatically, so they double checked the machine's records with his. Then I was doing a dungeon with Ezra. Eugene and others were in a 'pub' nearby and when we were in the dungeon we could hear them talking. They were fans of the Harry Potter movies [note: last night there was a FilmForum video which used Harry Potter movies as an example]. There was this new thing with floating rooms. Couples usually rented them. It was unknown to them, but the walls were glass so they could see through and all the rooms would float together in this big 'room' (it was kind of like The Matrix). From the top, you could see everything. It showed some couples cuddling, kissing, some having sex and one guy was masturbating alone. Then Jason Segel and I were in a room. He was my boyfriend. We were having sex, on our side and he was behind me. I was watching Smallville and Clark said "fuck" twice and I thought that was weird. It was a weird, complicated episode. Then I was watching Queer as Folk. Hazel (from the UK one) was in it, and Michael (the US one) was her son. Then Mom and I were in the car and we went to one of her friends. They were trying to impress me and I was yawning.
