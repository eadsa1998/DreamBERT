["Howard trapped again."] I am hiding in a bed that is like a top bunk. A blanket is used like a curtain. Howard comes into the room. He knows I'm there and comes up in the bed with me. I pretend to be in a coma. He leans up to my face, his cheek on mine. He says I know you are there. You had better reconsider our relationship. I'm not going to stay here forever with you ignoring me like this. I think to myself. It's better off for you if you leave. He is angry. I am determined. Then he leaves the room and I get out of bed. Lydia has a friend that wants to sell me a big storage system for my dream program stuff. I ask how much. She says 1600. I laugh. I haven't got that, but she comes in to do the pitch anyway. I ask her what kind of media she is using. She is impressed I have a video player in my room. It's sort of an office. I say but no monitor to see it with. I use it on my computer, which is in a small separate room off this office. Somewhere in there I help a female client with her problems.
