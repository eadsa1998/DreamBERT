I'm lying on my back in bed. There are five or six people dressed in white surrounding the bed. One of them takes our cat away. Sam is in the kitchen and I call for him. Children are in the closet and I can't move. The people in white start picking them up, some are crying, others are reaching out to me. I call for Sam, but he doesn't come. They are taking all of the children away.
