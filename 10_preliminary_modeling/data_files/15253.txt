It was around 2.30am. I was watching an episode of Six Feet Under. I remember Claire and Nate, and Claire was a bit chubby. I was on my bed, reading a book in the dark. I had an ensuite and saw a creepy shadow. I went to Ezra's room and asked to sit on his bed and read. His door opened a bit later, but made no noise. Then a girl walked by and I tried to scream, but it was barely a squeak. I shut the door and locked it. She tried to open it (she was a ghost). Another one came and the door flung open. She had the shape of a cross on her face in blood. She was a 'star'. They said the star was 22 degrees and there was no nuclear thing, so couldn't develop water on them. I took her to the shop and I waited in the car. She got back and we had to wait at a set of lights to leave the carpark. I said she was worse than Dad to drive with, then said 'no, he's worse'. I was watching Spiderman or something. A guy found this ring to time travel with and James Franco found it and was using it.
