I am giving birth to my third baby. Someone looks under the blanket and sees that, unbeknownst to me, the baby is already born. He's very cute and lying on my belly. I am amazed and say, "But I didn't feel any pain, not even a tiny twinge!" Someone says, "But now we have to get the afterbirth out, that will hurt." I feel labor-like pains as they push on my belly.
