I was pregnant. I was in the car talking to Mom saying that I had been taking it easy so as not to go into early labour. I was getting a caesarian in like two weeks. Then it was time and I was at the hospital. I was asleep for it, but I remembered getting my stomach sliced open. I woke up and Mom and Austin were there. He mentioned to Mom about having an affair with me and I was like 'what the hell I never did that'. Mom said she would call Ezra. He came but then it was Jack (Dawson's Creek). He had been asleep and was the father, or so I assumed. I had given birth to a girl by the way. Ezra came with lollies. Amelia was on the floor and he was handing out lollies and reluctantly threw a lolly at her. I thought it was funny and she ate it. He threw orange snakes at her and she just kept eating them. At first she was like smiling but then she seemed to be getting worried.
