I was still living on Lakeland Dr. It was winter and snowing. There were a couple of inches on the ground. It was night and I had to distribute the mail to everyone on our street. As I was sorting out the mail for one home. A young man, about 25-30 years old, asked if he could help. I said no but he insisted. Shortly after Connie B and one of her kids joined us. We had some difficulty sorting the mail and had a discussion about one piece that belonged to me.
