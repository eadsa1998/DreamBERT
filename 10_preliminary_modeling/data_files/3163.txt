I am holding a sweet little girl in my arms. A man I love walks beside me. We are in some kind of time warp. Someone sees a large picture of Abraham Lincoln on a wall and I am drawn to his dark sad eyes. Something is behind that picture. We rip it off the wall and see writing. It says "B was here in November." It was written by the man to prove I was here before this. But now I am realizing that we must die. I am filled with grief. I hug the girl to me. I ask someone, a doctor perhaps, what will it feel like when the moment of death comes. I decide it will be a drink of poison, a big dose. I hold the girl and say, "I'm so sorry." She says, "It's all right. You have to do it" (meaning kill her). I sob and sob and she comforts me. I am walking into a house. Her family of this time, a man and woman, are harsh and I scream at them to leave us alone. Now I am walking in the waves of an ocean. We are walking along the beach in the surf, facing perpendicular to the waves. They hit from the right side. Sometimes the waves are like paper roses that spray over us. I say to the man I love, I'll die with you. I'll kill you two and then I'll drink the poison too." He begs me not to. He says I must live because if I don't then no one will write about them and then they will be truly dead. I sob and sob, clutching him in a side embrace. "How can I live when all I love is dead?" I sob. We go into a room and I hug him, sobbing and sobbing. My mother is there, and I confronted her.
