I and some neighborhood friends were at a place where we gather when we heard an argument going on between a man and a woman, but we did not place any importance on that fact. After a while the couple who had been arguing came out of a house I know in the neighborhood and the man forced the girl to get into a car (I remember the brand and year: Morris 1970). At this point a good bunch of people had become aware of the fight. Suddenly the scene shifted and my friends too. We were no longer in the neighborhood, but in a small town similar to those on the highway to Chosica, the attention kept being focused on the couple that was fighting. The guy drove his car at great speed and the people thought that he was trying to scare her. Suddenly they got out and he took her to the lawn. There a new fight took place. It seemed a stupid matter to me because he was on top of her and they were saying, (he), "No, no, no," (she), "Yes, yes, yes," and then they kissed like lovers do. One could plainly see that she was dominated by him, or it seemed so to me. It turned out that this girl was known by some girls at the university and later, when we were all gathered in a very elegant house, lined with wood which I don't know, they brought the girl, who was hurt and crying. Later I was talking to a friend from the university and he told me that the argument on the lawn had been over an abortion. She did not want an abortion and her boyfriend did want it. My friend had taken part in the abortion since he knew something about medicine, but they had to get him and the girl drunk in order to convince them. When the girl arrived at the above-mentioned house, several of us were gathered there. I looked at her face, but she did not look at me. When she passed by people, they would look in another direction and pretend they had not seen her. One of them even ran out, but I don't remember any more.
