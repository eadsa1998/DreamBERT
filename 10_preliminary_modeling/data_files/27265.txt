My father took me to a large department store; it was late and the store was quite empty. As I walked to our car to put part of the present into the trunk compartment (conveniently located on a high floor of the building - no?) - an old stooped lady reached to take some of my present. She failed to grasp it, but nevertheless I pursued her less she try again. We ran across a wine rug - she tried to trick me by dodging thru narrow doorways and behind chairs. Eventually she disappeared. I was pleased for she was gone for the time being. I returned. D. (who seems to me to have insight into people's actions - my father has no knowledge of him) was helping Father get lunch from the car. He tasted two milk bottles (with straws). They were sour; he discarded them. Father had also brought me a brand new camera with an expensive television attachment.
