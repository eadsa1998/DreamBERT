I am in a group of people and I want them to read my play, the new one I just wrote, something about sex and men and women and how they relate. They start reading it and I walk around listening and noticing that no one really listens or understands my unusual scene breaks. Finally, the man stops reading but the play is only half done and I ask him to continue reading. He says, "Naw, it's boring and besides someone said this must have been written by a fat old woman, because it puts down men and sex." I try to convince him to read the rest because then it will all balance out and they will see, but he won't. I walk over to where Sherry Lady is seated and try to talk with her. No dice.
