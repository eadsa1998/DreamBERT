It is lunch hour and I am in high school. I go for lunch at the First Lutheran Church in my hometown and there meet my two daughters. My oldest daughter is pregnant and all bloated and sick and says she didn't tell me because she didn't want me to worry. I want to get back to school. I am afraid I won't graduate if I miss any more school. But the church has now become a house that is actually a car and there is no driver. I am in the back seat and I struggle to get over the front to set up a seat to drive. My pregnant daughter doesn't seem concerned. Neither does my other daughter. Then I want a cup of tea and I go to the front of the car/house. Some girls have rented the front part and have decorated it for Christmas. I ask for water for tea. One of the girls looks in the freezer for the water.
