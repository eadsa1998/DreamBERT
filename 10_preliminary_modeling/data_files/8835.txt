I was communicating with Reid W or someone about following up with all of the people who have said they were going to participate but I had not received payment from them yet. One of them in particular was Kendall B. I was feeling uncomfortable about that one because he is my mentor. Someone brought to my attention that he has another book. He may have been the one that told me about it. The new book was called "Twice as much, but half as many."
