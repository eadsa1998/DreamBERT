I don't remember whether I was involved in the game as a player or as a spectator -- the latter, I think -- but Bob Standfort was pitching for the side I was rooting for, and it was a pro game.  He was a very good pitcher, too.  At the end he was faltering, and it looked like he was going to lose-but in a fantastic finish, he won.
