I was at school. I was getting a reward plus I had $300. Someone told me this was the last chance to redeem. I went to a booth and there were two women. There was a soft puppy toy. They asked me "what is your thing that no one knows?" I replied "I have no sense of smell" and they said "oh, that makes sense". Some girl I knew asked if I wanted a job at the cinema and we went there for a test. The manager called Ezra and he looked like the principal from Community. There were lots of people and lots of food. It was almost like a shop and it had four hotels. There were three people in the food section and there was a table. There was a table with two Adam Baldwin's, but he was young. I was doing bits of the job. I was letting people in and showing them a presentation. I decided something else was better because they weren't drones. There were lines of people at the door freaking me out. No one else had seen them and I went out the other door. I chose a better trick involving drawing lines on the road and one of the ones I picked made people drive around and then have to drive all the way back. I got in a car and a car smashed into the back of another one. I left and was driving fast. I couldn't stop very well. Some of the red lights had speed cameras but I didn't get flashed.
