 I'm at a mountain where skiing takes place. I'm with a group of people at the base of the mountain at a picnic-like park area. It's autumn, and the leaves on the trees are brilliant yellow, orange, and red. My friend Jimmy Youngman, his father, and his younger sister are among the group. People in our group watch for fire on the mountainside, which can spread like lava. It's hard to see if any flames are there with all the colorful leaves. I watch the mountainside for a bit, and then someone else takes a turn watching. A man winds up a fluorescent orange fire hose. A person things they see smoke! Everyone starts running away. There are three carloads of people in our group. Two of these carloads of people leave. I yell to Jimmy, his father, and his sister, who are walking closed to the base of the mountain. I wave my hand in the air, like I'm waving a handkerchief in the circle as a motion to "round 'em up", because there is about to be a fire. They run away from the mountain as fast as they can, fearing for their lives. It seems as if the fire is an eruption: an enormously powerful event that will raze everything in its path. My housemate Stephen Ramos and I run back up to the parking area, via a road. We move swiftly. This doesn't pose a life threat to me. I think we'll have time to get away. Stephen tosses me the keys. I go to get our minivan, and then will go pick him up with Jimmy and his family at the road to leave.
