Before the surprise party, Tina said come over, she wanted to show me something. Then she disappeared so I went up to the manager and everyone yelled, "SURPRISE." They gave me a towel or shirt that had a little kid and the mom and me and Nancy on it and I was saying stop it. Like almost on purpose they made me mad, so they could make a towel out of it. When people were climbing up, everyone could see their butts and someone behind me yelled, "Butts up!" which I thought was really stupid.
