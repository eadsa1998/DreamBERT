 There is a man in the bathroom at my neighbor the Jones' house. He tries to escape out a window, but he is very broad and large. The place is a school. The man is then a boy, and he flees down a hall and out a doorway where some administrators are. The administrators aren't happy that the boy is trying to get out. The area outside the school is fenced in. The boy runs up to a gate that is locked in three places: the bottom, middle, and top. A woman is at the gate with the keys. She is slow to open the locks: not swift and precise. There is pressure from behind the boy.
