My parents had two more babies and they were so cute. I was playing with them. We had a thing in the center - it was a big thing full (of) balls. The babies loved it. Then my family came over - cousins, grandma, (and) my aunt was already over. Setting: My real house. Characters: Two babies, cousin RD, cousin Karli, Aunt Trudi, Mom, Dad, grandma. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I loved this dream. I would love to have more sisters or brothers.
