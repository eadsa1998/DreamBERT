A young woman is going away to get married. I'm going to sing at her wedding or graduation. I am wearing a wedding dress, lots of lace, and I'm well-shaped. I look fat, but I'm not. A nun comes up to me. We are introduced. She doesn't approve of me. I am making jokes about marriage, like a clown or a comic. I show the girl my silly undertrunks and laugh. She's very serious and doesn't laugh. It's time for the show. A small audience, 10 of us in lines, are on the stage. I'm second to left in front. The girl is to my left. I sing a story about a bride who broke part of her husband's tea set. She had to pay for it out of her own money. "And," I told the audience, "it has to be out of the principal, not the interest. I am serious," I say to a scoffing audience person. They don't like my message. A woman friend's daughter starts crying and has to leave the stage. Perhaps the message is too modern for her. It's like we're doing an opera with humor.
