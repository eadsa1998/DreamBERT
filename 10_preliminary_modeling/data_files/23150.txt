I was going somewhere by taxi.  It was to be a rather long trip, and I was already concerned about the cost.  At some point, either on the way or after not finding our destination and heading back, either my daughter Christina or my son Burt, who was with me, spotted the Ferris wheel of an amusement park on a street at a higher level than we were on, and back the way we had come, and he/she wanted to stop.  So I told the taxi driver to turn around, but he had to go a ways before he could do so, and then we didn't find any amusement park.  I was anxious that the fare was going to cost even more.  When we finally stopped, I was relieved that the fare was less than $5.00.  The driver was Indian.  For some reason, he gave me $5.00 and showed me his ID, and I was trying to figure out how to allow for the fact that he gave me $5 in trying to get the right amount out of my wallet to pay him and tip him generously.  I finally decided just to give him back his $5.00 and give him $6 or $7 more-but my wallet was stuffed with big bills, and I couldn't find a $5.  I decided to take everything out so that I could go through them more easily. In the process, a lot of checks fell out, and some of them had been shredded.  So there was paper everywhere, and my checks were scattered, and it was a big mess.   Sue Bailey and Frances Reed were there, and one of them commented to the other in my hearing that it was amazing that I was really very professional in other contexts.  I felt really embarrassed to look so foolish.
