This dream was very confused and I can remember only a few details. We were having a junior class meeting. There were both boys and girls present however. Mr. R-- was leading the meeting. Then somebody in the room started to throw a small rubber ball. Mr. R-- tried to get it but it was always thrown before he could get to it. The ball never came to me except once when it rolled near my foot and I kicked (or really pushed) it with my foot. There was more to the dream, but I can't remember it.
