I was at a shop with Mom. She got cheap clothes and also wanted this baby outfit (it was like for the Royal Wedding). A lady said it came with a gold bracelet and I said it was disgusting. She asked if I meant the bracelet and I said I would rather hang out with a child molester. Someone thought there was a bomb at the shop. I hid down near the checkout. Then I was home and tried on a white shirt that was way too small. It was made of netting so had gaps between parts. My other clothes had holes in them. I was talking to Benjamin on Facebook and he pasted something about Edinburgh and I said we were going to Scotland and that we should meet and he agreed.
