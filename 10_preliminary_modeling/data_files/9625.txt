With Edward: at a party where liberals work for civil rights; one of them is killed: I go to the place where his casket is placed: I stand before the casket, cross myself and a police man comes along, followed by others: they arrest me subversion. I have go to upstairs, I am scared, but then go willingly: "You don't have to force me."... I hear that Edward died (just after talking to him on phone), odd feeling.
