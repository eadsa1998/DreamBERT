I was on a boat with a school. I was in a bottom compartment and it had seats like a bus and windows to the sea. It suddenly started spinning around really fast. I looked out and realised the boat was sinking due to a storm. It stopped and we tried to work out what to do. There was a doorway leading to stairs that would take us to the top. I left to see where it was. I held my breath and went under water but a little bit of water got in. I saw a shark and it had a smile and on one side of the mouth the teeth were always showing. I quickly went back. I realised we were going to die and some of us decided to breathe in this thing which would suffocate you. I died and then a girl realised how to get out, so I reversed it so I wouldn't die. We were then on at the top of the boat with all these control panels open and on top of the water. I got up to it and it had been going fast and straight. I couldn't slow it down and it hid bridges and boats and finally crashed to a stop. It felt good to be back on land.
