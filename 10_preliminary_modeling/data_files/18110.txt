Me and Teddy were at a club in Brooklyn.  We went outside to wait for our rides, and Edward and his gang came to beat up Teddy because she dumped Edward.  So Teddy got on a bike and started running away.  I was really scared so I hugged my friend, Big Boy.  He got on his bike to go protect Teddy,  Some of Edward's gang stayed to beat me up, so I ran and hid in a toy store.  They found me, so I ran to the Brooklyn Bridge.  I met Teddy there and we started freaking out.  Then Edward pushed Teddy over the bridge.  I screamed and ran to get the police.  The next day, Teddy came to my house in a wheelchair.
