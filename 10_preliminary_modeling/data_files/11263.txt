The only other person in the dream was a woman I work with (49). She told me to go to the stock room and bring some red dolls (the kind you might win at an amusement park with feathers for skirts), but I wanted to bring blue dolls. We had an argument, and I went to the manager and told him that if he didn't fire her I would quit. The last thing I remember of the dream I was preparing to quit.
