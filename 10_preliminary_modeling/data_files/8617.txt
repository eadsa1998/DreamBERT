Kim H had asked me to do quite a few things on the morning of her wedding. The wedding was to begin at 10:00 am. One of the things that came up last minute that she asked me to do was to call the florist before they left to come to the church and ask them to bring something else with them, but I don't remember what it was. Chris A was going to be arriving at the very last minute so she had also asked me to do what I could beforehand so he could get ready very quickly. I was in a very large open room. I don't see anything in it. Yet, I picked up a bottle of body wash and put some into a sink. As I did so I also closed up the sink drain and allowed hot water to fill the sink. I had a new shower sponge with me. I tore off the tags and laid it by the sink. Next I laid out all the pieces of his tux on something. Just as I was finishing Chris A walked in. He was dressed in what would be usual attire for him. jeans, boots, plaid shirt over a t-shirt, cowboy hat. But he was much taller and much thinner than in waking life. I didn't even take time to give him a hug but as I walked away I half-turned around towards him. I pointed to where his things were as I mentioned the sink of water that I had prepared in case he needed or wanted to wash up. He said he had taken a shower before he came. I think he said at a truck stop. I was in such a hurry because I realized the wedding was supposed to start in 5 minutes and I was not dressed yet. I knew Kim H would be very upset with me but also didn't feel that there was anything I could have done differently to have been able to get dressed earlier. Somebody was talking to Kim H in another room trying to assure her that everybody would be ready on time, though I don't think she was upset with Chris H or worried about him being ready on time.
