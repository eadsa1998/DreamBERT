Another person and I are at a zoo. Two large and dangerous wild cats get loose. They start chasing us. We run and end up cornered in the empty hay loft of a barn. To defend myself, I pull out two small short bladed rickety pocket knives. They are dull. The sassy mountain lion comes up close and pulls out his pocket knife, which is like mine. I feel afraid because I am inadequately defended. He and I circle each other and then we start to laugh at the silliness of the situation. We agree to be blood brothers. He cuts his thumb with his knife and I cut mine with my knife and we mix the blood. Then we talk about how we can work together. I point out that if he stays in a particular area, he won't scare the neighbors and I'll give him classes and teach him enjoyable things. I introduce him to 3 teachers. Then I see a well-manicured hedge.
