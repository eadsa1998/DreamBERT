A shrubbery about 15 feet high was outside the window. (It resembled the shrub outside our dining room window.) There was something clinging to the top of the trunk like a vine. But it was fleshy like a snake and it was pure white. I climbed up and touched it. Later, inside the house, there were two rag dolls on a cabinet.
