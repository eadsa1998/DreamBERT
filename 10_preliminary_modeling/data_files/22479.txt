I was in a very strange house which was like my house since my parents and my sisters lived there. I was walking and I stopped to look at a mirror and I looked horrible. I had big, ugly warts all over my neck and face. Then my mother came and she was scared when she saw me and then she made me go to bed and they called the doctor. But in the meantime, the warts, which were like ugly animals, multiplied all over my body and I was desperate, but in the middle of my desperation, I felt that it was only a dream and that when I would awake, I wouldn't have them any longer.
