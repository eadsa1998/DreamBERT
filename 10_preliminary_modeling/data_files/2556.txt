I am at a dance. I am perfectly beautiful, perfect proportions, long blonde hair. All the men want me. They keep cutting in. One man rushes up to me and says, "Tell them you choose me, for now." I hesitate. Is this going to be beneficial to me? Which man should I choose for my best interests? I do choose him temporarily. We dance. I decide I like him the best. He's sweet and sensitive. An older man, distinguished gray hair, like in soap operas is very powerful, but I don't like him. He wants me and tries to convince me to choose him. I am stand-offish. He is angry at me. I then choose to sit on a bench with a young disabled woman and her mother. We chat. I feel like I'm "slumming." I'm aware of a "better than you" attitude. I then get up and go pick up a 17-year-old disabled man and carry him in my arms like a child while we dance. I am waiting for my love to return. He comes in, looking like Abner, with four of his brothers and sisters. They are playful and laughing together. I am glad I'll soon be a part of their nice family. He comes over and I then dance with him. The older man is after us. He'll cause us injury or harassment if he can. We go down to the end of the room. The older man has placed a long mechanical/animal creature under the table. I pick it up at the back of the neck to prevent it from biting me. It curls up and manages to almost get me. I search for and find a button on its right side. I use my left hand and push it; it turns the creature off so I am safe now.
