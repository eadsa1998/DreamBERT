We are sitting at a table with Patrick and tell him that I have a needle point that I wanted to give him. Also that I want to do art in the mornings. -- I see a lovely, curly headed child playing nearby. I also see my nieces and want to buy them something for Christmas; happy to have some children who are related to me.
