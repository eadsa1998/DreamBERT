It seems I went to a certain party where there were many people. It must have been a hotel. I can only remember one young man there that I recognized and talked to. He is about 28 and an acquaintance of mine. I cannot remember the other young women at the party, but there were quite a few of them, some of whom I seemed to know. There were many small tables and so we must have eaten or drunk something. After a while I seemed to feel very warm and retired to the ladies' room where I rested up for quite a while. After that, it seems I was visiting a girlfriend's apartment with another girl. The apartment was in the Mayflower Village. I have never seen the apartment before but she showed us the living room, which was a light green. While we were there she talked to her mother on the telephone.
