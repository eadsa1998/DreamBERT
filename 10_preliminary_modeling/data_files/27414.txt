There were about 50 people sitting at long tables in a ball at a banquet. My mother was sitting at the head table and I was sitting at a table near the back of the room. There was a very small glass of milk in front of me and I drank it down in an instant. Then I hollered at my mother at the head table to get me some more milk. She had brought me too small a glass. She said she was sorry and went out of the room to get me another glass. That's all I remember because I was awakened at this point.
