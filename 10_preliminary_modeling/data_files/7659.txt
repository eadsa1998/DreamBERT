I realized that someone I know, a casual friend maybe, had killed someone. I don't know whom it was that he killed. I was kind of running around with this huge chef's knife covered with blood and trying to figure out what to do with it. I also have a sense that I wanted to stay away from the person now. People started showing up at my house for a party. When one man showed up, I realized he was the father of the killer. It made me very uncomfortable. I didn't want him there either. He was a very large man, maybe 6 feet tall and 300+ pounds. He was very rough looking, and had a salt and pepper beard. He brought a bunch of very large fish with him. They were on a string as though he had just recently caught them.
