I get called to a house on an ambulance call but the man is already dead. Instead of driving back in the ambulance, I take a car and am driving very fast and reckless even though I don't intend to. Then I am in an airplane and it lands short of the runway. Next I am telling our new editor, "I almost crashed a plane Friday." thinking it will impress him. He asks how and I tell him I came up short of the runway. He is not impressed. He just acts like that is an ordinary happening and keeps on working.
