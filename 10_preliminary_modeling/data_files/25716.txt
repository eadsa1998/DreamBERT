 I'm on a crowded bus on a Paleontology field trip. We pull away from an area. A young woman is being the bus yelling at us. I stick up my middle finger at her. We are on a crowded train. My friends Niles Zelling, Beth Mock, Bryan Beard, and the Jewish vegetarian guy from my Paleontology class are there. I ask the guy if we are having burritos again for dinner tonight. He says yes. There is a woman next to me. We say hi to each other. I ask her where she is living this year, as if I know where she lived last year. She says in the same place. I say "Oh", even though I have forgotten where that place is, and don't indicate so. She asks me and I say Tea 2nd. The train is so crowded there are three people in two seats, but I get my own seat. I give the vegetarian guy $5 for a group gift for the professor. We get off at a train station at a small town with a name that starts with "m", like "Mumba", or something. We go into a long white room and take seats at a long rectangular table.
