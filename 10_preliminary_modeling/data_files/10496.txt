The phone rings in my dream to wake me and it is Hillary, she is crying because the baby Reynaldo died. I don't know what to say. I hold a rosary in my hand and try to explain to others what happened. I never get to say many words of comfort to Hillary; I am vague about the ending, only a sad feeling.
