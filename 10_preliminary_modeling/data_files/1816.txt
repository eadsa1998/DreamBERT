I walk upstairs, my high heels clicking. I check off a person's name on a list and walk downstairs again. Up I go. This time I try to check off more than one name and I see some books. I take them. They are mostly old children's books. I see a very pretty art book with a beautiful purple iris flower on a black cover. I ask,"Whose book is that?" I go back downstairs. I have two teacups and saucers. Someone says we need more plates. We are boiling potatoes. I wonder if there is enough.
