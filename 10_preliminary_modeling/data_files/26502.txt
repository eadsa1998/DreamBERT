 I'm at home, alone, in the bathroom. There are two toilets. One is normal, and the other is like a large blue plastic-like urinal, shaped like a satellite dish. I step into the bathtub and sit on this urinal, which is over the bathtub. The plastic is flimsy and it bends when I try to let it support my weight. I'm cautious, listening for intruders. I hear something in the other room and quickly get up to go see what it is. I'm scared of who it may be. I run blindly into the kitchen, knocking over a small blond boy holding a telephone book. There are several people there. I recognize them as my grade school mate Charlie Hander, who is still very blond but much larger in stature, my cousins Phil and Kyle Jessen, and another boy. When I see who it is, I do not feel threatened anymore. Confused, I ask them what they're doing. They say that their parents told them to come in and go to the bathroom. I look out the front window and see a large black truck and a huge white motor home parked in front of the house. I tell these kids to just knock, and to tell their parents just to have them knock next time!
