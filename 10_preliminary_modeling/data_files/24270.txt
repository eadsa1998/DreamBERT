On XXX Island. Woke up in the big beach house my mother was renting for me and my brothers and my sister. It was a wood-slat mansion, old, but still exuding an air of scale and imminence amid the backpacker hovels and quaint beach resorts. I was watching a movie, or that was the excuse, anyway. Really, I had witnessed a great mystery -- perhaps a window to some nascent apocalypse heralded by the arrival of gypsies and a darkening of the sky. I'd seen the runes appear, like Ankorian temples with cropped steeples, crackled with crimson veins, like river tendrils spidering down the side of a mountain, only the currents carry pulsating flows of blood. I saw the creature briefly. It was like every demoniac you'd probably seen or imagined, large, black-colored, muscle-bound and winged, only when I actually was in the presence of the fanged and brimstone-smelling thing, I couldn't help but despair beyond any rationality. Though the thing soon left, and I was left to prepare.
