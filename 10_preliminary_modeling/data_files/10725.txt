I was at a large party which seemed to be a New Year's Eve gathering. It took place in the Hotel Carter Ballroom and the place was jammed with people in formal dress. I was dressed in a disreputable outfit of blue jeans and a dirty shirt, and every time I tried to make conversation, I was completely ignored. There was a tall, dark, handsome young man whose attention I was trying to attract, but he too ignored me, so I went to a building across the street where there was another party. After going up in several different elevators, I arrived in a long, narrow hallway also crowded with people in formal dress, who likewise ignored me.
