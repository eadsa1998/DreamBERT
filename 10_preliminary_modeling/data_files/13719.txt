It was the morning before school. My hair hadn't been straightened. We had jackets with hoods but I didn't think it was going to be cold enough so I planned to wag. I was near the kitchen and Dad reminded me to make breakfast. Then Ezra was there. We got to school which was really different and I told Ezra to go upstairs (so I could tell him I was walking). We were in this big room. Ezra said "Hey Aunt Sally' and I saw her sitting in there. I didn't know any of the teachers there. It was for form so I was trying to find mine. There was a guy and a girl and I asked each of them if they were from B2 but neither answered. A movie about some wagging boy had come out recently. There was something about A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm McDowell was hitting some guy in the balls. This lady teacher was annoying me so I yelled at her and started walking out. Ms Pascal was coming and everyone ran out of the room, so I went with them to sneak out. There was a pink bike near some trees. I took it, but had trouble with it. I got home. All these people turned up outside a while later. Aunt Sally, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur, Dad and others. Dad came and talked to me calmly, then Mom came to stay with me.
