I was in a house. It was a beautiful, large home with expensive furnishings. I went to the kitchen where I saw some people whom I couldn't quite recognize. I saw 4 dogs, one of which was a collie. I also saw a small girl, an acquaintance of mine. I then found myself in the basement where I was watching my husband (24) and brother playing pinochle. My brother (24) took the hand, but somehow my husband won money.
