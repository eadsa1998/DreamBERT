This dream was very vague and confused. I can't tell exactly where it took place. It seemed to be in a basement of some building. In this room they were selling eggs - There seemed to be many regular egg boxes piled up in rows in the room. I was apparently watching some man, whom I can't identify, gathering the eggs. He was just about to take a egg when one of the chickens pecked at his hand which caused it to bleed. I don't recall any thing else that occurred after that.
