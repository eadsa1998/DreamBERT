My father and mother had become parents of a baby boy. I went to see him at the hospital and he was absolutely the smallest baby I'd ever seen. It seems my mother was my father's third wife. I was the daughter of his 1st wife and my younger sister was the daughter of his 2nd wife. However, the 3rd wife in the dream had the appearance of my real mother. My dad was very happy because it was a boy. Suddenly the happy father was my husband and he said, "I knew you'd come through." It seems that I was the mother.
