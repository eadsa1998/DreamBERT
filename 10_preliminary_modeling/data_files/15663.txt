Somehow, Tyrion (Game of Thrones) and I were romantically involved. We would sneak off to these other castle buildings -- there was a big castle thing which was the main place and then there were lots of little buildings around. We were sitting in one, holding each other and talking. He wanted to give up his inheritance to run off with me. Later, we walked out of the castle together and people were watching, so I said "I'll go walk around and meet you" and smiled. We split up and I walked to the right to walk around the buildings and go through a back entrance. Some people followed me though.
