 I buy something at a store, and then I go to the service desk. My friend from Brimson Sara Miller is working there. I haven't seen her in a while, and she has longer hair. I go up to her and she doesn't talk to me. Another woman assists me. I want to put something on my credit card, when I had actually written a check for it. Then Sara speaks to me. She is holding a grudge against me: she says I'm a ____ (the equivalent of an asshole or a fucker). The woman that is assisting me says something. I decide to play the asshole role that Sara says I am, so I tell the woman to shut the fuck up. I say to Sara, "You know how I am: I mean no offense", implying that she has no reason to hold a grudge against me. She changes her attitude towards me and gives me a piece of paper that says Happy Birthday Kenneth. We seem to get along fine then, and she is her smiling self. (183 words)
