I was going to take a course in a hospital. It was a course for nursing students. It was on child development and children's diseases, and I was wandering thru the hospital at night trying to find the exit so I could get out in the front and then I could find the entrance that I wanted so I would be at the right place for this class. So I finally did and asked the instructor if I could audit and he said yes it would. It was going to run for several years, but that was right with me because it would take child development as long as my children were developing. That would be fine with me.
