I am shooting at a man who stole millions of dollars. I fire bullet after bullet. Several hit him in the leg or back. He flinches, but keeps running. Howard (sheriff) stands to my left. I reload the gun and throw away some spent shells. The bad guy locks himself in a vault-like place with a small window of thick glass. I load a huge empty "dum dum" shell and fire it at the glass. It's like a bazooka or flame thrower fire starts. I see his eye huge, scared and prominent peering out at the fire. I know I've got him now. I wonder how "they" made his eye so prominent. Probably colored it a special color to draw attention to it. The fire spreads and he runs out. I yell, "Get the money." I start to go in, but the flames are too much. So I order four women to go in (deputies) They do, and throw out boxes with stacks and stacks of bills.
