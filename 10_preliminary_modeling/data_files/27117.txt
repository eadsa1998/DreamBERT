I dreamt I was riding on a streetcar and was watching the conductor operate the car. I began to notice the lever which he turned when we rounded a bend. It soon felt as though I were operating the car with him. When we came to a sharp corner, I went through the motions of turning the lever and steering the car. The next thing I knew, I was on top of the car which had now turned into a train. It seemed as though I was very high up and the train was traveling very fast. Several times I nearly fell off, and I felt very frightened. I was also afraid that I would attempt to jump off. I was particularly anxious when the train rounded a bend. I noticed next that another family was sitting on the top of the train with me. A small baby was there and seemed to be thrilled with the ride. I felt as though I was the only one who was frightened.
