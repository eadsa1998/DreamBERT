Big holiday at Church: a gallery for visitors and many children, including ours, crawling around on the grass. I am concerned about glasses (drinking glasses?) and gather them up; first I sit with Frank and look down on the ceremony. Then go down and discuss with Father Andrew and others why so few people come. Many reasons: it is the first of the month, difficult time of day, etc. I realize I forgot to take communion, but do not feel guilty.
