I was wrestling at a match on a county league. I won the match and everyone was cheering for me. A cute boy my age on my team came up to congratulate me. Then he put his arm around my waist and he took me home. He walked me to my door and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I felt so happy. He went back to his car and drove away. I went to my room feeling as light as a feather. The next match I won again. Some boy on the other team tried t pick a fight with me. But the cute boy came over to protect me. I gave him a hug and he took me home. He gave me another kiss. I was so happy I forgot to say hi to my mom. Then I went to my room and laid down, and my alarm woke me up.
