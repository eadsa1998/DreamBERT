I am holding a baby boy and he changes into a sort of cute, large lady bug-like creature. I hold him carefully. I like him. I am walking, now, holding Rena up as I am taking her in to take her bath. Another woman is in the tub already and I think of putting the baby into the bath with her, and then feel embarrassed I would think of doing that without even any consideration for her wishes. She gets out and starts to drain the water. I start to clean the tub for Rena. She gets in too quickly, some of the other woman's water is still in there. Her face is right at the surface of the water. I smile and ask if she is OK. She says yes.
