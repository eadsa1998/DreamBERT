I get into the back of my van and suddenly I see a man in a corner. He steps toward me with the intention of raping me. At first I feel resigned and paralyzed, not knowing what to do. And then I start screaming, "Help!" as loud as I can. He realizes I'll fight back, so he leaves. I quickly shut doors and lock them, glancing nervously at the corner he came from and drive away. I come to a river and get out. I have to get on a bus to cross. I climb up the stairs in great pain, asking if there are any seats near the back. I crawl over people and choose not to sit by some guy. I didn't like the way he looked. Then I am in a house and a man intends to have sex with me. I am not in agreement, but somehow I know I have to. There is some antagonistic and prideful remark I make. I'll at least keep my pride and dignity. I go upstairs and see a turd in the toilet. I then see a movie and say, "That's not a good movie for me to see now." It's about someone who must use their talents to their full potential and someone who gives up and doesn't. I say to him, "You don't think I'm going to make it easy for you, do you?"
