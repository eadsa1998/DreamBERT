The second story was of a woman.  For a while I was her, and was in a Curves Gym class.  This consisted of sitting on something and moving it- it was like a large spring-mounted horse as seen at old playgrounds.  The woman was with some friends, and her boyfriend ended up stealing something out of her car.
