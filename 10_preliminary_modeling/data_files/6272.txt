Last night's dream I had was that I was a commuting student at a college. However, the college I was commuting to was in England. Yeah, I know, it's far-fetched, but in my dream I would fly to England on Sunday nights and fly back to Boston on Thursdays. You see I went to study overseas in September, however, it didn't work out so I came back to Suffolk. Now somehow or another in my dream I would go to that same school and instead of taking their curriculum I would be taking Suffolk's curriculum with all of the students who I met over there. The weird thing was I no longer hated it. I actually loved going to school there now and I felt at peace with myself to be able to study there without feeling any anxieties. In the dream it worked for everybody including my parents. They were happy that I could finally see England and enjoy it. When I was there I didn't enjoy any part of being over there. So because of the dream I now feel that I have successfully done what is right for me - - to stay in Suffolk.
