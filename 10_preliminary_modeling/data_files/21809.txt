I was in Rivertown with Carl Fisher and Judy. We were on the street near the schoolhouse. Fisher went into the house and then as he was coming out, we saw a tiger walking toward us. Fisher went back into the house and I walked to the corner for Judy. I didn't see her and then I was in the house and Judy was home in the parlor. I told her to look out the door and if she saw a wild animal, to shut the door. I looked out and it was dark outside. I was flying with Judy in my arms. We were out in the woods. I had a rifle and we were looking for the tiger. A man came to the door. I asked him what he wanted and he said, "Mrs. Evans." He said she was outside. I opened the door and I looked out and saw her in bed. She was getting out of bed and there seemed to be someone under the covers. I was going to investigate, but I awoke.
