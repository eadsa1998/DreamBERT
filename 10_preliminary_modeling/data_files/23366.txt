I dreamed that a murder had been committed (I think Doctor C. had been killed), and I was engaged with another man in a close survey of the premises. My companion had climbed into a dusty gallery that opened from a hole in the wall of a large bare room. Presently then he called to me that he had discovered the identity of the murderer. I followed him into the confined space where he was, and we bent over a large brass headed tack in the floor. On the head of the tack were two distinct images, in color, of a man we both recognized.
