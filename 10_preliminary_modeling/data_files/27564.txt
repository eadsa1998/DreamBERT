I seemed to be eating lunch in E---- hall, however, the dining room looked more like a club room. After dinner it was announced that everyone had to leave because a chemistry group was going to have a meeting there. A man with red hair called off a list of names of new veteran students who were invited to remain. One on the list was a girl. During lunch, before the meeting, one of the boys was talking about the immoral practices of the army nurses overseas. I was glad I could say that I hadn't been overseas.
