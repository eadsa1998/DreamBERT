I was in a dream. I was at a house with celebrities including Bill Murray, who was in a coat and hat with glasses. I made breakfast for everyone but I had toast with a really red and tasty apple. As I left, Darius and some others went to the front of the house to get autographs. I got in the car with Mom and Ezra. Bill Murray took the bin back up and I pointed him out to them and said 'that's Bill Murray'. I told them this was a dream and we talked about it. They were very 'real' and seemed to actually be thinking for themselves.
