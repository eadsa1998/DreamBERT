There were three people involved, myself and two fellows whom I didn't recognize. There was no particular setting. Me and one fellow took the other fellow and tied him to a reclining tree or bench or such. It was at a 45 degree angle. Our mood was playful and we were aware of what we were doing. After tying the guy, we poured gas over his feet and lit it. I did this all with the intent to stop before the guy was hurt. I waited for the other guy to realize what he was doing. He never said anything and for some reason I didn't put out the fire. The guy on fire was screaming, naturally. The dream ended there. [playful, anxious, both pleasant and unpleasant, no color]
