I dreamed that I was in the snack bar. Everyone in there was fast asleep, so I attempted to sleep too. I remember I was in between Lou and Albert. Lou and I were talking, and then he started to kiss me. I was annoyed because I was pretty sure that he didn't think he was kissing me. I pushed him away but he kept kissing me. Then I left and had to be Santa's elf or something and help build the sleigh. Lou began to get sick, so I have him some cheese to help him feel better. We finally finished the sleigh, and then I woke up.
