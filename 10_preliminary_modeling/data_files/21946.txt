We were climbing thru a window onto some kind of stand which was shaky and about two stories high. Judy also was with us and she almost fell, but I caught hold of her. We were sliding and mixing objects on the floor. The black ones were supposed to be colored people. We mixed them, one here and there among the whites. I was watching boys play baseball and then I joined them and played with them.
