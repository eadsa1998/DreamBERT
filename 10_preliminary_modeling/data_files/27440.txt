I dreamed I went to New York with 2 girls of my age; and while waiting for an elevator in a hotel lobby, we noticed a blind man getting about by himself without any aid. I made some remark about pitying him; and he became so enraged, he started to chase me. He kept chasing me around the block; but despite the many people on the streets (many were C-- whom I knew) and despite the fact that he was blind, he relentlessly pursued me. He finally caught me and I tearfully told him that I had meant no harm. He started to laugh and said he was just trying to demonstrate that pity was wasted on him. Besides, he told me, he liked the sound of my voice. We then proceeded to tell all about ourselves to each other and I found out that he was a famous athlete. We then parted after making a date for later that day and I realized we were in love with each other.
