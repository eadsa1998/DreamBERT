["Reindeer ride."] I am at a large family gathering. Long tables in long rows. Many of them. Dinner is over and I walk between the tables collecting small souvenir glasses of various shapes. Small square, short round ones, stemmed small goblets. Dora is there. She had brought the glasses as little gifts. Maybe its Xmas. I decide I want to drive a small sled with one reindeer. They tuck me in under warm blankets and I start slowly, gain confidence. I go around the outside of the tables in a large square. By the 3rd corner I am going very fast and have improved my driving is now quite good. I feel good.
