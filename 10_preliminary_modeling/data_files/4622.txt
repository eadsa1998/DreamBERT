["Red haired rapist."] A red headed man sneaks up to my bedroom window. I am hurt, lying in bed and realize he is a rapist. I grab my phone and call 911. I can't remember my address. I say I am within a quarter mile or a hundred yards of a state park. It feels like the same location as the reunion dream, but not the same house. He comes into the house and talks to me, telling me to let him have sex with me. I try and fight, pulling his hair hard. He threatens to hurt me more if I struggle. I am trying to fight hi off and also aware I'd want to have sex. These feelings are within me.
