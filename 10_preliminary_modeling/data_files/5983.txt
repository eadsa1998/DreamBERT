My brother X. and I drive to a beach in the cool autumn. I set up a chair near the roadway and X. wanders a little bit down the sloping beach. He gathers a lot of sand from nearby and builds an elevated walkway leading to the top of a two-story, tall, round castle turret. He sets up his chair there and surveys the entire beach. I am bored with my position and decide to explore. I follow the elevated sand walkway and reach the turret. The view is nice, but there are some large rocks ahead which block the vista of the sea. I leave the smoothly constructed sand castle and climb down onto the rough, jagged rocks. The going is slow but I eventually reach the top of a tall rock right at the water's edge. I look below and see Y. (a female friend from work) swimming in the ocean. "Come on in", she calls, "it's nice." "The water must be too cold this time of year", I reply, and I do not go any further.
