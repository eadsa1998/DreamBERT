I had two interesting dreams. In the first one, I and my husband were out in the yard. There were several other people out there too. And I happened to be looking up in the sky, and I saw two what seemed to be stars rising up into the air through the clouds. And one seemed to be following the other and chasing it. And I realized that these were really two planes or two rockets or something. And the one which was following the other one got in front of it somehow, and then there was this flash of something that looked like lightning between the two. And one of them, then there was this huge, bright explosion. And I knew it was an atom bomb, and that probably this had been a Russian airplane and one of ours. And so I grabbed my husband and told him to quick, run inside the house. And we did. And then after the shock wave and everything had passed, there wasn't any visible damage around. But we knew there was radiation outside. And several other people came in with us. And the rest of this dream, which seemed to occupy hours and hours, was spent in trying to close up the windows, block them off with things so that some less radiation would get in. And this gave me a very warm and cozy feeling, to be making everything so tight and sealed off and everything. And that was really about all of that dream.
