 My sister Ramona, others, and I are at a family gathering. There are photographs of the Redding family and the Redding's children's families. All the grandchildren are assigned to be Grandma Redding's best friend. I think this isn't a good idea: it is impractical. The grandchildren won't ever call her like a best friend does.
