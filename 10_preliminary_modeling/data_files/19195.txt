The dream began in a kitchen in an apartment, and I was preparing dinner for myself and for a woman who was also there and who apparently was my wife. I was preparing minute steak and potatoes and the argument was about whether or not I should make potatoes, and as I woke up, I was reaching up in the cupboard bringing down a can of sliced potatoes. That's it. Questioned. Did not recognize woman. Dreamer's age. Argument over whether they should have potatoes for dinner. Dreamer wanted potatoes, woman didn't. Dreamer never uses canned potatoes. Not a violent argument, a snide one. No color. Not a pleasant dream. She was unreasonable, probably V (the girl he is going with now).
