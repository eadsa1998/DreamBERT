I went out the back and there were two frogs in the pool. Dad came out too and there were some lizards. One was this long thing and Dad was like "You mind if I don't hurt it?". I said "That's what I always say!". I went back inside and there was a little gecko in the games room chasing me around. There was a yellowy lizard in the sink, which had appeared before I went out the back. I was rinsing out a bowl with hot water but changed to cold because I didn't want to hurt the lizard.
