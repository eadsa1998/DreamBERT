There are many rooms in a house. I walk toward the bathroom. I am playing a musical instrument, like a guitar or mandolin. I say, "Look, I just relax and don't think, and the music comes up from my memory." I am pleased. I start to walk into the bathroom and my mother is in there putting on her clothes. I see her "bush" as she pulls up her pants. I turn around quickly and say, "I'm sorry. I'll wait." She says, "It's OK." I go in and look around the room. There is an old-fashioned bath tub, the room is large. I think, "I can put in big beautiful plants." There is a window with an ornate, carved, gold leaf frame over it. A mirror has the same decoration. I think about curtains and remember white gauze like curtains lying on the floor outside in the hall. I go back out and realize I've placed my bedroom clear across the house and it is inconvenient. I see a door next to the bathroom and think, "I'll bet this would be a good bedroom." I open the door. It's not as pretty as I wanted it to be - empty bookshelves, white paint, ordinary. I step in and then notice an alcove with a bed in it off the main room. It was neat. I turn and see clothes hanging on the door, a red striped shirt. I think, "How wonderful dreams are to create all this detail." I see another alcove and go to explore. I turn on the light and at first it is dark. Then I try to will it light, and then it's bright, reality-like light. It was like I'd woken up and was seeing my own room, and then went back to the dream room.
