I was in the bush and people with guns were chasing me. I climbed a tree and they couldn't find me. They shone a light and found me, so I ran away. There was this strange video game, where you make people from parts of other people. I made a cool one. There were lots of graffiti backgrounds. I think the game was called Screenie.
