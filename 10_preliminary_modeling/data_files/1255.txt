I am in a pretty little house. Water rushes in the alley behind it like a river going downhill, emptying out into the streets. Then it reverses directions and rushes to the other street. I say to Ellie, "This sure is a cute little house." I go out and look at it from the outside. Now Ellie is driving and I'm sitting in the back looking through the back window at my house. I see Nate and Rochelle sitting on the front porch. Nate has sunglasses on. He sees me and smiles. I try not to respond. I feel a warm sense of happiness at seeing him and I'm thinking, "I don't want to see you." We go around the block. I'm teaching her how to drive. Now it's crowded. I say, "Slow down, be careful." She says she can't stop because of the water. I look but I don't see any water. I get out and go to a store. I find some of my belongings out in front. I pick them up and also see a beautiful pair of earrings. I think of taking them too. A woman comes by and says, "Are you taking my earrings?" I say, "Certainly not. It's just that my finger got stuck while I was looking at them!" I find another pair, they look Indian, no clips. I ask the store owner if they can be fixed. She says, "No."
