 I'm in the kitchen at home in Oak Valley with my mom, my brother Wally, and my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I say to my mom I need to take a walk. I go out and walk down the hill in the alley. Annie is following me. She then passes me. I see that it is not her, but rather a softball player that I recognize from Brimson. I run down the hill on 2nd Street to get a ball that went down the hill of the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue. Annie is on the other side of the yard. She thinks I am following her. I am back on 2nd Street. Annie and our friend Elise Rooks and my sister Ramona are standing near the intersection of the alley and 2nd Street. I get really mad at them. I throw a walnut at them. The walnut still has its cover over the shell. It hits Ramona in the nose! I feel guilty, and go over to see if she is okay. Annie and Elise are laughing. I am furiously mad at them! I say angrily and seriously, "I really don't deserve to be treated this way. I really don't!" I go back to the house. My mom and Wally and one other person are playing a hand of the card game Cut Throat. I get a really bad bloody nose. Someone is leaving on a plane early in the morning.
