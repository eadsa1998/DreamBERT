 I'm walking in a university setting that seems to be in Southern Australia. I walk by my classmate Yolanda Ginsburg, who I know is also studying in Australia. It's strange to see her. We say a surprised, "Hi!" I walk on. There is a crow. Something is happening to the crow: it is doing something that makes me question my perception. I ask myself if I'm dreaming, and I float upwards, flying. I realize I'm dreaming. I struggle to stay on the ground and concentrate hard to make myself fly down. I seek to have sex with someone. I meet my acquaintance Eve Nichols and we have sex. I lose my lucidity at some point, but regain it later. My friend Paul Jones and his roommate Cordero are there, with others. Paul is fighting someone.
