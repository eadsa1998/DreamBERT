It was after a big banquet. Mrs. McC offered to give me some advice if I wouldn't be hurt but as she whispered, I couldn't catch much and explain I can't hear whispered speech. Looking at the dining room, long tables. O.M. inside eating, as still set up for the banquet. Ai. Tells of people who didn't like being moved. I decide it's time to dress and tell Baby Kolt so and to come along. Notice how very hairy Eu. Is. A man is in the room without clothes. I have on only a lion cloth. Suppose the stranger thinks it's family custom to go about with little on.
