I was at school. I was in the class next to Ezra's in a computer room. We got into a little fight. Then I went into this other room to do my "art work" and he had squirted this red/yellow sauce on it. Ms Solomon was egging him on. I yelled at him. Then I said to the teacher that I was leaving. There were only a few minutes left to the end of school anyway. I was then in some lady's van with Mom and Ezra. They went into the bakery at Midvale shops, but they made me stay as they didn't trust the lady. I asked for a chocolate muffin. They had the right notebooks for my dreams, but Mom had already bought me the right one this morning. This grey plane, which looked like a giant beetle, was flying around the carpark. It wasn't being driven very well and I said "I wouldn't be surprised if it hit us". Then it landed on the car in front of us, and rolled and just missed us. I took a photo of it as we left. Mom took me to this lady's house. There were cops up the street at another house. Mom suspected this lady of killing her kid. There was no furniture in the house and I said "this looks like a big hall", there was light against the wall from the window behind me. She asked me where I'd put some table because her cat, Pudding, liked to sit on tables. She left and I was alone. I saw a cage thing with something dark in it. Mom came and I shone the light from my phone in there and it was a dead baby. Mom called out bye, but the lady realized we'd found it and started bashing us up. These spirits that we'd saved came and were threatening her. This new girl spirit got excited and lost control and killed her. Sam (Supernatural) and I were then out the back chucking stuff into the ocean. There were a lot of bags and they wouldn't push out to sea. There was a little area out the back of her house and there was a lizard and I fed it to something. There were snacks nearby. Sam complained about all the bags and I said "wait until you do mine!".
