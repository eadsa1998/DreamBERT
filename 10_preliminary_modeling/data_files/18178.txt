It seems we're up in my husband's hometown visiting his mother and there were several rather confused things and we were going to go back home to my university town the day after tomorrow. We were wondering whether we should go to Europe for the next day. I wanted to, but nobody else thought it would be a very good idea, but we were talking about how when we came back in the fall that we could get maps and where to buy groceries and everything from this aunt and uncle of my husband's, Gilda and Bernie, because they had been there the last summer or something.
