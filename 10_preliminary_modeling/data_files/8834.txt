Rolling down a snowy mountain. Landing right by the edge of a lake. There is one small boat with a man and his young daughter. There is another boat just like it with his young son in it. I don't know them. There is a small ice-fishing shed. At some point in the dream there is some kind of relationship between me and them, but I don't remember what it was. I was in a college dorm room. I crawled out my window to get away from someone or to hide from someone. I was hanging from something holding on with my hands, but I fell to my death. Later in the dream another young woman on campus died. We were talking to each other after both of us had died. Not being accepted by a particular group of students. Being one of a group of four cheerleaders that never gets to actually participate in the cheers, but always ends up sitting on the sidelines. Susan J and Dorothea D. Shopping.
