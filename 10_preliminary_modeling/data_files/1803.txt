I am teaching a workshop. A cute man is interested in me. I finish one section and during the break I go up to the 4th floor on the elevator. He comes with me. I am standing on a bed reaching up to a shelf to get my things. He is sleeping on the bed. He wakes up and is delighted to see me there. He smiles and hugs my legs trying to pull me to him. I am attracted and we tease. I push the button for the elevator. It comes. It is small, tall, and narrow. We get in and I say, "This is like being in a coffin." We get to the basement where I'm to teach the next seminar. Lots of people are there. I want to find a bathroom. All there is, is a toilet with no door and a see-through curtain. I call a group of women over to stand around me, holding up articles of clothing. They laugh and joke. After I am through, a woman comes up and hands me a dime. I had just dropped some pennies and was glad to get rid of them because I had no pocket. She's buying 10 pingpong balls to play a game. Then I see a cabinet with a tiny black and white TV set in it like an old 1940's set. I comment on it.
