There's a girl in my bed. I hear a voice (I suppose, telepathically) telling me something like she's always been more comfortable in "the other world" (i.e., dream world) or the dream world is better for her. I pick her up to bring her downstairs, but I decide instead to put her back in bed and cover her completely. An evil spirit tries to "convert her" or something and her mother is converted too. This is the part I don't understand in the least I don't remember what they were converted to, although I know it wasn't something good.
