Sickle's image came to mind as I was awakening. I was playing ball. I ran and caught flies. I saw Muchunis's paper. He had about 3 horses that he played _, _, _. I don't remember the names. I saw Ekirs printed in large letters. I saw the moon. It seemed close. I could see the clouds float around it. I had a good look at it.
