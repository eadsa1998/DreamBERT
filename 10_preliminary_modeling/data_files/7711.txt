I was staying or living in a house with a large number of young people visiting. I think they may have just been visiting. The boys had made spaghetti to impress the girls. I told them I would show them how to make spaghetti that would really impress their girls, because theirs wouldn't. We started making the spaghetti. As we were breaking it up, we were putting it in sauce instead of water. Two of them were helping me break up the spaghetti. As soon as I realized we were putting it in the sauce we changed and started putting it in the water. The next thing I knew there was a man and an older Italian woman that wasn't there earlier. She was giving me a hard time, saying I don't know how to make good spaghetti either. I was trying to ignore her. I was thinking about the sauce. We needed to add garlic and (green spice?) to it. Earlier I used my arms and swept everything off the tables to start over.
