I am traveling in my wheelchair down country roads. I want to go to a resort town. I come to a cliff where the earth stops and a huge tree is the only way down. I get out of my wheelchair and shinny down the tree, literally getting out on limbs and feeling shaky and not too safe, but managing to get from one branch to another and on down to the ground. I'm in Mexico now and at a hotel with Paulina, my daughter. There are American tourists around but I don't really like them, sort of the ugly American type. I speak Spanish as best I can and can't remember lots of words. I go on a tour with a woman employee of the hotel. She shows me a path next to a river and we walk. I see a square bit of water and say, "Is this a lake?" She says, "No, it's a massage table." I look again and see it's a water bed kind of mattress and is next to windows where a person could be soothingly massaged while seeing the beautiful landscape. I want to do that. Then I notice a huge stairway and realize that is the front (el frente) of the hotel and we had taken a circular path from the hotel around it to the front. The guide is pleased that I noticed. I go back in and go to a buffet breakfast. I find fruit and look for pancakes and so on. Then Paulina and I go to our room and I have her try on a beige lace dress I want to wear. We are going to refit it so I can wear it. I pull up the waist and realize that if I wear it as is, it will be fine. I am surprised because I thought we'd have to spend days fixing it. I try it on and say, "I hope I remembered to pack my slip," because the dress is see-through with all the lace. I realize I still look pretty good and the fat belly actually looks kind of alluring, like a belly dancer's belly.
