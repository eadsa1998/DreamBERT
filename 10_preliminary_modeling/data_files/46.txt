A LT is starting ( or Prep Night) in a room that looks like an old-time school - wood everywhere and we even seem to be dressed for the setting. It's all disorganized, people aren't in their places on time and part of the reason is that some other sort of class is going on next door that overlaps and the ones in the LT have to be let go from it, so they trickle in after we've started.
