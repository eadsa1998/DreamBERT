I was in a strange town. I had just heard about Chet Miller's being killed. Chet Miller had been killed two days previously in time trials at the Indianapolis Speedway. I was driving my car up a sidestreet in town looking for the remains of his car. I saw it but it was not badly damaged. Upon arriving at the hospital I entered the operating room. They had already wrapped up Miller's body in rubber sheets and heavy rope. A girl that I am going with was an attending nurse but she didn't seem to recognize me. She is 23. Chet Miller was 50 years old.
