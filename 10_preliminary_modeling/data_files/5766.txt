[1997-06-21] My wife and I were separated and had been for about 6 months and I had to go to our old house to do something and I know that will be uncomfortable. We still get along and everything but its going to feel so strange going there since we're not together anymore. The next thing I remember was being at my in-laws' house with my wife and was in their yard trying to retrieve 2 garbage cans that belong to us. One of them had a lot of garbage in it and was fairly heavy, the other one was empty and I went up into the yard to get the one and I ended up getting in between a bunch of hedges and flower beds and couldn't find my way back out and I had to ask for help. My brother in law Moe, who doesn't live with his wife anymore, in fact lives in another town, was there and he was directing me, telling me where to put my feet without trampling the hedges to get the garbage cans out of there and I ended up spilling all of the garbage out of the full one and I knew that I would have to ask him to help me pick up the garbage.
