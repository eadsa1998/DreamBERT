I was at the old house and I had a boyfriend. Something happened and he left and I followed him, pleading him to stay away from the car and he broke up with me by saying that he was 'busy for a year'. I was upset and went back in. Dad and Ezra got into an argument and Dad said he saw what he did with Emery last night. He called Mom saying he wasn't a virgin and it turned out he had had sex with Emery. Ezra was quiet and upset about it.
