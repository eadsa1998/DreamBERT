I was working somewhere and Hugo was working near me. He said that I shouldn't wear the same pants because they smelled. I was a bit shocked and I said 'I have no sense of smell' and he said 'yeah I know, but we can'. I was shocked at how forward he was (and he didn't seem fazed one bit about saying anything) and I was a bit hurt. I was also wearing clean pants so I didn't get it.
