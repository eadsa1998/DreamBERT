 I'm at a casino with some guys. My friend Nate Nelling is one of them. He's playing a $1 Red-White-And-Blue slot machine. I visualize the machine giving him a red, white, and blue 7, and it does! Nate wins $680. He takes his money to high stakes, gets a new dealer, and plays cards: poker and blackjack. He loses very badly. I watch.
