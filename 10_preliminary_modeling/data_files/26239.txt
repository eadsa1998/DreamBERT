 I'm in a class where the professor is my professor Jerry Rice. I have told one of my dreams, and the class is discussing it. Jerry asks me a direct question about the content of a dream and its meaning, saying, "...isn't that right?" as he is one of his long tangents. I firmly say, "No! That's not right!" I then go on to explain why it isn't right and point out a flow in the method Jerry is using. I say people may propose interpretations or ideas for the dreamer, but it is entirely up to the dreamer to evaluate each and take the concepts that he or she finds useful. One should not pose a direct question to the dreamer, by saying, "Isn't that right?". My firm and clear knowledge of what I'm saying impress Emilia, the woman that sits in front of me in my Brain, Mind and Behavior class. She says she wants to work with me. There are caramel rolls there. Jerry comes up to me and apologizes. He explains his error, his reasoning, and fault. We talk. December 10th is the due date for the Laird Addis stuff. The mail of one person is being distributed to the people there. I get some stamps form Publishers Clearing House. The Playboy stamp is among them.
