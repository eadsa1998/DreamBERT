I was organizing things, and putting them in order. I was working in the office of a retail business. An employee was stealing clothing from the company for her baby or toddler, partially because there were things that she needed and couldn't afford but some of things she stole were simply things that she wanted. One part of the office reminds me of the backroom of NTNS except it was much longer and the ceiling was much higher. We have lost something and there are several of us looking for it. We're looking in an area that looks like the backroom. It seems to be about the same size and shape of a flipchart but I know that's not what it is. It does have something to do with information though. Susan J is working in the backroom of NTNS. She is very cheery. There have been some changes and she is telling me how much more comfortable she is working there now. There are two male employees and one male member of the top management team get into an elevator. I reached out and stopped the doors from closing so I could get in as well. We thought we had stopped this employee from stealing. I'm sitting in a car in a parking lot and see her with a male in vehicle. I realize that she has still been stealing from us and her mom has been helping her without being aware that she is helping her to steal. It's as though I'm watching a TV commercial with a bunch of young people in their late teens or early twenties. The camera focuses in on just one of them. They are humming a tune while going. The camera changes focus to another one who is humming the same tune. They do this maybe ten or twelve times with a number of different people. The background or environment is different each time. There is a marching band in uniform giving a performance. The song that they are playing is the same one that all of the young people were humming.
