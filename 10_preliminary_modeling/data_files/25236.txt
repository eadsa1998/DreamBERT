 I'm playing capture the flag. My brother Wally is on my team. There is a secret building that we are trying to get into. The opening to the building is a small rectangular box. Wally gets in first. I follow. Other people are coming soon after us. To get in, there are ants that turn to their left. When their path changes, we gain access. We don't have much time. The building is like a pyramid with mazes, with many chambers. Adjacent to some chambers are secret passageways. I need ammunition for my gun. We are using water guns. I find out flag. It is a wood pole with a black cloth tied to one end. I need to re-hide it because others are coming soon and may shoot me. I want to come back with a good gun and reinforcements. I find a secret passage. It's a way out. I had previously thought that there was only one way out, and that I'd have to go back. The passage is a small window. I get outside, and it is snowy. I get Andrew, and tell him the plan to load up and go in. A player must be hit in the legs to be out. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and my cousin Henry King are on my team. My high school classmate Ned Stallone and my college friend Amy Leopard are on the other team.
