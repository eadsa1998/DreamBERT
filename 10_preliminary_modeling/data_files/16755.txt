I'm home (from a Christmas party? or something) and I see my cat Muffin on the stairs and I assume he knows something about music, or something like that. It's a weird thought; I don't remember it clearly. Then I walk upstairs and I hear the word "aging" and in my bedroom is a documentary of the aging process of my grandfather's young cat, Doc. It's not a video documentary, it's like a small museum. I remember seeing either pictures of or 3D representations of Doc all over the room.
