I was in an airport (I think) somewhere-apparently in the city where my alma mater is located because I saw Ralph Stone and wasn't too surprised, other than by the coincidence of our both being at the airport at the same time.  I was quite surprised, though, to see Ronnie Nadner there.  He was quite distraught, saying his mother had died and he was on his way to my hometown.  He was almost in tears; I had never seen him so upset.
