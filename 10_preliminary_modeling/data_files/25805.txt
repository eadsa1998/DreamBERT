 I'm in prison. Some black men and some when men are arguing. There is tension between them. The black men are the aggressors. They are angry, they say. They want more rights, and want the white men to go back to Europe. One black man punches and kicks some of the white men in the face. He crushes them, smashing their skulls and popping their heads. He turns into a fire-breathing beast with horns! He is about 15 feet tall, a huge monster! Everyone runs. When I run he comes after me and grabs me with one of his arms. He is going to hurt or eat me. I realize I am dreaming. I break free of his grasp and crush him by clapping my hands around him, flattening him like a pancake between my hands. Since I am dreaming I pick up a picnic table and try to break it in half. At first I can't do this, but then I do. I think I should be more productive in my dream, so I fly. I run and jump, and get very low to the ground, but I do fly. I want to ejaculate, so I imagine myself having sex as I float on my back. Then I lie on my stomach and rub or thrust against the ground. I'm near Carter Church in Oak Valley. My friend Ivory Alshire goes by on roller blades. At this point I have lost my lucidity. I go into the north side door of the church. There are oranges piled up that have greenish growths on them. I go into a meeting of education with social leaders there. It is like a city council meeting. I offer words of advice, which are well taken. There is a black man in a green suit in front of me. There is some odd black stitching on the collar of his suit. There are two women next to me that are vigorously taking notes. People are talking about education. The speaker or leader says PET boxes aren't even available to high school teachers through public funding. These PET boxes contain each student's academic history. The issue debated is how to fund everything.
