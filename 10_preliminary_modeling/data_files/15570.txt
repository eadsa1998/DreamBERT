I was at home which was different. There were people across the road and I heard Scottish accents so I listened closely and there was a curly redhead guy. He said his friend was "local-ish". His sister came out as well. This guy said 'fitba'. I was thinking that I loved the accents. Then I was in a car with Benjamin and two friends in the front. Farrah came and gave us an invite to her birthday on the 22nd October. Ezra was there and said 'happy birthday' and so did I, but it got drowned out. Emery and someone else had gotten back from a holiday and we went over. There were nice biscuits from Canberra. They had really neat hangers on the wall.
