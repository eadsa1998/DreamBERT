The crew was working on a car and I was at a computer trying to find information that would help them. I seem to have an Excel sheet with columns of information. not numbers but text. Some of the cells were hyperlinks so I would click on them, read what I found and decide if it was useful. If it was I would cut and paste it into a document and give it to the crew. If it wasn't I deleted it. I was also moving some things around on the Excel sheet to a different place in the column it was in or to a different column. I don't know what that was about.
