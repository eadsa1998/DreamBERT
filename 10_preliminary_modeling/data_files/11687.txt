I was standing near the bank of a river. The surroundings were dark and suspicious and I was afraid. I suddenly felt myself falling into space without even coming to a halt. Suddenly I plunged into the icy cold water. I could not swim. I cried for help. I heard someone calling and coming toward me. He began laughing at me. I looked at him. He was an old schoolmate of mine whom I detested. He laughed again and said he would let me drown. I screamed and as rapidly as I screamed he laughed. I felt myself drowning but he wouldn't help me. Then the scene became blank. I plunged into darkness fighting for breath. I was afraid. I felt a pressure against me. I wanted help but received only a little laugh. I could do nothing as the water pressed into me.
