["Stay of execution indictment."] I only have 2 hours to live before I am executed. I find it shocking to imagine not existing anymore. I feel fear. I must present myself to the court for my execution. I walk there. A woman lawyer says to me, you can file a stay of execution indictment and they have to hear the appeal. I almost off handedly say Oh, I don't know. I mean the thing is already scheduled and I don't want to upset anything. Then it occurs to me that not dying might be a good thing anyway. Then I feel a bit of remote resentment that my "crime" was merely to be invaded in my home by other people like a burglar. It didn't seem fair. So I finally agree to file the indictment. Then some children with red hair want to go to the movies. The smallest doesn't. I vaguely think going to a movie would be fun, since I'm not going to die. But I tell the child he can go home. I send one of the other kids to walk with him home. Then after they leave I realize that would leave the child alone. So I go and watch him and give up the movie.
