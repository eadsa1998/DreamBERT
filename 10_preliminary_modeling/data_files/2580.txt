My mother is on her knees by my bed and she's very intense. I get up and leave, telling her not to be so intense around me. "A circle complete." A man wins a red convertible "scat wagon" car. I admire it and we agree we'll both own it. I say, "I like to drive." He's happy because he doesn't like to drive. It's a perfect symbiotic relationship. I am driving. I stop to say goodbye to a friend.
