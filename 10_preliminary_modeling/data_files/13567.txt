I was at a school. Tiana there and I think we were friends or I was friends with a loner. I went to a bench and sat at the edge because it was the only dry spot. I saw Evelyn there too. Jillian was there and got up and complained that I was sitting next to her. I called a retard and she was circling me and I complained. She was touching me lightly and then grabbed my shoulders so I kicked her in the face.
