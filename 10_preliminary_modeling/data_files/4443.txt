["In relationship with Lance."] I am in the back seat of a limo with Lance. One of the drivers turns to him and tells him he'd better deal with the men that were being negative at us earlier now or they will continue to bother us. Lance resents being told what he should do. He disagrees with the driver and wants to leave matters as they are. I agree with the driver but I hold my tongue because I don't want to embarrass Lance. It's always better if he figures it out himself. He thinks it over and decides the driver is right. I am happy he agrees. I curl up with him, holding his arm tenderly. We talk. Now we are out of the car. A woman is criticizing him. with other people around. I feel empathy for him. I tell the woman it is impolite to criticizes someone with other people around. I then talk with Lance, reassuring him that he is OK. He complains about how people are on his case and I say, yes, but, my situation is worse. I have to explain to Paulina about us being in relationship.
