I was at school already, that I was in homeroom and we had to fill out these forms which they called "desk-writing forms" that told your GPA last year and some information about yourself, and that they were going to grade us on that. And somebody was showing me mine from last year and I couldn't really read it. It was like diagrammed out, though. And then we were watching some kind of a movie, and then Melinda came and looked at me and said, "Let's go." And then I'm riding in a brown car with her, with brown seats in it. And we go to this restaurant and we're ordering this steak burger thing and all of a sudden she disappears, she takes off. And then I woke up.
