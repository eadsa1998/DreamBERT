I was watching a movie which was from a few years ago and had Oscar Isaac in it playing this cool ladies man. He was clean shaven and looked younger. He had a sister played by this unknown actress and she was at his house/apartment. Sometimes I was her. They had chemistry and were talking in the kitchen and he made a move on her and she went with it. They were in this spa together naked and were high and she had her legs up with her boobs visible and he was eating her out and she was like 'this is the greatest thing'. The next morning they were kind of weird and she was like we shouldn't have done that and he was like why not it was good. Then like later I was at this house and a creepy guy came to the door and had a sign saying like he would steal one thing in exchange for something like a wish. This young girl let him in and grabbed this kitten and said he could have anything else and he took the 'custard' and then all the food in the house with custard in it disappeared (and it was like a lot). Then it was the movie and I was this cop or detective and we were watching Oscar Isaac. At some point he was getting ready and I was there and he put this green/emerald ring on his second finger and changed his mind and got this gold one and then chucked them off and said no rings. Then we were following at a distance through this shop. A lady bumped me and asked me a question and I kept walking and realized my phone wasn't in my pocket. I ran back and found the lady and she admitted she stole it immediately and gave it back. I kept running through the shop but my phone disappeared again and I was annoyed so gave up. Ezra also messaged me saying like 'uh we did it' and I was like what and he said that he got reminded of something and he said we'd had sex and I said we didn't. I said 'either I've wiped the memory from my mind or it didn't happen' and I couldn't imagine it happening because I had no interest.
