I went to see a doctor about getting released from the hospital. He stood behind what looked like a bank teller's window. He was soft-spoken. He seemed to be busy. He was about 40. Later I posed for a photograph. I told my sister about it. She was sprinkling with a hose. She had paint on her index finger. My mother tried to rub it off. She told my sister to be more careful.
