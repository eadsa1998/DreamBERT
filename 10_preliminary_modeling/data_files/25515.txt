 I'm going to the airport. I am near a river area with docks. I fall in the water. I have forgotten my boots and other things. I'm going to check in at the airport, and get on a plane. I have a booklet-like folder that contains my tickets. A man slides a transparency up against the book and matches tickets. There is a man who wants to give me my passport in Los Angeles. I say, "No way!" My high school classmate, John Stromer, is there, and he tries to get on the plane. The man won't let him on, and he ends up at a counter where I am.
