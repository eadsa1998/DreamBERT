I am in the basement of the church I attended as a child. My former boyfriend is asleep in a pew in the basement of the church. I say I know what happened. He doesn't want his father to know where he is and I say I won't tell. Other people are also doing this. I go back to my bed which is also in the church basement. There is also something about a psychologist and seven years.
