 I'm shopping in Grocer Getto with my friend Matt Yams. We buy a deck of red playing cards for $3 and change. I take out a dollar to help Matt pay for it, but he doesn't except my money. A lady asks me where the Doritos are. I work at the store. I look for the Doritos and can't find them. I look around and point the lady to aisle 17, a long way off, where I can see some big bags of chips. The chips I see are generic, not Doritos. Matt and I have other groceries. There are women with us who take the groceries. We go to get our grade school classmate Tiffany Maples' black car. We can't find it right away. There has been a snowstorm. It is cold. Only a few cars are in the parking lot. A turquoise truck and trailer burst through a pile of snow. It is a nice looking, powerful truck. There are two semi-trucks that three men are loading snow into with a bobcat and a snow pusher. <br/
