I was standing on one bank of a river looking at a structure on the other side. The structure was in the general shape of a barn, but was of a light cream color and of a modern design. Suddenly I was on the barn side of the river and was watching a little girl who had swallowed a nail. (Her body and features were that of a small girl, but somehow she seemed to be older.) Her brother was there and was going to use a small suction pump to remove the nail from her stomach. He attached the suction pump on her mouth and played an organ while the pump was working. (I was not conscious of any sounds however.) The little girl fainted (or something similar) and the nail fell to the ground. (We were standing ankle deep in water all this time.) I was shocked when the nail fell into the water onto the ground and I stared at the nail for some time.
