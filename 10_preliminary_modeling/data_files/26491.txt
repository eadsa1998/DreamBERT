 I'm in a bar with a friend and some men who work there. I flip a coin to try to get a free drink. On my first toss the coin lands on its side on my jeans, so I toss it again. One of the men says something about the correct direction to flip a coin. I get a heads on the second toss, which is what I had called. The coin looks like a penny, but has an entire body on it, instead of just a head. I wonder what kind of beer to get. The two men who work there aren't much help in figuring this out. They don't seem to want to give me a beer. One of them makes a comment about Busch Light and a case day. I have a shovel, which is like a spade with a flatter scoop. I point it at people, as if it were a gun, and jerk it back towards me, as if I had just fired it and it had recoil. There are some women in the bar. Several of them leave, and then come back in carrying crates of full milk jugs. <br/
