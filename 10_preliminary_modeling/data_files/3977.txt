["Don't neglect the babies."]  I am now responsible for two babies that my mother had but doesn't pay any attention to any more. She's had other babies and lavishes care on them but neglects the first ones. I resent this and feel bad for the abandoned babies. The same thing happens with Lucy. I am taking care of her first babies too. I try to explain to her that she is neglecting them. She doesn't seem to care or hear it. In my explanation, I use a horizontal metal bar that is a part of her couch we sit on. I say horizontal. She thinks about it and uses the baby's legs as an axis to get a spatial picture of horizontal versus vertical. She traces a line across the spread legs and says Christmas, right?
