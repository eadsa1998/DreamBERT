I was in a shop and running from robots or something. As I ran, I stopped at the aisles to grab stuff, Pokemon cards mainly. I grabbed red packets instead of blue. Ezra was getting them too, but blue ones. We fought off the robots. Then I was having a race with Dee, Mac and Charlie (all from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia). I got lost because I went the long way, so they counted it as a win.
