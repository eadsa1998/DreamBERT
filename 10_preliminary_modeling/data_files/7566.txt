I am in a small religious gathering and Mary is sitting beside me. Suddenly, the congregation rises to say a prayer in memory of deceased love ones. Since it is not yet the anniversary of Mary's death, I am confused! I do not know whether or not it is appropriate for me to rise and pray. Both Mary and I are crying. Various members of Mary's family (I think they are her family) are around us. Some are very angry and refuse to join the prayer, or resent it being recited by the congregation. There are two groups of family members, huddled together, comforting one another. One group is behind and to the left of us. The other group is standing next to a wall. Mary is seated to my left.
