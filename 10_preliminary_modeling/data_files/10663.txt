I was at the hospital and an advocate said I could take care of this little boy Carl. Another advocate was going downstairs and told me it wouldn't be a good idea if I come because she's going to the garage. I left the little boy and went to the bathroom. My hair was half braided and I wanted to take the braids out, but didn't know how. They were tangled. I looked in the mirror and said, "I'd look good in braids like Tina, I should try it." I saw two cute hippies but I couldn't find them. I kept seeing them in the corner of my eye and then they'd disappear into an elevator or around the corner.
