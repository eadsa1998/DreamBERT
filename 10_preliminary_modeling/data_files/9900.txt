Frank decides, without consulting me, to take a class at the Art School: on MWF together with Francesca and Dave Brown. He expects me to keep office hours even though I must miss piano lesson and cannot do a lot of other things. I am so angry. I yell and scream at him in public, really mad. He does not see my point of view: "It's a small thing." I say: "I want to take the class too, don't want F and D to have more in common than we have." I stand in line and wait for class, sit at the right side at old-fashioned desk. See Frank at a distance, talking and smiling to others. Wake up angry.
