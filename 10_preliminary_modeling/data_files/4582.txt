I am preparing a presentation. I write some chalk words on open shelves. Somehow the air I working like a blackboard. I then wait for my turn to present. First two blackboards are moved in and my father is doing his presentation. At first I think my father has erased my work to do his, but I then see my stuff is in a different shelf. The man I am doing this presentation for is named Harry, or Henry. I am a social worker.
