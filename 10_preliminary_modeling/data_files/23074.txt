My daughter Christina was playing with the kids of another family.  We were all outside, and I had the jitters because she kept getting into the street.  Once, she ran across the street and I ran after her.  She kept running, going around some bushes on her right and heading back toward the street.  I saw to my horror a pickup truck coming down the street from her right.  It didn't swerve or slow down, but luckily she fell down just as it got there, and its left front tire just barely clipped her shoulder or leg.  If she hadn't fallen, she would have run directly into its path.  The truck didn't even slow down, and I was furious.  I noticed that its occupants were black.  I rushed for Christina and picked her up, trying at the same time to get the license number of the truck.  I thought I should spank Christina severely, but I was so relieved that she wasn't badly hurt that I only gave her a few light smacks.
