I attended the Dr. I.Q. quiz show which recently appeared in Cleveland and which is on the radio on Wed. at 8 p.m. I remained tense as I waited hopefully to be a contestant. In the meantime, a queer thing happened which never takes place on the quiz show. The quiz master was replaced by his wife as quiz master after half of the program was over. I was finally called to answer a question. I can't remember what the question was or how I answered.
