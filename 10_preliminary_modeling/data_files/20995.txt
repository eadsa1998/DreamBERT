I was in Rivertown and was told to play baseball. I saw Bill Grove and Marty Cristovich batting balls. I picked up a bat and swung it for practice. Then I knocked a few balls out. I picked up a hickory nut and broke it. It was rotten and a few more were wormy with holes in them. I went into the cupboard to get some peanuts and they were on an upper shelf. I reached for some and they started to roll out. I caught them with my hands and they kept rolling. I put some in my mouth to eat them, and I had a hard time to keep them from rolling on the floor.
