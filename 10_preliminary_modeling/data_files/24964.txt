 I'm up north in Franklin country, driving in a car to Hillston. It is around 10:00 am on a bright sunny morning. I look up and see the moon in the sky next to the sun. They are about one thumb's width apart, I judge. There appears to be a "bite" taken out of each of them. I think this is weird because they are never that close to each other. There is an alien face to the left of the sun. It is black with white eyes and a white mouth. I wonder where this is coming from, and then I turn around and see that the sun is reflecting off the windshield and bumper of the car behind me back into the sky. Ahead of me and to my right is what looks like my friend Nate Nelling's car. I pass it. Then I am in the car, and am passing a semi-truck. I am nervous about being in such a little car. I make a turn on the road when going almost 60mph. I feel the car kind of shake. The sun is really bright as we round the curve. I drive into a small town. The speed limit sign says 49mph. The town is just like Oak Valley when you drive in on highway 23. There is a baseball field and an AAA store on the right. There is a Food-n-Fuel and a bar on the left. But the town has a newer, cleaner, smaller atmosphere to it. A lot of things are colored bright blue. I look for a sign that will point me in the direction of Hillston, because I think I've gotten a little off track. There is a road sign saying Dalz, which is the name of a town, is 31 miles, with an arrow pointing to the left. I turn left, but stop to check the road map in my back pocket.
