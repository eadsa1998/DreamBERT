I heard deep fen or blue fen. I saw a horse race where horses were chained and they pulled or pushed a freight steel car and the one that pushed it against the other won. One horse pushed it against about five or six horses. His chain broke and he ran as a winner. The steel freight car ran over most of the other horses and they lay there dying. One of the horses opened up a trap door and the dying horses fell into a hole of water, for I heard them scream as they fell, and when they landed, they were excited. The other horse closed the trap door. Frank wanted to borrow a half dollar from me to give it to another guy he talked to. I noticed it was on a horse bet that he lost. He then gave the guy about 4 or 5 dollars. I came by Gibson's door and called Lassie, but about 4 or 5 pups came out first, then Lassie. A freight train came by and the pups were on the other side of the track. I was afraid they would get killed, but when the freight passed, the pups were walking between the rails on the ties as the freight went over them with harm. I was eating a banana and standing in front of Gibson's screen door. I heard first. I watched the coke ovens smoke and did the smoke roll out of them. I went into a country church where there were benches of old wood to sit on. I saw Frank and Donnie there. I saw a bull in a field. I picked up a wet glove. We bought an old house and sold ours. I looked and saw a big man walking. He was in front of a skyscraper and seemed to be as tall as it.
