My 5th/6th grade teacher Mr. Man was there.  There was a huge collection of people, and a large pit in the middle of a big room.  It was somehow a military thing.  In French, someone asked, "Aren't our tank formations pretty?"  I was attempting to get across the room but it was difficult because of the crowd.
