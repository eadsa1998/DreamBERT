 I'm at the Hill Park in Oak Valley for a dream group meeting. I drive my truck, and tow my boat behind the truck. I park on the north side of the pavilion in the dirt lot with my truck facing the pavilion. It's early morning and the sun is rising, shining. I go sit at a table on the southeast side of the shelter. People show up on roller blades. My grade school classmates Jerry Kasper, Eric Stoner, Patrick Bergman, Misty Ryan, and Sonya Nittles all arrive within a minute or two of each other. Two of them have cameras. I have a camera, too. Jerry has reddish hair: he has dyed it. I'm surprised that they all have come. They are a new group, all of which are unfamiliar with dream work. I will have to teach them, explain to them, and train them. I'm willing and eager to do this. Another classmate, Jim Granger, has a lot to do or he would have come, too. He is currently serving as altar boy for a funeral. A truck with a boat drives by on Park Avenue.
