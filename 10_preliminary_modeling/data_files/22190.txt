It is not necessary to add anything to the description of the room. The only new thing is that I have added a poster of Che Guevara which I painted. I dreamed I had been at a meeting with a group of friends in a coffee shop downtown, discussing several things that were on the news. Later, as it got dark, my friends started disappearing one by one and then the other people who were there. The moment came when I was totally alone. I went outside and the streets were also empty and were lit by tiny lights and it was raining lightly and it was extremely cold and there was a lot of fog, which made for very poor visibility and didn't allow me to see the objects around me clearly. I was walking through some narrow streets, wearing a thick coat, a hat and a muffler and these clothes made me feel somewhat strange and mysterious. I felt I had to get to some place and when I was one block away from a place which was in better conditions than the one I was in, I stopped and I felt I was getting away from that place, but could still see it. And suddenly I felt that someone was touching my shoulder and I awoke and it was my mother who told me it was time to get up to go to the university because it was getting late.
