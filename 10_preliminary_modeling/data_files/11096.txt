It was the night of the sorority formal. I had played tennis in the morning and gone to the track meet in the afternoon. I was going to leave for the formal at 8:30. Then I was in somebody else's room and I noticed it was 8:45. I was frantic and I hadn't even pressed my formal yet. So I started looking around for an iron and all of them were busy. In fact, all the girls who were using the irons were going to use them for several hours. I was frantic, but I hadn't received my parlor call yet. Then I went to a sorority sister's room. She was going to the formal, but the fellow she was going with was on the baseball team which had to play at Toledo that afternoon. Suddenly he appeared for her earlier than we had expected and she left in bobby socks. I was about the last one left in the dorm and I wondered where my date was.
