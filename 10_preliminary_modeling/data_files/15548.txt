I went into this school place. Acquaintance-F-09 was there and she was a physicist or engineer and was really smart and playing some games. There was a game with a house that you had to protect from bears. You had to build a fence and then bears would come and you had to reinforce the fences by placing them around the outside. If they broke in, you had to click on them to kill them. It got really difficult later.
