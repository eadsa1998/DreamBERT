I was coming home from school and my driver said that he wasn't going to have any calls for a while, and it was the middle of the day and he wanted to take me to this theme park and I kind of had to say yes. So went there, and he drove me over this great big bridge to get in there. And it was kind of more like a playground than a theme park. They had all of this furniture and things out of wood and they had little play things out of wood, but there weren't really any rides per se. So we were for a little bit. He sat and he waited for me, and I took like I don't know how long, a little while. And then I decided that I should call Melinda and see if she could come meet us here. And she wasn't there, obviously, like she never is. And so then I was home and we were looking at this catalog at dresses and things and Mom was telling me that she had a dream about the chickens, and that they were eating, like they hadn't eaten in two days because of seed. And I went out there and fed them, and they did that for me. There was a white one and a brown one, and they were eating out of my hand like feverishly. And I think that's all there is.
