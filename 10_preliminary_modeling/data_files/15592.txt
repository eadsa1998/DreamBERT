Some people from Lost -- I remember Charlie -- and I were in a group after some apocalypse had happened. We were staying out the front of home. Charlie and I ended up in a car to sleep because everyone else took the space inside. He touched my leg and I didn't react so he ran his hand up more and then stopped and went into another car. I was thinking it had something to do with Ben. The next day, I saw a car with my licence plate and I pointed it out and they were like 'typical Izzy, only noticing something small like that'. Ben was there. I also got a call from Rohan and I couldn't understand it because of bad reception. It was apparently a threat, but he was laughing and sounded like a 12 year old.
