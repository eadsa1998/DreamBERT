Ann  was sleeping on the roof. She had a bench with a back rest. She stood up and was leaning back and I yelled at her not to do that. It would break. But she wouldn't listen to me and all at once it broke and down she went off the roof. I got scared. I looked at my children and said, "Oh, goodbye, Mother." I ran outside.
