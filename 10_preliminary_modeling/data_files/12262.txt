Evelyn wrote down on a piece of paper who she liked, who I think was Darius. Somehow, the class got a hold of it, but no-one said anything. I was friends with Ryan Donowho and we were at the beach. Evelyn was there too and he was annoyed that she was there. I think later that either Darius or Ryan started hanging with Evelyn and ended up liking her. Then Mischa Barton was talking with someone in Mom's room.
