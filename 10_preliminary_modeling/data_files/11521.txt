The dream began with myself standing at a bottom of a short stone stairway leading into a basement hall of a castle. I had on a page's outfit and had a quarter master whistle around my neck and I piped people in and out of the castle. This girl came in but was a common girl so I didn't pipe for her. We talked and somehow we fell in love. Then the king came in to the hall. People hustled around. They had on beautiful clothes and the women had many jewels on too. I gave this girl a beautiful ring and all of a sudden the people were gone and the girl and I were alone in a different room. The king came in. He didn't look familiar, but he was tall and nice-looking. He carried a beautiful robe with pearls on it and trimmed with white ermine fur. He put it around my shoulders and then put a crown on my head and said I was his son and now I was king. Then I went back to the girl. The people left the room and I took the ring I had given her and gave her a large diamond surrounded by three sapphires and some little diamonds. Then I put the other ring on the finger next to it and said that it would be an engagement ring until we were married.
