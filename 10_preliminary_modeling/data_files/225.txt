I've been on a bus on my way to work and I get put off part way there when the bus breaks down. It's a hill, somewhat south of town, and I can see the space between. I'm late, of course, and going to be later. I'm nervous about that and decide to turn back rather than go in so late. Now I'm at my father and My stepmother's house - I seem to be staying here. It's a regular sort of suburban house. I don't have a key with me and I don't know if I can pick the lock or break the door in - and I don't want to be seen breaking in, but it turns out if I just jiggle the handle a bit and lift sideways, it opens - the lock parts are loose. [I go inside but I don't remember what I do there - something to do with the telephone.]
