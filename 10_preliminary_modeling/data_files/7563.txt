The locale of this dream is the bedroom of our Tree Frog Street apartment. This room is terribly cluttered and packed with furniture. I am trying to clean up and put the room in order. While doing so, I notice on top of the dresser some of Mary's belongings (cosmetics, etc.) in a pool of water. I start taking these off the dresser, examining each closely for any damage, and looking for another place to set them until I can wipe the water off the dresser. While I'm wiping the dresser, Adam (as a young boy of about 10 years old) is helping me clean the room. He is smiling happily and is very involved in his work. I express surprise that he is helping me, and thank him. I tell him I'm sorry I haven't thanked him often enough, and that I should acknowledge more frequently my appreciation for his help. Mary enters the room. She has just finished taking a shower and is wearing a robe. I take her in my arms and try to kiss her. But she does not want to kiss me. I accept this and take my arms from around her. I am so casual in my acceptance of her refusal to kiss me that Mary apologizes, saying she will kiss me after she has tidied up.
