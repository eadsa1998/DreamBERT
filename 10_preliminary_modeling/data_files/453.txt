I was in a house with an upstairs and a downstairs. It belonged to my boyfriend and myself. This was a house that I didn't recognize the house. My boyfriend and I were cuddling and laughing upstairs when we heard noises downstairs. Both of my boyfriend's ex-wives were staying with us as guests. Wife number one in the dream is really wife number two in real life and wife number two in the dream is someone I had never seen before. I went downstairs and saw his first (dream) wife. I was surprised that she spent the night in our house. She was folding up some blankets and wanted to talk to me and ask me a favor. I got the impression that she wanted to spend some time alone with me to get better acquainted. This surprised me because I have never met her and I know she doesn't like me. So I told her I would make time for her. Then I left her in the family room and went down the hall into another guestroom. I saw my boyfriend with his second (dream) wife. Her name was the same as his actual second wife. She also talked with the same regional accent, but had blonde hair like his first wife in the real world. When I walked into the room, she was drying off. I think she had just taken a shower. As she was drying her hair, she looked up and saw my boyfriend and draped the towel over her shoulders like a man would do and gave him a hug. I thought it was strange that she didn't have a top on and left the door open while drying her hair. I noticed as I watched this scene that she had pierced nipples and that bothered me more than watching her hug my boyfriend. I left the room and my boyfriend came after me, telling me there was no need to be jealous and then we started to laugh and giggle some more.
