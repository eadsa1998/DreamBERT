Another dream was a man with a swimsuit, speedo type, and the crotch had a hole cut out of it, with rib supports to keep it in place there.  He had no genitals, he was sexless, and it made me think a woman's swimsuit could be made with a hole cut out like that.  I reviewed the marketing potential, let my mind play around with the concept, the design and target buyers.  The hole was oval shaped, for sex.  Upon waking I realized it was a totally unmarketable idea.  There is already lingerie like that, and who would want a swimsuit like that?  But interesting that I was marketing in my sleep, going over the marketing possibilities.
