I was driving fast and my car was driving well. Mom was with me and I commented on this to her. There were special lights on a shop to signal the green light, but I couldn't see it and when Mom realized she was like 'oh, you can go' and there were cars coming from the side but I made it in time. We went to a Bunnings like shop. There was a secret bit which had 'heads' and 'DNA' strips of paper. We had been there before and mine was there. I also saw Eugene's. I got some others including someone I knew called Brendan, but it was spelt as 'Brandan'. A fat girl came and stared at us and was possibly security. Then she left. We went upstairs and there was a colourful and quirky shop. There were lots of people and they were all talking to each other. There were books for family trees, but it was like interactive and I put in my name and it came up with The Young Ones. It had silver edges. It cost $1230. I thought I should've gotten the DNA strips instead. I ased why Sarah Michelle Gellar wasn't in there and they said they forgot. I was at Nana's watching The Simpson's. Ezra wanted to watch. Lisa was down in the sewer. I had seen it before but they'd changed it. I had a look to see what movies were on and Life is Beautiful was and I said "Oh, I love that movie". Blow Out was on in 30 minutes (at 2.45) so I decided to watch a bit of Life is Beautiful then that. Dad was there too. Poppa said something about the windows and curtains.
