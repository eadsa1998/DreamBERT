I was explaining to a fellow how coke was made. I went into the boiler room with him and there I saw a big piece of coke. I touched it and said, "Here is a real genuine piece of coke." I was walking in snow. I tried to get on the road and had a hard time finding a low spot in the snow bank to get thru.
