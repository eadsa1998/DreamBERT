I entered a huge stadium just like the one at Ohio State. We were supposed to play for the intramural touch football championship. At the half time of the game, I climbed up the stairs to talk to some friends whom I didn't remember. Since I only played offense, I stayed on the sidelines and shouted instructions on what plays were coming and telling the players, who were all my fraternity brothers, what type of defense to use.
