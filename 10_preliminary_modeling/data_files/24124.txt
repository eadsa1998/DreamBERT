I was sleeping in my dorm room at Cowell and I was sleeping so soundly that I didn't hear the fire alarm go off. (I usually am a light sleeper.) My roommate was not in the room. I got up to use the bathroom and after I finished (in the stall) I tried to get out by unlocking the door but the plastic or metal walls began melting all around me. I tried furiously to get out and somehow finally got out and tried to open the main bathroom door. It was hot and as I opened the door (everyone was out of the building except for me) I ran through the hall to the outside while feeling like I was getting burnt. Once on the outside, I was wandering around in a daze, aimlessly down a street supposedly down from Cowell College. (But it didn't look like Cowell college.) People were running around and there were fire trucks all around me. I was lost and lonely and didn't see anyone I knew. Then this guy around my age ran up to me and said "Did you hear what happened to 'V'?" I said "You mean 'E'?" (this guy I'm acquainted with) and the guy said "No, V", there he is. And this guy was in an ambulance with all of the lights on and windows on the side and a sheet over him. It scared me because I knew he had burnt to death.
