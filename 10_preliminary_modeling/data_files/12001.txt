Mom and I were at a friend of hers' place and he got bitten and turned into a zombie. So we got out of there, and I ended up at school. People were turning into zombies there too. I was running from different rooms with Farrah and a girl I made up. We were running around, ending up in places like the gym, running down a hall, back to the gym. We ended up in an apartment type room. There were three beds and knives and things in the drawers. We put the mattresses on the floor.
