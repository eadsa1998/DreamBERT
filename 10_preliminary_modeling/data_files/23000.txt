I spoke to a good male friend on the telephone, and it didn't sound like him at all.  Sometimes he spoke in a high-pitched voice, then later changed to a very low voice.  He was also very cool and matter-of-fact toward me, and I couldn't understand that.  He still displayed his keen sense of sarcastic humor from time to time, but it was much more serious and less effective.
