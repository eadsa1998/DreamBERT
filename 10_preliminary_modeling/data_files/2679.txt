I am a teacher and new. I'm being asked how I'd handle certain situations and I'm pleased to notice that on several occasions the boys would get me into a no-win power struggle and I'd make my statement and walk away and then they would comply. A man asks how I'd handle a fight and I'd say, "Stop!" I'd put my foot pedals between the two fighting boys and I'd yell, "Stop!" to them and to the observing kids who entice them to continue by their attention. Then I decide to lecture on the contents of a Playboy magazine. This is quite controversial, but I continue. I show them page after page of advertisements and then political articles. Finally a naked man and a naked baby are seen. The man's penis is tucked in between his legs as he lies on his side. The baby boy is very sweet and cuddly and chubby and I pass him around for the kids to see. Two girls have him on a table and are admiring his sweet smiles. His penis is just a part of who he is and isn't important.
