A horrible dream. My family and I are living in an apartment overlooking a yard in a totalitarian state where the occupying power or government is free to commit acts of torture and murder. In the yard below, the army marches prisoners around, and makes up games to kill them. I have to keep my eldest daughter away from the windows. There is one particularly brutal incident which I witness from the bathroom window. The soldiers have carried a prisoner up about 6 stories of a fire escape. He looks perhaps middle-eastern. There's a crowd of soldiers below cheering as two soldiers up the fire escape dangle the prisoner upside down by his ankles over the edge. His hands and legs are tied and he is blindfolded. They then drop him head first onto the concrete ground below. He lands like a sack of potatoes with a crack. The soldiers cheer. Then, the main soldier up the fire escape jumps off in a different direction, and lands on a large inflated mattress - the sort used in stunts. But doesn't land on it properly - he sort of hits the edge of it and then hits the ground. It looks as if he breaks his neck.
