 I'm on an airplane, either in Australia or flying to Australia. Everyone, including me, has his or her own large seat for sleeping and relaxing. I sit at the back of the plane. There are star NBA players on the plane. We're on the ground. There is a question about whether a gas or oil leak would be preferred. I say I'd rather have an oil leak. The oil filter at the rear of the plane needs to be changed before we take off. The filter is a white cylinder about five feet long and three inches in diameter. We seem to be in Sydney. The advisor will meet us at a place. We drive through a roundabout to get there. An ambulance drives past us with its lights and sirens on. <br/
