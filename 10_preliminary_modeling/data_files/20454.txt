I was on top of a slope. I was carrying toilet articles. I had to move, so I picked up my toilet articles and left the spot. Later there was a toilet bowl standing there. It was stained and had an acid odor. I placed an open jar of mineral oil on the rim of the bowl. Immediately it began to sizzle. Then the acid in the bowl seemed to mix with the oil, and it seemed about to explode. I was afraid to remove the jar. I told some others about it. It was steaming like a pressure cooker, but the vapor was cold. I dropped a piece of goods in the bowl and it was immediately dissolved in the liquid in the bowl.
