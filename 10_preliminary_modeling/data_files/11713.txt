Mathias and I sat next to each other in class. Then we went to this camp thing. Mathias and two girls went into this house and this man said something about angry school teachers. He shouted "Eli!" like that bloke in Children of the Corn 3. He let me stay in the house, but I had to sleep in the same bed as Mathias. We covered ourselves with raw meat to keep away wolves or something.
