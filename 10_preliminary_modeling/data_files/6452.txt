I am a Chinese man, and I'm going to marry a wealthy man's daughter. This makes me the inheritor of this man's fortune. In order to claim my right both to the daughter and the fortune, however, I must kill her younger brother. He's now jealous because the fortune would have gone to him. So I end by shooting him through the head with crossbow bolts, literally pinning him to the wall.
