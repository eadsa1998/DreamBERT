I pulled into a parking lot at night. It was raining. I parked pretty far away and ran in. As I was running in I realized that there several parking spaces closer but it didn't really bother me. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella. I was in an appliance store. I was looking for a small TV for my office that I could also move around easily and that would not be very expensive. The aisles were very narrow. I had to squeeze through some of them. The store was packed with products and people. I was looking around and finally spotted the TV section. There were microwaves mixed in with the TV's. I accidentally opened a microwave and shut it right away, hoping no one had noticed. I was afraid they would realize that I had mistaken the microwave for a TV. I was looking for a TV around $200. I kept seeing price tags of $400 and more though I think there was one around $200 but I didn't especially care for it.
