I was seated in the movie theatre room of a house. The pink net and chiffon curtain opened and the movie started. We were looking at the waves of a river as if we were partly underwater. The waves came in and we were under, the waves would recede and we'd be above water. The PA system invited anyone who wanted to, to swim on in and get to see the backstage workings of the movie. So I swam and swam and found myself on the bank of the river. I sat down on a white wrought iron sofa and the lecture began. A voice said that ironic though it was, they would show us the movie on TV screens so we won't miss out. Then this guy stood near a conveyor belt and created sound effects and so on. Once he showed us how he and a small kid that looked like a white curly-haired dog, would join in the action of the movie. Some sinister thing slunk through a blue velvet curtain.
