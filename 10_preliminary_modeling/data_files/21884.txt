I was downtown. I met Clarence Fassinger farmer. He was coming home from work. I walked with him. We came to a fence. I was going to climb over it, but thought of the bulls in the field. Just then the fence started to fall over from my weight, so I jumped off. It was dark and I was feeling my way along the cliff top. We went to a church that was being built as we walked by the regular church. There was mass going on and I could hear the priest intoning.
