I own a new Chevrolet. I drove it around the corner and then parked it near by a house I lived in 10 years ago. When I came back, I discovered the car was missing. I then realized I had forgotten to remove the key. After a while I went to the house I used to live in. It was a double house and I knew the people who lived downstairs. I asked her if she knew anything about the car. She didn't. As I was leaving, the lady upstairs called to me and told me the police were holding t he car and it would cost $70 to regain the car from the police.
