Ezra and I shared a computer, at the same time though. I was playing Runescape and left the computer for a second. When I came back he was also playing Runescape in a different window. We played with the windows side by side. I was annoyed at this setup because I couldn't listen to music. I could hear the faint sound of cats meowing and I thought it was Kiki. Mom and others sent a list of cats they had sold and points they had gotten for each one and also an intelligence rating. Mom's intelligence rating was high and it said that because of the rating it was, she could own three cats (which was supposed to be a high amount). Tabby cats got no points.
