In this dream I recall being in a small room. It was kind of dark, dimly lit. There were 2 other people in the room with me, 2 guys about 17. We were talking about color guards, and I remember saying something about the Highlanders color guard, that I didn't think they should have won a contest. Just after I said this, I realized that these 2 guys were connected in some way with the Highlanders. Then I recall saying something like, "Oh, you're with the Highlanders, aren't you?" They shook their heads yes, but they didn't seem to be upset by what I had said. That is all I recall.
