I dreamt I was at the movies with a girlfriend, but that it was a rather strange theater. The seats were kind of like blue sofas, there were lots of people, and they would not charge for the seats on the right-hand side of the theater. But I did not feel comfortable, and I told my friend that we should change places, but we didn't. Next to us there was a great big sofa, which was taller than the one we were in, and I saw with amazement that the sofa was transformed into a roller coaster, the same as the ones they have at amusement parks.
