My parents are divorced (in the dream). My brothers and I live at their house with my mother -- even though we are fully grown -- and my father lives in the city with his mother. He comes to visit and we have a lot of fun. I wonder why we don't see each other more often. I say, "Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but parents should stay together for the children's sake." One of my parents -- I'm not sure which one -- answers, "People change; we drifted apart; you're all grown up for years now." I feel anger followed by either resignation or acceptance of a loss.
