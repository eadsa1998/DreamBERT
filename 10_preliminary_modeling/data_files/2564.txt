I want to go to the bathroom real bad and am aware that I am dreaming and therefore must not find a toilet. I find one and think, "No, I'm still dreaming. If I am awake, I'd have my eyes open." I'd try to force my eyes open. Once they opened and I fell asleep again. Then I found a toilet and a huge stream of urine rushed down my leg, puddling on the floor.
