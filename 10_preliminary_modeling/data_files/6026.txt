I was in a living room with my several friends. It was almost 9pm. Friend A asked me what I was going to do that night. I said that I was planning to watch Richard Wagner's symphony on TV. Soon, the program began. But the music sounded more like Gustav Mahler's. He is my favorite composer, but I didn't know for sure which symphony was being played. I just knew it was Mahler's, but not Wagner's. TV was showing pictures of the cosmos and a woman in white dress dancing. The woman seemed to be lost to meditation. It was an extraordinarily beautiful sight. Everybody else in the room gazed at the screen. I was still trying to figure out whose music it was. When the first movement ended, TV screened the title of the second movement. It had a name of some comet, which I was not familiar with. But I understood that the music was Gustav Holst's, "The Planets." (This is ridiculous because no movement in "The Planets" has a name of unknown comet.) Suddenly, I heard an alarm and noticed that the whole room was trembling. I went out of the room and found that I was inside of a big battleship. Many people in uniform were running around in a panic, but I remained calm, looking at the terrible scene wondering why they were so flustered. I went to the deck. It was still dark and the ocean looked very peaceful.
