I am in a building. I go down a long flight of stairs to a small hall or porch. It's time to get color draped. A male attendant brings the first color. It is blue. I say, "Oh good. That's my favorite color." That should indicate something. He tries dark blue first. I put on a knitted sweater and pants. He puts on my makeup. I look lovely. Next he tries yellow, then red, then black. He is very tender, and I think he likes me. Then it's time to go. There's sort of an earthquake. Then the building starts flying. We are traveling over the traffic. The freeway is below us, the noise and the pollution, I don't go too high because I'm afraid of flying. Then it's time to swim. I go to the shallow end of a pool. He (the attendant) is watching me, lovingly. I swim laps. Then a little boy swims up to me. I pick him up and take him to the edge. I ask who let him in. Someone says they did. So I have to let him swim but I don't want to because he's so little I'm afraid he'll drown.
