[1997-06-08] I'm with people. I don't quite recognize all of the people. There is some kind of religious person there, not necessarily a priest or a minister, but it was somebody who prays anyway. He was asking me a bunch of questions and then said "Its election time and Tom Tailor, a blind person and friend of mine said to me "He is no longer the chair person of this group, you are and you have to run the meeting and ask the questions... but I didn't know what kind of meeting it was, it wasn't a blind meeting, it was kind of festive with soda and coffee and party snacks and drinks Again, no body figures, only spirit figures.
