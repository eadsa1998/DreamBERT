Later dreamed I received awards at a banquet in an Arabic-speaking country. Accidentally thought the washing machine/basin was a urinal. My mother got lost after she had to park the car. I was with my father. MacIverny (journalism professor) sat at my table. I got an award from Ms. Bailey (a high school teacher of mine I'd spoken to recently). And a mountain biking award. Just giving me small random stuff in this second round of awards. It was held in a large hall with tan sandstone bricks making up the place, like a clean massassi temple from star wars. I wondered about the expense of all the awards, and how they fit into the budget, and whether they were just valueless pat on the backs that everyone gets.
