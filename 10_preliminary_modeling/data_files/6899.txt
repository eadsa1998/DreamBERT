I found colored Xmas cards and started cutting them for a charity when mother came and picked up a box and told me this was the sample of cards she was selling. In distress, I told her about cutting a card up and finding the pieces tried to mend it. She told me she had had them out last Sunday and tried to sell them but hadn't sold much.
