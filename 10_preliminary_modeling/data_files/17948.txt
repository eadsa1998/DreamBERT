I was in some sort of medical center, as a mental patient.  Something was reminiscent of a long drive out of state.  I went to a nurse and asked about something, and there was some sort of 'treatment' that included putting a sort of sticker on the person's tongue, which she demonstrated to me.  I rambled to her about how I knew she was going to do that, because I'd dreamt it, but that it was weird that she did it because I don't have prophetic dreams, and so I must have actually seen her do that before in real life, but not remembered it.  Then I was in some sort of convenience store, and the owner was a little mentally ill, keeping her daughter locked in a cage beneath the counter.  I was going to try and help her escape.  Then there was a group of people being named for their new roles they had acquired for the next Lord of the Rings sequel.  They decided upon their new names and the reason.  My former friend Deanna was to be "Styx", the main villain.  She had a hole in her calf that was leaking green viscous liquid.
