I was at a museum and me and someone had to sneak past these people to get in. Someone had to deliver a letter to me. I hid behind a door, and then ran out to the car. The car was actually a four-wheeler, except it was different. Dad and Ezra were already on it. I hated it. We went to an ice-cream shop. They made one for Ezra and he didn't like it because it wasn't 'tight enough'. Dad tried to give it to me and I kept saying "I don't like chocolate ice-cream".
