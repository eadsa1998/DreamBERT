We were going to go to some waterslides. We were out the front of home and Valerie and kids, Mom, Dad and Ezra were there too. We only had one car. Farrah got the mail and it was all for me. One was from this place to do with school. It had a bunch of names on it but the only name I recognized was Gregg. There was some mail from some Spongebob place. Ariana was in the back seat and wearing a Spongebob shirt. Farrah was in the driver's seat and Valerie was sitting on the boot. Mom and I went inside and she invited her brother so that Valerie wouldn't go. She knocked on the breakfast bar to pretend that she was knocking on the door. Then there was a real knock and Evelyn and a man (which was her father, but not really) and two dogs were there. She was talking to me and asked if I was going out and I said yes. Then there were heaps more people there. Ramona was there and I kept calling her Paul. I was yelling at the people to get out of the house and calling out for my keys. On the drive there I remembered I had my period so I decided to check how heavy I was when I got there.
