I am part of a hidden minority group. We have escaped and we're on a mission. We run out in a group to the library or museum of modern art. We get in and realize we need to hide because the police/citizens are coming in looking for us. Several others and I get in a cabinet (like my video cabinet). The doors keep popping open a bit and sometimes the box isn't even there, although we all act as if it is. I can see the citizens (women) and hope they can't see me. Finally, they leave and we get out. I've split from the group to go where each one of us is supposed to go to get our mission accomplished. I go up a steep flight of stairs. It is difficult. I reach the top and see there is no opening for me to get to the 2nd floor. It's like the stairs curled up over itself. I keep trying to visualize it open. I struggle and finally arbitrarily declare myself on the 2nd floor. After a bit, I am. Now Bonnie and I are at the card catalogue table and I see instructions for how to duplicate/copy the cards you want. I pick up a pile of pink waxed paper covered cardboards (like thermofax paper). You put a roll of film in one card and lay it on the pink film and wait 2-4 minutes and peel off the pink film. I touch the pink film and start to lift it up. I ask Bonnie if she's loaded the film yet. She hasn't. Now I am a young boy and all the other patrons are older retired women. Someone asks what I'm doing there. I am so out of place with these retired people. I hope I'm not noticed before I finish my mission. I now look through cards that look like postcards, upside down, with pictures of animals on them. I'm looking for the ones I came to find.
