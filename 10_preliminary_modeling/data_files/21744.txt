We were traveling on a highway and the road was bad. There was snow and mud and I was going up a hill and I thought I wouldn't make it, but I did. I was away from home about three weeks and was lonesome for my family. I was operating three machines. I was making some kind of small gears. I gauged the jobs and had to put each individual piece in the machine for the operation.
