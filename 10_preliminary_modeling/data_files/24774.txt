I climbed a mountain with leaves and grass to a shack with a lot of accessories outdoors. There, I saw a man I knew. Other part - I was looking into a big refrigerator and the rows of lights in the fridge went out. Then all the power went out. My mom was there. Setting: On a grassy, leafy hill, and in my house. Characters: A guy I know (no identification that I can remember). He looked like my dad. Also, my mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Neutral. The fridge was a day-residue from when I opened it yesterday and a lot of stuff came out.
