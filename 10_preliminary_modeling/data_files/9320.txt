I was in my hometown in the back yard of a house I lived in when I was 10-12 years old. But it started on the college campus where my father attended--rolling lawns like open country. We were chasing a horse that was loose. We chased it into the back yard under a big pecan tree. People showed up, some I knew, others like gypsies in painted caravans and old cars. They started building a fence from scrap lumber--new and yellow-gold, but not matching. It grew like a Spanish fan or peacock tail. "It is movable so the horse can get new grass within the fence each day." The ground so lumpy like old furrows covered with new grass. Suddenly I was in a house sitting on the floor, and a young woman in white blouse and tight jeans sat beside me. I put my hands on her hips. She moved and another took her place. She had red hair and freckles and was about 20. I quietly admired her clothes, hair and skin. And she quietly lifted her sweatshirt-sweater and rubbed her lovely freckled breasts. She rubbed the nipple between her finger and thumb. In the dream I assumed it was modesty, covering the nipple. But it was also sexy stimulation--both opposites joined.
