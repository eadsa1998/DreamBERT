 I'm near a body of water. A large boat is anchored a ways off shore, and a small boat is tied up near the shore. There is a windy, rainy storm coming. I think my friend Kevin Simpson is with me. I have to untie the little boat so that Kevin can take it out and get the large boat. There is a cinder block tied to the rope, which is looped through a loop around a pole to hold the small boat in place. I unloop the block, but as I do I fall in the water. The water is warm. I try to bring the block to the surface: it is heavy. I hear someone talk about swimming without using one's arms. It is my high school classmate Persia Miko's voice. There are some bleachers near the surface of the water. The water is clear and turquoise colored. I have my eyes open under the water, and see. I wrap my feet around the bottom side of one seat of the bleachers and have my body submerged. There are tropical fish around. A person can touch them. There is a fish that says, "Marvin's Hope" on it. I think, pause, and start to cry. <br/
