I reorganised my room, which was big and different. Mom and Darren had stuff in there too and wanted to look through it. I said I was going through my private stuff and they had to wait. I was later on the computer talking to Benjamin and he said he got a girlfriend and that he hadn't dated since he was 12. I was annoyed and wished it had been me and sighed. He said something like 'it's so perfect' which implied he didn't have a girlfriend, but then I wasn't sure if he was joking or not.
