I'm at an audition. They have already chosen the 3 guys. There is only one woman part in the play. I am putting on my costume. The woman director tells me and my rival to wear jeans, a half-t-shirt and a vest. My jeans are ripped at the hip seam. I'm quite surprised and comment on it to the guy that will be the romantic interest in the play. My outfit is somewhat revealing. I am pleased that I'm still slim enough to look good. The woman director leads a singing and dancing warm-up. I sing harmony and counter rhythm, like a lead gospel singer comin' in with phrases between lines. It's jazzy. It sounds really good. I know I am impressing the director. I know I'll get the part and I feel very satisfied and warm.
