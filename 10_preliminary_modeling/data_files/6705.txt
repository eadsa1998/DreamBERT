I was going to the hospital. As I entered I saw Eva Hunter with a tray of medicines. Some looked just like the large round pills, one black, the other dark red, that I was carrying in my hand. I thought, "I can take these sedatives I have too, but perhaps I shouldn't. They may give me others." Asked Eva what she was doing. Vague answer. When back in my ward, I remembered I had brought nothing with me. Went to find nurse, but along the corridor saw only student nurses for permission to return. Behind closed door, heard voices but again saw no head nurse. Decided to hurry back home anyway thinking I could probably return before I was wanted. As I was waking confused skip to back of desk to sign in.
