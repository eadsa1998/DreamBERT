["Flying with the pain."] I am lying down and the pain in my foot is tremendous. Ginny is helping to get me on an airplane to fly me to S City. I am watching and I see the tailgate like piece slam down on both my feet, cutting off my right foot. I am in terrible pain. People are aghast at what happened. Now by will of my mind, I am lifting myself up and flying myself around still lying down on my back. I am looking around me and I see buildings that I am skimming over, barely making it over the tops. I see carnival rides I am skimming over and I feel like I'm experiencing a carnival ride. Now I see a country road and I turn left and follow it like I'm driving. Now I'm in a "car" maybe a convertible and must turn left or right. I ask the country singer with me which way to turn. He grins and says you choose. I turn left. Now I'm gliding (still on my back like I'm reclining in a hospital bed, slightly raised.) in a beautiful old hotel and each wing has different blues artists. I love being there and turn down a hall to listen to wonderful jazzy blues music.. A Negro man sings the blues. I am amazed at how perfect the music is and that I am making this music up in my head. It sounds just like I was listening to the radio. I see a ladies room and admire the signs on the wall. It is beautifully ornate, the decor. I concentrate on the wonderful music to keep my mind off the terrible pain.
