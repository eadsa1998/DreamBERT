I see some new kittens that are very cute and go over and pick up several of the youngest ones. I pet them and they are at first afraid and then calm down. As I sit on the lawn holding the kittens, I look up and see Rover's sweet face as she crawls up to me to be petted looking as though I would send her away or hit her. I am shocked because I thought she was dead. I wonder if she'd been buried alive all this time or if the girls had not told me the truth and had let her go and not put her to sleep. I feel sorry for her having been buried so long with no one to pet her. I can see she desperately needs affection and love. I pet her and talk softly to her, hoping we aren't hurting the new kitties as they sit on my lap, now scrunched by Rover trying to get close to be loved.
