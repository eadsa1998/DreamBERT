There was  real heavy rain, thunder and lightning (storm). The wind blew and the lightning and thunder was heavy. The flashes were close and bright. Bob and Cecila Lippert were there. Bob got drunk and he acted out of place. I was surprised to see him like that. Mary Hutter was there. We were sleeping in beds. This was a shelter like. Then the windows blew in and we awoke some people and told them to move back into the building. Bob was so drunk, he lay face down on the floor and the rain came down on him. The storm finally abated and we started to leave. I got into my car and we left. Then I saw the federal men running away from the crowd. The FBI's. I was a federal man, so I ran into the bank and we had all the doors and exits locked and no one was to leave till we had a checkup and a report. I came into the bank after it was all over and there was a gang holding it up. I had no gun. They made me lay on my back. Then they poured some kind of powder and a liquid around me and ignited it. I was going to take off my overcoat and put out the fire on my back, but I was told to keep it on till they got out. I had to show them the way out. Then, when they were out, I took the coat off and doused it into a puddle of water. I was going to catch a bus from downtown with Joe. I yelled at him to wait for me and I would ride with him. The bus that we were to take, it hit a deep puddle and turned a turtle. A girl and a couple boys flew out and were nude in the cold water. I gave my overcoat to cover them so they wouldn't be cold.
