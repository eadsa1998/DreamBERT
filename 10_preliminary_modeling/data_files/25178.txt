 I am at a restaurant with Annie and I use my driver's license as identification to buy alcohol. I'm surprised and happy that it works, since I'm not 21. We leave the restaurant because the other guys we are with couldn't get served. Among them is my high school friend Lyle Zeffman. I am disappointed. Annie and I had already ordered out food. We walk out. I leave a $3.00 tip for the waiter.
