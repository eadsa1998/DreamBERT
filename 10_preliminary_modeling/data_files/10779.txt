The only visible person was a man who had freakish limbs. At the end of each arm and leg there was either a stump or only one or two fingers or toes. I had the feeling he had acquired one of them only recently. I seemed to know that this man had a loving wife who would not leave him because of his horrible condition. I also had the feeling that both my fiance and I knew him and we seemed to be looking at him (but we were not actually in the dream). Later I had a spiritual rather than a visual dream in which I seemed to be training children.
