["Writing down dreams."] I am writing frantically, before I forget the dreams. Bill Domhoff is standing near the couch. I want him to explain his dreams to me. But I want to write down the Bill Domhoff dreams before I forget. He waits. He and the grad student are chatting. I try to concentrate on writing the dream. Then I realize I'd already written down this part of the dream and get confused. I'm starting to forget all ready. I have a number of papers and the dark black ink smudges and I forget to label the page numbers. I write part of the dream and run out of space, because another previous dream was on that page. So I'd turn the page over and continue writing. I am aware It will be very confusing to go back and read it.
