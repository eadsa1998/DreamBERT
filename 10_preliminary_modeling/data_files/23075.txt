My wife Bonita and I went next door to meet our new neighbor, whose wife we have already met.  She introduced him as "Bruce," but kept calling him "John."  I was very disappointed in him.  He seemed to be a shallow, beer-bellied fraternity-type jock.  He wasn't very friendly, either, and talked mostly to another guy who was there.  A surprising amount of their private life was revealed, in that she was complaining about his not recognizing her sex needs enough or being home enough to satisfy them.  I was embarrassed that they should discuss it in front of us-and frustrated that I couldn't let her know that I, being neighborly, would be quite happy to help her out anytime she said the word.
