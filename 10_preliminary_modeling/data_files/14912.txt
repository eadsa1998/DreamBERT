This guy at a petrol station was talking to Serena and Blair (both from Gossip Girl). There was something about Led Zeppelin and another band. The lead singer was someone's boyfriend so he could help them. Blair told him stuff in return. I can't read what I wrote, but he said something and Blair answered him. But they both liked him. Lillian started talking to him and flirting with him. He had tan skin. Lillian turned away and told him not to joke around. They were both breathing heavily and he reached his hand around her and they kissed on the lips and then made out. A kid walked past, unfazed. I had a dog and he was spotty and it was actually Mom who had gotten the dog. I think it was a poodle thing. I woke up at midnight but I thought it was noon. I was watching TV later and there was a movie from 1926 with Humphrey Bogart. Supernatural came on. Mom and Darren came home and started watching the episode. I was thinking they would know where the name 'Dean' came from, but I was thinking that Sam was my favourite character at the moment.
