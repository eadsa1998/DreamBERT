["Drunk rock and roll star sells self."] I am a man and a member of a famous rock and roll band. After the show, I lie down on the floor with a bottle of booze, very drunk. The young women are coming up to the bar to buy our services. One pays for me and I get up and we walk into a large room with benches and curtains setting off tiny cubicles on the bench, only enough room for a man to sit and a woman to sit on him. People are having sex all bunched up together like that. I look for an empty seat and find one. As I sit down, the other two cubicles beside me open up so that we lie down. I guide my penis into her and feel the extreme sexual thrill of going inside. I feel a faint orgasm. It is over very quickly. I am glad I was able to find the place to get it in. Pretty soon, another woman will buy me and I will do this over and over. I am very drunk and spacy. Someone, a man, I think looks at me like he'd like to make love to me. (I feel like I'm a woman inside, so I think he is attracted to me as a woman). But I get bored and tired and decide to walk home. I walk past him. He is lying on the grass. I pat his head sympathetically and say, "I am going to see my father." He nods. I walk down to the ocean front and wade in the surf, looking for the creek I can swim back up to my home. A woman tells me I have to be careful of the cross currents of the ocean and the creek meeting. I see a water slide on the other side and a flight of stairs going up. I am trying to decide which way I will return home and decide not to cross the creek, but to wade right up it. It's harder that way, but I want to go that way.
