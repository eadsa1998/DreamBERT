I dreamt that I was invited to a large party held by a group of sororities. The one sorority that I seemed to be most interested in had chartered a bus. Several of the girls had dates. I did not, but the boy with whom I had gone to the stunt night dance was sitting in the seat behind me holding hands with a woman almost twice his age, and presently we turned around and began talking to the boy with whom I had gone and the woman. We talked of generalities, such as the weather, etc. Finally the ride seemed to be over for everyone left the bus. All the while, however, I was not conscious that the bus had been moving. We went into a large building in which each sorority had its own particular room. To get to the room of the sorority I was with, we had to go through the room of another sorority which I disliked intensely. But the room was empty and we went through into our own room.
