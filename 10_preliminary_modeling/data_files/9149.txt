I was looking for an apartment with Bill F. An employee of one apartment complex was driving us around in a golf cart to show us the different types of units but also to show us some of the features offered by the community. I looked up and saw a second floor walkway to several apartments that I remembered seeing before. I remembered either that Jo V had lived there or moved in there or that I had thought about moving in there, or that I had been there before. I'm not sure which. But I remember it from another dream even though in the dream I thought it was something I remembered from waking life. There was a rectangular shaped cement pond just outside of one of the buildings. At night they put a tarp over it and a blanket and the employee that was working the overnight shift slept on it. There was a wood, plank bridge along one of the long sides of the pond. It had ropes along the sides to hold on to as you cross. It was very shaky and I did not like walking across it. It was getting late, starting to get dark and I wanted to go home. One of the employees said something that led me to believe that we were expected to spend the night as a way of trying the community out before making a decision. After the employee left, Bill F and I decided to try to figure out a way to get back home without the employees finding out.
