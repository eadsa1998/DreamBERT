Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles were brothers in real life and Jeffrey Dean Morgan was their father. There was a video of them and some funny stuff they did as kids. They said that one video had the 'best timing', when Jensen played a joke on Jared and he sulked and looked around. I watched it with Mom and Ezra.
