 I'm at the airport with my roommate Stephen Ramos and friend Emerald Reinhold. I am on a cart with a man who works at the airport. I tell Stephen and Emerald that we are going to be on a different compartment. The man and I leave. The man drives backwards, and we leave the area. I am afraid he may hit something and injure me, since I'm on back of the cart. I'm then on a plane. The seating area is small and cramped. All the people for my class flight to Australia are there. My friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman are there too. The plane is flying very close to the top of a city: very low. My friend Yvette Ullman is there. She acts and talks as if she was my girlfriend. I see Stephen and Emerald in a different compartment. I realize I've left my backpack at home. It contains important items. The backpack is in the hotel where we stayed the night before. My friend Kate Francis is there and we talk briefly. People are eating Mr. Freezies. Green is the best color Mr. Freezie, although purple is also seen. My high school crush Harmony Allure is there. I see her and say hi. The first thing I notice and say is that she is wearing a lot of makeup. That is an uncomfortable start to our conversation. She leaves quickly after we stumble through an uncomfortable conversation on the topic of school.
