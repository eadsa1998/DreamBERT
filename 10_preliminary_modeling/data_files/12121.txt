I was at a shop with Mom and Dad. Dad was going to buy me something expensive. I saw an egg-chair and it was cool and blue or silver. It was $300 odd. It came with a big monitor and a cool game and stuff. Mom said that she'd buy it. There was some show thing and Dad almost fell. Some dude did fall. He was the producer of the game. James Matheson bought the rights to the game and some friends and I went to this place. It was pretty much empty. James said that he wasn't going to finish making the game because he wanted to be famous for music. I said just finish this. He said he wouldn't but on TV, he said he would.
