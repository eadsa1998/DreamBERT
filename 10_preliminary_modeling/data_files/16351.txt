For whatever reason, Mom was waiting for an ambulance to come and get her, but yet in the meantime she was going to take a walk with me. Now doesn't that sound weird? And so we went and we walked over to this like kids' playground thing and then -- this is all kind of like mixed up in my memory -- so we were at this playground thing that was all built out of wood and it was like kind of a maze thing, and they had all kinds of neat things. But I couldn't find any of them to show her. And somehow I dreamt that I had the notion that I was at school and time to get out so that I could get to the parking lot where they were going to pick me up. Well, at school the halls were like flooding and they had water up to my ankles, and I took my shoes off so that they wouldn't get all wet, but from taking off my shoes I couldn't keep my balance as well, and there wasn't much more to it.
