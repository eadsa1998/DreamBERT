I was at a shop. That kid who used to read all the time at school in 2003 was there -- I'm going to call him Alberto. There was a stage there and we (a few people) went behind it and got some instruments and we were playing on the stage and Alberto was singing. I went out to Mom's car to get my phone, but I couldn't find her car and I looked all around the carpark. I asked this couple to help and I rang my phone and they answered. I didn't think anything of it and then I called them again and asked them to meet me at a taco shop because I realized.
