On a giant swing that goes in circles like ones at carnivals. On a train. Put mud all over my face and down my body to my thighs. Wash it off right before the train stops. Get off. It's headed toward Mexico. Looking out window. See a giant crane carrying a boat from one side of the harbor to the other near where I'm looking. I see two men inside the boat. The men are working-class, seamen.
