The third possible answer to a spiritual direction question. Trying to keep a spiritual direction appointment with Father F. It appears to be in St. Joe but there is a black expo event going on. There were cars and people everywhere. I was trying to very carefully drive around to get where I was going. I noticed a space between two cars that I thought I could drive through but it turned out to be a parking space, not someplace that I could go through. I had to try to back up and find a different place to drive through. There was so little room. It was very tight and I was concerned about being able to back out without hitting someone else's car. Some people were talking about what I needed or what I was trying to do and trying to give me some direction. Whatever they told me didn't work or wasn't going to work. Now I'm with Jennifer K related to spiritual direction, still in St. Joe.
