I was trying to find my way home. At first it was CR (town in which some of family has lived since 1910) downtown but in the northeast side. Then I was tangled in narrower streets and dead ends, blank walls on either side like in China. I ask a woman if I went this way I would get to open streets. She said, "Yes." But then, ''Not that way." But the way she pointed meant climbing the hill again.
