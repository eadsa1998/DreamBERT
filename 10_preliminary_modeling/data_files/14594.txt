I was watching a movie, which was The Hangover, but not. I think Michael Cera was in it. There were two guys and one of them cheated on his wife or girlfriend with Heather Graham's character? She went to his wife/girlfriend and said she had some STI and the wife was like "and...?" and then realized that he had slept with her. Then the two guys and a girl were in a bed and there was a knock on the window. They were all naked. One opened it and it was his wife. She said something, but I can't read what I wrote, and I thought that she thought that he was gay. Then she realized Heather Graham was naked. I laughed because I hadn't noticed. She held her shirt up and the guy told her off for being naked. I mentioned the movie, Moon, to Ezra. He said he wanted to see it and asked if I could download it. I said that I didn't think it was out until November. I asked why he was interested since it was a "sci-fi drama". He said he didn't know. I was thinking 'Sam Rockwell, yay'.
