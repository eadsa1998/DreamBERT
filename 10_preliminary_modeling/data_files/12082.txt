I was playing Fate, except it was real life. Some people were in the dungeon. They didn't finish the tutorial. I jumped over this thing and people followed. I bumped into this evil lady. She whistled and all these zombies came out. I told everyone to get something to stab with. I got this thing and I stabbed the vampire lady, but I don't know what happened to her. We had a fight though.
