There was music playing nearby a swimming pool, in which I was bathing. At first, the pool was surrounded with trees, but these trees turned into people, and I was in a show or aquacade diving and swimming and laughing all the time. I must have been having a wonderful time. The water was silvery blue and the moon and stars were out, yet everyone could see us very plainly.
