I was supposed to work one evening but I forgot and it was 2 hours after the start time that I realised so I text the supervisor to apologise and say I'd forgotten. Then I somehow missed another job and I wondered what was wrong with me. Later I was somewhere where people from the Technical College were - it may have been the Technical College (different from real life). Some of us were sleeping over in this building and I was on the floor with a blanket and pillow and Frederick wanted to sleep there too because he didn't have a blanket so I said ok. I woke up in the morning and people had started trickling in and I was worried they would think something dodgy was going on. Frederick got up and was helping them prepare for something and I stayed lying down. Then I discovered they were setting up for a karaoke night and I got up and started packing up to leave. I kept complaining about karaoke saying 'I hate it' and whinging that it's alway new music I've never heard of. I picked up some of my stuff and left to take it somewhere else. There was a big crowd of people outside and I realised I was wearing my Portal pants but didn't really care. Jolene and a few others were walking near me and she was smoking and I angrily waved the smoke out of my face and walked past.
