In the dream I was teaching some class in psychology. It was not my present nurse's class as there were both men and women students. It seems as if the class actually belonged to someone else but had been given to me because I was so good at remembering students' names and relating to them. The actual setting for the dream seemed to be sort of a large room that combined features of a classroom, a hallway, and a locker room. I was standing there taking off the electrodes and some student from the class was trying to explain something about how a considerable number of the students would be missing that day. I couldn't understand this girl too well because I seemed to be more preoccupied with removing the electrodes, and she had to repeat what she was saying several times. It seems as if the gist of her conversation, since four or five students would not be there in this classroom, then it should probably not be held. <br/
