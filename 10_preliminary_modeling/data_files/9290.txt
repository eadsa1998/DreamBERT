Three of my worlds collide with acquaintances from ITI, SAID, and SXDS all at one event that was going to last several days, seeming to know each other when I know that isn't the case in waking life. A group of us were getting ready to go somewhere, I think out to lunch. We got in an elevator. Macy F was with us as was Wes S. I knew Wes S was planning on us being alone with me at some point during this event. I was imagining what that would be like, after so many years and now that we are both single. I was unsure what I even wanted from that time. I was in a hurry to take care of something before we left. In my rush, I left my handbag or a some kind of bag in the elevator. Macy F noticed and brought it with her.
