The church was nearly empty when we arrived but we sat down on a bench outside where we could hear. A man and two women came up and asked the time. I looked at my watch and said 8:30. My friend said she thought there'd be time to go and went off with them. I went back thru the church. A 3 or 4 year old boy asked for TV. I said I didn't know how to turn it on. He went up and turned it on. I missed my tan handbag and went back thru church to pew outside but it wasn't there. Returned to child and told him we should keep door to church shut so as not to disturb the service by TV and closed the door. Room looked like a kitchen dining room. I found two bunches of my keys on the cupboard shelf and other items from my bag and then I spotted the bag on the floor.
