Dick, my boss, and the senior accounting partner on our account, Veronica, were going to play tennis and invited me along. I didn't want to play because I don't like them and I'm not a good player, but felt pressured to say yes. But by the time we were getting into the car to go there were seven people, and no room for me, so I sent them on and said I wouldn't play. They left, and then I ran into Brandy. I was glad to see her and we decided to walk back to the office together. First we watched some kids play a game on a hill nearby.
