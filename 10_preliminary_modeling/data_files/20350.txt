I was with a colored woman about 25 years old. She was very friendly with me. We looked for a place where we could make love. She fondled my organ, and she was anxious to have an affair with me. (Yesterday the colored patient named Williams had made advances toward me which I at first did not resist, but I told him later not to do it again, and he agreed. This dream of the colored woman may indicate that I have an unconscious romantic attraction toward him.)
