I was sitting in the backyard with a plate of scrambled eggs. I had forgotten to take the yellow part out so they were very dense. I had forgotten to stir them too. Then Dora came to the backyard and she had a plate of scrambled eggs too. She had taken the yellow part out and she had stirred them. Her scrambled eggs were light and fluffy. My mother called us to come in the house. Company was here. They came out on the back porch. I had been washing clothes. They were NOT folded, except the sarong I had gotten to give to Dora as a present. Dora. It was my birthday. Dora had a circle of rocket candles that go out and come back on when you blow them out. We just needed a cake to put them in. I blew them out. They came back on. I blew them out. They came back on. I blew them out and then you could see clear glass cylinders at the base of the rocket birthday candles. Ascending from the short glass cylinders was a wick in each tube. Then I understood how it worked. "These clothes are a mess!" My mother said. I said, "The sarong is for Dora." My mother said, "Dora, your cart only has one hook and it won't stay on the ceiling. Merri's has 2 hooks and she only paid $7.99 for it." I wished she would shut up. Aunt Linda said I cut my hair too short. She said when she cut her hair short about a year ago it grew back red and I don't like it. A group of us were in the elevator. Connie too. On the 11th floor you had to sign in. The lady behind the window said, "Boys, step over to the side." I didn't know which group I belonged to. Connie got lost meandering through the upper floors of the building. The country singer had big teeth and his brother did the echo part.
