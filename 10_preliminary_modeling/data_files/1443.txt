Heidi, my brother Dwight's daughter, is a 2 or 3 month old baby. I am holding her. She is sleeping on my shoulder. We are walking in a busy shopping street. I call to my daughter Dovre to come on now because I see some tough guys and I remember it is night. We might be in danger. I start to walk away. One of the guys calls my name, "B." I am surprised as I don't know him. But I am no longer frightened. I turn and go back and talk to him. His brother was at the community college. That's how he knew me. He sort of smiles knowingly, a slight sneer because he knew that I thought he was trouble.
