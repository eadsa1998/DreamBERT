I was driving on the freeway, which was different. I was going 70km/h so I changed lanes and sped up. I was approaching the tunnel and there was a cop with a sign. I realised he was doing breath tests so I stopped. I said to this lady, who was smoking, 'excuse me, I don't know if I was supposed to stop'. She said 'me neither'. I saw everyone behind me stop too. Elijah was there. It was then my turn for the test and they had to give you a needle that went between your hand and arm. I didn't want to do it. They also tested your heart rate. Phoebe and Monica (both from Friends) were there and Phoebe was pregnant. Phoebe got into a bed and I saw water on the floor and I said 'did you spill a drink or did your water break?'. It turned out her water had broken and I got Monica and we went to take her to hospital. At one point Ezra had my phone and he said he looked at my photos and I yelled 'DON'T!' as I was worried I had naked weight loss photos on there. He said Nana looked too and saw pictures of Joey and Chandler from Friends and I was like 'so what?'.
