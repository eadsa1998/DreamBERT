I'm with a bunch of members of my family. We go to a store to pick up some things. I don't know what we're traveling in but we're on water. It's not in a boat but I don't know what it is. As we're on our way to this store I look around and notice all these other people traveling also. I get very excited and tell everyone, Look. We're a part of The Amazing Race. All of these other people on the water are in this I mean, it's like in waking life they would never let boats be this close together. But we're as close together as we would be in a road race or in a marathon. But they all have I mean it's a wide variety of very unusual vehicles. Some of them look like cars, some look like tractors and some just look like very unusual things. I'm pointing this out to some of my family members and mentioning some of the things that I see. We go to the store and get what we need. To go back there's two large they look like wood picnic tabletops. That's what we're going to go back on. I want to attach them to each other so we're all together going back. Nobody else believes we can do it. I ask what the harm is in trying. I think we're actually going to try it.
