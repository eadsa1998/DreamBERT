I make it up as I go along and order them all about. I suggest they all take off their hats and alternate playing certain notes to play the most difficult part, which is a Chopin something which is soft and sweet. That's hard for a marching band to do, but my ideas accomplish that. There is much applause. Everyone is thrilled. I suggest we take it on the road. I am walking past a tavern or cage. All the patrons are talking about my magnificent ideas. I go in and sit next to my guy. I am very happy. Suddenly, we have a fight. He's not happy about my success interfering with our time. I feel very sad but prefer to leave him than give up my new successful life style. I go to the counter and get a note from the cook, Nate, that says he really likes me. I wink and smile at him, feeling good that some man still likes me. It means I haven't given up relationships altogether just because one guy isn't pleased. The cook gives me a box of food. I try to carry it to my van. It starts to be difficult. The food spills out of the bags and I have trouble getting the wheelchair onto the van.
