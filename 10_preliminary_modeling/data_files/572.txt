My oldest son shoots a rabbit and uses my hand to get it and gets a rat bite. I am trying to find someone to take care of it. Even a dentist or eye doctor. No one is around. I am in the hospital in my hometown and someone named Dr. Ran comes in. He makes a big issue of being covered up to work and doesn't want to get dirty but decides to do it. We are puzzling over where the rat came from.
