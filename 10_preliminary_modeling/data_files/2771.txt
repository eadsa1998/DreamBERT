I receive a large package and I am intrigued about who could have sent it. It is filled with lots of little packages and notes on each one and I have to be careful not to rip any envelopes open because there are notes all over it. I carefully read it and exclaim, "Oh, this is from Robert Price, the man I met in Alaska." We were at a party or festival at the end of school finals and met just at the end of it before I had to catch a train home. We were very drawn to one another, but the timing was wrong and I had to leave. He had talked about a place in Alaska where we could get together, like a resort, and enjoy each other's company in a restful atmosphere. In the package are fishing rods and I laugh because I don't fish and I remember the negative stuff around Howard giving me a left-handed fishing reel. I am not offended, however, but pleased. I see little lures and fly tackle and stuff and I say to Ginny, "Look, he's courting me." She asks what I'm going to do about it. I say, "Well, even if it doesn't work out, I'll always have this wonderful moment. At least someone is courting me." I am going to meet him in Alaska and give it a try.
