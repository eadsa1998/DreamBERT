I am running at a resort. I dive into the lake, being careful not to dive deep as I don't know how deep it is. I swim, amazed at how well I'm doing. A man is interested in me, but I don't like him. He's sleazy. He follows me. I go to the resort lodge. Really crowded. Someone says, "What does it mean when they say you are independent." I look at him and then demonstrate. I turn to the guy that runs the place and say I need a place to sleep. He immediately finds one for me. [BL]
