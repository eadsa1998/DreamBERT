I am attending a dream workshop put on by a group of con artists who are running a scam on dream religion. They charge large prices for the series of workshops and religious experiences. I know they are cons but ignore their clever cons to continue on the "path." I took this basic workshop 3 times because I am interested in the dream path religion. The man keeps trying to intice me into believing. I smile and continue ignoring him.
