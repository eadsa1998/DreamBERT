I wanted to bathe and went to do so in a large room. As I started to undress I saw the door was open to an adjoining room where a man was dressing a year-old baby. I went over and asked, "May I close the door?" Did so and wondered if I should lock it but didn't as he knew I was inside. Tried to urinate but couldn't and began to dress, thinking I would try again later. ... Mother came with two tan billfolds, one for each of us. I saw a typed label with our names and address in each. Asked who from. She said, "The travel agency." I thought H. must have secured them for us, one of the extras one gets for belonging to one. At first the billfolds were very slim but then I saw many pockets. "Oh I like this." Then one flap fell down and I couldn't see how it would hold anything. Asked what it was for. "For napkins."
