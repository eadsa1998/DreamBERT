This dream has really a very evocative theme because through it I have again seen the image of my grandfather who died 12 years ago. I must point out that he (my grandfather) is one of the people I loved in my childhood, until I knew that he had had an accident and had died instantly. I didn't go to the funeral because I was far away. Only my father could go and he arrived when everyone had left the cemetery. My dream goes as follows: I was walking aimlessly when I saw a bunch of hills and among them one hill that stood out. But on a side of that hill there were some people who were watching the passersby. Then I arrived to my grandfather's tomb and didn't find the body. I hurriedly asked the cemetery keeper as to my grandfather's whereabouts and he pointed to the distance. We started to go towards a tomb that had a square cover and that led into a basement. He opened it and asked me to cover my face with a handkerchief, possibly due to the putrified odor. But at that moment another keeper arrived and he called me for some purpose which I don't remember. Then I was at the main gate of the cemetery waiting for some vehicle to take me home, but suddenly a taxi appeared and 7 people are inside. They are distributed 3 in front and 4 in the back. Among them one woman stood out. I saw an orgy inside the car. Suddenly the car failed and I got out to go on my myself and at that moment, another car went by and he nearly hit me. Then I awoke.
