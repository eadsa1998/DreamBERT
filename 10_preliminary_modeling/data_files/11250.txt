I was sitting on the grass in a field sorting golf balls with 3 or 4 other boys. We looked up in the air, and there was a two-winged plane doing loop-the-loops. The next thing I knew, the plane was a one-winger, a Piper Cub, and it was flying right at us. We ducked, and the plane hit the ground but didn't explode. A tall man with a flat nose climbed out and came at us. We were laughing, and he was enraged because his landing gear was damaged.
