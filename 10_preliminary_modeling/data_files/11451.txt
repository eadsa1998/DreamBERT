I had just received my acceptance from a medical school. I sent in a one hundred dollar deposit and then began packing my clothes. Then I went downtown to board a train. The train ride seemed very long and one time I thought we were going in circles. The train seemed to speed up then it would almost come to a stop. I enjoyed the ride very much. When I arrived at the medical school, there was a crowd of people waiting to greet me. I felt very happy.
