I was with others in the bush. This guy lead me to this empty patch and told me to take a step. It turned out to be this invisible house with an alarm. They had parts like a camera/phone and I had to plug in a cable and download from it? We had to do something to get in and this guy came and we made up a story about why we were there and tried to keep him away from seeing the open parts. But he saw them and we tried to make up an excuse. Then I was at a shop, at a table with some guy who was the Mexican from Kiss of the Spider Woman. I purposely left something facing him so he could learn the truth and then he gave me money to get a water bottle. There was a big bottle of Mount Franklin. He came into the shop while I was at the counter and the lady was counting my coins. Then Chevy Chase was on our side and was in the movie playing on the TV in the shop. His character was called something like George Stromapolous.I called him and he answered in the movie so I talked in code. I watched some of the movie and there was lots of boofy hair. I thought he was hot in it. I needed to buy some stuff, including a USB. This guy motioned for a brush. I joked that it had 'been on your head'. I called Chevy again and said "where are you" and he said "I'm-" and then I woke up.
