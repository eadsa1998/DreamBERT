 I'm at party that seems to be down the block from my home in Oak Valley. My sisters Ramona and Heather and my cousins Nisa and Sandra Redding are there. Bratwursts are being sold for 75 cents each. We buy a few. I want two bowls of Lucky Charms. The cost for these is $3.50. I talk to a woman there, who may be my neighbor Mary Robbins. She thinks I am pre-med. A family friend, Dennis Prosecky, is there. He talks to someone about splitting two tickets, and selling them to different people to make money. My mom had given the girls about $103 to buy bratwursts. My mom and I ask them where the leftover $100 is. They make excuses for not having the money. I get mad. Then they tell us that they crashed the car when they were practicing driving on the freeway. The $100 went to pay for damage to the car. They were practicing parallel parking, for which they had to back up, on the freeway! People listen to our conversation, which is loud. We are then at our neighbor's house, the Stein's. Sandra and Nisa's mother, Darlene Redding, is yelling at them. I yell at them too. I say they are immature. They think guys will be attracted to them for parking on the freeway. I tell them to grow up.
