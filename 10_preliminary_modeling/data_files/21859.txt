We were traveling in our car. Someone was driving. It was dark, then the clouds started to break up and the sun came out near the horizon, near sunset. We passed thru a town. I wondered how the people made a living. It was small. There was a lake or pond. We stopped and watched a boy catching fish in a net. Carl Fischer and I were back at White's. Bob Lippert came in and I asked the boss if he was coming back. He said he was working here on some other job. He mentioned. I can't recall now. Joe Gruber, our boss at White's, had us move a big pile of old clothes or rags. I was kind of raking them along to a different pile.
