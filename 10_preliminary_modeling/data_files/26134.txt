 I'm in a football stadium in Texas. There is a march going on, which is a kind of line dance. There is a long line of people, including many women dressed in red, gold, and glitter that are considered pretty. The people seem like cowboys. There are wagons in the line. The line marches and the end of the line goes in front of the front of the line, so it is a huge circle. There is a song playing. Someone calls us different groups, one by one. There are six different groups. One gets called Jimmy, which is my friend's name, and another is called Kenneth. When one's group is called they march out to the group across from them and exchange members. Only three groups are called out since all six groups will have exchanged members by then.
