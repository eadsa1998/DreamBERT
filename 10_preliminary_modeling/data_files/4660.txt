I am married to Hector. He has second thoughts. I say its no problem. He feels upset he spent so much money on the rings and I'll end up with them. I look at the tiny diamonds. I say I'm fine with giving them back to you. I feel very helpful and kind. We are trying to call a company to come clean up a mess.
