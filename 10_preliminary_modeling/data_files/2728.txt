I am a beautiful young woman in perfect physical shape in a two-piece white bathing suit, like in those Beach Blanket Bingo movies or Gidget. I have my surf board. The men are all lounging around on the beach. As I approach the water, they laugh and scoff because this is their "turf" and I'm just a woman. A James Darren-type man watches with interest. I go out and surf very well, which amazes the men. I go back out and do it again, showing my stamina. Then, I choose to go out even farther than they dare, to the really big waves that are wild and deep. I have some trouble but make it in, I crash and get back up, sand all over me and in my mouth. I carry my board and go to a standing shower head and rinse myself off and drink the water, spitting it out to clear out the sand. As I am showering, a huge crowd of ordinary "tourists" come by, all carrying huge black spears. They trample my surf board and I interrupt them and pull by board to safety. I then cleverly point them to another beach so they won't infest the surfing beach. They go on. Now I meet the male leader of the surfers who is almost growling at me. He doesn't like me or rather his territory has been invaded. I coolly stand up to him. #2, James, is warmly proud of me. I then try to decide if I am going to surf at low tide and do a surf estuary. I see the water washing back and forth on the exposed rocks. I decide not too. Not much excitement in that.
