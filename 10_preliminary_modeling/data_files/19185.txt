We bought a boat, and we took the boat on a trailer down and put it in the water. There were several other boats in the water. Started up the boat. Drove off down these channels, like between land, and we were going in single file with other boats. We were going fast. I think our boat was a used boat, but it was pretty good at the price we paid for it. We passed some other boats. The only boats that passed us were bigger and more expensive boats. We is myself, my wife and my mother. We beached the boat. We had a picnic, and we discussed the merits of the various boats. We decided that ours was a good one for the money and we were quite happy with our boat. My wife and my mother purchased the boat, and they told me that they had looked at some that were cheaper. I think the price was 9.95, a used boat and a new one was more expensive, something like 22.95. But the one they had, I think, was about 12.95. Anyway, I liked the boat. I was quite satisfied with the boat. When we left the dock area, we drove the boat out the channel between two pieces of land. They seemed to have rather, you know, stone sea walls. There were high trees along the water edge, and this channel wasn't straight out to the ocean. It went at right angles kind of out. When we got back, I got in an argument with a man over the merits of an Evinrude over a Johnson. I was all for the new Johnson with an inboard and outboard drive. He thought just the outboard alone was pretty hot stuff. These canals were actually quite long. This canal was a continuous canal with a lot of turns and much of the time I recall was spent driving the boat down these canals. The boat was an open boat, somewhere between 16 and 18 feet, I would say, and it had one of those inboard-outboard drives. You could tell this because it had a box in the back rather than an outboard motor hanging out.
