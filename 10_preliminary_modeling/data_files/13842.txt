I had made up this ring tone on this site. At first, it was food, then it was a Sim. It was this apple pie looking thing with extra stuff added. It was nice. Then it was a female Sim. I decided to eat my phone and I was eating one of the sliding bits and then decided I didn't want to so I asked Mom to get me a new one tomorrow. I told her about what ring tone to get. Ezra was also there.
