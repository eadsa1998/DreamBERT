["Saving Bill Clinton"]  Charla and I live at the White House. Bill and I are going to be married. Charla is talking and says "Sex." I am nervous and ask her not to mention sex. The reporters will pick up on that and make rumors about Charla and Bill Clinton. I then worry that my warning her will sensitize her to do it more often for attention. The preparations for the wedding is going on in the main room. A woman is there and I realize she is the killer that is trying to destroy Bill. I and Charla convince her to come upstairs to a room to talk. She agrees. The stairs are outside the house. We are in this room, and  she grabs me to poison me. She is behind me and I struggle. I manage to get the poison she is trying to kill me with, into her mouth and she dies. I go down the stairs and find Bill. He is wearing a white suit. Most of the rooms are white. We hug. I say to him, I've killed her.  He is shocked. I say it was self defense. He hugs me again. He is very happy.
