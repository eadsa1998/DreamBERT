Millie and I are doing the dishes together. She's washing and I'm rinsing. She turns on the water faucet and starts filling up the bucket. I get angry at her because we aren't finished yet and she's diluting the soap. She explains what she's doing and is upset with me because of my outburst. I then feel badly and apologize for getting angry. We go on with the dishes.
