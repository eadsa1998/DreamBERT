I am teaching a class and Darryl is one of the students. I like him just like I did in high school. We dance together and hold hands and I wonder if the other students will be upset or think this is unethical. After all, I did know him when I was a teen. As we are walking together toward the door, I say to him, with loving anticipation, "Will I see you at lunch?" He says curtly, "No," and walks away. I feel devastated and hurt. I love him and want him to want me.
