I am going to be late to school.  It is 8 a.m. and I am still in bed.  I think of all the consequences but am sure Mother will write an excuse for me.  I do arrive at school a little late, but still during homeroom, I believe.  I go to my locker, and it is on a long street-like affair sort of like Bottomore St.  Mine is near Longhorse St.  I see that there is no lock on the locker.  When I open it, the combination lock and padlock are on the floor inside.  Upstairs, I go through a door, and it is more like a dormitory.  Pat Byers is there, and her "locker" consists of a small room with red and white checked wallpaper.  It contains a small dresser, a mirror, a radio (to which she was listening), and a bed.  She shows me a bracelet which opens on each side like a locket.  It is heart-shaped, and on her right wrist.  It has her name on it and also "John."  She has one on her other wrist also.  It is inscribed with "Jim" and a message which I don't read.  She says she likes Jim the best.  The engraving is pretty sloppy.   After homeroom, I want to use the phone.  There are about 6 phones in sight in the hall, but they are all in use, and a long line is waiting for each.  I ask Ronnie Nadner, who is starting to dial, what all the rush for the phones is.  He says that a certain day-that day or the next-is the last day to have pictures made at the photography studio.
