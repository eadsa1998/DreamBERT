Going to a meeting with my boyfriend, my roommate and another friend, being bored, trying to make the best of things. Wandering around. My roommate left without my boyfriend and me even though I told her to wait. I called only to hear her tired voice saying she was tired and sorry but she couldn't wait anymore. It was by the water. It looked like a warehouse but I wasn't sure. We ended up (my boyfriend and I) wandering to my apartment but I kept forgetting something and had to go back for them and it continued on like that and when I woke up we hadn't made it home.
