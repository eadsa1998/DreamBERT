 I walk in a very large old house. Many people live there, like a huge extended family. I'm near the top floor. There are many old things being stored there. There are preserved heads and other parts of dead people. Some of these are painted. Some are in jars. I see one or two heads that are mounted, like they were heads of a deer that were mounted. From the neck up the head is there, and it looks real.
