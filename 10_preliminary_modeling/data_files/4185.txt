["Strange roommates."] I have a young man as a roommate and he has a girlfriend. I watch as she gets angry at him and packs up to leave because he didn't do something she wanted. He wants her to stay. She does this three times. On the third time, He knows the drill and simply hands her her small case as she points to it. She keeps coming back. I lie on a couch watching this silly drama. Finally she leaves and both the young man and I are glad to see her go. Now I go into the kitchen. I see a huge dish of hamburger with what looks like chocolate chips in it ready to be cooked. I show this to the young man and he says they are corn chips. We decide to cook it even though it was left by some other roommate. Later, I look into the cooking pot and it is more like a stew with chunks of beef and funny looking veggies. A bunch of string like white things.
