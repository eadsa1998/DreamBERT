During my dream early this morning, I was swimming in the ocean while a bright shining spotlight shone on me. The spotlight followed me whereever I swam. I tried to escape the light by swimming very fast in different directions and diving deep into the water, but it continued to follow me. I kept diving deeper and deeper, but when I came to the surface the light was always there shining on me. After a while, I realized there was no escaping the light so I swam towards the shore. When I reached the beach I walked out of the water and came to a parking lot where my brother was sitting in a car. I remember nothing further about this dream other than my brother and me greeting each other in the parking lot.
