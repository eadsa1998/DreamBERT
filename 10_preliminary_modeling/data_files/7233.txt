I told her I was going to get a new coat. I had had the old one six years. She said it was wonderful that my nephew had helped me buy the old one. She had a slight German accent. Then she said something about Mr. Cassels. I saw the name in large white letters and told her so but asked if she hadn't meant Mr. Castle.
