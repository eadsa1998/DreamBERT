I dreamed I fell asleep at my desk at my office, although it looked different, more home-like.  I was partly nude, and I knew my underwear and leg was showing, but I kind of wanted that.  I felt bold and teasing.  I knew someone might come in and see me, although it was night in the office.  I was half-asleep, wanting a sexual fantasy.  I imagined part of it, even felt my sheet being pulled slowly off me.  I was surprised, and even woke up a little, because my hand had not moved to do that.
