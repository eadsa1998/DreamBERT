I dreamed last night that I was back working for my job in the art books section. The department was located in some old ruined dorm at my high school. Yet I was somehow very close to the Alps and everywhere else in Europe. I had to snowboard throughout Europe (which was tricky enough since I can't snowboard) and steal art for my job in exchange for cocaine. And I don't know why but I was trying to acquire 40 grams of it. Aaron was there and was talking to Britta, even though he had come to visit me. I sent them on a tour of Europe to keep them busy while I tried to find the 40 grams of cocaine. Then I woke up.
