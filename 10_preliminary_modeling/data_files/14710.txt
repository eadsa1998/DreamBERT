I had this vampire guy as a friend. He was young. He was saying that he was gay and he had had a crush on James Van Der Beek when he was young, but he was born in 1948. He said he wrote him letters that he didn't send and had material that was "not repeatable". Then it was True Blood. Bill and Sookie were in bed together. We were at Granma's house but it was different. I needed a tissue and I asked her for one and she gave me these small squares of tissue. She wasn't happy about vampires. Uncle Gabriel walked in the room as I was closing the door on the other side, but left when he realized we were going to bed. Sookie and Bill were now other people and he wouldn't suck her blood but she wanted him too. There was some jam stuff you could eat which did something to do the blood (I think it produced more). There was this new thing out where a van would park in a carpark and encourage people to exercise. There was a meeting there one day and there lots of people doing stretches. One guy there had a heart condition.
