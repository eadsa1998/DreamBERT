I was at home in my room when the doorbell range and I went to open it, and it was a friend of my cousin (who lives in my house) who had come to look for him (I had never seen the friend). Both of them went out and they also took my brother. Afterwards, I was in my room again and I looked out the window that faces the street and saw two girls. One of them had studied at my school, but in a different class (younger); the other I took (in my dream) to be her sister, because they were wearing a uniform which wasn't from our school. The girl I know (Carol) stopped in front of my house and we were talking. Her sister disappeared. Then on the other side of the street, a car passed by and hooted the horn and I recognized the car of my boyfriend's brother. The whole family (parents, brother and himself) was in that car, and I told Carol that it was my tough luck because I was sick and this was the first time I was up and they would now think I was already recovered. She laughed and said goodbye. Later, my cousin, my brother and the friend came back and all of them, except the latter, and I went to the room of the first two. There we realized that they had been drinking and my brother is not used to that and was very sick. I scolded my brother and left. Later my boyfriend arrived and we were talking and my mother called us and told him that she had to go out and to please (my sister was also there) stay home and look over all of us, because the three of us were sick. He said alright, and holding my cheeks, he kissed me and started to laugh. I don't remember any more.
