I am living in my car. I'm in the driver's seat. I notice lots of broken glasses and cups on the floor. I am annoyed at Ellie for making this mess, carelessness. I try to reach down and pick up some, but it's too hard. I start to back the car out of its spot. I am parked too close to an older black car (the Mercury?) I wonder if I scratched the paint on the car or made a dent. I also notice my green van on the right. I then get out of the car and walk downtown to see what I can see. The sidewalk is uneven, like old bricks or cement. I stop to look in a store window at dresses. I see a fat skirt, some ugly dresses. I notice in the reflection of the window a man is standing next to me - some creep, no doubt. He's talking to me. I'm annoyed. I turn and walk away and I see the end of the road. There is a huge ocean with ocean-going vessels out there. The waves are huge and crashing and cold. The oil tanker-like ships are rusty. I feel fear and revulsion. I don't want to see it and I turn and walk away towards that man even though I don't want to see him either. I notice another (street?); I go there only to see a rugged vacant lot with junk and a burnt-out foundation of a house. I think to myself, "I wonder what these symbols mean." I notice the negative aspects and feel a reluctance to examining the meaning. Just my luck, hard and negative symbols. I see the burnt-out house and feel resigned. I see some children nearby. I see a person who looks at me and waves and I am unaware that I'm actually waving to myself. My dream self is waving to my waking self. I am amused and impressed with myself.
