 I'm in a store with some friends from home, including Marybeth Neumann. We see Marybeth and kind of ignore her, playing coy. Others start to leave. I stay there. I look at Marybeth over a counter. She starts to cry. I go over and hug her. She is sad. Things have been difficult for her. She broke up with her boyfriend Jeff, who turned out to be her fiance. When I leave she offers me something. She words her statement funny, like what she is offering is entertainment. She is offering me a kiss, I realize.
