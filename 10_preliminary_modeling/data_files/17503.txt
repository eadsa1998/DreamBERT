Shopping.  $90 for a large blue tub.  I cuddled with my good online friend Del as he held a seagull.  We went to a campus caf√©.  A robotic drink server didn't allow much time for us to grab the drinks.  A girl offered me a package of Nutrageous.  I took them.  Saw a hamburger-sized spider eating another pack.  I told the girl, she said they were cute and refused to do anything about them.  I had to go for classes.  I was taking a follow-up class to the human genome, Bio 134.  I had to go on a little trip to qualify.  The bus driver from my regular route got on and the teacher started signing people up.  He stopped right before my boyfriend Jeremy and I.  I slept behind Jeremy's shoulder.  Then the teacher had us sing Linkin Park.  Very slow songs.  "For this one I want you to be 102."  The tune went something like 5 1 5 3 5 6 1 6.
