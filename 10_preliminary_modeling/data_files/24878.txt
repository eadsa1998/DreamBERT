We were at the middle school and my ballet class had ordered pizza. Courtlynd was asking everyone if they had any crust to spare. Some of us sat down outside while others went to classroom 2 and watched a hyped-up video on soccer. Angela kept talking about how it was changed for the Olympics. She said she gave her gold medal to another teammate. Then people started eating Steamers pizza. Setting: At the My school Middle School. Characters: Courtlynd, a girl in my ballet class. Angela, another girl in my ballet class that has nothing to do with soccer. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. Very mixed things.
