High school friend Dora and I are walking to town and come to the bridge that goes across the river. This town has two rivers in it. As I start to walk on the bridge, I am shocked to see that boards are rotten and holes come through the wood. This is an arched sort of oriental shaped wood bridge. I am afraid to set my foot down and then realize that this hasn't yet happened, but is on the verge of happening. I gingerly walk across, afraid I'll fall through at each step. I look out at the quick rapids in the river and am afraid. I see an animal "caught" in a skin of water. I say, "Is that a dolphin?" Dora says, "No, a seal." He's having a hard time making it through the tunnel enclosed around him. I decide maybe I should move from this town so I don't have to always be going across this dangerous bridge. It makes me sad because I like this town. I remember we left our luggage and ask Dora if we shouldn't go back and get our luggage. She says we came here to get the key to our luggage. She asks the guard at the end of the bridge for the keys. He gives them to her and we go back across. I see Dora/Jennifer H hanging by her knees in a swing thing on a tree, laughing.
