I am teaching a sexuality class. Three double beds are lined up on the left side of the classroom. I am somewhat annoyed because it crowds the space. The students come in and I ask them to line up the chairs, making room for them to sit. After class, one of the male students follows me, curious about what I do in my off hours. I go up an elevator to find my office. I wave hello to several male colleagues. Bonnie and I start walking to the parking lot to go home. Very prosaic.
