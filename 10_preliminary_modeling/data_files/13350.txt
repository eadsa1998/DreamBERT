I was in English. Ms Solomon was helping me with a question for A Fortunate Life. The siren went and I got up and was putting stuff in my bag. Eugene walked past, then Darius and Bradley. I went to lunch. I saw Evelyn skipping and she went to the oval. Calvin was at another block watching her and was like "What the hell?".
