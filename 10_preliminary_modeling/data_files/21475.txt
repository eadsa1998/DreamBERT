There was a big snowstorm. When I came outside, I had to dig the car out. I mean the windshield was covered thick. I looked for a letter to appear and I thought it was going to be a three, but it came on clear and it was E. My sister Mary and I were going home from work. I was not working for White Sewing Machine Co. I met her. There was a grade going down and it was icy. We sort of skated or slid on the ice. I held her and we slid downhill using our shoes like skates. There was a pile of apples peeled on the ground. I picked one up and was going to eat it when a boy said, "You have to buy it. Climb up that tree and pay for it." I looked up and there was a row of men going up. I went up part way and then everybody was climbing down. They were afraid someone would fall from the top on them. I also climbed down. I was running up and up and Scout our dog was with me. There was a piece of wire that was always in my way, so I bent it and threw it on a side out of my way. Bob and I were up in a building and Uncle Mike (deceased) was there. Then his son Mike swung on a swing and was to jump, but fell on the floor. I was climbing up with Andy P. up beams like we got to the top. I was wading thru water, then I swam part of the way.
