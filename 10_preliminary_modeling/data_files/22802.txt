I am in River City.  I see Susan Sanders rolling down the sidewalk in sort of car like a Nash, only much, much smaller.  I get in and ride with her and can't even sit up straight because the car is so small.  I ask her if she got her license, and she says yes, that she's 14.  I ask her if she had to take a test for her license.  She says yes, but I can't find out what it was about.  She says the place is on the corner of Erago and either Pogdras or Pelodas.  Then she suggests that since there is so little room, I can drive and she will walk.  So I do, and I find that the car has to be pedaled or pumped.  We stop in front of some store and some adult that I know is there.
