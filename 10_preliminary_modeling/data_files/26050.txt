 I'm at Grocery Getto in Oak Valley. There is a lot of cold cereal on sale. I buy some bite size shredded wheat or frosted mini wheats that cost $3.00 for two boxes. I see raisins and buy a bag because I remember I need them for my oatmeal breakfasts. A lot of cereal is on end displays. There is a large toy section, with yellow trucks in it. I buy other things as well, including blueberries. There are raspberries at the top of the bag of blueberries.
