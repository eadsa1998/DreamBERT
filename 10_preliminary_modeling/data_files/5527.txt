I was hanging up clothes for my mother and one of the pieces of cloth was one of my dad's tan workshirts. They were long sleeved and he had pants that matched them. The shirt was almost as if it had been very stiffly starched and ironed and I had a real problem hanging it on the line and one of my mothers friends was on the lawn, playing with a dog I don'' remember the size of the dog, but I was surprised that this dignified lady, this school librarian would be roughhousing with a dog and there was a small statue of Queen Victoria on a stand somewhere, and it was very nicely painted, she was not in mourning and that the most common picture you see of her... Here she was short and dumpy but she had on lovely clothes, a blue skirt and pink blouse and that's it.
