I sell my house and buy another one I think I'll like better, but as I walk around in it, I discover holes, rotten floor boards. It's falling apart. It's smaller. I find a small storage room that I see a long drop to a rock base under the rickety floor board. I see a skull with a hatchet in it. I then compare bills with the previous owner. She owes me $40 and I owe her $40 and more. I can't remember.
