I am in a bed, sleeping. My cat pops up from under the covers. My children come in (teens). We discuss my getting up. Kenneth walks through the hall. I look up to see my cat walking upside down on the ceiling. The plaster was so thick he could get his claws in. I look for my clothes and remember they are in the bedroom across the hall. I look at miniature things.
