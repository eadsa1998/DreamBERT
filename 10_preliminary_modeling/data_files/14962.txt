I was watching Burn Notice and it was a weird episode. I said that I hated Fiona. Mom and Ezra were watching and Mom said that she probably wouldn't mind the show. I can't remember it properly, but Eugene and Sam were on a job. Then they were in an office building. Adelle DeWitt (Dollhouse) was there. This group of guys blew up this bit outside and then went inside. Jack Bauer (24) was also around and quietly went in through the sliding front door. He hid a gun in a plant pot and joined the rest of the people. Then it was Eugene again. He was speaking in code to this person. I was inside too and I was trying to get this metal 'lid' off this thing on the floor. I didn't have enough time. Then it was House. I went upstairs to find Taub. I asked "where's everyone gone?" and he said "I replaced all of them". It was Christmas. He asked if I was still on. Some guy had only joined because he liked Cuddy. She found out and was like 'why didn't you just tell me' and they had also had a one night stand years ago. Taub was actually called Ezra.
