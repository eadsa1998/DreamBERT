I was in a hotel room with Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly. We were getting ready to sleep but I couldn't go to sleep, and I was like taking my shoes off and getting off into a recliner lounger that was sitting on top of two beds, straddling two beds. I was like wiggle, wiggle, wiggling around, and then I fell asleep and then I woke up and it was the next morning. Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly gave me this "Wee Sing" CD/ DVD-like thing and I was kind of afraid to look at it and stuff, and it played in my, you know, that Spanish thing, that Spanish dictionary. It played in the card slot. And then next thing I knew, it was on TV and they were alike singing songs like on the other "Wee Sing" tapes, except it showed them like playing in their tree house and stuff. And I know there was more to it, but I can't remember.
