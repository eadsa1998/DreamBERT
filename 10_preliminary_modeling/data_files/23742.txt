I was with a group of people, about ten of us, walking on Mars.  We walked by a sandy, rocky ledge in a reddish landscape.  We were on an archeologic or geologic tour of Mars.  I hung back from the group, I felt an alien might appear.  From behind the ridge, a male Martian came out and walked up to me.  He told me:  "You people on earth shouldn't be so uptight and hostile about homosexuals.  At one time on your planet, everyone (or every being) was homosexual.  You need to be more tolerant and accepting to homosexuality."  In the dream I took this to mean: when life on Earth was one-celled and simple organisms.
