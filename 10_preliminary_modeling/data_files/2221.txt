Now I'm driving home up a freeway. I'm sort of Kate Hepburn. We see a troop of entertainers and pull over. They come over and are belligerent. We try to escape. They laugh and say they aren't legal in this state but they are just over the Delaware border. We drive away and realize we're going the wrong way, so we turn and drive quickly past them again, sticking out our tongues and jeering, feeling safe they can't catch us. We pull into a hotel that has a parking garage so they won't see our car, but as we look out our room windows we see them pull in. We lock the door. Our room is furnished with two bare mattresses. They pound on the door and we hide, hoping they'd go away. They do and then the hinge side of the door pops free and open. We hold it closed, hoping they don't return.
