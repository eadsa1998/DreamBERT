The dream started out on one of my father's jobs. We had just about finished building a brick store and were trying to finish up this day. The job was near Donna's home (my girlfriend) and she used to drop around once in a while. Gilbert (a close friend of mine) was helping us finish up and was on the roof looking down at the street working. He was off balance and almost fell. I told him to be careful because I couldn't catch him if he fell. My father came over and just about that time Gilbert fell and Dad and I caught him. It seemed very easy. Later I went over to Donna's to say goodbye. I was leaving for school. The rest is not clear because someone woke me up.
