This dream happened in Virginia on one of its many mountains. While walking on one of these mountains, a large brown black bear appeared before me. I immediately took off down the side of the mountain because I knew that a bear's front legs are shorter than his rear ones. So if he (the bear) had to run on a downgrade he would trip. Just when I thought I had escaped, my feet seemed glued to the ground. I remained almost motionless however hard I tried to make my legs move. The bear was upon me in an instant and at that time I woke in a cold sweat.
