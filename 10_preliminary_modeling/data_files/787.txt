Later, I'm being chased by people in 4 helicopters. They are trying to shoot me. I get on top of a green airplane just barely larger than my body. I lay down on it so it and I are the same configuration. I control the speed with my hands on the prop. We fly over a big shiny lake. I look back. Two men run and jump into the lake to escape the helicopter. They land head first in shallow water from the waist to the feet. They are out of the water (standing on their heads) I go over a mountain, calling ahead to get permission of the airport to land quickly. At first they refuse. I have to wait my turn, heavy traffic. I tell them this is an emergency. They say, "O.K., you'll have 10 seconds between planes." I then get inside the plane. I think, "No, I don't want to, I feel trapped," but then I decide to because I would have metal around me and the chair back to stop bullets. I land. Then I'm in a huge house sort of like M City, only there are lots of windows everywhere (like at in-service old club house). I tell people, "Duck down, or you'll get shot." A mixture of people are there. Chuck, Dylan and lots of young college age women. One young woman wants to know what's going to happen to our deal over the yarn if some of us get shot. I am impatient with her. I say, "If I get shot, the yarn's yours, O.K.? The rest we'll worry about later." I go downstairs. Two Seans come in, nonchalantly. [BL]
