I was working on a client database at the computer, though I don't know what company I was working for or who the client was. It seemed to be a word document that had many pages. It was an alphabetical list, or a list that was supposed to be alphabetical. The first thing in each entry looked more like part of an url than a company or individual name in color text. Following that was a brief description in black text. Something about the way the first part of each entry was in there was making it hard to find some of the listings with a search. I was trying to come up with way to make changes so we could quickly and effectively find the entries we wanted when we needed them. I would occasionally say something to someone else related to what I was doing.
