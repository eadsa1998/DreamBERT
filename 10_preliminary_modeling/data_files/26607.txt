 I see a swinging pendulum-like object. It is huge, and seems to have a semi-truck at one end. It swings and smashes a ghost-like being into a wall or building. The being is made of a skeleton, but is Jell-O-like, smashed. The pendulum breaks through one building, with the flattened figure of the ghost stuck to its end, and smashes into the next building. The ghost-skeleton is severely beaten. The ghost is then the actress Linda Hamilton. She picks herself up and continues on despite the beating. Her name is Wendilot. She is being chased, a spirit may be trying to kill her. I may be one of the spirits chasing her. The goal of Wendilot would be to make a titanium watch for her uncle, who may be helped or cured after 30 or 40 years of illness. He would be able to cure himself. I'm evading Wendilot, staying hidden around my neighbors the Stein's house, and the front sidewalk at home in Oak Valley. A man with bl___ (?) may be the protected or the protector. I have a brown or blue hat on.
