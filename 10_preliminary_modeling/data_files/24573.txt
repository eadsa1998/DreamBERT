My dog was leaping toward me and my mom was making pasta and the phone was ringing and everything was going berserk, Barbie dancing around the room and all of a sudden I was swimming and my dog was dancing and Barbie was on the phone. Setting: My kitchen and pool. Characters: my dog; Mom, Anne; sister, Barbie; me, Charlene. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I think it's a totally weird dream. I don't understand why (I) was happy.
