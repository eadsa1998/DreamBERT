I was kept a prisoner in a room which opened into a larger room which was barn-like. I was confined with another man, and I don't remember whether I was he or whether he was somebody else. It seemed that perhaps I was the only prisoner, and that my dream mind was watching the affair sometimes from a distance and sometimes closely. My jailer was a fiendish sort of person who was going to kill me. I wasn't clear why he didn't kill me, since I was in his power. The jailer kept taunting me by running from window to window, peering in and leering at me.
