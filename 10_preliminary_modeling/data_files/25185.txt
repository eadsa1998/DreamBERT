 I'm in Franklin Hall's second floor as a sophomore but in my first-year dorm room. I have the feeling both of moving in and of moving out. I must be moving in because I'm in the wrong room. I move some of my stuff down the hall to a suite. It is big and has four beds. It looks like one person has already moved in. I think we'll get along okay with the other two people. There is a bathroom in the corner and stairs leading up away from the room. Back in my old room, my friend Melanie McDyss comes in. I am happy to see her. She has longer hair than she used to. She is really hungry. She asks me for food. All I have is Country Time lemonade mix. My high school classmate Sal Watson chases my college friend Ivory Alshire into my room. They are flirting. Ivory says to me, "Nice thighs." I am wearing no pants. My high school friends Kevin Simpson and Edith Sherman show up. Edith has not left for Chicago yet. Kevin lives on the fourth floor. I tell him to carry something of mine up to the third floor where I live. I am moving out.
