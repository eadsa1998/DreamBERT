There was this really ugly tree and it was really smooth and slippery and I was staring at it, but this kid ran up to it and he was trying to climb it but he kept falling off. I was hurt and mad at the tree so I started yelling at it, but the boy still fell off - except now he fell into this huge pit, so I went to the pit to look for him and I fell in too. There was this huge doll that kept quoting Shakespeare and I couldn't find the boy. Setting: In this big grassy place. Characters: The boy and the huge doll. The boy kinda looked like Tom Sawyer, but it wasn't him. The doll was one of those porcelain dolls they advertise in TV guides, except it had a pink frilly dress on and it was a guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, hate. I was angry at the doll and I hated the tree.
