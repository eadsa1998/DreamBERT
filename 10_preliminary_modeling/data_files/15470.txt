We knew Greg Sestero a little. We went to his house for some reason. He seemed to want me to leave after a while. I packed my stuff up; I had my phone, water and some other stuff and went to the carpark. There were 4 red cars in a row and then another a bit further away. Greg came out and got in a car with other people and they took off. I took a photo. Samantha was pregnant and made a post on Facebook. I found out I was pregnant too and then we were in the True Blood world. I was seeing Eric, but had had an affair with Sam, which is why I was pregnant. We asked for someone's advice and they asked how I had gotten pregnant and Eric said 'she had an affair' and seemed annoyed about it, but didn't really show it. There was a game with a hose and a water slide and you had to use the hoses to climb up while reading out lyrics. I forgot the lyrics to the song and a hose fell and then another one did too. I tried to work it out and get out. At one point, Sam was bending over and he was wearing tight jeans. Ezra had a smoke which was made from acid and no-one seemed bothered.
