There was supposedly a play being produced and given, but nobody was cooperating. People were talking, moving around, etc. I was trying to make love to this well-formed blond in tights. I didn't recognize her and she was particularly attractive. I wasn't getting beyond third base with her (kissing and searching for her gifts) when I got up and went outside where they were trying to catch a black panther, a small one. They cornered it up a tree with the help of a dog. Then it would jump down, then run up again. They (probably the stage crew) tied it on a stick like they do on safari and started taking it somewhere. It got loose and the chase started again. Then they had a rope around its waist and it looked like it was hurt. I pointed it out to another guy, showing my sympathy for it. While the other guy was helping, out of nowhere this huge, and I mean huge, prehistoric animal was staring me in the face. I told the guy, "Look!" He just shrugged. I turned around and this other prehistoric monster started at me. I found myself fighting it and then woke up. [sex desire, sympathy, scared, anxious, both pleasant and unpleasant, no color]
