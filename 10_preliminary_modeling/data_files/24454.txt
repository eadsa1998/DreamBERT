I am with Jamie H. on a trail in Vietnam. We are in a hostile environment, though at the same time on vacation or holiday. The terrain is wooded and tropical. I begin to tell him about war, about Chicom's and combat and death. We are both armed. I am fearful of going out on ambush. The next moment I begin to weep and sob deeply. Recollection ends here.
