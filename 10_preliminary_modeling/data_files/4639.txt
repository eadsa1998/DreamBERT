["Shards of multi-colored glass in my mouth."] I own a business of some sort. Alan Alda and I are there. He is a medical Doctor. We are friendly. He wants me to go with him to see the area where the employees are doing arts and crafts projects in their free time. Maybe we'll play and have fun there. We walk over to a table area and I notice a small shard of colored glass is on my finger. I had touched the table surface with my hand and a piece stuck to me. Someone had been doing a cut glass project. I carefully take it out of my finger and see more shards on the table. I want to move on someplace more safe but Alan is interested in showing me something there. I notice another shard. I pull it out, then another and then I am in bare or stocking feet and get some on my toes. I am worried. Alan stands there observing. I want him to help me but he doesn't. More and more I find the shards. Red, green, blue ones. Then one is in my mouth. That distresses me as I might swallow it and cut my throat inside. I carefully remove it, Then more and more until my mouth is full of them. I must be very careful swallowing. I am worried and Alan simply watches. I'm pulling out bunches of them now. I say to him, I need a restroom. He vacantly looks around. I see a sink and try to rinse these shards out of my mouth. It's becoming scary.
