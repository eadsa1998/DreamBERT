I was at school. I was sitting with some people and there was a toilet which was outside and was like a drain. Ms Pascal thought that I was friends with the people. Then she asked how many friends I had, "eleven?" and I said "Two, Calvin and Evelyn" and she was like "How did you manage that?". I was telling Calvin later. He thought that the person I liked had a 'J' in their name. I was thinking 'Daryl, Dmitri and Eugene don't have a J!'.
