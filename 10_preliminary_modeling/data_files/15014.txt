We were having a joint get-together for me and Mom's birthday. I was naked with a towel around me and I sat next to Gizmo. I saw Eugene near me. He was putting his bag down and I saw him writing in a card. I imaged him started to write 'I love you' and then changing it to 'have a good day'. Then I was at Nana's. Dad and Ezra were in the lounge room watching a horror movie. This guy was in a plane and there was a special button to allow for decoys. There were some more but I can't read it. The movie was called IC Eric or something. Another movie that was on was called CCVII and there was another one which was getting heaps of good reviews and Dad said he had heard enough of it. There were two towers of buildings. I can't remember what was happening but the one I wanted to go to was closed.
