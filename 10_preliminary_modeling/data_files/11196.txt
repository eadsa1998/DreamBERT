I was in a very exclusive jewelry shop looking for a watch and an engagement ring. The jewelry looked very cheap and I did not like it. Nevertheless, I bought the watch and picked out the ring I wanted. The ring was quite different from what I really wanted. The boy who was buying it for me came in and asked me why I picked one I didn't like. I didn't know. Then suddenly I was standing with my father waiting for a streetcar. He was carrying the watch and I was carrying the ring.
