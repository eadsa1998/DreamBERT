 I'm at my home in Oak Valley sitting on the floor near the four bay windows. The Brimson College Basketball team comes through the front door for a team photograph. They move the furniture out of the window area. I talk to Yar Glenn, the coach, and help him move a coffee table. I check the refrigerator.
