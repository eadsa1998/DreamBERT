I was standing in the dining room with my dog, lob king out the window at a sunny Saturday afternoon when a brown Buick (1939-limited) with white sidewalls drove up. My father's brother got out of the car and came to the door. Dad let him in. They went into the library and talked rather loudly. I opened the dining room window, and the dog, Becky, and I jumped out. We ran across the front yard to the car and just looked.
