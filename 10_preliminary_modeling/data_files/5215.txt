First I dreamed that my friends and I were all trying to help Matthew get into Yale. We were helping him with classes and applications. I think he ended up getting in, but then I started a new dream that was really weird. I had three bedrooms, and whenever I had to talk to someone, they always met me in the wrong room. My next dream was about taking exams. I dreamed that right before each exam in the morning, we all gathered in the dining hall and individually ordered French toast and bacon. The woman got angry because she didn't want to cook. I was slightly confused. My last dream was about this game. There were 20 people and 1 killer. Everyone is trying to find out who this one killer was before they died. They were all forming pacts and groups, just to be betrayed. It was really odd. Then I woke up.
