This dream seemed to be in a forest, although I do not know exactly where. I was sitting on a log apparently waiting for a squirrel to come into sight. The birds were singing, and I felt very sleepy and warm. The squirrel came out on a branch high up in a tree, and I took careful aim but could not fire. I must have said "run and play little fella" rather loud because it woke my wife up who in turn woke me. I was conscious of the green moss and little red flowers in the woods as well as the beautiful reddish coat of the squirrel.
