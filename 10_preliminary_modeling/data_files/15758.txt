I was at university (I don't know what I was studying or what university it was, just one I made up), and something had happened like a battle. I'm not sure exactly, but there were lists of all students who had been involved and 'killed an enemy'. Marvin also went to the school and we were sitting next to each other on computers in a computer lab. I found my name on the list and his name as well. He was sort of following me around at one point and sometimes I was following him [similar to at work]; there was a small cement platform thing outside that had steps going up to it from all sides (it was kind of a pointless feature and not that big either) and we were standing on it. He just kept kind of tagging along behind me. After the computer labs, we finished up at the same time so I followed him out. I couldn't remember how to get out of the building anyway, so just kept following him but then he went to the toilet. I went into the girls' toilet so it wouldn't look awkward, but there was some kind of problem so I just left.
