Drive north in my car on 24th St, to inspect the partially built houses on Rhode Island Ave. The houses are on south side of R.I. Ave., between 22nd and 24th Sts. One of the houses has walls built up only about 4 or 5 feet. Next, I seem to be on west sidewalk of 24th St., with my car parked on the street but facing wrong direction. Several cars pass, going in both directions. I meet a boy of about 14 years of age, evidently one of 2 brothers. His features are strongly remindful of the girl who sometimes gives the "Scotty" (black dog) an airing. I ask the boy something about the new houses on Rhode Island Ave. He becomes coy or shy, stands on one foot, with down-cast eyes, and says "They told you," referring to some words called out by a passing motorist.
