Last night I dreamt I was on Javier Prado Avenue; I was alone and was chased by several men, but I put up a good fight, though they caught me. They passed me underneath their legs and they wanted to stick a water hose in me. I was desperate and didn't know what to do. It was nighttime and there was nobody who could help me. The men looked like crooks. But that's all I remember; I don't know what happened later.
