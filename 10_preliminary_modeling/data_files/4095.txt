["Three Brides For Election"]  I am in a milling crowd of politicians up for election. I am one of them and am wearing a baize lacy tablecloth folded into a wrap around skirt. I look around to see that two other women candidates also have the same lacy tablecloths. One has two. One for the top and another for the skirt. Yet another woman has three of them. We look like brides, with a Spanish mantilla look. I am now the one with three tablecloths on. I pull off the one at the bottom of the skirt that is like a train. I modify the skirt as there is a gap showing. I reset the hooks closer so the gap is closed. It feels ridiculous to have us all looking the same.
