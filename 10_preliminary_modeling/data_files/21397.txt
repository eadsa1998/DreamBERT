I was fixing Grandma's plumbing. It was leaking. I was fixing it with wood pipe and faucets. They leaked, so I was going to the store. I was in the shop. I saw the boys reading the paper. I got hold of one and it was the 10th, an old one. Then I looked at another paper and I saw the results. I saw one horse $169. I can't recall the name now. It was a familiar name. I saw a movie where a man was floating thru the air. I told Andy P., "I fly like that in my sleep, but I can go in any direction. I wish like a bird."
