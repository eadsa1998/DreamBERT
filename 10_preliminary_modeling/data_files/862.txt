Claire K (a client) got engaged. She asked me if I was sad because she was engaged. I said, "Yes and no." Yes, because she'd now be busy with someone else all the time and no because it was good for her. She gave me a pair of glasses to give to her daughter, quick. Her daughter would get sick and cause earthquakes or something if she didn't have her glasses on. I went in to the counselor meeting. Lucy was playing pool and all the counselors from the community college were there in a meeting. I stepped in front of Lucy to put the glasses on her. She peered at me. I put them on her. She said, "Ah, you're Barb Sanders." The other counselors looked up at me (they were sitting), then she looked at all of them. "Now," she said, "You'll all have to say your names again so I'll know who you are." I saw Co-worker Tyler looking at me. I felt sad. I left the meeting. I felt like I'd lost my friends. I lamented to Claire, "I could have been in that meeting with them all night and enjoyed them, but I can't now. It's all gone." Then I called Andrea to discuss my concern about Claire. She patched our call in with  Susan G. Susan G disagreed with Andrea. She said, "No, there's too much dog," (counselor talk for dogma). Andrea gasped. She was wrong and couldn't believe it. I felt a kind of "gotcha" feeling. Then I was vigorously ironing a skirt with lots of wrinkles. A pleat (like in a skirt I made in Jr. High). I was doing a pretty good job but making a few more wrinkles with my somewhat sloppy vigorous ironing method. The hem was undone and unraveled (frazzled).
