I traveled to a resort hotel, maybe in Mexico with Bonnie and other woman friends. We are there to see a concert by some famous male singer. Bonnie keeps changing her elaborate costumes frequently. There are many stairs. Bonnie goes into a restroom. I step down the 2 stairs into it as Bonnie is saying maybe she can't manage the stairs. I see a line forming in the hall and realize if we don't get in line, we won't get in to see the concert. I say, let's get in line. I walk up flights of stairs wondering why I didn't take the elevator. Enselmo is around somewhere.
