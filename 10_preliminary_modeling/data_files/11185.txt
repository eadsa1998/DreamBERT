In this dream I was visiting my fellow at his home. His small brother has a guinea pig, Buzz, which he keeps in a cardboard box beneath the kitchen sink. The wastepaper basket sits beside it. I was clearing off the dinner table and kept throwing papers, etc. in the wastebasket. After I had it piled high, I realized I had thrown everything in on top of Buzz instead of in the wastebasket. I hurriedly took out the papers and found Buzz half dead. I revived him by tossing him in the air. I then put him back in his box and proceeded to throw the papers in on top. I dug him out, revived him and did the same thing again.
