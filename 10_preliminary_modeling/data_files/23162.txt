I was on a campus.  The details are fuzzy, but I was flying, tethered by a long blue ribbon or nylon cord.  When I landed, the cord attracted the attention of a number of people.  They didn't seem so much amazed by my flying as they did annoyed by my use of this cord, which apparently belonged to the college.  Bob Morris was passing by on his way to class, and I realized I was supposed to be in his class.  I ran to my previous classroom, where I had left not only my books but apparently also my shoes and maybe even my shirt.  I found the classroom, but another class was in session, and a woman outside refused to let me in the door, despite my pleas.
