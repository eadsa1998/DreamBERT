 I'm in an office building. I have a 2:00pm appointment with my grade school classmate Eric Stoner's mother, Shelly Stoner. My high school friend Holly Ball walks by. My high school friend Janice Appier is there. I know that my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper lives near Blooming Grove on Circle Highway. My high school basketball teammate Aaron Hadley is there. I am alone is a house. My parent's friends stop by. I escort them out. I look the doors and take care of the house. A discussion ensures about whether oral sex is sex.
