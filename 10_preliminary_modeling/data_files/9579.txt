At Christmas dinner: elaborate costume and food. Lots of people and Jonathan (friend of family). I see we have the same red cross-stitch blouse... but sad because no one bought John a present because he is poor. In Church: early, getting ready for Sunday evening service. Reynaldo runs around, friendly feeling, happy.
