We were out in the yard and plane came by. A lady was piloting it. I know her but can't recall her now. She was flying low, just skimming the roof tops. Then she came down and just touched the ground and went back up. Finally she came down and made a landing on the back end of the plan, which was flat with a lot of prongs or posts on the tail of the plane. There were a lot of children on the plane. When it finally settled down, it tipped and fell on its side. The pilot fell on the ground and was caught by the other children. We looked away and then at the plane again, and there was nothing there. The plane was gone. Ann and I stopped in a bakery. I looked at the delicious hard buns. We waited to get waited on and I looked at a wrap in some kind o f solution in a tub. I got a stick and picked it up and swished it. It was washed clean. Ann was making sandwiches and Judy said Carter was upstairs. I walked up and on the landing I met Carter. He was nude with a towel in his hand, going to the bathroom. When I met him, he was so startled, he stopped dead in his tracks and started to shake from the sudden surprise. Then he put his towel around his body and was nervously moving it around. I could see his penis. It was out as he talked to me.
