 I'm in Australia with a group of people. We hurry to get on a train that will take us to the plane that we're flying home on. I get on the train. Others squeeze in as we pull away. All 15 or 17 of us make it on the train. My classmate Allie Crater is among the people there. We ride the train and it seems to be like a roller coaster. I'm in the front, and I sit alone. We ride outdoors, away from the station. We seem to go in water, and it feels like I get splashed, but I don't get wet. It's like the log ride at the amusement park in Forkville.
