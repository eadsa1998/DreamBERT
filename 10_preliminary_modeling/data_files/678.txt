Neighbors from my hometown come back from Hawaii with a snake for me. It is a beautiful green snake and it looks like a boa I remember from a book on snakes, but this is called a strawberry snake. It is mildly poisonous. I am not afraid of snakes but after awhile this one starts making me uncomfortable and I give it to my son. He enjoys it for awhile. Then it bites me on my finger while I am in bed and I make him get rid of it. He shows me the receipt for the snake and food.
