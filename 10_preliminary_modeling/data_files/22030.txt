This dream took place at the university where I study. It was a familiar place for me. It wasn't a pleasant dream, because I saw myself in a fix. I went into a classroom where there were lots of people. It was my classroom, but the seats were in the wrong direction. I saw a nice girl that I know and asked her what they were doing. She told me they were taking a test. Then I went out in the corridor and found a friend from the 1st year and one from the 2nd year. The one from the first year (boy) was guarding a map of Peru that belonged to the university. The geography professor had asked him to do this. I don't know what happened, but since I was bugging everybody, I ended up tearing the map into two pieces, then I remembered it belonged to the professor and got scared because he is a very energetic and aggressive man. My friends' ages are the same as mine. Then I saw the professor of geography with a lady and they were going like on a picnic to a hill where the lady had constructed a geographical site of importance and quality and he praised her constantly. She knew that site very well. The surroundings were like the beginning of the mountains.
