[1997-07-24] That family next door, that had moved away, were back for another visit. Sally, the mother had come up to say hello to me. She greeted me with a kiss, I was very happy to see her, and she did tell me that they had repurchased the house next door as a second home. She began to discuss things. They had done quite a bit of traveling, something about how many miles they had covered, they had been as far south as Alabama and now they were going to return to where they lived now which was in Maine.
