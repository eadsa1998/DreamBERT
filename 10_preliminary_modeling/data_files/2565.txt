It's Halloween and I'm looking for something in the house to give so I won't have to go to the store and buy more. The rooms are long and full of furniture (see drawing). At least the kitchen has at least three sets of tables and chairs. The living room is spacious. I find containers of hard candy and taffy left over from a year ago and decide to use that, but I see some spots on a sheet of candy and wonder if its moldy and spoiled. I decide not to use it, just in case. I go to the door. The children come in, having been trick-or- treating. They have huge bags filled with candy. I think about asking if I can give it away to trick and treaters, but decide that wouldn't be fair. I see Jake babysitting the babies. He's working hard. I invite him to join us in the living room where there's more room and more fun. I see one of the tables in the kitchen area is gone and am glad to have more space. I have bags of old pretzels and cheese puffs to give to the trick and treaters, but they are small. I hope I have enough to go around so I won't have to go to the store and spend money and get more.
