I went shopping with my friend. He had to buy something for his girlfriend. And I had to buy a pair of black shoes and a pair of slim jims for my girl. We went to 2 stores which were located next to each other. My friend did all his shopping in one store and I did all of mine in the next. I asked the man for slim jims, but instead he brought out about ten plaid sport coats. Finally he brought out the right pair of slim jims. I paid him and left. When we got to the car, the store owner's dog was in it. The dog was talking to us, then it left. As I was preparing to drive off, my girl came. She had been playing tennis. She had on a pair of white bermudas, tennis shoes and a blouse.
