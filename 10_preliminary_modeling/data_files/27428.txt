I kept my lunch in one room and would pick it up after classes and take it to another room to eat. One morning there was a class still typing in the room where I ate my lunch. I went in anyway and sat in an empty part of the room. A boy that was in my class in high school came over and said something to me, but I don't remember what it was.
