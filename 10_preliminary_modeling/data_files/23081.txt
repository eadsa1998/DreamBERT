My wife Bonita and I, maybe Norman, their parents, my sister Nancy, and Nancy's boyfriend were all sleeping in sleeping bags on the floor in some house.  Most of us had had a couple of drinks, except the elder Lingermans, who were asleep.  Harold got up, though, and Nancy's boyfriend had just set half a drink down on the kitchen cabinet.  It was about 3 a.m.  I was afraid we would all get in trouble.
