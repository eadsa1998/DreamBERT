Something about the weather and involved a computer printout of something related. It was very hot, Matthew was home for a visit. I had all the windows open because I didn't want to turn the air conditioning on but I knew he probably preferred that I have it on. I was looking at this print out and thinking that the weather was going to change and/or the printout was wrong. I didn't think it was a big deal because I knew I could go to the computer and print out an updated or correct version.
