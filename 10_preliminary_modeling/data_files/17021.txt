I visit a rundown disused factory in an area that is neglected and falling down. It's an old industrial estate or a dockland. The building in front of me reminds me of Battersea Power Station in size and style of architecture. There's a wide rubble-strewn yard in front of it. There are old cranes that have been welded together to form some kind of sculpture or a kind of bridge or span.  It's not very elegant, but it looks like it took a lot of effort to do. One person (a female art student) did this apparently with some technical help over 3 years - some kind of art project. She explains it's not finished, but that she's been working on it gradually. Part of me is impressed with the sheer ambition and effort. But part of me is also unimpressed - conceptually and aesthetically it's rather meaningless and slapdash. "what a waste of time" I think.
