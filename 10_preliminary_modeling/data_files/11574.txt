I dreamed that I was coming downstairs in the fraternity house into the living room where I saw the photographer with his camera already set up. The hood and bellows of the camera were white, and formed a long streamlined-looking affair such as no other type of portrait apparatus I've ever seen. At this time I set about diligently to attempt to organize the men and assign them their times of sitting. Suddenly I was reminded of the time and realized that I was already late for some kind of a church group function at some other part of the city. I woke up in the throes of a great inner struggle to try to straighten out the muddled picture-taking situation while still not being any later in getting to the church program.
