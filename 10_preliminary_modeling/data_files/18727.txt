Kitty was running sideways on 3 legs. She was running along the curb on 42 St. She was scared and looked like she'd been hit by a car. Her hair was sticking up in different directions like she'd been side-swiped so close it buzzed her hair at sharp angles. In the women's locker room Eileen was showing us some books. Some were postage stamps of women from the Royal Family. Some were books of leaves in pictures in the beautifully designed squares of intricate, tender drawings of leaves. The pictures were still, but moving. The leaf would hesitate and then sway, as if to fall from the tree or open up majestically. In the locker room was the project on movement. One thing they showed was a baby hooked up to an I.V. of blood. The baby had unhooked itself, though it needed blood. The baby needed the blood from its mother, but the mother had AIDS, so getting the blood would be slow sure death. So the baby had unhooked its own arm from the I.V. and walked away. Disappeared. Eileen noted this and explained and passed around the leaf pictures. The big pictures were still. It was the tiny square insert of the leaf that moved and twirled on its own--even though frozen in still paper and not moving at all. ??? (ILLEGIBLE) It was almost time to start. Tom Brandon was there dancing. He had on a red plaid shirt. We ??? but it was almost ??? Me and Rudy were photographing strange shadows on the wall. Shadows of ladders that came from nowhere--went to nowhere. The major installation was waiting, and walls for this piece would show something else when we looked on. The art didn't look so good. I kept looking at the book, wondering how Eileen had made the still leaf turn. A band was loading up and playing roller blades.
