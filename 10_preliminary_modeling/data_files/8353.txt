I had to wear a floor-length black dress. It was kind of a sheer fabric with gold lame' design. I was at a party as either the host or playing some kind of major role there. There was someone that was very envious of the fact that I was wearing this dress. I don't know who it was that was envious. I have a feeling that it was Jennifer F. That would make sense to me that it was her. As I said you could see through the dress. On the gold lame was a t shape. The first one went across the chest. The next one was below that a little smaller. The next one below a little smaller. Then there were three more, the same size as the first three, below that. I was wearing something like a full-length black bra under it. Bev and I were talking about undergarments. I had said something to her about this one and how it made me feel more comfortable in a lot of different clothes and how it gave me a smoother line. Someone else chimed in and a little bit later when Bev and I were alone I told her I had one on under this dress so she could see what I was talking about. She could get a better understanding of what I was talking about.
