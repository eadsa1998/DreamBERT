I was talking to my friend MB, 22, at my house. He said something about his uncle getting a new British car for $8000. The next thing I know, I was outside heading for the car when I saw a little puppy who had been and was throwing up. I seemed to shake my head and say, too bad. I guess he's got distemper. I then proceeded to inspect this super streamlined car which was a convertible and was parked across the street.
