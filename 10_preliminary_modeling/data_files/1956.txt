A woman has been running from her mean husband. She is blindly feeling the walls as she goes down the street. She comes to a telephone booth. I join her and offer to help. We look up names of people/agencies that can help her. I decide we'd choose a time in the afternoon and go back to her apartment and get her personal things when her husband isn't around. Then my male friend and I can help her decorate her new apartment with her own possessions. I am in her apartment. The husband (like Cary Grant) harasses me. I write down info about the wife and he wants that info. I refuse to give it to him. He is angry and threatening.
