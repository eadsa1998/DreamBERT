Silas got moved to my health class, but not to my Phys Ed class. But in Phys Ed, he was there. He was asked to go get these two girl things (called Appley) and to see Max Schreck and Alfred Hitchcock (it was a different dream though). I told Evelyn that I wanted to go with him. He then asked if I could come with him. We went down, but he kept getting distracted. Calvin joined us, and then Calvin and I made it to this storage place. We found Silas and then Seamus came in. We didn't know what to get. Samantha and her 'clone' said they didn't know either.
