Lucy sits next to me at a restaurant, long table. She announces that she is naked under her blanket. She just didn't feel like wearing clothes. We are tasting food. The wife of the restaurant owner wants our opinion. I want to leave and go home. The "games" there are uncomfortable. First I'm going to shampoo my hair. I am in a room and a man watches. I use too much shampoo and spill it into a small container. Now Elizabeth Taylor is taking a bath. A man in a leather jacket comes in, opening 3 wallets with credit cards and money. He says, "This is what I offer. All you have to give is you." I'm a little disgusted and want Elizabeth to leave but she doesn't want to. So I leave. [BL]
