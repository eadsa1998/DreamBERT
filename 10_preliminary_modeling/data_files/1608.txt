I took a good bath and then I lay down in a "University" bathtub which belongs to Dickie. I am wearing blue jeans and no top. It is unnecessary to take the second bath. I then go to put some makeup on. I put on lipstick. I choose a necklace with little hearts on it. I think about one that has little birds and hearts and choose not to wear it. I put on eye shadow. It is thick and globby. I scrape some of it off.
