I am in a large building which is a composite of my residence and my office. There are many, many people here. This place is a beehive of activity. I am looking for something, but don't know what it is. In my search, I am going from room to room trying to locate that "something." While I am on my search I know that my family -- including Mary -- are in a car outside waiting for me. But I am preoccupied with trying to find what I'm looking for. I finally decide that I am not going to find what I seek and head for the car. I am too late. From a window in this building I see the car moving away, and everyone in the car is waving at me. Mary is wearing her white duck pants and gray poncho top. Even though I can't see her clearly, I know she is in the car. There is a great sense of loss and disappointment in me that I did not join them in the car sooner.
