It was night and I went out to move my car and I noticed when I got out of my car, another car pulled up and I knew they were after me. So I flew up and over their car. When I was flying along some high hedges, it dawned on me I was flying and a flying horse should come in. I went into the house and I tried to lock he door. It was like on 68 St. Then I tried it and it was still open. I pushed the button the other way, and still it was open. I pushed it shut and I noticed someone from the outside was forcing his way in. I held it back and yelled at Frank J. to get my shotgun. He was frightened and ran out. The crooks went to the other door, so I ran into the clothes closet and got my double barrel. It was a sawed off gun, to my surprise. I picked up two shells and put them into the gun. I noticed it was plugged up, but I opened the door and commanded them to beat it or I would blow their heads off. If they charged me, I would be out of luck for the gun would explode in my face. They walked off frightened and I was master of them. I came to a ghost town where everyone was a spook or dead person and alive again. One man jumped out of a window. He had tattooed arms and someone said, "Look how he floats thru the sky," and he really floated at leisure in any direction he wished. I worked my hands and legs and I flew up, a boy spook got on my back and asked me if I would take him to the show. I rode him and when I flew into the show, it was full of ghosts sitting in the auditorium. I saw my family sitting in an upper corner. I was afraid for them. I flew down front and I saw Grandma Evans slumped in a seat. Her head was down on the floor. She was bent forward. I raised her up and I noticed she was headless. I asked her if the ghosts cut off her head and she said they did and promised not to hurt any of my family. Grandma did that just to save my family. I sat and watched a show. I saw Sid Hamlet. He yelled and waved at me. He was a ghost also.
