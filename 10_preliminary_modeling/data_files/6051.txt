Last night's dream was quite unusual. I was at the place where I work, but none of the faces seemed the same. Everyone looked different except for me. I really felt like I did not fit in there, and everywhere I turned and everything I tried to do was different. It was as if I could not do anything right, and I didn't fit in anywhere. It was an awful feeling. I was wearing a dress and I had long, curly hair. The strangest thing about the dream was that every time I finished doing something, I found the same paperwork in front of me. It showed up in every room I went into. I could not escape from it. I wanted to scream. Every time I put the work away, it seemed to follow me. I could not complete anything the whole day. At the end, I was at my home with some man I guess was my husband. He said he had to talk to me. When I went into the room, he was holding the paperwork. It was [illegible].
