Thea Gill, Michelle Clunie and I were friends. We were on a train. There were people throwing stuff and we moved to the end carriage. I think people weren't happy with gays. There was a cartoon and you could watch it in colour, although it was made in black and white. Some people were trying to run from some witch person and they ran into a different motel room. The witch found them. I think they went to her 'lair'. It was science fiction looking. When they walked through the front entrance, they started walking across and platforms appeared as they stepped on them. This girl came in from another side and nothing appeared and she fell. The witch or whatever, sent a ship to save her.
