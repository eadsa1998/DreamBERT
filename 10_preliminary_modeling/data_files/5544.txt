One of my clients has fathered a child and the mother just had the baby. The baby is a few days old. The client wants to see the child so my driver and I pick him up and bring him over to where the baby is. He has to sign some papers. This has somehow happened again and so has happened 2 years in a row. He fathers a child, needs to be picked up and has to sign papers to be recognized as the child's father. In order for me to continue, now that my driver is somehow gone, and he needs to go home, we took a bus.
