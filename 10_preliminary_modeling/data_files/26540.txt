 I'm in a crew boat rowing with others. I'm at the back of the boat, so I can see everyone. We come very close to another boat and a dock, and may hit them. At some point the boat begins to go in the other direction, so I'm at the front of the boat. We back out of a place. We seem to have a captain who wants to go to a race of some sort or to get certified. We are all new rowers, and this seems premature. At some point I am urinating outside. I have trouble sitting straight in the boat, and I dangle my legs outside and try to get the position and stroke down.
