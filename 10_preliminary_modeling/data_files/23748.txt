I was in my family's house, but it was bigger, more rooms, wealthier, more decorated, older.  We knew it was going to burn down, and we had to decide what items to save.  I took some things out, can't remember now what.  I was standing outside and I realized that all of my and my family's possessions would be destroyed and gone forever.  This caused me great anxiety.  Then I was in another house.  I was older.  This house was three or more stories tall.  I and some people were touring it like it was a historic landmark.  It had been my childhood house.  I told people I used to live here as a child.  I went to the top floor, then out on the roof there were two more rooms up there alone.  They were separate, they were not another floor, they were two rooms on the roof.  They had many windows, like sun rooms, but the windows and the rooms were dirty with age, not clear.  I went inside these rooms. Inside I could still see all the windows, the dirty concrete floor of the roof of the house.  There were benches along the walls and old little child's chairs, other various items around, some play items.  I told people this is where my middle sister and I used to play together.  I remembered exactly how and what we used to play there, I could see us as children.  I got sentimental and wistful about my childhood.
