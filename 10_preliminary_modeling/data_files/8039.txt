I thought I was awake listening to a Christmas Video/recording on the TV. When I thought I was opening my eyes I would see an animated video corresponding to the holiday song that was playing. I realized that they weren't playing all of any of the songs- that it must have been a commercial of some sort. I thought it was odd that they were playing this on TV in the middle of the year. Then I realized that I had put it in before I went to sleep. I was too groggy to get up and turn it off. I thought that maybe that is why Christmas had shown up.
