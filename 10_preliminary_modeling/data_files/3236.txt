I am having a quarrel with someone. I decide to leave and walk. A fat, kind man like John Goodman says he'll drive me. I am angry and say, "No way, I'll walk." He says, "I can't let you do that." He's very big brother or protective. I walk, so he walks behind me. I turn and yell at him to leave me alone. I turn back and continue walking, but I can't help a tight smile because he's being so sweet. We walk in single file and now a large mosquito, only it's really a slim woman, tries to attack me. As long as I create a breeze with this card in my hand by waving it around, she stays just out of reach. She's persistent and I must constantly defend myself. I do so. She waits for me to tire out. Then John warns me a black fly is near. I get under the covers and cover everything around my face. Some other woman wasn't very protective and leaves me vulnerable to the fly attack (maybe my mother). John goes to get some rest. I continue to fend off the mosquito woman. I am tiring and she knows it. I am fencing with her with my blue card and once I move too slow and the card touches her for a moment and she smiles and says, "I have you now. Next time, you'll stick and then I can move in on you." I valiantly fight, but it's harder and harder. Now I have an electric fan that works and then a bigger one that doesn't work. The air stream goes too slow and in the wrong directions. I call to John to come help me. He does, then we continue on our journey. We come to a woman's house and she says we can work for her if we'd watch the Raiders (sports team). I say, "OK, sure," secretly so happy because we always love to watch the Raiders. John and another thin man step back and do a huge happy gesture, kissing the carpeted stairs. I smile at their cute antics and their happiness. We go in. The mosquito seems to be gone now.
