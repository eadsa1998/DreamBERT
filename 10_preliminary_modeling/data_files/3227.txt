I am somewhere, a house, perhaps. Dovre is there. A small third grade girl is there, maybe Paulina, and Ginny and cousin Abner. I am busy doing something, maybe trying to clean up. Xmas presents are in a pile and cousin Abner says one is on the floor and Paulina says, "Is it the ceramic cat?" I smile at her naive way she gave away the info of her gift to me. I say, "I don't know, I'll have to wait until Xmas and see. Paulina is making something and I say, "Hey, you're pretty good at arts and crafts." She smiles and suggests she use my Lessons 9 and 10. I smile at her clever way to get my arts and crafts stuff to use. I say, "We'll do something together later. Then I see Dovre is in a small room and blowing up a square plastic thing and I say, "What's that, a square globe of the world?" she shakes her head no. I say, "Then what?" She pulls out a handle on the side and puts it at her feet. "Oh, a hassock, I say, "are you opening your Xmas gifts early?" I ask. She shrugs and agrees. I say, "It's your gifts, but I sure wish you'd wait." She seems depressed and I say, "There are other ways you can beat this depression than opening your gifts early and being disappointed in them." I smile at her, implying that I as a counselor can give her good ways to lick the depression. Then I see a white cat, scrawny and ill, crawl up and lay down near me. Its left paw is unusual, almost like a cross between a hand and a turkey claw (or chicken claw). I say, "Hey, I think it's sick." I say to Paulina, "Let's get it some food." Abner comes by and I say, "We'll give it some food and send it on its way," knowing it'll probably stick near us if we feed it.
