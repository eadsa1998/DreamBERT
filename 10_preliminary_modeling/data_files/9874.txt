Marissa Camden at our house: I must go somewhere... to Church: Spanish Church: white stucco and bathed in a beautiful mauve light, quite unearthly: "Heavenly." I see Father Andrew performing the liturgy: magnificent. I also see Angie Steele (his sister-in-law) going up to him and kissing him on both cheeks. I hear her say: "I feel that you have a secret love-hate relationship that is tearing you apart." But Father Andrew continues with his liturgy: then I see many people bringing food, etc. Also see cats playing around. I meet Frank and family: much confusion; embarrassment; worry about long delay in getting back to Marissa: finally get home: Marissa on phone comforting a sick person....
