The setting was something similar to me working as a counselor. What happened was a friend or a camper's mother asked me to make some sort of handicraft like a chain. Something that you do while just sitting around, almost like a lanyard, but this wasn't a lanyard. It was something like this. I think what it was, was a variation due to the dream anyway. She seemed to be in a hurry as if it needed to be done within a matter of a short period, so I started it and then she came back and said, "Is this the way it's finished?" Something like this. I answered, "Yes." She says, "Well, I hope it better hold," meaning the last knot and I said, "Oh, it will." Then she hurriedly moved off. There was no action really in between starting this handicraft and when she came back and had it finished. The woman was the mother of this girl whom I know from camp and is a freshman at the University of Florida. I was talking to her this evening on the phone so my contact with her has been within the immediate future.
