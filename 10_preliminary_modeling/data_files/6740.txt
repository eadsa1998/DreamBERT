I was lying in a 3-sided cement , no roof, walled enclosure with my legs outside of it. J. was in a similar enclosure next. It was at the seashore. We heard a jet plane explode. He said, "The plane is falling in pieces." It didn't hit us. We must dress to go home. (There was a noise of construction near by.)
