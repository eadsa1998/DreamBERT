I was at home. A few days ago I found out that Ezra had been having the exact same dream that I had last year. He had written one down that sounded familiar and I was pretty shocked by it. Mom was around and we were all discussing it and I realized it was exactly the same. I was thinking 'how the hell am I supposed to talk about this' and I thought of sending something off to DreamResearch.
