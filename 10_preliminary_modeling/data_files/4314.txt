["Chopping up the salad veggies."] I am in a house. My mother is demonstrating cooking hamburgers like pancakes. She is doing a running commentary on her techniques. She is cooking many of them, like one would with pancakes for a large group. Aunt Millie is there as well. Perhaps this is a family reunion. I suddenly realize that I should have been working on my task which is cutting up the salad veggies. I find them on a cart and begin to chop the lettuce. Some others help me. I see corn on the cob as well. I am not paying much attention, and my mother tells me to watch what I'm doing. I had tossed a weird corn on the cob which only has the silk hairs all dried out on it. I take it out of the salad fixings and start to throw it away. My mother says no. If you poke a hole in the top kernel here it will express lactose. I am not impressed. Who wants lactose?
