Ezra and I went for a very long drive somewhere. Then I was at a school. Then it was a movie and a guy went there late one night to drop off an assignment. There was some security and they pointed to a teacher's window. He knocked and handed it in. Then it was day. A girl there that he kind of liked was going out with a mean guy who didn't like him. They told him they filled his car up with toilet paper, but he ordered them to take it out. Then I was at a shop. A guy said to me "do you like games?" and I waved him away. It was Michael Caine. He followed me to my car and a friend joined me. It was a red Mazda. There was stuff in it and I said it was probably planted and we drove off. The roads were weird. At one point, the other lane had big chips all over it. A billboard shot out onto a two lane road, but then it was only one lane. Noddy was on it. When I got home, I told Mom that she owed me a lot, "about $100" and she paid me $1 every time I said a certain word.
