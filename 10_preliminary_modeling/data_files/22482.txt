I was at home with my boyfriend and we decided to go for a drive in the car. We went through a very pretty highway filled with gardens on the sides and the hills were covered with grass. We decided to get off at a place where there was a river of crystalline water to rest. Several tiny rivulets came out of this river and they got lost in the scenery, among the trees and the rocks. I felt really happy to be alone with him in such a beautiful place. We were having lots of fun. We ran, we sang, we laughed, etc. Then we were back at home. I don't know how we got back, and we wanted to go to the movies. We went, but the picture was very boring and we got out and we went walking on the streets again. But since this time we didn't have the car, we got home very late and I was very scared, but all of them were asleep and they didn't realize at what time I got back.
