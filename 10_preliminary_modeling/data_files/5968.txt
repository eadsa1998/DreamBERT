I am a crew member aboard the Starship Enterprise featured in the television show, "Star Trek, the Next Generation." I am among a large group sitting around a circular table in the ship's bar/lounge enjoying themselves. One of the crew ("Riker") says, "We have to get back to work now." Everyone at the table, except the Captain ("Picard") and I, gets up and goes off together. Sitting alone with the Captain as he sips his drink, I say, "You know that I have to go with them." The Captain nods his head in an understanding way and says, "Yes, I know." I get up from the table and start backing off, still facing the Captain. Suddenly I am whizzing backwards across the floor at a great speed, as if pulled by some strange force. I speed in this manner out of the bar through a small corrider and into a room where the other crew members from the bar are standing. They are all startled by my entrance, and one of them ("Jordi") says, "He's being pulled by some mysterious force!" There is a set of elevators near the middle of the room, and I zoom directly into an open shaft and fall in. The other crew members are very concerned and look down the shaft to find some trace of me. "It's okay!", one of them exclaims. "His dog is still there!" Sure enough, at the bottom of the elevator shaft my pet dog (a small black terrier) wags his tail and barks to demonstrate that he has taken the fall and is fine. I, too, am fine and am hiding underneath the neighboring elevator. I laugh at the crew who were so worried about me and call up to them, "That was a good trick I played on you, huh?"
