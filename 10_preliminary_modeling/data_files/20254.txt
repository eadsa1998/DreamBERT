I was among some girls about 10 years old. I was tempted to touch them sexually. A plastic balloon shaped like a crotch was by me, and I felt it. I was dismayed because I had been tempted. I wanted to convince the doctors at the hospital where I was confined that I could control myself if they released me. I said to a doctor, "Is that why you won't let me go?" I pondered deeply on how I could rechannel my mental energy toward creative endeavors.
