I was in bed. It was morning. There were people in the house. I had forgotten that they were coming early this morning or I didn't think ahead about being prepared if they showed up before I had gotten up. I was sleeping in the nude and concerned that Rachel S might come up and climb in bed with me as she often does when she stays with me. I opened the drawer of my beside table. I thought I might be able to grab pajamas and put them on quickly. I couldn't find them. Normally they are on top of everything else in that drawer. Then I'm someplace else but still in bed and nude. I don't know where I am but there are a lot of other people around. Some man comes in. He is very short in stature and small framed. Some might describe him as mousy. He lies down on the bed and starts having a conversation with me. I pulled the sheet covering me tight around me and tucked it under my legs and such so there would be absolutely no way that he could look under the sheet. As we're talking he mentions a previous discussion we had. I said I normally don't wear anything to bed. He looked at me as if to say with his eyes, so I know you're naked under that sheet and I think I'll peek. I double-checked to make sure the sheet was secure around me.
