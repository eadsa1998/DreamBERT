I was trying to shut off my TV that I use everyday. I could feel the buttons, very distinctly, all push buttons, and the darn thing wouldn't shut off. I was alone in the room although I could hear my son's voice over in another room. The frustrating thing was I kept pushing the off button and the TV simply wouldn't shut off.
