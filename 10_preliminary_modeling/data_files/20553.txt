I was at a fence with Manhattan in the distance. I climbed over the spike points on the top, and I picked up something I had seen and climbed back outside. Then I saw men going inside and I pretended to be one of the group. A guard at the gate was suspicious, but he let me go in. A large bridge was nearby.
