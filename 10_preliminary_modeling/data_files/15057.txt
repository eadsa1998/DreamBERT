Sean Maher (it wasn't him, but it 'was') and I had become friends and were secretly dating. I kept sneaking off to make out with him. He was lying in this thing and I lay on top of him and we kissed. I told Nana he was going to make us food, but then it was something weird, so she made it. There was a 'chicken' with a big lump (like a loaf) of brown stuff, which was caused from it swelling up from the air, which happened sometimes. I left and went to this room and Sean put his arms around me and I put my hands on his back and we kissed (the 'holding' was quite vivid). I came back to my room later and the bed was messy and there were clothes on it as well as other stuff. I started to clean it up. Then Sean was Cory Monteith. He had to go back to America or whatever soon, but he wanted to stay. We were trying to work out how it would work and we eventually decided that he could to go some music thing at the start of semester 3. We celebrated. Mom had finished cleaning my bed. There was a list of hot guys and I remember seeing Aidan Gillen's name and there were love hearts on the i's.
