I had taken a job in Arizona at a place like the one I used to work at. I found the rules there very rigid. I was doing a hand stand and my supervisor came by and threatened to fire me for being too casual. Then I was walking down the hallway and I realized I was naked from the waist down. I panicked and asked one of my co-workers if there were any boxer shorts or hospital pants around. He said, "No we don't have anything like that here." I asked one of the kids if I could borrow a pair of shorts and he loaned me some.
