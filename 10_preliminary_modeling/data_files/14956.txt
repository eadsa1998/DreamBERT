I was at Nana's. Granny was still alive but she was in water? Nana took me home and some young guy was in the passenger seat. This older guy was driving and I was in my usual seat, behind the driver. Gold by Spandau Ballet came on and I was tapping to it. I got home and it was different. Some guy with a bag of ice shards was at the door and I walked past him.
