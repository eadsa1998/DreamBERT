I was working for an organization, helping them to get their office organized. Someone asked me about a pile of files. I mentioned someone else that I felt they should ask about the files as I was unsure what to do with them. There was something unusual about them. These files were somehow connected to Gary S and there was something very bad about the information that was in them. I mean bad in illegal, unethical, or harmful to someone or more than one person. Gary S was angry with me when he learned that I had find out about the files. He suggested I live in his apartment and he was going to move out. With some doubt, I agreed to move in once he had left. He had left all the furnishings and many of his personal things. I was surprised that he had left his personal things. If he was already angry with me for learning about the files, surely he realized this gave me easy and private access to even more information. I think he had paid to have someone killed and was trying to make sure no one ever knew.
