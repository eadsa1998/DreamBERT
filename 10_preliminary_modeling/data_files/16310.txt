I was at some kind of a religious convention with Sandra and Lee, and to do all these things, we had this like great big _______________ and ___________ in Eastport or something. And then we came home and everybody was home, and it was getting close to Easter and I was getting all these Easter presents. I got this ______ bunny that was supposed to hop around with a remote control, and a bunch of other Easter candy. And somehow I had the notion that I was on this really long trip and now I was home, and I was getting all this stuff. And I was playing this song that, "Ain't It Good to Be Back Home Again." And I think part of was maybe Mom was home, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek were all there. I can't remember any more. I'm getting bad about that lately.
