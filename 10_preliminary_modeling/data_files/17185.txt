I believe we were trying to hide this bear.  I started calling him Benny.  He and I were pretty close.  In escape route, Benny was found to be a very skilled driver while I held on behind him (like in a jeep).  We went to a park with a group of people and roller bladed.  I followed Benny down a little leafy path.  I hit a grassy patch and fell on my face. We grouped together for a picture- a lot of the relatives were there.  Ahead of us I watched an old home movie, someone on the porch of a house with a large grey dog.  As the dog moved it morphed into a man in a costume.  Then we got ready for the picture and it was hugging Aunt Fiona.  Tried to get everyone in the picture- family.  My paternal Grandma Fay was on the couch behind me, my mother's uncle Bert and his wife Loretta were on the other side of the camera, as was Ann (supposed to be Alice from the Brady Bunch).  Then Bert and Loretta's son Rick showed up and we wanted him in the picture too.  He took off his coat and my mother asked if he would eat fish (as if he were vegetarian).  I went to the back of the house, turned on the light and closed the door for my brother Stuart who was in the bathroom and I went to lie on my parents' bed with my father- he was curled up in his blue pajamas with the bedspread over him.  He was annoyed by the situation too.
