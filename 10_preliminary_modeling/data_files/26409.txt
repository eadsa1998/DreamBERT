 I'm boarding a Qantas flight for Australia. I'm in line in my kitchen at home. I grab a plate, cup, knife, and fork for the flight. I board the plane and find my seat. I sit next to the aisle of a section of three seats, on the side of the plane. Then my ticket says my seat is forward, so I move up to the second row, behind the cockpit. There are only two seats on this side, and they're bigger. I'm happy to have a larger seat for the long flight. I can see the pilot, the windows, and out the front of the plane. Someone tells me this isn't my seat, and I must move back a few rows. I then see my seat is in the middle of the middle section of seats: the one place where I was hoping it wouldn't be because I can't move due to lack of leg room.
