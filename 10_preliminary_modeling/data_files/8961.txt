I'm visiting Tony S and Dorothy S. I'm sitting up in bed. I have the sheet pulled up over my chest but tucked under my arms. Tony S comes in to see me. We both seem genuinely happy to see each other, and he leans over to give me a hug. We talk briefly and then Dorothy S walks up. Again, we both seem genuinely happy to see each other and she bends over to hug me. Now we're at their house and we're talking about Tara S. She isn't there right now, but her husband is. He's quite a bit taller than Tony S with a medium build and dark hair. He's an average looking man. I say something to Tony S and Dorothy S about him seeming like a very nice man. They agreed that he is as he and Tony S left the house. It must have been Dorothy S who said to me that they are very pleased to have him as a son-in-law. They had both taken one of my tests and I was grading it. I thought I should double-check my grading to make sure that it was correct. They would certainly point it out to me if I had made a mistake. Tina S and Toni S are at the house but they are little girls. They are both toddlers and appear to be very close in age, which is not the case in waking life. When I got ready to leave, it was just the two little girls in the room where the door was. I told him that I needed to leave. There was something about making sure that they stayed in the house and didn't follow me outside when I left.
