I was at school and there was this 'boys' area. Calvin pushed me into it. Almost everyone had their shirts off and I was trying to get out and Elijah and Dmitri saw me. Elijah freaked out. It was caught on camera and people were laughing at Elijah. Then I was in S+E and the teacher moved Calvin away from me. There was someone called Dagmar March.
