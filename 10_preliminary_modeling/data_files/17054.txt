I was in the Mafia or just someone wanted by the Mafia. I was in a hotel room and there were two Mafioso guards standing at the inside of the door protecting me. The door was really weak, similar to a train overnight compartment door. It wasn't safe for me to sleep there for the night, so I snuck out of the room and building. At that time, the Mafia members trying to kill me busted in the room I was in. They saw I was gone so they started looking for me everywhere. Outside, I was met by my backpacking friends. Outside of the hotel, there was a ravine and everything was jungle-like. The location of the hotel looked like where the psychology building is, and the ravine looked similar to the area where the dorms are. We started hiking, looking for a place we could hide for the night. On the inside edge of the ravine, we built a jungle-like fort that was camouflaged. After we hung out for a while, we decided it wasn't safe enough, so we left. We walked outside of the small jungle, and crossed the road that brought us onto a huge golf course, much like the one I used to live near. We walked onto the middle of it. When we got there, the Mafia men had just found our fort in the jungle, and they knew they were on the right trail. In the middle of the golf course, we ran into Michael Jackson. We felt that he would be a good distraction, so we sent him towards the jungle and hotel building. Then we ran to the edge of the golf course and backtracked towards the jungle to watch.
