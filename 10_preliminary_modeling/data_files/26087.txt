 I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson, the priest from the movie Black Robe, and others. We're in a canoe. I'm fishing. The line on my reel gets tangled. I take off the spool from the reel, untangle the line, and then cast. I didn't reattach the spool to the reel so the spool is cast out into the water with the line! I quickly start reeling in line to recover the spool. [Note: This is impossible. The spool needs to be on the reel to recover line] People come swimming up to our canoe. There are four women among them, including my high school classmate Josie Heck and my roommate's ex-girlfriend Brandy Roberts. They sit on the front of the canoe next to me. One of them says I smell bad. I think that she means my breath is bad, but then realize she means my body odor. Kevin and I laugh at her disgust. They jump off the side of the canoe. Kevin and I are on land. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, wearing a skirt. We talk. Music starts playing. Melanie says she wants to be like Kevin and I: free. I tell her we all have to jump around to the music. We do this and laugh. I fall over, dizzy, and laugh. We are in a long, fenced-in area. A dog and a horse run by. My roommate Stephen Ramos says loudly that I should put my penis in Melanie's butt. Melanie almost hears this, but I don't think she does. I don't want her to hear.
