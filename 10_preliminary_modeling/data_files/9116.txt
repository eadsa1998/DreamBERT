Matthew was supposed to come home and go with me to see a movie or play. I can't figure out from the images which it is. He find out he wasn't going to be able to come. Before he told me he tracked down one of my friends from high school and invited her and her son to come and go with me and he would provide the tickets. Just minutes after he told that he wasn't going to be able to come, Dorothea D and Alex D showed up. Alex D was still a boy, maybe twelve years old. I was very happy to see her. She told me what Matthew did. The movie or play we were going to see was something like The Christmas Carol. Rumor had it that the way it was presented made it somewhat scary to the audience. If it was a play it was because of the way the scary characters moved through the audience. If it was a movie it was because they had a technique to project the scary characters to look as though they were floating through the audience. There is an image of a character that appears to be covered in a very large white sheet and has very large black oval holes for eyes. It didn't look like there was a person in it at all but it did give the appearance of being alive.I looked into the area where the audience sits and saw there was another show in progress but very few people in the audience. One row of seats was full and there were just a few people sitting here and there throughout the rest of the theater.
