This nasty teacher made the class line up. I started singing 'Love Me Tender' under my breath and then Calvin joined in, and then the whole class. I was then at some place running around trying to get away from this black kid in a wheelchair. I went into this news agency earlier, and the kid was there. He followed me to the deli and by mistake, a strip club. He didn't need a wheelchair though [he was like Andy from Little Britain]. There was some magician guy on the stage. I went into Green Day's dressing room, then I was some boy, who had stayed there for a week, but it had been two years.
