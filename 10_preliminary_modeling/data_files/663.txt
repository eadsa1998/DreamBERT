I'm at work but it is more like a high school classroom. I am called into the hall and am talking to someone when I see my old boyfriend, from high school days, and another man. I say I didn't see you. He said he has been there. There is something about needing to write an assignment on the Eisenhower era. It is late and the building is closed and I can't get the names of people in a band that has something to do with the story. There are three men involved. Then I go to another classroom and find someone who give me the names. After that I go to a party and my boyfriend is not there but it seems I have gone with him to this party. Some teacher who is like my editor wants more information on the story about the Eisenhower era. I am not talking directly to him about it but I am telling some woman that I was so tired I didn't get to do as much as I should and I was anxious to get to the party. There was a lot more detail but I can't remember it.
