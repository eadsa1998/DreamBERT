I woke up and Gizmo was on top of me. I rolled over and something vibrated. It was my hot water bottle. I threw it out of the bed and wondered why they vibrated. Later I was getting my Dream book ready for publishing, with the correct formatting etc [Note: I was on Lulu last night]. Some of the formatting didn't match up properly. I had big headphones that were really soft and comfortable. I put them on and they were really tight fitting, and 'clapped' right over my ears. I thought it was cool that I could listen to music more often. I was reading about Grey's Anatomy. Some lady said that someone on it needed eye surgery because she had googly eyes, but it was a set up. Izzie (Grey's Anatomy) worked on the surgery but then she was George (Grey's Anatomy). I was then outside undercover. I was sitting at a bench with Calvin and Liesl. I asked Calvin if he got to do his exam and said that we did but didn't get a timetable. I asked if "she" did exams and he said 'no why?', then I can't read what it says. I saw Evelyn not far away and we tried not to laugh and I told him about this book (?) which was now a game and I said it used two random pictures and said whether they were good together or not and Evelyn got Darius. Then I saw Eugene there. He was near Evelyn and was looking for something.
