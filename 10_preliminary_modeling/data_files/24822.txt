I was skiing alone at Badger Pass in Yosemite and everyone just disappeared, no one was there. I was alone and I felt lost, I got scared cause it started snowing, then a blizzard came and I started making a dome out of snow to keep me warm, but it didn't work. A big wind came and I felt my toes freezing (and then I woke up with a big jerk and I was sweating). Setting: In the cold snow, Badger Pass ski slopes in Yosemite. Characters: Only me, alone. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, cold. It was a very frightening dream, it was almost a death dream, trying to tell me my fate or something. My science teacher taught us how to make an Ice Dome, and in my dream it didn't work, which was terrible. And I totally woke up sweating!
