We took the kittens to the pet shop. Mom was there. We went somewhere else for a second and then when we came back the lady said all the kittens were fine. Then we also had a pig, which was sometimes a dog. She said it was pregnant with lots of males. Then it was a place to test for something like powers. This black girl had a necklace like the one in The Blob [I watched that part last night] and she was on a date with this guy when the blob attacked her. She was all stretched out and torn apart but she was alive and had lost the necklace.
