I am walking and trying to find L College. I see railroad tracks and am undecided which way to go to get there more efficiently. I choose a street and see a big steep bike cement path that goes down a steep embankment and back up the other side over the tracks (like the street at the M City house). I wonder if I'll slip and fall, it is so steep, but I manage it. I see a domed building in the distance and recognize it as one of the L College buildings. I walk in that direction and find the administration building with a ramp and stairs and I can't decide at first which one to walk up. I go up the ramp and then some stairs. I want to sign up for more classes. Now I go to the M City House and want to take a bath, I am very tired. I had wondered how I managed to walk so far. I go into a room that has a tiny bathtub like a sink and try to fill it with hot water. I have trouble doing it, it gets too full, the water is cool and sticky. I release the plug and it goes out too quickly and I try again. Millie is there, sort of helping. I look out the sliding pocket door and see a crowd of people at the S's house and a policeman. I wonder what the commotion is all about. I see Jake's pickup and all four tires are flat and it is jacked up. Vandals, perhaps. My father is around. I go back in the bathroom and shut the door. I am aware a man is attracted to me and he stands just outside the door playing music for me. I see his eye as he peaks into a corner of the door. I try to shut it more. I wonder how I'm going to fit in the tub. I fill it to nearly overflowing.
