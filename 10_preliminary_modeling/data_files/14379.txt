I was in a classroom, on the left side near the front, and in front of Brent and Ishaan. They were talking and then Ishaan called out to me. They asked if I'd be happy with flowers as a present (as in, would females like it). I said "Well, I wouldn't', because I'd like something useful," and they asked 'like what?'. I said "a DVD or a new computer..." and Brent asked "what kind of DVD?" and I said science fiction (and the like) and then Brent said "You're pretty cool". Later, Classmate-F-03 came in and she and Brent were quite touchy-feely. They had drawn some pictures. The teacher was called Mr Drive or something. The class ended and it was a long way to get to the bus. There was a small building and we had to climb through this hole to get to the bus. I had my shoes off and so put them on. Brent was not too far back in the line away from me. I went through the hole and Ms Pascal was there. She wouldn't let us out the quick way. I was then at school and Calvin was there. He was doing chemistry and he got 88% on a test. His wrong answers were the same ones that I got wrong, but we had different answers (I thought he had copied me at first). Then I was somewhere and GTA 3 was on the TV and Ezra was with me. I remembered playing it years ago. Also, there was this game that I played where you walk into this room and there were two doors on the left and then I noticed this black latch in the right corner of the front wall. Then a third door appeared and I laughed, remembering that Darren had said "shadow behind the third door", except I thought he said something else rather than shadow. In the game, you got a rare 'fire' animal or something. [The night before I was talking about dreams with Darren and he said "watch out for the shadow behind the third door" or something, to see if it would influence my dream].
