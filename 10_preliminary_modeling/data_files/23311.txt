Someone gave me an induction coil and I bent my energies toward amusing a large company with it. I wanted to make the spark set off a charge of powder, which with absolute want of foresight, I put inside the coil. Then I considered that the explosion would kill us all and what seemed still more undesirable, would ruin the pretty machine. I puzzled over the difficulty for some time, but I believe I did not find any way to carry out my experiment.
