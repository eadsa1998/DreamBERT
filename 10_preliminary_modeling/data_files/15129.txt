Mom had an email from some job thing at a call center. There were photos of people who worked there and it was nearby so I was looking at school photos to see if I could find Eugene. I found one with Rebekah, and Rodney was in it, so I took it. Ezra got a job at the Science Museum as security or something. I decided to apply for a job there too. Then it was morning and I was getting ready for university, but I was late. Dad and Ezra were there. I was eating breakfast and then put on a caterpillar costume and Ezra and I went with Nana and Rover to the Science Museum. While we were queuing up, Ezra pushed me. A guy said he would interview tomorrow and then I suddenly remembered I had to get to university.
