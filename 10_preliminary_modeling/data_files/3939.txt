["Saving the Baby"]  A small baby boy is nearly comatose. I hold him, rock him and play with him for hours at a time. My total focus is on helping this baby become animated and well. I am in a bathtub filled with water. I scoop up water into a plastic sack and hold him with the sack between us so he gets this warm massage kind of feeling. He laughs and likes it. Slowly, he comes out of the comatose state and we enjoy the day. He is always with me and I am always helping him. I love it. It feels wonderful.
