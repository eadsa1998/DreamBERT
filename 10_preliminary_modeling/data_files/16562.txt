I was taking a class at Modern Media College, actually I was taking a test in a class, and the instructor was pretty friendly, but the test was about a bunch of confusing data and numbers that I really didn't know about. And they were like at work stations, and each of us had a computer and a CC TV, believe it or not. And we really didn't need the computer for the test, and everybody was using their CC TV. And it was this like third of a sheet of paper that had like the answer things that you bubble in and then a full sheet of paper with the questions. And it was stuff about matching up numbers and letters and like, "Mode E has 115 different things and Mode Z has 40 different things," and just stuff like that. And I think this is kind of a reflection of mini messages, but mini messages are a little more specific than that. This was just crazy stuff being thrown around. And so I did as best as I could, and some of it was even being explained to us as we were taking it, and I remember leaving the work station and going to the middle of the room and sitting down at a big roll-top desk and writing, like for some reason. I don't know what I was writing. Then I would go back and do some more of the test. And somehow that jumped to another little scene when I was done with the test. I didn't know if I was getting married or graduating or if I was just having a birthday, but I was getting these presents in my mailbox, like one person gave me a talking teddy bear with a heart. Another person gave me a little stuffed peacock that you like clip onto something. And about that time I woke up.
