Well, me and a whole bunch of teenagers were in a circle at a park in the City. We were hangin' out, playin' football and, weird enough, smoking weed. I only took one or two puffs but it was crazy. I knew two people there. They were close friends but not my age: 17-18. Setting: In a park in the city of San Francisco. Characters: I knew some skater guys and two close friends of mine named Lily and Aaron were there. Otherwise there was just a bunch of teenagers. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. I was happy to be there and to be hanging out, but I was worried Lily would get mad at me for smoking weed.
