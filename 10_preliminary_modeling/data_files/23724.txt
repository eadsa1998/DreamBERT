I was at Jeff's parents' house.  Drawing, or designing a small poster.  It felt like when I used to make cassette tape playlist covers.  I was drawing a tiger, and running across / below the tiger was a broad torn-edge area, with tiger stripes which I was drawing with a wide black marker across thin cut strips of white paper.  It was beautiful.  I was making it carefully, deliberately, I could see each black line and the strips of paper, I was getting intent about it.  Jeff's Mom was handing me the markers and art supplies I think.
