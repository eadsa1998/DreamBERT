Ezra and I were waiting in the car for Mom at a shop. I thought I saw Jeremiah in the car park and went to check and to ask Mom how long she'd be. I was then teleported to a dungeon and unlocked a music track on Runescape and I had to kill a blue dragon, but it was only level 72 or something. Then I left and Mom still wasn't out and it had been over an hour. Bradley was also talking and laughing with someone and kept looking at me and I thought he liked me. I was also thinking that his new haircut was really hot.
