I get a girl to come on to my friend Andrew. We throw them on the trunk of a car and take off. We being me and some of her girlfriends who think it would be funny. We tell Andrew she is all hot for him, and he makes his move. He gets confident, cocky in his advances, and eventually they kiss as the car races through town. He touches her leg, her breast, and they kiss. Andrew humps her lips with his face. I grimace, and yell, "you're doing it all wrong! That's disturbing, and disgusting and embarrassing!" There's his camera on the seat. I start taking pictures through the back seat glass. The car goes over a bump, and Andrew is thrown off. We lost him. I say to go back to look for him, but fear he's died. At least he died doing something he's never done before.
