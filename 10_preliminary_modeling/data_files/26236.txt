 I'm in a vehicle with a young woman my age and a male professor. The professor is driving the vehicle, which may be his. The woman needs to go to the airport. The professor says maybe I could take his car and drive her to the airport. We could take Circle Highway. Traffic would be normal workday traffic, but that would be okay. I'm in the vehicle with the woman. It seems to be a jeep. She is in the passenger seat. I'm standing in the legroom area of the passenger seat facing her. I thought she was driving. We're now in a situation where we're very close and facing each other, and there is a sexual feeling. I'm in the driver's seat then. I back out of the parking space with a boat attached to the vehicle, which is risky because I almost hit the neighboring cars. The vehicle is a stick shift. I pull out of the parking lot recklessly. I may be driving my housemate Jack Thigpen's Isuzu Trooper.
