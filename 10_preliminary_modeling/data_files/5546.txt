[1997-05-10] We were traveling to NY and we were getting off of a plane and instead of being that usual flat thing, we had to go down this funny metal thing and it was like a metal, inclined plane and it was very narrow from left to right, somehow I reached down to touch it and it was like a slide for emergency exits but it wasn't an emergency and when I touched it with my right hand, when I stooped down, to clamber kind of, forward, off of it there were like little grooves in it. I knew there wasn't going to be enough room on it for Betty, my guide dog, so she had to follow behind me, but she did. Then we were getting to our hotel, and my suitcase was really heavy and someone helped me carry it and then I had this broken tooth, one of my molars, I could feel it with my tongue, my tooth was like all coming off of the bottom of my gum, I could pick it up and it was only attached on one end, but it wasn't hurting or anything. Then there was this console in front of us with 4 switches on it. You turn them to the right and you can hear people talking about different things. They were all talking about businesses and you had to decide whether their business was solvable or soluble or worth getting involved in. And I said to one of them, "no that's just not going to work", it was somehow connected with the Idaho Counsel of the Blind. There were people there from other states and they were talking about their businesses and we said, "no that's not going to work". Each switch represented one person's business and we listened to the one on the left and then the next one and then the next and somehow my father was there and we were eating and the rest is too vague.
