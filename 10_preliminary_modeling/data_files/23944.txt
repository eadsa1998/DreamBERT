I met up with Wendy. She was all weirded out. She would talk in a strange way, very tense and hateful. I knew she had become evil but I didn't realize how much until I found out she had a sort of following. One of them was this big guy. They were after me and were trying to kill me. I made a narrow escape. [Wendy = a bestfriend from highschool i lost touch with]
