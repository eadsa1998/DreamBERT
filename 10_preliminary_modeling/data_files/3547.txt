I am talking to a man about how crazy making it is to work in crowded conditions. I tell him about registration at the community college and how each year it got more crowded. I see Tyler telling Charlene one of his stories and smile because I know she has heard it many times. I wonder if she will just stoically listen or what. She finally interrupts him and says she has heard it before. She leaves and he smiles sheepishly. Now the man comes into my bedroom. I think I am rooming in his house. His son is upstairs. He is a quad and the man is crying as he tells me that today the assistant can't come today and he will have to be left alone. I offer to call in sick at work and stay to help him, but it would mean moving him downstairs and I couldn't transfer him. The man is grateful. [BL]
