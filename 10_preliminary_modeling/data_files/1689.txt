I am going to go to town. I notice we are approaching wet ground and I am somewhat concerned we don't slide into the ocean. We turn parallel to the shallow water and start to go through an archway. I then see the real ocean and a huge brown wave surging through the door. We back up hurriedly so as not to be drowned. Later, we go through the doorway, looking carefully for more waves.
