I wanted information about a planned trip to India. My guide was told first turn to right after ____ . We started up the stairs. Found I was carrying a green figured sofa pillow. "What do I want of this?" I threw it over the banisters down a flight. Will get it on return. He threw his over too. On 3rd floor were many offices unlabeled. I went back and forth when a woman in an office called to me, "I think I'm the one you want to see. Wasn't it you Mrs. Craw. called about?" I hesitantly said no but entered and sat on edge of her couch. She said I must have a chair and a man started to move a large heavy chair, then opened a camp chair for me. I told her I wanted to go to India but there was so much red tape about entering or leaving. She said to go ahead just as if everything was easy.
