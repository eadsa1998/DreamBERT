It was Good Friday. I was in church with a young fellow who works in the same store that I do. We were supposed to make his girlfriend jealous. In front of me I noticed my girlfriend Mary. She said she was married. Her husband turned out to be a man much older than she was with a bald head showing through his thin hair. He also had a mustache. I was shocked she would marry such a person. I started to go up the aisle in order to kiss the cross. I noticed that I was carrying something in my hand. It was a bottle of cologne. The cologne was very yellow. When I came back, I saw my other girl friend. I looked for a fellow from school that I knew, but I couldn't find him. There was also a fellow that I had known two years ago. He was someone I had liked. I was supposed to go to a party he was giving after church. I felt how inappropriate a party was on Good Friday. I felt guilty that I should plan to go.
