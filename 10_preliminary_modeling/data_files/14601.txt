I was at the train station. The next train was in ten minutes. There were buses which went downtown. There was a bus that looked like it was the 98, but then it was 96. I asked the driver (an oldish lady) and she said it was the 98. The bus had heaps of old people on it. I tagged on and I sat at the front. I can't remember properly, but there was a crash over this hill. There were two buses and some cars. We were out and I was trying to slow cars coming down the hill, there was a huge line of them. Some of the crash vehicles looked like they were going to explode, so someone said to take this other bus and find help. This other guy got in to drive. This other guy and I raced to get there first. There were people on the bus and I got on and saw there was blood on the seat. Everyone on the bus and blood on their heads and were dead. I picked up a hammer and I thought the guy who came on with me had done it. I hit him and chucked him off the bus. Then I realized it was the guy driving and I hit him but he didn't fall and I kept hitting him but he just seemed drowsy. I don't know what happened. Later, I found a rubber finger in my room and I asked Ezra "What the flip is this?".
