["Traveling on the different side of the road."] I am getting into a car. I can't decide where the safest place to sit in the back is. I see three wooden chest drawers where the trunk ought to be. I slide one out and decide this could fall out with me in it. So I get in the rumble seat, open convertible seat. No back there. But then there is a back, so I stay there. I am with some other women. I had packed some things. Now the car is a open convertible black limo and I am in the back seat hanging onto the top of a black derby hat the driver is wearing. We are driving down the streets of London England. The buildings are high skyscrapers. There are many shelves filled with wares to buy along the front of the buildings. I am swiveling my head back and forth to try and see everything. I might want something to buy. A street hawker runs with us yelling "water." Over and over. I see a paper in his hand with my name "Barbara" written on it. I smile as it is obvious he got the info off my license plate and is marketing to me. I say I already have enough water. He then changes his call to "California water for sale" and runs to another car. He calls the driver "Mayor" and I think that odd that he'd mistake the driver for the mayor. There is an odd extra strap of material on the top of the hat I can slide my hand into for more secure hold. One object I saw on the shelves was a beautiful rose pink glass bowl.
