Mom was telling Ezra and I stories. She was telling Ezra something and I heard "Grabbage". I asked her to repeat it because it was a teacher I had before (I was thinking about Mr Grabski). I told her and she was embarrassed (she'd had sex with him). I went to Plainfield. I had been there before and there were heaps of people from Brookland in the hall. I remember seeing Daryl and Dmitri. I met with some people outside. We had to go in groups and do sport things. I didn't have some $1000 contract that would allow me to participate. I told the leader teacher, who was Mr Grabski. I text Calvin to see if he remembered him. Calvin ended up at my house looking for something later. We had to put our bags in these lockers. Calvin went off in some group. Tiana went with me. I was going through a yearbook from 2004. Parvati and Eliska were there. The music video for Od-na came on and I said "I love this song!". Tiana went for a drive, then she came back. I then ended up lost somewhere with Dmitri and 'Mr Simon Grabbage'. I was following them. Then it was Runescape like, and I died somehow. I asked some random to get my stuff and then I text Dmitri. I was in some snowy place with 'Jupiter rocks'.
