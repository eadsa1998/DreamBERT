The dream starts in the basement of our fraternity house where most everyone in the house is gathered. I see that someone has discovered a wine cellar in one corner of the basement and there are bottles and bottles of champagne all over the room. Then the scene switches and I am arguing furiously with someone I didn't know who wanted to break all the bottles. The dream ended with hundreds of bottles all over the basement and everyone drinking and laughing.
