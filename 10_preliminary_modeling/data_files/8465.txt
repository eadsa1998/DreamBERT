Matthew and I were on Trading Spaces. We were working with Edward. The color paint we were using on the wall was the same color we used in his room recently. We were doing a similar kind of paint treatment but it turned out a lot better in the dream. Edward was getting upset with me because I kept sleeping instead of working. At the end, when we finally got the room done, I think it was after the reveal, I went up to Edward and gave him a hug. I thanked him for all of his efforts and apologized for my sleeping so much. I told him that I had not been feeling well and didn't feel that I could help it. He was then very sympathetic and said he didn't realize that I hadn't been feeling well. He said he was sorry that I hadn't been feeling well and that he was glad that I was able to do as much as I did. Everything seemed okay between us then.
