I was carrying Judy thru the countryside thru high weeds. I was thinking what if I ran across a bear. What would I do? All at once I looked ahead and I saw two small bears. This frightened me because I knew the mother was near. I started back for home. It was night. When I got home, I thought of closing the door and when I went for the front door, I saw one of the cubs in front of the storm door. I closed the door and I looked thru the small window on the door and I saw the cub on his haunches looking at me. Then the mother bear came by the door and said, "Let us in," and I said, "Would it be alright if I gave you food outside?" but the mother bear said, "We will get in." The bear was actually talking. I told Bob, "Get your shotgun loaded." I was in a building and when a fellow came to see us, I took him thru the rooms, which were being built. He looked them over as I explained different things. It was sort of inspecting. I got a letter from White's Sewing Machine to come to work to a good, easy job paying my regular wages. When I was to go down, I met someone and I was told I would be asked if I was 42 years old, the job was mine, and I had to admit that I was 42 or I was dropped. I thought what a racket. I went down to White's and when I got to the office there was a truck there. Joe Grabar, the boss, was helping to unload it. The fellow with the dirty hat looked like an undertaker. I came closer and I was eating a potato with a peeling on it. One fellow came up to me and I knew him from White's. He asked for a bite. I gave him a big bite of the potato and then another fellow came over and he also got a big bite of the potato. I was picking up money, dimes, quarters and half dollars from the floor between the people's feet who were dropping them accidentally.
