I got some postage stickers and tried to make a broken object stick in place, but it wouldn't hold. Joe Lasko was the one that had the trouble. I was working the woodwork and was watching one of the old timers sand a chair. At lunchtime I went into #5 building. It used to be that stock room and there were windows on the northwest side of the building now which there were none when I worked there before because there was an annex to the building and there couldn't be any windows there.
