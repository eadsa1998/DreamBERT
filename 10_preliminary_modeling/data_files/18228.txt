I was in this dime store looking around and perhaps buy something, but at any rate I was looking around. I was looking at pocketbooks and seeing if they had any I liked. I did see one that I liked fairly well, but I didn't have my pocket book with me. So there was this big woman, utterly, utterly different from me in every way, who also thought this was a lovely pocketbook. I thought this was sort of a collegiate pocketbook. It was leather and madras or something, but she thought it was the perfect pocketbook for her to go to church with and such like things. I think, as a matter of fact, that this pocketbook sort of changed its nature. It was more of a patent leather thing. But at any rate, I was afraid she would get it and I was trying to see if it had any serial number or anything on it so maybe they could get another one for me if I wanted it. I was just wandering around the dime store and looking at some potted plants. By this time my husband came in from somewhere. We were going to buy some and I don't know why because this is something we would never buy, but we couldn't pay the price that they were asking for these plants and I forget even what kind they were. Probably in my dream I really didn't know either. Now that I think of it, the leaves of one of these plants looked like chrysanthemum leaves. The other plant looked more like this philodendron. So I went carefully, more or less carefully, not to damage the plants, and also to find some good leaves, picked off 3 leaves, 2 of the chrysanthemum type and one of the philodendron, and took them to the store manager and he was going to root them for us. And if it worked, we were going to pay a certain amount, and if it didn't work, then we didn't have to pay anything for them.
