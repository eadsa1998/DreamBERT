I'm at a tennis club. It's deserted apart from 3 or 4 of us, including my mother and my friend Tim. We take turns to sit out while the other 2 play. The court has no fence around it, and we spend most of the time looking for lost balls in the surrounding undergrowth. It's very overgrown around the court, and slopes up and away from the club house and what was once a terraced garden. When I play, I cannot hit the ball and keep it in the court. Most of my opponents shots also go out. It's a frustrating process and we lose a lot of balls.
