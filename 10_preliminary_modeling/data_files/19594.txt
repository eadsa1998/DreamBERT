Only 2 fragments remembered: 1) A few people, identities unknown, were arranging or examining a file of books belonging to Hall. One of them had a black fly leaf whose lower right hand margin had been chewed by mice, the teeth marks being distinct. It occurs to me that the book must have been left open (probably connected with my having left open "Swiss Family Robinson" the previous evening, to air out some of the medicinal odor).
