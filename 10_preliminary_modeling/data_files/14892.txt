It was my birthday. Mom was giving me money, but not yet. Darren was going to the shop to buy stuff for cheese and onion pie. Raquel gave me a bag of stuff and I said "this is the most exciting thing I've gotten all day". There was something about jumping off something into the ocean. When I was younger, a heap of others and I had done this, jumping from rocks. Some kid had hit the rock. There was a photo of him and he was like 30-40 now. I saw him somewhere and wanted to meet up with him. There was a queue for something. Then I was at home, which was different. I was organizing some mess. A baby had gotten kidnapped and there was an x-ray and pictures of other babies. They chased this guy. They were in a taxi and there was a fat guy. This guy got out and the fat guy punched him through the glass, which smashed.
