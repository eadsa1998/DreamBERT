I am seated on a small stage area talking. I put on a furry hat (Robin Hood-like shape) with a bouquet or corsage of flowers on it. Some bad person comes up to us and I put on the hat and discover that I turn into a small fairy like Tinkerbell. No one can see me. So I hide up in the curtains. Then I flit down and move things, which confuses the bad guys. They look around to find me, but I hide again. Then I pick up a stick and pound the helmeted head of a bad guy, thump, thump, thump! I dent the plastic mixing bowl. They are astounded. Then there are two of us and she doesn't have her hat on and so is big and visible. The bad one sees her and realizes what's going on. I sit there and she sees me, even though I'm small with the hat on. She has learned to see us, so I'm not safe anymore. Now I go to a photography class. A door jamb frames a room of people dancing. A woman in red is very graceful and I take pictures, and then I get up and move around to get different perspectives and better pictures. I get close and see my own actions a part of the picture. I hold the camera out as I dance with them. Then I want to see the pictures. I open the photo envelope to see how well I did. They are pretty and interesting. One photo is a composite where a picture of a baby was cut out and pasted on this photo and has something to do with why I became visible as a small fairy.
