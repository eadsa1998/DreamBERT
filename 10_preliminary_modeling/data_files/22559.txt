I dreamed that my friend Elizabeth and I were coming back from Hilda's house at night. In the corner was her boyfriend, Benny, and my friend didn't want to see him and told him to go away. But he didn't want to go away and told her that he had something to tell her, and he started following her. My friend Elizabeth was running all over the street. Then he caught up with her and told her that her father had returned and Elizabeth was very happy and went home.
