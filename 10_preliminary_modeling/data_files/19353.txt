I was in the activity office at school, but the room was empty except for this desk and chair I was sitting at. It was during passing time, but I didn't leave the room for reasons unbeknownst to me, and then one of my ex-girlfriends came into the room. I talked with her for awhile and then just as she was leaving I found myself playing on stage with my band.
