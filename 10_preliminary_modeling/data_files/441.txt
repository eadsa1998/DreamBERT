Throughout the dream I had a feeling of urgency. I felt that I was on a deadline to get an assignment done for school. I almost didn't turn the assignment in on time because when going to the campus, I took a wrong turn and ended up in the parking lot of where I went to high school. Then I was trying to get to a house that was supposed to be my house. This is a house that I had never seen before, but I knew it was mine. I'm at the top of the stairs in the house looking down them. Someone had just told me that all of the animals that lived in the house were fighting. The dog that belongs to my housemates was downstairs, but I wasn't sure she was the one who was causing the trouble. Also my two cats were down the stairs and my dog, who is dead, was also there. All the time I was wondering what one of my cats was doing there because I had to give her away, due to the fact that she and my other cat didn't get along. Also I was surprised to see my dog, because she was put to sleep when I was fourteen years old. I had heard these noises of animals fighting when I was outside of the house, so I ran up to see what was going on. I felt that I was in a frantic hurry because I couldn't get up the hill to the house fast enough. I ended up running through the campus to get to the house. When I finally reached the house, I heard a cat screech and I saw lights blinking on and off, like a haunted house. Then my dog ran out of the house, obviously very scared. I noticed she was limping and her leg was bleeding, like she had been bit. I said, "She needs help, she's been bit." I figured my housemate's dog had been the one to bite her. After I saw my dog, I ended up in the house somehow.
