Everybody I know would see when I went down the alphabet. Like when I saw A I'd see them eating an apple. I could only go down to N - past that everybody would turn into monsters. Setting: Some playground. I don't know which one. Characters: A whole bunch of people. I don't think I knew them but I knew what letter their names started with. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. Mostly happy - when I got down to the bottom I felt scared.
