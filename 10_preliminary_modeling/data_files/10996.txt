It was a very dark night and it was very late. Some friends had walked me home. They tried to persuade me to go with them to get some food, but I knew it was very late and I had to go inside. These friends were angry because I would not go with them and they quickly left. As I was about to enter the door a little squirrel ran up to me and I was frightened. I thought the squirrel was going to bite me. I ran inside. I wanted to find my parents so they could protect me. I started to run up some steps. I ran and ran. The house old and unfamiliar. The stair-steps were steep and I thought I'd never reach the top. When I did, I found my mother. She had been asleep. She was in a night gown. Her hair was disheveled and her eyes looked wild. I could tell she was angry. She told me to climb onto a high table or dresser. She went to get something and I knew she was going to get a knife so that she could cut me up. I started to run down the stairs.
