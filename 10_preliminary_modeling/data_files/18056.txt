I was on my porch and somebody came over and said, "Look at my robots" and I said "cool" and then out from the door came these robots after robots and there was only one more left that didn't want to come out so I had to push him out with a broom. He had rollerblades on and he had all sorts of control buttons on him. He had a very, very long antennae.
