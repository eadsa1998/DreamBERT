 I'm at a Perkins restaurant with my professor Mary Monroe, friends Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, and their female friend. My friend Nat Miller is there and he pays me the money he owes my in quarters. I drop some of the quarters. There are other coins too. I'm mad that he has paid me in this way. My high school classmate Sarah Summers is there. I open a door for her, and she opens one for me after it. My classmate Jill Banks is there. She is wearing a white tank top that looks like a wife beater. I'm wearing a wife beater.
