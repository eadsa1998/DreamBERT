Two years ago, Lilja (Lilja 4-ever) was put in a time machine and it looked like those water things they have in offices. There was a lever hanging off it which was supposed to open it, but only at certain times, but someone said it would make it explode. Ezra and I were outside with it. I said 'she's been in there for 4 years' and gave it a little push, but it started to fall and the top of it popped off. They tried to find a way to open it and had to call a place. Then Mom and I were trying to go somewhere by jumping a fence. Mom made noises as if she was hurt and a group of people, including Jeremiah and Eugene, were hanging around. I laughed and called her a noob. I easily got over the fence. She had taken her shoes off too. There was another drop to some train tracks. I told her not to follow me. I went back over to get her shoes. I opened a way for her and Eugene described how to beat the boss -- there were shelves of chocolate biscuits and it would put them to sleep. We filled them up fast.
