I dreamt that someone broke into our house and tore up everything. But the odd part is that only a small valueless flower pot was stolen. Another thing which I recall very clearly is the way they broke into the house. They broke in the back door. It seemed they just pushed in the door but it was still on its hinges swinging back and forth.
