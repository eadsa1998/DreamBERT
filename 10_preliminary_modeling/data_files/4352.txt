["Bonnie won't rehearse."] I am preparing for a presentation. Bonnie is supposed to play a character in the presentation and Sharon is supposed to get the food ready for the buffet. Both show up together, late. I am trying to explain to Bonnie that she needs to have her lines memorized. She doesn't want to do that. She wants to carry a sheet of paper with them written on it. I explain how that will not be professional and besides it will make the show not as good. She just doesn't' want to do the work involved to do it right. Meanwhile I am trying to show Sharon the map of buildings across the street where she needs to go to get the food for the buffet. It is Paul M.'s deli. She can't seem to get it. I walk with her and am still talking with Bonnie about how much better it would be if she'd rehearse. I find a deli counter at the community college and see Paul R. I ask him where the other deli is and he says why bother, he has everything here. I try and ask him how much and know it would be wiser if I went over to the other deli to comparison shop. But I am tired and decide to just go with what's here. I feel bad about not checking it out. He says how much were you going to spend? I say maybe 200 dollars. He grins and says no problem I can do that. Maybe it will be 250 dollars. I know this is coating me more, but I don't check it out. I then go out into the hall, trying to find an elevator to get other to the next building without having to take the long way around. I can't find it. I stop into an office where a man and a woman are necking and flirting. I interrupt them and ask. They don't know where it is either. I am frustrated because this will make me even more tired.
