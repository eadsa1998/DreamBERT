I was standing in my dining room, but there was no dining room table. One of the plants on the individual plant stands had fallen over. There was dirt all over the carpet. It'd sprayed out to the middle of the dining room, where the table would normally be. Back further in front of the wardrobe there is a rectangular flower box that had been sitting on the floor that was also knocked on its side. Actually, it was closer to being turned upside down. What I mean by that is it wasn't exactly laying on the side and it wasn't completely turned over. There had been dirt in it but I can't tell if there were flowers in it or not. I'm also moving one of the plants on the large plant rack. It's one of the medium-sized plants. I know that I'm turning it around but I'm not sure if I might also be moving it to a different shelf on the rack.
