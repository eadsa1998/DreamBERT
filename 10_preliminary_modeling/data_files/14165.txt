I was at a shop. Mom and I climbed up these boxes, which was really high. Ezra was on the other side and I yelled out to him and he had to climb all the way over again. He had a Labrador with him. Mom and I went down. Greg Grunberg was sitting on a lounge in another room and I walked past him again and went to get my phone and ask for a photo. My phone wasn't there. I asked Mom to ring it and it was in the boxes, but it was Ezra's phone. I told her to call Ezra's and I found my phone. It was low on battery so I put it on charge. Greg was going to the toilet, he said something scared him and he said that he "shat myself" and I said "waste of a trip then".
