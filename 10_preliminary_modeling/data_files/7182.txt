I brought a mattress pad to lay on the floor to sleep on since there wasn't room on mother's bed. Mother pointed out place to lay it. I said that I must get my own pillow. She asked when I got such a nice fat one. I told her she had given it to me when I went to China and I had had it refilled there and more recently had it washed at a laundry.
