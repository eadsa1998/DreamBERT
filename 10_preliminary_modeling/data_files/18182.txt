Some aliens of a strange sort were trying to take over the world. In some ways they were good and other ways they were evil. The type of thing that they were, they were sort of a great amoebae composed of smaller amoebas and they took over someone's brain, someone's whole body and could manipulate this person and they were very hard to kill. They were good in that for instance if one of them got control, say of a large city, he could manipulate it so that there wouldn't be any accidents, traffic accidents or anything, or anything bad happening. But on the other hand, what was mostly bad about them was the fact that they took away your freedom and you couldn't do anything any more, but just what they were directing you to. I realized they were evil and I wanted to get rid of this one. Apparently not too many of them had been coming so far, and I wanted to get rid of them. I think I had a pistol and it was rather involved action because only one person had been taken over by this thing, but in some way it could manipulate a whole crowd of people even though only one person was actually taken over by the thing. I think I did, attempted to get rid of one, and I almost did, but as I said, they were very hard to kill, so even though you shot and shot at them, they would still be alive and still be capable of hurting these other people, but I think finally the whole problem was solved when there was a second man. The first one had taken over was a male person and the second one was female, and I was going to shoot at this female one who was just walking along alone. When she found out there was another one there trying to manipulate, he got very jealous because she wanted to be the one who did it all, and so she was going to rush in and fight with the other alien. I figured that when this happened, whatever was left of either one of them would be easy enough to kill and I guess this is what happened.
