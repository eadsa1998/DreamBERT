I was staying in a room and Skye from Big Brother was in another. The blinds were riding up. Skye's outfit was in like four parts. Someone chased her. I threw a party at my house. Lots of people showed up and people were peeing, pooping and spewing all over everything. I tried to say that people needed to leave but no-one was really interested. I started shooting to get their attention. A girl who I was related to and I was her heir but we didn't like each other and she confronted me and I said I was only pushing people who caused a mess and it doesn't matter if I like them. I was doing Spud Shed with Esther and had to strip this meat -- it was thick and red with grey on the bottom, and was renowned for being difficult but I picked it up quickly.
