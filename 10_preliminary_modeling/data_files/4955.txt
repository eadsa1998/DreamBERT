I am dressed as a young boy/man, but I'm a woman. I am in disguise. It's 1800's. A man sees me and seems to take me under his wing. He is quiet, strong and watchful. He knows I'm masquerading and is intrigued by me. There are some ruffians and he saves me from them and suggests I travel with him. I go to get my worldly possessions. I live in an attic room of a big tall building. I go up many flights of stairs. As I am running up the stairs, I feel a mild earthquake. I mutter over and over, "The bricks, the bricks on the roof." I am afraid. Apparently my father or some man had been killed by bricks falling off the roof. We get to the roof. I see bricks falling and a man falling. I grab my duffle bag of clothes and run down the flights of stairs. Out on the street, we get on horses to ride away. This man feels empathy for me and will protect me. [BL]
