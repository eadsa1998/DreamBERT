I was in an office, like at the elementary school.  My mother had gone to do something and I went in there to do something and wait a moment for her.  What we were doing I don't remember.  There was a blonde-haired boy in there.  Somehow he and I began dancing.  He was not much taller than me.  There was a stereo playing the music we danced to.  The boy made a mention of expecting me to kiss him.  I smiled and nudged my nose next to his right ear, and told him I don't go kissing that quickly.    He was pleased.  My mother came in at some point and the situation didn't seem to faze her.  The dancing ended and the boy and I smiled at each other, with an unspoken understanding that it wouldn't be the last time.
