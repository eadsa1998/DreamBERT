The characters involved were my mother, father, _____ 16 or 17 year old brother Dave. It was an unusual dream. The feeling of communicating with my parents was distinctly important. It's sort of difficult to accurately describe the setting situation as far as feeling of the dream, one dream as being taken, no dream was taking place. The basic idea of the dream was I was traveling from someplace to home and when I got home, I was to clean something. There was a chore that was expected of me to do. The whole base of the dream was my coming from one point to home. The dream seemed to be more in the tense of the past. It just didn't have the characteristics of a present. My father particularly. In the past, well, it just seemed different. The house seemed to be across from our house where we lived in New Jersey. Very good friends of my mother and father lived there, and this seemed to be the house we were occupying. This dream seems to be fouled up by the same sort of feeling and situation of the first dream recorded tonight of a light plane landing, myself sitting, watching it. It seemed to be completely different from the dream about my folks. There seemed to be no relationship between the two. It was just as if one was cut off, and the next thing this one starts, but the bit with the plane wasn't as if a story or something. It was just this plane was landing and that was all there was to it. This was to be the end anyway. The __________ referred to was known to me before reaching home and this was going thru my mind as I was traveling to my destination, and there was hardly any conversation between myself and my folks, just a salutation upon arrival and exchange of words. This was the extent of the dream.
