I dreamed that I was at soccer camp and we were all in the room where we watch movies. It was pitch black and we were all soaking wet from the rain. All the coaches were outside the room choosing courses for us next year. I was getting really frustrated because I wanted to choose my own classes. I didn't want someone choosing them for me. The door opened and a little light crept in. I realized I was alone. Aidan came in to tell me what he had chosen for me to take. I was really upset because I didn't want to take the courses he selected.
