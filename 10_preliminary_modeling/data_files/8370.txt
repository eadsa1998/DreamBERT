I was working with a team of people on some kind of project - home improvement or decorating. One of the last things I wanted for the homeowner was a storage bench seat- a rectangular shaped box with a hinged lid so they could use it for storage and sit on it. I wanted it to place it by the door so they could sit there to take their shoes off when then come in. I wanted it to have a back on it of about 6 inches and on the sides I wanted the back to taper down to about the middle of the lid/seat. Then I wanted an upholstered cushion for it. I drew four different design options for the carpenter because we were running out of time to complete the job and I wanted him to make the nicest one he could with the allotted time. I named each one after a person because each one was like one that person owned. One was named after me so I named it Anna F. One was named after Anna Fi so I named it Anna F also. At first I wrote Anna S but quickly realized that S was her maiden name so I changed it to Anna Fi. I realized that wouldn't work so I changed mine to Anna Father and hers to Anna Fi. I don't remember the names on the other two. But then later I changed the name on each one from the name of a person to something else.
