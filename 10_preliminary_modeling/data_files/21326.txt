My dad was still staying with me, but I ignored him and it was 2 days that he left and was not back. Frank Lasko was in Grandpa's bed and he was there 2 days already. I didn't know till Ann told me I had an idea. He got into an argument with his wife and left her for a spell. Just as I fell asleep I was out in the field and a rabbit jumped up and ran and it startled me, so I awoke. The rabbit was scared. He jumped when I was close and he also scared me.
