I'm running through a crowd of people, a man is chasing me. I mostly just see his wrist and the suit and shirt cuffs. He's very tall. He's smiling. He's going to rape or hurt me. I look around for help, trying to stay in the crowds. I see a police station, but it's a block away and no one's around. I try to run for it, but can't run very well or fast so I turn back to the relative safety of the crowd. He's closing in on me. I try to hide under a decorative table cloth, small round table, two big, round cloths draping it. It's not going to help. I start shaking from fear.
