A guy had written Twilight. He decided he loved Alice so everyone thought he was going to bring her back to life in the next book [note: she didn't die in the book]. I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Buffy and Giles were acting weird and they leant in to kiss and someone entered the room and they backed off. I remembered in the last episode they had made out. The others left and Giles was locking the front door and closing the curtains and then Spike was there. He said "Buffy" and he thought something was going on. People were complaining about not knowing what Spike could do (without the chip).
