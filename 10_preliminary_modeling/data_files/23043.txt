I was at some house, maybe the Drivers' house in my hometown.  Several other people were there, including the Paul Sparkles family.  Paul and Steve were about the same age as the last time I saw them.  I asked Paul how "Paul" was, and he replied, "I'm Paul."  I was confused.  I knew Paul was Paul, and Steve was Steve, but I was apparently thinking of Paul's older brother (which he doesn't have).  So I clarified myself by saying, "I mean your older brother."  He began to tell me something in hushed, serious tones -- about his having been killed in Vietnam, I believe -- but we were interrupted in the middle of it and I had to go into another room.  When I came back, everyone was sleeping on the floor in different rooms.  I started to wake up Paul and Steve and ask for the rest of the story, but decided it wouldn't be very considerate of me to wake them.
