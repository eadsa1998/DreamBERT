["Darcy and the incest."] I am at the V. farm. I am outdoors. I see that Aunt Rosalie, Darcy and her family are camped out down in the pasture. They have been there for a while. We had been waiting for them to come to us. I realize that I will have to go to them. I walk down to the pasture. I talk with Aunt Rosalie. Darcy joins us. I realize that now is a good time to ask them about the incest. I say, in a hesitant tone of voice, I need to ask you a question. It may be distressful for you but I don't know what else to do but ask it. Then I ask Darcy is she had been incested and does she know if I had been incested. Darcy and Aunt Rosalie are pleasant enough. Darcy says Well, actually. There was no incest. I feel oddly uncomfortable about that. Then she says, It's just that my father had some lessons for me to learn. He was teaching me. I then smile, thinking aha. She is in denial. There really was incest. I feel relieved to finally have the answer.
