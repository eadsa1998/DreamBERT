I went shopping with a friend, LV, and I looked in this clothing store, through a rack of summer type sweater-vests, but instead of getting one of those, I ended up buying for myself a wind-breaker textured summer vest and took that home. When I got home, instead of entering through the front door, I entered through the basement door and heard some commotion going on upstairs, some people talking and bustling around and I wondered what was going on. But I turned around, and after setting my vests down went outside because I knew that I had some friends from church waiting to take me to an outing in the afternoon and yet I couldn't resist finding out who was upstairs and why and so I turned back around, went back inside, closed the doors and went upstairs and discovered it was my parents putting up stair treads that they had planned to put up sometime this year and had never gotten to. They were also painting, which I didn't expect them to do. I asked them about it and they said "oh, we're just here, doing a lot of stuff this afternoon" and I said "well that's all right, but I'm not going to be here this afternoon, I'm going back out to a church function" and they said "well that's all right, we don't need you here but can we make tuna fish sandwiches for this afternoon when we break?" And I said, "yeah, you can do that I have plenty left" and I went outside to find my friends still waiting for me and that was it.
