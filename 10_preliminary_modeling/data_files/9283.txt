I was conducting a silent auction for SPX. I had donated two pieces of furniture and three of the figures from my outdoor nativity scene. The auction was almost over and I realized none of my items had sold. I felt a bit bad about that, thinking that I should have found better things to donate. Later, as we were cleaning up after the auction, I saw that my two pieces of furniture were gone. Someone had bought them after all. Someone came up and asked me what had not sold and I pointed out the few items that were left, which included my three nativity figures. Someone who had been helping with the auction had collected all of the money and had it in a zippered vinyl bank bag. When I found her and asked for it, it appeared from the look on her face that she had not intended to give it to me. I took it, with the other things I had, and went to find an empty office within the parish offices where I could sit down and go over everything, and figure out what our total revenue was from the auction. I looked into several of the offices but wasn't sure which ones were okay for me to us. Judy A was in one of the offices where there were three desks. There were many boxes and other things sitting all over the place. She indicated one of the desks in that room that I could use, saying that someone was coming in to use the other one. She said who was coming in but I can't recall now. I went in and sat at the desk she indicated was free and began to go through the paperwork and payments.
