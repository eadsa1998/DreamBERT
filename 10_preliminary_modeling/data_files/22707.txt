Another image I remember is that I was three months pregnant and that I was happy, jumping in a field. I believe it was a school with a swimming pool. It was very pretty. My father didn't yell at me like before because I was pregnant, etc. I don't remember any more. I think that my husband was a Protestant. We had a religious wedding first and then a Catholic wedding.
