I was sitting at work, very bored, and no one was there, so I smoked some pot. Then I noticed that my boss was coming there soon. I knew I had to open doors and turn on the fans, but my boss came in before I could get around to it. When she walked into the office, she sniffed around and gave me a dirty look. She said I could leave, so I left, but I forgot my backpack. I didn't realize that I didn't have it until I was at the store. I went back to work and asked my manager for my backpack. She threw all of my books at me and I asked her if she looked through it. She had found my pot and was very angry. She said that they would have to have a big meeting about the problem. Then I was in this room with a bunch of people that I didn't know.
