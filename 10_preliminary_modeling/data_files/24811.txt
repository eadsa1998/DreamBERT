For some reason this girl and her family was living in our house with us. I hated her and we fought all the time. We were screaming at each other and she came up with a pair of scissors and cut a huge chunk of my hair right up to the scalp. I was crying but I couldn't do anything about it. Setting: At my house. Characters: This girl and I just never got along. I don't know why. She was in my house, but I hated her. She was the only character. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, hate. I'm trying to grow out my hair so I know why I felt so mad and helpless. I would kill her if it really happened.
