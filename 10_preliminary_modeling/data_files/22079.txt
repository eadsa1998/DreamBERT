I dreamt I was among boys whom I cannot place very well. It seemed to me I was next to a wall, only one wall. And I wanted to (was trying to) tell these fellows that they were bourgeois, and this caused me to feel anguish because I was not doing it and I don't know why else. Suddenly Alfie, the president of the Liberal Arts Students Association, came into my mind. But even before he came into focus, instead of being vague as the other fellows were, I said, "This is the only convinced socialist-Christian." I don't remember any more. He is 19 years old.
