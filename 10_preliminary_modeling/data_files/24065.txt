I'm with Jess and we're walking around and just talking. I can't remember anything that we're saying, but we have plenty to talk about. What's odd is that we're walking on the side of he highway where it merges with a larger highway. We're walking in the middle of the lane and cars are whizzing past us, but not only are we not even worried by it, we continue our mellow conversation. We keep walking until we reach the point where the n-ramp changes into one lane and merges into the highway. For some reason we're surrounded by trees that sort of look like big bushes. Jess asks me, "Why did you break up with Sarita?" and I'm like, "She just saw the worst in people." We want to keep going, but are stuck because cars are driving everywhere around us. We then see some other people that kind of look like cavemen. The hairiest one looks at us and says, "Follow me, I know the way." He starts walking across the highway and as he proceeds, the cars stop coming. We follow him across the highway, and as we reach the other side, I wake up.
