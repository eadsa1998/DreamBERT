I am with of a group of inventors who have come up with a device that remotely opens doors - garage doors, bin-lids etc. It's a mystery how it works, but by pressing a button it suddenly transfers energy to the door which flips open. We drive around the streets making doors fly open. Suddenly we are on Main Road near the park, and there are numerous hot air balloons and air ships in the sky. Some of them are shooting by at incredibly high speeds. "This is like the future" I say.
