Mary is getting ready to go somewhere and is trying on a white pant suit made of a silk-like cloth that is somewhat transparent. I am watching her dress and am delighted with the outfit she put on. I hadn't seen it for a long time and had completely forgotten about it. I can't see Mary in clear, sharp outlines, but I know it is her, as she had been when she was healthy. I see Mary twice: once where she is wearing pants and bra, and again where she is completely dressed in pants and top.
