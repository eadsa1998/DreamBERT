This lady did some charity thing. She told the group one day that they got a heap of money, but then the next day, her, this guy and another guy called Alec, left and went to Australia and took the money. This cop person (who was me sometimes) was there and there was a thing saying the "girl is med-hot, Alec and is cool" or something. They thought he was going to kill her. They discovered she was allergic to pepper. They put a thermometer in the guy's mouth, who was then Ezra and the temperature went way up and the cop said "You're under arrest" and Ezra was confused. He said he liked peppers in meatloaf and he had bought ones the girl wasn't allergic to.
