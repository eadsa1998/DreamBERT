I was at 'home'. Rover was chewing on stuff. We were now outside and I was with Mom, Ezra and Darren. Darren was annoyed at Rover. I got quests on World of Warcraft and I had to go to Outland. I was only level 51 though. One quest was like level 41 and could be done in Eastern Kingdoms, in Stranglethorn.
