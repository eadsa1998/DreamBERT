I recall that I was in my house and noticed some birds flying around in the house. It didn't seem odd to me but I decided to follow them. I saw that they flew into the fireplace, so I took a flashlight and looked up into the fireplace. It was big enough to stand up but I didn't at first. I noticed a nest on the left side and a bee's nest on the right. I went to get a closer look and a big black bird was sitting in the middle of the chimney. I had to back off because he got mad. I thought it was great that we had these birds flying throughout the house so I left them there.
