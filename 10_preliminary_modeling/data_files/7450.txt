Mary and I are at a movie and the picture is supposed to be some kind of erotic film. If I remember correctly, there is a scene in the movie where several women are wearing masks. But the masks are actually massagers or vibrators. The women close in on a man -- or men -- embrace him/them and press their massagers/vibrators against him/them. In the dream, this struck both Mary and I as very silly -- hardly erotic at all. Mary is laughing and is in good spirits. She turns to me, and says, in high glee: "I like fucking and sucking, but that's something else." We decide to leave the movie -- it's so stupid. And as I'm sitting beside Mary, laughing and enjoying myself and feeling so very glad to be with her, I suddenly realize she is dead -- has been dead for 15 months. As I think about this in the dream, I am aware of thinking also that she's not dead. How can she be dead when she is here beside me, laughing and enjoying herself? In this dream I'm dimly aware of being married to Bonnie, but I'm deeply preoccupied with being with Mary and shocked to remember that she's dead. I'm not accepting that Mary is dead because she's with me.
