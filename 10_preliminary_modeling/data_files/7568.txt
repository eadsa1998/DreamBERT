We are in the living room or dining room of our former apartment on Tree Frog Street. Mary and I are getting ready to go somewhere. She is dressed and ready to go before I am ready. I am having difficulty putting on a pair of overshoes. Mary is dressed in black. At one point I ask her if she wants a cup of tea. She declines. Then I ask her how she's feeling. She replies that she no longer has a headache. I ask how she is feeling otherwise and she tells me, "So-so." In other words, she is feeling some discomfort. At one point in this dream Mary and I are hugging.
