[1997-05-16] I was over at our [blind] industries department and they were making these beautiful sweaters and I touched this beautiful, woolen, knit sweater, which was very well done and I asked what color it was and somebody said that it was yellow and our clients could make them and I said, "let me bring down the products, I have a lady in the hospital now, it might give her some ideas and might make her feel better even though she's sick, to know that she can do this project" and they said "okay" so after calling her I went down and showed her this project, she wasn't mad or anything and she didn't sound sick, not very sick. So I asked my lady driver if she would bring me down, it was about 1:30 in the afternoon to Naugatuck where the client was and she did, but when we got there we didn't go to the client's room, we went to this other place. There were all these children, handicapped, in wheelchairs and we had all these little animals and they said put the animals up on the wheelchairs, but not where the food is, put them up by the kids' heads, more like on the back of the wheelchair. They were little fake animals about an inch long and they sort of stayed on the backs of the wheel chairs and we were having a party with them and eating with them, in this big, well-lit room and I think it was afternoon.
