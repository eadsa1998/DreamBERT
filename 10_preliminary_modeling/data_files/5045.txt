A little mouse with tiny ears is in a box. I feel guilty because I had left it in there for a long time without food or water. Someone takes it out and puts it with other mice in a box with food and water. Its ears become huge like bat wings with a red rose painted on each one. It slips out of the person's hand and falls, but it is flexible and quick and is ok. [BL]
