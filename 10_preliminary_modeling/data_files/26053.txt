 I'm at a lake with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling. Tim has caught a big fish that looks like a cross between a walleye and a bass. It is strung up on the dock. It is a walleye, I think, but has a huge mouth and is gray and black in color. Niles landed a big eight or 10-pound northern pike. Tim hooks into one on the dock. I go out and net it as he gets in near. Niles' fish is in the net, and then I net Tim's. It is also a big pike: six or eight pounds. We're happy when I net the second fish: we got two big ones! They hold their big pike up and I take a photograph. I am confused as to who caught which fish.
