There was a little boy about seven years old maybe. His best friend was a little girl a year or two younger than him. A boy his age came around wanting to play with him and he was embarrassed to be seen playing with the little girl. He ignored her and pretended to be shaving. He told the boy to hide like they were going to play hide-and-seek, but instead of looking for him, he went looking for the girl. He found her standing in front of a room giving a presentation of some sort. He sat in the audience.
