Bruce W and Carl W were chasing me all over trying to tickle my feet. Aunt J had given me these two beautiful armoires and they had circular racks made of wood. They held ties and clothing that had belonged to Uncle A. The circular racks were about 6 feet tall and approximately 2 feet in diameter. As they spun it was beautiful color. The one was completely covered with ties. The other with other clothing.
