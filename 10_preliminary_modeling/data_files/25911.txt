 I'm at some sort of a staff gathering or dinner for Fishing Haven. One man there is getting married. I seem to remember him having something sewn haphazardly on his crotch or zipper, very jaggedly. I talk with my coworker Amy Rancher and say maybe I'll see her next summer, but maybe not. We kiss each other goodbye. We'll see each other later tonight.
