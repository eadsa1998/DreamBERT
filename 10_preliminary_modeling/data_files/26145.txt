 I'm in College Liquor with my friend Niles Zelling and my housemate Stephen Ramos. I decide to splurge and stock up on alcohol. I pick out four bottles of liquor, two of which are a 1.75 and a one-liter bottle of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum. Then I ask a man working there if he'll get me three cases of Horse Hoof returnable bottles from the cooler. Niles wants one of the cases, so I get three instead of two. The total price comes to about $30, which I think is a good deal.
