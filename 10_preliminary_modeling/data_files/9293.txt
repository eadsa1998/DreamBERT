Ben D and I were making love. He was trying to convince that the current condition of my body didn't bother him at all, as he rubbed my breasts and stomach. I didn't believe him though. [Saw a commercial on TV last night about a new show that is trying to get overweight women to love their bodies naked. I totally agree with the concept because of the health issues associated with being overweight and the numerous ways it can impact society and other people. I don't want to learn to love my body as it is. I want to get my thyroid under control and get back into shape.]
