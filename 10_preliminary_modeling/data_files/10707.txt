I dreamed it was next summer and that I was going to be married to my boyfriend at home. Mother advised me not to, but said she would not stand in my way. He had very little money and George, after finally convincing me not to finish school, said maybe mother was right. I had made up my mind, however, and would not hear of a postponement. The next part is after we are married. Although I did not see the ceremony, I knew it was very simple. Someone asked where we should go on our honeymoon and I can't remember where I said, but they thought it was the place in Europe named the same. I was embarrassed when I said it was not. Then I thought maybe I should have married another fellow I know who would have taken me to Europe, but I immediately dismissed this from my mind. Mother said then that the place we were going was very nice, although neither of us had previously been there. This made me feel much better. Next we were sitting in a large dining room. George was drinking a beer and I had a coke. All of a sudden it struck me that this was my wedding night and I got nervous and sort of afraid. I then asked George to order me a double shot which I never did get to drink because I woke up.
