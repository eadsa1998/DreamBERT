I'm telling this woman how to set up the name file, I think, We're in the Sheridan house and she's going to help me out with my secretarial duties. She prefers colored papers and I say I'll get some for her later, but first I show her this book. First she has to look up the name of the place, Vincent Hospital. I can't find it at first, but I keep looking and I find it. "Then," I say, "I look up my own name because I know I'm on the list. I see 'Sanders-29.' That tells me to turn to page 29. I do so and see 'Sanders-1-1-2'. That tells me where the list is." She agrees to do it. Now, we're in an old rickety house and this woman, a man, and my brother Dwight are going to help me build it up from the falling down, ugly condition. I point to a solid rock wall and the man says, "It will be easy to build a staircase in it." I say, "But for why? Where would it go?" He decides to build a fireplace. He's painting the kitchen in the "bar" room. He sees that we have a lot of kitchens. I say, "Well, we need them. This one, in the bar room will be used for the customers. The center one will be for family and the one outside for the cattle hired hands in the summer when we raise 100 head of cattle." The house is built into a mountain and under a huge cement bridge. The country is too rough to graze cattle. The house keeps improving. It's starting to look good and solid. (see drawing)
