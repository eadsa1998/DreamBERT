At night, it's time to rest. I lay down on the ground. A lion jumps me. I shoot it. I can't tell if I've killed it because it's all dark. I decide to rest with my back to a rock. A rock over, hangs above me and I place sharp sticks in the ground all around me, so the sticks will get them before they get me.
