A chubby, flabby boy is a Buddha emperor boy and the priest comes up to him. The boy shoves his fat belly down to make a pillow for the priest, who lays his head on the belly, a sort of ritual greeting of emperor and priest. Now they raise him to sitting and drape his fat, flaccid penis over the edge of his bed and he pees. I watch, fascinated. It's such an odd shape penis and the boy is so spoiled he doesn't even use his muscles to lift himself up. It is all done for him by the priests.
