Me and Polly went to camp and had our own cabins. A lot of people I don't know were there and there were a lot of obstacles we had to go through, like an obstacle course, and I was the last one. I would keep getting dressed and I was outside with no clothes on, and I thought it was the style but everyone else had clothes on, so I said, "Well, I guess this style's out." Then Polly came up to me and said, "Don't worry, it just happened to me too," and she shared a towel with me. Then we walked to a place that looked like our bungalow, but it was a Chinese businessman's house. He was mean and serious. His servants brought out a silver tray with ketchup in the middle and french fries all around. My friend Cindy, me and Polly jumped and started eating the fries like crazy and the Chinese businessman got mad. A tray of shrimp came out and he started attacking the shrimp and eating and eating like crazy with his friends too. Later we were in a pool and taking care of octopuses. Four would live and four we would have to kill, so we did. When they put the big octopus in the pool, everyone jumped in because they were scared, except me. I tried to tell them that if they were in pool, they'd see the octopus, but if they were out, nothing would happen to them, but no one believed me. There was a pool of toothpicks that churned and you had to walk through it, but it didn't hurt.
