We are living in a place like the Retreat Center, many people. Am I a counselor? Willie is there too (as a young boy). He is befriended by a black fellow, and when it is time to go home, he doesn't want to go with us. I hesitate and then say OK. "But for 3 weeks only, then you come home." Lots of confusion in our leaving.....
