I see Dean Martin strumming his guitar. I remark on his very broad shoulders. Then I'm in my maroon nightgown and Ellie and I get into my sports car. I'm impressed with the steering. I drive it up a hill. It handles well. Then I go to my cousin's house. I look out a window and see this Tarzan guy (my husband, I think) standing on a high cliff. He's going to drive like Superman into a creek. A woman watches and is horrified when he jumps because she doesn't know his skills and powers. I smile cause I know he's OK.
