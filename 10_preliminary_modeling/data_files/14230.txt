We were in the car. I had some Red Dwarf shoes. Darren needed to do something with shoes because of something with his feet. My shoes were size 11 and his were 13. Mom was in the car too. Then I was looking at some Chris Barrie thing. He'd had an accident with another guy in the water. They had fallen in and he accidentally got an octopus killed and the other guy had hit two dolphins. I jumped in to save them, but all the animals were dead. Chris had lost his wedding ring. I saw it on the floor and the creepy crawly was near it so I moved it out of the way and picked it up and took it to the surface, although I really didn't want to touch it. Later, I was drying him with a towel. This person asked how we knew each other and we said "friends". He was kind of fat and had a couple of chins.
