A very vivid dream about either my friend Terry or my brother becoming king of England. The scene is set for the inauguration ceremony dinner. There is a huge hall with a high stage where the king and his closest colleagues sits (I am among them). Below is a sea of decorated tables of unknown posh guests. The people mostly seem to be young, as if friends of a bride and groom, although they all seem upper class (so they wouldn't be my friends). For the rest of the dream I'm in the palace the day after as the right-hand-man of the king. The king's identity keeps flipping. Now he is another friend of mine, my friend Toby. In one room in the palace is a huge pool table, where we organize a tournament. My mother is there with her partner, who also has an adult son with him. I remember meeting the ex-queen, who is a young upper class lady, who's wearing an expensive dress, hair-do and make-up, and seems to look down on us. She doesn't seem to approve of the new king and his entourage. There's another part of the dream which is set in a wine-making room, which is like a James Bond set: the walls are stainless steel, the floor is deep with white wine, and there's a walkway or ledge above the surface of the wine. Vine roots trail downwards from the ceiling out of view into the wine. Either the roots are feeding the wine or via versa. The vine roots seem to be fleshy and more like animal than plant parts. We are accompanied by guards, and for some reason I and others jump into the wine, causing outrage. A fight breaks out.
