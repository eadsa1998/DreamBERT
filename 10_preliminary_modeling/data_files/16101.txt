This was the day after my first day of school. I dreamt that Dad was kind of crabby and that he was in Mom's workroom and I whispered to Mom something or other and somehow he heard it. And somehow he heard it and then he came in and started disconnecting the wires to my sound system, and I said, "What are you doing?" and then he made some kind of smart alec remarks and he said, "I'm not worth anything to you." And then I said, "Well, think of all our walk time, all our family time." And he said, "Family time? Yech!" And then I said something, I yelled something and then I slammed the door behind me and I ran out with Mom to go to the Thai restaurant with the firemen people. I think this dream was brought on be a subconscious overreaction to his teasing last night about I didn't use his binder and so he was teasing about he's just an old bird these days. Now I remember something else about that dream. After Mom and I walked out, we went to Circuit City and I think she was tell me she dropped something, and she was going to have to pay for it. I don't remember exactly.
