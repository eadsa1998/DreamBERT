I dreamed I was in H--- Hall where I met my Aunt, and also a girlfriend (20 yrs) who lives there. I was quite surprised to see my aunt and wanted to show her around. I introduced her to a fellow who played football. He began talking with her, so I went away. I don't know where, but I met and talked with many school friends. When I returned to my aunt she was still talking to the football player. I was amazed to find her so interested in the fellow as he was not the polished, refined typed which she approves of.
