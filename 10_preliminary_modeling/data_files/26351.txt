 I'm on the very top floor of a building that seems to be Old Main at Brimson. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She is teaching others and I the names of things, as in school, and she is the teacher. We stand on boards. There is a slant to the ceiling or wall. I lick and suck Melanie's fingers. She is not expecting this; I do it randomly. After I do this there is an awkward feeling, and I start laughing to ease the tension. There is a fire drill, a man tells us. We all walk down the stairs. People have dogs, we see, on the way down.
