I was driving downtown, down the street, down Ponce, and I just came to an intersection, and the light changed yellow. I went through it anyways, though. I went thru all the way on the yellow light because I looked in the rear view mirror. A cop came after me anyways, though. He pulled me over into a parking lot, the parking lot of the 820 bar. It's right out here on Ponce. He wanted to write me out a ticket for $25.43, and as I woke up, I was arguing with him that I hadn't gone thru the red light. That's about all. There was some day residue. I almost stopped at this bar tonight. They have all drinks for 35 cents. We talked about going in there. This all happened at night.
