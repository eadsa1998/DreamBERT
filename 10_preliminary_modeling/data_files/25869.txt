 I'm a priest. I'm at the back of Carter church giving a blessing and spraying people with holy water. Then we walk up to the front of church, carrying things. I carry Degree brand deodorant in one hand. I'm then serving as an altar boy with my grade school classmate Eric Stoner. We put the things we're carrying in the back room. I'm not sure it is appropriate to bring deodorant out in view of the congregation, so I leave it in the hallway of the back room. I go out next to the pulpit to get a sign and move it. The sign has responses to petitions on it. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan needs the sign there, so I don't move it. I go sit down. I sit in the chair for the altar boy who holds the wine chalice. I have a wooden medallion on. Eric doesn't have a medallion. We are not wearing robes, which I notice when we sit down.
