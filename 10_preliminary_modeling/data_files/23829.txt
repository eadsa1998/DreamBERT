I dreamed of Julie F (one of my clients when I practiced law in Moab) and her youngest daughter.  I was looking at her and talking to her, telling her she looked just like Julie.  She did, only with a young, round chubby face.  Then I dreamed I knew how to fly a plane, and there was a small plane I took out and flew over fields.  The fields were grey or dead brown, like winter, it looked like Utah, near Cisco or Thompson, but didn't really feel like that.  Something about flying to Julie's house, hovering over her house, going inside for documents or something for our case, then going out and flying again.  I enjoyed flying a plane, I could be alone.  There was some freedom knowing I could go out to this plane, get in it, and fly it.  I think I wanted to take Lynn out flying in it.  I asked Dad if he minded that I was flying, and he did, it worried him.
