 I'm in the very back of a hatchback-like car. A large, powerful black figure comes to me and takes me with him. I'm in a place that I later recognize to be the Carter Church basement. There is a being there that is my leader or boss. He is a polar bear, but sometimes seems to be human. There are people/bears in the room. The leader has to elicit a reaction from the others by doing something unusual or abnormal. This may be something secondary or in the second attention. He jumps on tables, which seems to elicit a hostile response from the others. He jumps down, in their midst, and they fight. He has two-inch claws. I help him fight. He is a good fighter: strong and quick, and can fend off several adversaries. I smash one person on the side of the head with a rock or melon. Barbel Inhelder is there. Her head is a melon, though the melon and her head are separate. Whatever happens to the melon happens to her head. I hold the melon. I smash it against a right corner of a metal structure, piercing and splitting the melon, and Barbel's head. She is dying. I kneel down and pull down her pants to rape her. With her last bit of energy she weakly attempts to resist, to pull up her pants. She has no strength, and is almost dead. I turn her torso around to rape her from behind. I think: I'm terrible for doing this.
