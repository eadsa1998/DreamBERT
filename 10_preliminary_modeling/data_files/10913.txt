I dreamed that I was sick and was having a dream about Mr. Chapman, my art teacher. In my dream we were rehearsing a play that he was directing. When I actually got well and returned to school, in my dream, Mr. Chapman was rehearsing a play and just as I had dreamed it. We started talking and I told him about it. At one point during the rehearsals, he was demonstrating a dance with the main dancer, to show the others how to do it. She had very bright colors on and they went whirling and twisting all over the place. Somehow I was in love with Mr. Chapman and I think he was in love with me. I think he made love to me even though he was married and I cried because I was so sorry he was married. This is all very indefinite and I don't remember much.
