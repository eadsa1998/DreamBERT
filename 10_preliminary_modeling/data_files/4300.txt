["Dream symbols revisited."] I decide to go for a walk. I am outside going down a street. I turn to the right. I want to put an ad in the E City Weekly. I don't remember exactly where it was. I cross a street and say now I'm in the old section, where I had dreamed this scene before. I look up and see signs across the street on wires. I see P and P3 and P Girls. Ah, just like in another dream, I think. I see a store on the left and turn in to it. No, wrong one. I go down one more and go in. I found the place. I see a booth like machine I want to buy to work my dreams with. Someone asks me if I want a drink at the bar. I say no. I don't like to socialize at a bar. Then a woman invites me to a Women's Club meeting. I go in. I am now wearing a gray slim dress, looking sort of 1950's women's club fashion, like all the other women. Then I am up front with the four speakers. The one speaking I suddenly realize is Dora. I am so surprised and happy because she is dead now. It's my turn to speak and I say with deep feeling how grateful I am for dreams because I know it isn't really Dora standing there, it is some Asian woman I don't know, but the dreams permit me to visit Dora again. I cry deeply and sadly for Dora. Then I start giving a speech on my Rheumatoid Arthritis and my experiences with that. I see there are other women waiting to speak and I trail off and hand the mike to them. They don't want to speak and the speeches are over,.
