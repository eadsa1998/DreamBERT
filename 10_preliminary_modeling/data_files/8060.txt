I was sitting at a computer, looking for a place to live in CO. It was as though I had an arial view of the city. I think I was using the mouse to move around and get different views, different angles, or maybe see different parts of the city. I was now in the air moving over the city, moving around the city. Homer Simpson was now with me. We were looking over the city and I was thinking that it wasn't such a bad city. I noticed some of the architecture. I thought some of the buildings were very cool. One building in particular looked like the whole thing was a fountain. It had water running down the sides of the building. I think it was a hospital. There was something about a motorcycle in this.
