Last night's dream was a dream that I realized when I woke up and smelled the coffee that is what it was, only a dream. I had watched the hockey game on TV and saw one of the players score four goals and the crowd was going crazy. The dream that I had was that it was me who was on the TV set playing professional hockey and receiving all that attention. I have currently two close friends who play professional hockey and during the summer they are constantly being recognized in the public and it drives me crazy. So before going to bed I started to wonder how it would feel to be in the limelight. It was a great feeling: going out and everybody just would stop and ask me for my autograph. A good feeling.
