 I'm at open gym. My old coaches Jackson Shooter and Joe Ace are there. My friend Stephen Ramos is there, stacking up crates to jump off and dunk near one of the side basketball hoops. I attempt a dunk, but can't get my footing down. I have bad footing. Before I try to dunk, I stretch. I am really flexible. Stephen jumps on my back, jokingly. <br/
