There's this old guy who owns a business (maybe a trailer court) and a young guy who is very business astute. They become politicians and are very good. The young guy has a sister who is sheltered at home. He goes to pick her up. We are sitting in the back seat of a car. The sister says to her older woman friend. "I put the long line (underpants) in my purse." The woman shushes her. I lean to the woman and say, "I hope you'll take good care of her. I know you will." A sort of secret here. I'm not supposed to know they are planning on sneaking off. But I have figured it out and I am giving my blessings. The woman then notices we are driving up a very steep hill and is surprised. "Where we are going?" she asks. I smile and say, "Wait 'til you see it's even steeper and more curved up ahead." We round a curve and I see an ocean side cottage up facing the cliff side. A sign indicates a sea shell and souvenir shop. I think that's an odd place to have it. Rarely is this road traveled because it is residential. We pull up to an older woman's house. We go inside.
