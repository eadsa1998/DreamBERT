 I look in my closet at home, which is now my sister Heather's closet. It in, on the shelf, are my summer shorts. I've been looking for them. I pull out a pair. They are Girbaud shorts that I cut off in the 10th grade. They are huge: very baggy. I have a belt. They look black on me, though they are really blue. I don't wear them. My favorite pair of shorts isn't there.
