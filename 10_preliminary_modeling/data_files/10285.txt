Chloe comes to the house and we talk about our kids; ERIC appears unannounced; he has missed his plane to London. He will have to leave the next day at 9 PM; I drive him out to the airport and tell him that I heard he has a drinking problem; I ask him to promise to stop before he gets sloshed; or else to get treatment. He promises he will really try to know his limit. I return to the house and Chloe tells me that it is exactly one year since her father died....
