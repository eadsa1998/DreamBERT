A couple of Viet vets that are very well trained have to take out a bunch of us civilian non-trained types on a mission. They are upset because our lack of training could get us or them killed. We enter the enemy camp. I run and hide in a corner when people come by. The teachers can't see me, but the students can. I follow a guy and ask him if he'd mind answering a few questions. He's suspicious, but agrees. I ask him if there could be peace between them (the Arabs) and the Israelis. He say, "No!" I write his quote on the palm of my hand, "The pain is --- we are different. Our high schools differ." I ask him if I can borrow a piece of paper to take notes on. He says yes and tells me I should have come prepared. [BL]
