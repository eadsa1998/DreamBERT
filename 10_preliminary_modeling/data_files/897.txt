A young boy is riding a horse. He's doing trick stunts to show off. He's now off the horse, trying to go into a building on campus with no authorization. A security guard stops him. I walk up behind him. I'm on my way to teach a class. I vouch for him though I don't know him. He looks at me, surprised. I walk down the hall. I see a group of people. They are the class. The boy ducks into a room just before my classroom. I open the door and go in. I say, "I know who you are, so don't get into trouble, or I'll get into trouble." He says surprised, "How can you know who I am?" I think, "You're bluffing." I say, "No, you are John Travolta. I knew it when you were riding the horse. You stuck your foot out, and it was arrogant. Only boys from New York do it in that style, and only 4 of them like you did, so you have to be John Travolta." Then I say, "Don't worry, I won't tell." He looks at me like he likes me. I beat a hasty retreat. I look at my watch and say, "Oh, I'm 6 or 7 minutes late for my class." I go next door where my class is waiting. It's like a library or a book store, so I figure I'm teaching something about writing. Later, I'm lying in a bed in my classroom. The boy is sitting on the edge of the bed beside me. We are talking. At one point, he hugs me and I can feel the largeness of his shoulders/body that denotes a grown man. I think, "Oh, goodness, he really is John Travolta." I then realize the near sexual aspects of the position and firmly tell the little boy to stop playing now. He wants to continue but I tell him, "No." He sits on the edge of the bed and we talk. There is some flirtation (sometimes there is a sense of my brother Dwight in him).
