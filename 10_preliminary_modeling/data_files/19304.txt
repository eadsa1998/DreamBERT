I was in school but not the school I go to and we were studying serial killers. One of the serial killers killed over a 100 people in less than a month. This guy had a really gross long beard and wasn't clean at all. I remembered that one day me and one of my friends were in a park and there was a hole in the ground and the serial killer was in the park and he told us to look in the hole. My friend did and there was a bomb in the hole and as my friend was looking in it the bomb went off and she died. I somehow got away before the killer killed me. I was then afraid he was going to come after me, but we then read that he died.
