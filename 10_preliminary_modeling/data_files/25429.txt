 I'm with my friend Matt Yams. He is telling me about something that happened at his place of employment, The Greasepit. The cash register broke and the lights went out. Money was stolen. People came back at 3:00 am to get the money. Matt had waited for them, but had not waited long enough. Matt and I are near the American Legion building in Oak Valley. He puts some videos from Hollywood Video, and I put some strips of my stratographic column from Historical Geology, into a manhole cover. <br/
