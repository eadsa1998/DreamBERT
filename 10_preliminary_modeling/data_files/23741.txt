I was at the Moose Hill Orchard [in New Hampshire, I worked there picking apples in 85], I woke in the bunkhouse and saw the pond down the hill.  It was beautiful.  I thought - I don't remember driving here, is this real?  The bed and window were vivid, the feel of the bunkhouse.  I realized I was the first to arrive at the bunkhouse and must set up my apple crates around my bed.  I started doing that.  (Happy that I was really there.)  I was in the apple storage building.  The woman I spoke to on the phone was there, helping me find Macouns [my favorite apple].  I saw the spotted skin of Macouns.  I looked in drawers under big tables for them.  I was happy there.  It was beautiful and peaceful and something I really wanted to do.  I felt though like the decision had been made too quick, without enough preparation.  I just arrived there all of a sudden.
