Ginny and her crazy older husband and I are in an airplane. He is the pilot. He laughs crazily and only flies us in a straight line back and forth, nearly hitting tree tops. Ginny and I just look at each other and shake our heads. Finally he stops teasing us and lands at the embassy. He pounds on the door, yelling, "Nicholas." We go in. Ginny gets a phone call from her young, nice lover. She has to decide between him and her husband. She looks for the phone. At first it looks like an elephant hitting his ear on a gong, but some man points to a big spoon and a dinner plate labeled "Plate" where she hits it with the spoon. The young man says he's coming to her. I ask her what she's going to do because here comes her husband. She's going to choose the young man, but is afraid to tell her crazy, dangerous husband.
