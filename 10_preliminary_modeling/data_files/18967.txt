This dream started, if I remember, I was just being dismissed from a Marine Corps drill, and it happened to be in an airport. And I went immediately when I was dismissed over to one of the planes. And one of the planes that I remember vividly was a yellow beach craft bonanza. It was the plane that I got into. If I remember correctly, I had a choice between one with a yellow stripe and one with a red and yellow stripe. I took the yellow stripe bonanza, but it wasn't mine. It was somebody else's, and he flew it, some unidentifiable friend of mine whose plane it was. We took off and circled around the rest of the guys that were in this Marine Corps organization, and I remember thinking about how impressed everybody would be that I would be in this beautiful plane, this real fast plane, that it's a real sleek, real good-looking airplane. And then if I remember right, the friend that was flying me to get where we had to go -- I think we were going over to his house, I don't believe it was my house, it might have been -instead of flying through the air, we flew through a tunnel, a real long, long tunnel. It was a well-lit tunnel. I remember going real fast through this tunnel. And on one of our voyages through this tunnel, we either landed purposely or the plane stopped, and one of my professors, the professor I have for oral interpretation, came out of the wall. It all seemed very logical, him coming from someplace in this tunnel where he was having a class at that time. And he was asking me what I was doing there during a school day; it was Thursday. And I told him that I didn't have any classes on that day, and he believed it. Then I remember the professor, myself and my friend having a long conversation in this sort of tunnel like.
