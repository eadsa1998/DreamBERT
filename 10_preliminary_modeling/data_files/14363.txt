I was watching a movie, although it was real sometimes. It was at a carnival. Two people had died and were now ghosts. They were trying to recreate the death with someone (when it was real, this person was me). Some people came and we went into the back room to do it. There was an oven in the corner and it was on. I had to climb over it, I think, and there was no room to move and it was hot. I was then a doctor and on the street. I had a table/bed thing. I needed to do an emergency surgery. I got this little blowup black pillow and put it on the end of the bed. I told people to get ready because I had to go pee. I went into the toilet cubicle. Then I was driving with Mom and I think we got lost. I was talking to Mom and Ezra and she was telling us about a dream she had and Ezra was getting angry, shouting "I don't care!" and I said "I do".
