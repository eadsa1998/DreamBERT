My graduating class and others whom I didn't know were at a party that was being given by a friend of mine (I haven't seen him in seven years). There were few girls (I only remember four and they were friends of mine). The place was familiar; it was the auditorium of the last school I went to; there weren't any tables or chairs.  There was only a new, yellow, medium-sized car. It seemed that it was going to be raffled, but the boy who gave the party was its owner. We were drinking champagne, all dressed formally and the orchestra was starting to play when we heard a noise coming from the car and it shook, a classmate shouted, "One!" I was amazed, the owner of the car went towards it and looked at it with worry and went away later. Suddenly a similar but louder noise was heard and I heard, "Two!" Many people were worried and one could hear murmuring all over the room. Then I saw that some were putting their glasses on top of the tables (which weren't there previously) and I saw a group of ladies and gentlemen, maybe the parents of some of the kids that were there (they also weren't there at the beginning). These people looked at everyone with amazement and suddenly a third noise was heard and then a "Three!" Many ran to the door to get out. The car was shaking and smoke started to come out of it. I was at the door and trying to get out and then I saw myself outside. There was an explosion, the car blew up and the roof of the room was destroyed. The car's owner looked at it sadly, while sparks were coming out of it. Nobody was hurt, the car was on fire, but was not being consumed. Then I awoke.
