I was in a classroom and a bunch of kids were selected to go on a field trip with these strange people. As we went, we found out we were being kidnapped. They took us to a hideout. Polly and I went next door where we watched a girl go round and round the roller rink. We commented that that was probably how she had lost so much weight and was such a lovely shape. We then ran outside to a pay phone to call the police and tell them that we had been kidnapped. Then one of the strange people came to get us. They took us to the curb of a major intersection. The police then arrived with two scared children in the back and a strange man in the front. The man was very scary looking (bloodshot eyes, crooked teeth). The kidnappers told us to get into the police car, but we didn't because we knew that they were also kidnappers. We got into a van and headed towards another hideout. Along the way I saw my father and told him what had happened. He didn't do anything. I was back in the van heading through terrible neighborhoods. I closed my eyes and didn't think about what was outside. When we arrived to the hideout there was another ugly man with a cut off hand. There was blood everywhere. We then went to a mansion where my friend's father gave me a gun. I couldn't put the gun together. Finally I was able to and shot the strange people. Then we were rescued.
