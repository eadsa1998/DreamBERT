I was led to a small kind of hut or treehouse by a dog I was watching.  His urine smelled like spearmint.  The clubhouse was in an area with lots of plants about where the back of our neighbors the Herman's place would be.  My mother followed my freshman English classmate Samantha up a different way.  My crush Jose was standing in the corner.  There was some conversation going on.  Jose did the little knuckle-nudge thing to each of our chins.  My mother and Samantha continued to talk but Jose beckoned me to the corner.  "I didn't want to have to say this to anybody..." he said what sounded to be that he didn't like the "Parent Promises."  That is what I heard but not exactly what he said, I think.
