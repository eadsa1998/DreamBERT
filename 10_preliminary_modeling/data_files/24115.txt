      The one good friend and the other guy were lost, wandering around in some unknown place. I happened to be guiding the way, but it started to get dark and everyone was a little nervous. Eventually we found some muddy cliff to climb, and on the other side there seemed to be a small town. We ended up meeting three strangers and staying with them at their house.
