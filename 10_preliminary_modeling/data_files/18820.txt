I dreamt I was with a girl that I have dated. She is 18 years old and I am very fond of her. I dreamt that I was trying to tell her how much I liked her, but every time she looked at me, I couldn't find the words to say. It was both a frustrated feeling and a perplexed one. She had to go home, and I hated myself for not saying what I wanted to. We were in my car. <br/
