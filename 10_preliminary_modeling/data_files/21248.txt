I ran my car thru a big bank of snow on the road. In the screw dept. there was jewelry all over the floor that girls were sorting. Joe Grabar and I had to walk thru different aisles to get by the gems. I was in a hospital. My brother Steve was there. I stepped on a stairway and it was full of shoes. I came to the bed or table where Steve was and to my surprise Tony Marlot was there dressed in white and was supposed to be a doctor.
