I was on Movie Collector and had added Ocean's Eleven. Robert Knepper was in it, according to the cast list and I was thinking that I didn't remember him in it. He played T-Bag (Prison Break) in it though. They were also escaping from prison and some people knew so they were putting plaster around where they were escaping from so no-one could see it, but they could easily break it to get out. In 'real life', T-Bag had killed someone. I was getting married, but it was a fake, so I could get out of the country and we were going to England (it was weird though). The marriage was to Michael Scofield (Prison Break). T-Bag disrupted it and I yelled at him. Then there was a party and a fat girl was dancing. Then I was on Facebook and Salim had commented on a picture of my 'parents' saying "no wonder your nose is so ugly" or something like that.
