My wife Bonita and I were in some mountains, on a ski slope.  At one point we were right under a ski jump.  I rode around a mountain with someone in some type of conveyance to get a better look at the slopes or something.  Then I started climbing a mountain with Alberta.  It was sort of like a pyramid, in that steps were carved into the sides, and it was fairly easy to climb.  When we got very high, though, the steps became very narrow and slightly sloped on the treads-but by the time we realized it, it was too late to go up or down.  And as we stayed in one spot, clinging to the side of the mountain, I became less and less sure of my grip.  Alberta was calm and almost resigned-to keep me from panicking, I felt.  I was desperate to find something to grab hold of.  Suddenly I saw a fire extinguisher on the side of the mountain.  I didn't want to lunge for it, for fear I would pull it loose, so I slowly took a firm grip on it.  It was a better grip than I had had before, but I was still almost crazy with fear, because there was no way to get down.
