Mom and Dad were getting ready to take a trip and that for some reason they were going to go to Eastport Airport and fly to Westport Airport, which seemed really, really strange because they could just drive to the Westport Airport. And so when they were in the parking garage, everybody was oohing and ahhhing over their car and stuff, like they always do, and for some reason we had all of my equipment set up outside, and I had to bring it inside because it was going to rain. And I just took it one piece at a time and started bringing it inside, but I didn't get too far because Mrs. Dubois came over and said she was going out of town. And her daughter wondered if I wanted some Halloween things that she had. And then I woke up.
