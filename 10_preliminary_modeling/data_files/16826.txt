My mom was baking me a B-day cake and she, Lori and I were going to celebrate. Nan and Jan, my mom's boyfriend's two daughters, showed up as we were lighting the candles. They said they needed a ride somewhere. We all got in the car to take them where they needed to go. Jan got out of the car and went inside a house. We were sitting in the car waiting for her. I got out of the car and started kicking it, screaming, "This is bullshit! It's my birthday! Can't you guys find someone else to chauffeur you around?" Then my dad was there and he was bitterly angry with me. He said, "Now I know what Lori was talking about, I see how you are." I said that I was sorry but he wouldn't listen to me.
