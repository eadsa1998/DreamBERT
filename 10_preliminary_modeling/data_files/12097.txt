I was at school/shop. Calvin and Silas sat in front me and this girl I was friends with sat next to me. She got moved. I was saying how I watched Lost, Alias and something else. I ended up at some cops house that was in the middle of some water. He couldn't swim. Mischa Barton (as Marissa from The OC) was there. There was a fire in the house and she got out, then I forgot how to swim and I went underwater. The people thought that it'd take days for me to get back. But I got back in 10 minutes. The cop was angry. He got everyone to line up on this ledge. He threatened to throw a snowball. I was close to him and he threw it while looking at me and I ducked and fell into the water. He had aimed at another person on the ledge behind me, which was a bit higher. Calvin was next to me and I whispered for him to move. He got away, but the cop let everyone off. Later, I was in a spooky shop where there were lots of Goosebumps books. The cop kept picking on me. This scary dude got Calvin, Silas and Samantha. The cop took me to some strange place with monkeys. There was a pool thing and I didn't want to get in. He looked like Tim Brunero when we were there.
