 A woman I just met last at our party named Stephanie Peterson stops by our house with a mini green and white basketball. She is on her way home from work at the malt shop. We talk a bit. I tell her to hold on a minute and I'll grab my shoes and we can go play basketball. She has long curly blond hair. We talk about my roommates Stephen Ramos, Norman Noman, and Jack Thigpen. I tell her they're all gone, on dates. She seems interested in Jack. I really want to spend time with her, to get to know her better. I imagine, or think, that the basketball court is outdoors. I might be able to show off and dunk the mini ball.
