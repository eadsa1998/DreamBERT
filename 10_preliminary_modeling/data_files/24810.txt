I was at summer camp and there were all these duffle bags supposedly full of artifacts from hundreds of years ago, and we had to break into the bags. There was tons of cash inside. Then people started getting this disease where they would fall asleep with their eyes open, then they died. One group of kids was trying to figure out how to make Coca-Cola out of water and dirt, and my group was trying to figure out how to cure the disease. I don't remember whether we succeeded. Setting: It was summer camp but it was set at my school. Characters: Patty is my friend from school. She died. The counselors were all counselors from my summer camp. The rest of the kids I didn't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It wasn't a particularly enjoyable dream, but what's weird is it wasn't like a scary dream because of the disease. It was still kind of playful.
