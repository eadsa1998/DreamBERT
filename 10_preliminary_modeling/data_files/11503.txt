This dream has been recurrent at the rate of twice a week since 11-10-50. Dreamer in the dream is in the US Army in combat in Europe. Subject's company has been ordered to capture a specific hill. After securing the hill further orders demand that the company secure positions in the line of advance at the base of the hill. While charging down the hill with three buddies one of the buddies hollers, "Hit the dirt." Everyone starts to dig in except the subject who, for some reason which he can't explain, remains erect. A shell explodes and all are safe except the subject who is killed.
