I was beside the schoolhouse of my boyhood days. I was surprised I only had a tee shirt on and was nude below my waistline. I looked at the boys catching ball on the playground behind the school. We walked up the alley on the end house and the people in the house had a big pile of ripe tomatoes on the lawn for sale.
