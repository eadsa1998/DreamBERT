Again, I'm back at Plainview High School. This time, I have a schedule. I have Geometry/Trigonometry and a lot of other classes. They are easy classes, but I was happy I'd understand the material. I remember being in the cafeteria. Somebody asks me a question. I think he asked something like, "Yes or no?" and I don't even know the question. All of a sudden there are a lot of people around me (mostly girls), and I don't know why. There's a small wheeled chair type device there, and I get on and ask Eva to push me, as fast as she can. She pushes me really fast, and it's very fun. Then I see I'm about to hit a wall and I somehow don't get hurt. Mrs. T. tries to explain something to me, which I don't think I really understand at the time, but looking at my schedule, I see somewhere, for some reason, it says something like, "pregnant dog" and I remember that Mrs. T. was trying to explain that to me. I still don't know what it meant, though.
