I was planning to "fly around the world in one day-without a plane."  Actually I only planned to fly from Miami to my hometown-but the principle seemed to be the main thing.  I made a practice run from Dallas to my hometown, with my wife Bonita monitoring my progress on the ground.  I considered carrying her on my back as I flew, but thought it might make me too heavy, so she walked or drove.  I attained fantastic speed-faster than I had ever flown before, faster even than jet planes.  It was so fast that I was worried about my landing.  I tried to pick out a spot where it had been raining, so the ground would be soft.  I was successful in finding such a place, surrounded by green hills, and grabbed some tree limbs on my way down to help break my fall.  It was a pretty smooth landing.   Somewhere after that we met Evie Marche and I told her of my plans.  She didn't seem to understand too well.  Later on we were at Mother's house and were watching Warner Wolf on TV.  Then Warner was there in the living room with us, and I was telling him of my plans.  I suggested he announce it on his show sometime.  The living room was much narrower than Mother's, and a mirror image of it as far as arrangement is concerned.  When it came time to eat, Gaylen Tuttleson was there, or else Warner became Galen, and he wanted to look through Mother's books on either side of the fireplace.  I was pleased that there were so many good ones, and I was late getting to the table because of pointing them out to him.
