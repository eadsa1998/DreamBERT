I was planning on going to a big formal dance, one of the Mather dances to which the girls invite their boyfriends. I was very worried about who to ask, and for some reason I didn't want to ask Milt. A girlfriend of mine I don't know who, got me a blind date for the affair. The night of the dance I received a pink camelia, but it was not as beautiful as I expected, so I was disappointed. I remember that it was 9 o'clock that evening, and the fellow I was going with had not come for me. I tried to call Milt because I was certain that he would go. I was unable to reach him for a long time. It seemed like I was calling him by long distance, and I was sure the operators were listening to us, when I finally got to talk to him. He came right away, but we didn't go to the dance. I seemed to have forgotten all about it. He surprised me very much slipping a diamond ring on my finger. I had no idea that he was going to propose to me. He told me all about the house which he had almost finished building. I remembered that he had started it 6 months ago, and when I asked him why it was started to long ago, he turned his head away and looked a little bit ashamed, telling me that he had started it for some other girl. I didn't feel jealous though. We were both extremely happy, and talked for a long time making plans. The setting of the dream was not too clear. I think the last part was somewhere near my home. It was a long dream and once my whole family was there. They were all very happy for us.
