I remember I wanted to swim in a swimming pool. I brought all my swimming apparel. There wasn't much light in the place; it seemed to be around dusk in the wintertime. The place where the lockers were was dark and behind it there was an enormous wall covered with green that looked like a giant creeping vine which covered the whole wall. When I decided to go into the pool, I discovered that the water was a dark color. Without being afraid that something would happen to me, I got in. I wanted to swim, since I know how to swim, but I realized with surprise that the water was thick, like mud, and that, therefore, I wasn't able to make the appropriate movements for swimming. This thing bothered me and for a moment I thought that I would die, swallowed by the mud; that is, that I would sink. At this moment I awoke, rather scared.
