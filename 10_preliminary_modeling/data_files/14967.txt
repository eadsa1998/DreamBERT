I was on a playground thing on an oval. I was with Elijah and Ezra. There was some stuff up high and we were trying to get over it. Ezra carried me over some bit. I got stuck and held onto a wall crack. We were also on a time limit. Elijah was working his way over to help. A brick started falling near me and I was like 'Oh my God I'm going to die!'. Where I was, was about the height of a house. I left where I was and held onto another bit. Elijah was saying that I was light -- when Ezra had carried me earlier, so had Elijah at one point. He said "I don't know why it's so hard to get over you", which had something to do with the carrying. I said "... coz I'm awesome?". I got down and was singing I Don't Want to Get Over You in my head. I went under this thing to find something. I went under to this other bit, and I can't read the next bit but it had something to do with Elijah and I thought it was funny and I laughed. I saw Mom and I ran to her and it was raining.
