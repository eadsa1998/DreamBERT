First, me and Courtlyn were at this store. For some reason we couldn't go past this certain point that I wanted to go past. Then we went to her house, but it wasn't her current house, it was a huge mansion. I remember baking something sweet. Later that day, I went back to the same store with Sandy, Lynne, Claire and Brian. We did go into the part that I really wanted to go, but it wasn't all that exciting after all. But it was still pretty good. We all had bags, so we played "find the bag." I hid my bag behind a counter, but no one else had hidden theirs yet. Then Lynne went behind the counter and hid her bag there too, but she didn't see mine. Instead, she started babbling/shouting on and on about how it was the best hiding place. Brian, Claire, Sandy and I heard, but none of us went to find hers there. Setting: In a big store and a big mansion. Characters: I know Brian, Lynne, and Claire, but not very well. Sandy and Courtlyn are my really good friends. I can picture myself at a big store with them, but not with Brian, Lynne or Claire. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, worried. It was VERY weird. None of it (well, most of it) could never happen.
