I am at a boarding house and taking my pills. I couldn't remember how many I took, then didn't know how many more to take. A man said to me, "You shouldn't take pills in public where kids can see you." I make a sarcastic remark that people can take pills in restaurants. It's not against the law. I was mad that he'd expect me to get up and walk when it was so painful. [BL]
