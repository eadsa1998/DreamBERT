I dreamed I flew. I didn't feel my body. I was a cloud over the ocean. I felt happy, but I didn't have a body. I could look at the big ships, but felt far from them, although I was on top of them. It was a strange feeling. I was like a cloud, but I didn't have any shape or body. I was vaporous and transparent. It was only an instant and then I felt that I fell and fell and instead of crashing, I went right through the ship, the fish, the sea birds without feeling anything. It was a strange feeling. I was, or was conscious of being, but I wasn't limited, that is, things just didn't affect me. It was a calm but strange dream.
