I dreamed that I was a member of a gang which was being hunted down for some illegal activity that I can't remember. However, I felt all the while as if I were playing a game. I felt thrilled and excited. The other members of the gang were friends (male) whom I had gone to high school with. I remember one, in particular, who was leader of my gang. I had dated him in high school once in a while. The gang and myself were hiding behind some huge marble pillars high up on a mezzanine in a building somewhat like a bank. Police were below us and shooting at us. Several members of my gang had already been killed. The leader of the gang was below near the police. He and some remaining members were in a position to watch the shooting and seemed quite worried about me. I could hear the leader asking "is xxx all right?" They haven't shot her have they?" I can only remember that I was hiding crouched behind a huge pillar feeling sure that the police couldn't shoot me.
