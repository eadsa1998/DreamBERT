I dreamt I woke up at 8.  I went somewhere to a gravelly field; I was supposed to buy a unique flower for the shop that looked something like the protea; it was expensive and I didn't trust myself to find one of good quality.  I passed a sort of trailer I think with showers in it and went and sat in the car.  There was scuffling on top of the dashboard; it was a mouse, and our cat Nina came and quickly caught it before I could reach it.
