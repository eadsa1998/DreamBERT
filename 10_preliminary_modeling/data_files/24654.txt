I was at my friend's house and we were drawing a comic strip together. We went downstairs to get a snack (there was a man on the stairs in a green suit), and as soon as we stepped on the first step we went through a hole in the ground. The sides of the hole looked like we were going through a time warp or the black hole. We didn't know what was at the end or the bottom of the hole. When we got to the bottom of the hole we screamed. We were in a cartoon. We wanted to find out what cartoon we were in so we walked down the street. Setting: First it was at my friend's house, then it was in a cartoon. Characters: My best friend Helen; Helen's dog, Lucy; her mom, Joan and her dad, Bill; her sister Julia. I don't know who the man on the stairs in the green suit was. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, surprised. When I was at Helen's house, I was happy, but when we fell through the hole I was surprised and scarred (sic) that we would keep falling.
