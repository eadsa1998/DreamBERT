I forget most of the dream, but I was at my friend's house with her, her mom and her dad, and I was answering phone calls. Nobody knew who I was and there were a lot of hangups. Setting: At my friend's house. It looked just the same. Characters: My friend, me, and her mom and dad. Feelings and Thoughts: Stupid. This happened yesterday, but there weren't so many hangups.
