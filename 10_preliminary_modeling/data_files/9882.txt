Wendy returns from England. Why? because she had an unhappy love affair and the man said he hated being with her. But she was in good spirits again. Big party going on. I see Reynaldo as a boy of 14 walking upstairs with fist raised like a revolutionary sign, then coming down with "Heil Hitler" salute: I run and grab him and slap him and say: "Don't you know Hitler is dead? Don't you dare play like that again!"
