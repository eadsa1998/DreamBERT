Chuck, one of the men of that previous dreams group, doesn't want to share his feelings and suggests the democratic nonsmoking group meet to discuss how not to participate in the feeling sharing part. I'm trying to convince them to try it; they will feel much better. One man says, "But it is too dangerous and hurtful." I explain patiently that if one lets the feelings out when they are small, there is no harm or danger. It's when you keep them stuffed inside until they grow and grow that they can explode and hurt. He's not convinced.
