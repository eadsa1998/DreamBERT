I went to the church to hear a lecture by Dr. D. on "The Holy Grail." Instead of the minister, however, a stranger appeared in the pulpit and began a rambling talk on architecture. I was completely distracted from the subject when a girl of about sixteen walked down the left hand aisle and very cleverly stood on her head near the door of the minister's study. This was not the gross performance that might be supposed; she kept her skirts confined between her knees.
