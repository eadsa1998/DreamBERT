["Celeste and champagne."] Celeste R. is asking me questions. I tell her about my poetry. She asks me if I want champagne to drink. I say well, that's the odd thing about me. Champagne tastes good but I don't drink it. I don't like the way it makes my heart feel. I am explaining myself to her like something is wrong with me for not drinking Champagne.
