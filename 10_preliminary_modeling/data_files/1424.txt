I am in bed with Merle. We've been sleeping together for a week. This time, he puts his arm around me and touches my breast. I feel queasy. He wants sex. I might have known this would happen. I feel like giving up and pretending for him. I am very annoyed about it. Then I say, "No." It was hard to say but I say, "I've had to do this a lot and I don't want to make love to someone when I don't feel like it." He complains and I continue to say no.
