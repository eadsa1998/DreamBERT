Frank and I are on vacation trip to Europe with the children. At a hotel we see a storm. The windows are open. It rains in. Lightening in three places. See a dark cloud: then the storm passes and we go on with our trip but with only one child: Wally. I have left Zena and lose Wendy and Reynaldo! We are very far away and worry about how they will find us. I call on the telephone: vain hope I think, but while I am still on the telephone they walk in the door. "A miracle," I say.
