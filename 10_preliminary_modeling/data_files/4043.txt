["You must marry me"]  I am a young beautiful woman. A handsome but isolated man adores me. He  is abrupt and silent about his feelings but they are strong. He loves  me. He orders me to marry him. He says I can not leave his mansion until I agree to be his bride. I refuse to be forced. He watches as I go about my daily tasks. I go outside and find a bright red sports car all frozen in ice, I push it around to get into the drivers seat. It slides like it is on ice. I thaw it out enough to get in. I pull off the sidewalk into the street. A car full of young men beep and wave, calling out to me. I ignore them. I drive down the street, turning right at a light, Now  am back in the mansion. I am carefully gathering up information about the man who loves me. I begin to understand him and appreciate him. Now I am attracted to him. He invites me to dine with him. I take great care in dressing up as beautifully as I can. He is filled with desire and longing for me. I feel the strength of his feelings. I tell him he must let me go. He can't bear to do that. I know he must do that so that I can come to him of my own free will. It is  a powerful emotional struggle for him.
