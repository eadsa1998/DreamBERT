I see a beautiful woman laying on a gravel island. I then go to the top apartment where a very rich man lives. I think no one is home, so I sneak in and peek out the window. It is clear that the view is perfect for seeing the girl on the beach. Suddenly I am aware that he is still there. I lay down behind the couch, between it and the window, and hide. The rich guy and Jerome walk back and forth, standing very close and caressing. It's a very intimate relationship. Jerome goes to the window to look at the girl. He is standing too close to me. I am afraid he'll discover me. The rich man laughed seductively and teases Jerome about his gift to him (the sexy-looking girl). Jerome and the rich guy stand near the couch and kiss. I am afraid I'll sneeze or cough and they will find me. Then Jerome's wife comes in. She is shocked. She tries to eat a few potato chips Jerome has in a snack bag. He won't share. She's upset and pleads. "You won't even share food." Suddenly Jerome, leaning on the couch, sees me. He's angry and starts to kick me. I growl, "Don't you dare kick me." He stops. Then I pretend to have passed out behind the couch from the water drink which was really vodka. I pretend to be very drunk! They are suspicious and finally believe me. I escape.
