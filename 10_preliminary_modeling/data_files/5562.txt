[1997-05-18] We're in some kind of room in the West Haven industries division of BESB talking about the cigarette assembly project and how they had to make 3 cigarettes per minute and they were showing us all these cigarettes and how they go together and stuff. It was all smoky, I could smell the smoke, I hate smoke and I was really conflicted because I didn't think it was ethical to put people in this kind of job because it meant that they would have to be around this kind of smoke. But this lady was doing her job and she liked it, and she was able to meet that production rate that they wanted.
