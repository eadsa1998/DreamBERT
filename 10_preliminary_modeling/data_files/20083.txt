I was in a large expensive house. In a little while I was a man leaning on a cane and showing off. The cane had a monogram reading FDR. I commented that he was not using his own cane. He admitted it. The patient resembled a patient on the ward named Sopern. (This patient was of inferior intelligence and was very basic, that is, unsophisticated. He said that he had been arrested because while he was bedding with a prostitute, her 10-year-old daughter had asked him to play with her sexually and he had done so. He was accused of molesting the child.)
