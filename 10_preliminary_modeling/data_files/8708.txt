I met with Bill C about my leaving. He asked me if there was anything I wanted to say. I hesitated for a few moments then said, yes there is, though I'll likely regret it. I began by talking about our working relationship for most of my first three years there. When I began to talk about the change that occurred during the last 8-10 months, he rolled his eyes, and lowered his head to rest in the palm of his hand as his elbow rested on the table. I asked him what that look was for or about.
