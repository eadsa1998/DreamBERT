I see Mary, full face. She looks good, but has a slightly worried expression on her face. I am trying to hurry her to get ready to go to the beach (I think that is where we are supposed to go). But Mary tells me she doesn't think she can make it. She complains about something in her eye. She is seated and combing -- brushing -- her hair which she has down, around her shoulders. This is the full, frontal view I have of Mary in this dream.
