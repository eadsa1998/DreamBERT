I had a really crazy dream. I dreamt that Sandra was in town and it was kind of close to my graduation, and I had a Josie Wileski (?) CD that was kind of like the one she had. And now here's the crazy part. We were at this racetrack because we were going to watch the Grand Prix or a Festival of States parade; I can't remember which, but probably both. We were staying in this little hotel that was like had a view of the track, and there was this guy who was probably a veteran. He organized veteran parades that were like little things that took like ten minutes, and they ran by like every hour. And when they ran by, there was these rescue trucks with these sirens. Some made the standard warble sound, some made the back-up alarm sound, like that interval, and some just made a plain wail sound. And all these going by. Some honked their horns, some didn't. It made a big ruckus and it scared me really bad. And I was laying down in the bed at the hotel and I think Mom was there doing something, and I hear this and it was like totally commotiony. And then we were down there before the actual Festival of States parade was going to take place, and Sandra was there and Mom. I think Dad was there, but he was off helping one of the rescue guys. But anyway, there was this extra long parade by this veteran guy before the actual Festive of States parade started, and I figured, "Ooh, boy, I'd better get myself out of here." And so I said I had to use the bathroom, and I went into the hotel's bathroom and I was sitting there and sitting there and sitting there on the toilet, listening to these girls trying on clown dresses and commenting on how they looked. And I faintly, faintly heard all the sirens and rockets in the background, but I wasn't there. And before I said I had to use the bathroom, I was like sitting there on the blanket holding onto Sandra.
