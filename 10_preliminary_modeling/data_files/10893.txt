I dreamt I was in an 8 o'clock class with a girl who eats in our dining room, but is not in any of my classes. When I walked in, she was sitting there looking very tired. Her face was chapped, her eyes were red, and her hair was very straight and stringy. A very old lady whom I can't place, but seemed to know, had at the time come in and placed her hand on this girl's shoulder. How are you feeling, Pat? she asked. Pat replied that she was very tired. The lady asked her if it was a boy or a girl. She said it's a baby girl, but I just couldn't see missing my 8 o'clock class.
