I was in the basement of the Sears Roebuck store shopping around for some sort of present to give my mother. I was wandering around looking at various things and not really finding any of them suitable. I had already tentatively thought I might get her some silverware. I put some of the silver in my pocket and I was kind of worried in the dream that I might be picked up for shoplifting, even though I didn't intend to steal it. So I sort of inconspicuously got the silver out of my pocket and dropped it back in the display tray. I went out of the store and got on my bicycle and went up the street and started peddling home. The route I took home involved traveling probably something like 10 miles or so to get home, and this is a route which I've never been on in my life, but which I've taken several times in my dream before. My bicycle is quite hard to pedal on parts of this road, especially where it was rather hilly and several parts of it were on major highways and I had to be careful because of the traffic. I realized in the dream I hadn't taken this route in a long while and I had to be careful to take the right turns and everything. I kept recognizing landmarks every once in a while along the highway, and thru the towns the highway passed thru, so I knew I was on the right route. I was still a good ways along when I woke up.
