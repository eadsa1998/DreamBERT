We were going on a trip and I left my CD player in the house. I went back to get it and the piano was playing by itself. I tripped and fell and I saw someone in the living room. It was my dad but he scared the living daylights out of me. Then the scene changed and everyone was in the living room. Then my dad wanted to show me something upstairs. We went upstairs into my bathroom. It was different because there was a place where a light bulb should be above the bathtub and there weren't any shells on the shelf. My dad said there was this voice that gave him nightmares and was in them. He said it came from here. I told him to tell it to laugh and it did. It was the scariest laugh I've ever heard. But I wasn't scared for some reason and I just yelled back at it. I tried to find where it was coming from and it was coming from the heater. I tried to rip up the heater but it was too hot. Then my dad said it was the ghost of a football coach. The I woke up really freaked out. Setting: My house. Characters: My family - same as always. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, freaked out. It was a really scary nightmare.
