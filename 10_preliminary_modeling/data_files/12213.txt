The school was at the Royal Show. I had to do a project on how fast this ride went. It was really gay. We had to wear gloves. I didn't have any money. All of our bags were together; one had Hrvatski written on it. Samantha held my gloves. Nana was running a deli there. Elijah got a chocolate. Nana said she would pay for me.
