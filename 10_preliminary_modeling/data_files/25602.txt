 I am in a class of my psychology professor Marianne Stash. I stay after class and talk with Marianne a bit. I really like her: she is a good and smart professor. I tell her my aunt Willow Redding is a clinical psychologist, and ask her how many years of schooling it takes to be a clinical psychologist. She says it takes a long time. She isn't as interested in me and what I have to offer, as I am interested in who she is and what she has to offer. She leaves. I spend a long time trying to get my books into my backpack. This takes much more time than it should. The janitor woman turns the lights out when I am still in the building. I leave.
