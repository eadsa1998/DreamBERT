I dreamed I was the guard at a railroad control post. I was controlling the night trains in a well lit post, which was small. In front of me, across from the railroad tracks, were the main offices where the station master was. He was a person of about my size, about 5'6", and approximately 47 years old. He was working in his office when suddenly a cargo train with a few cars appeared. It stopped so abruptly that there was nothing we could do. We were surprised, he by a person of his size and age and I by a lady. I could make out her face. It was a person I know who works with me sometimes and whom I see for work purposes constantly. She must be about 28, older than me, because I am 25. Her sudden presence confused me and there was nothing I could do, not even defend myself, because she had a fire arm, a pistol, and she told me to get up against the wall. Then the man who worked with me helped me to disarm her. It was in that struggle that I woke up.
