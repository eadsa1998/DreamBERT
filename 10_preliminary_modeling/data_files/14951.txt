Dad, Ezra and I went to a cinema. There was a huge queue for the candy bar because all the workers (teenage girls) were on break. Dad and I were discussing movies. He said that all the Batman movies were good and I said no, Batman Begins was good, The Lame Knight sucked and the third one (which we'd just seen) was ok. I was then at home and I went to the toilet. There was a lot of poo in it and it was from Ezra. I went close to it for some reason and almost threw up.
