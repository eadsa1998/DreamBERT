This was a strange "dream within a dream." I was aware I was dreaming and I was also aware that I was dreaming I was dreaming. I was laying in bed with Ken and I remember trying to pull my pants down in bed so we could make love but I didn't really do it, although I really felt I was doing it. I also remember talking to him about what time it was -- dreaming I was talking in my sleep and certain I was really talking to him. I was surprised to find I hadn't done either thing although it was so real and I believed I had simply followed or went along with what was happening in the dream. Almost three levels of awareness, with the physical and awake me finally waking up to realize I'd only been dreaming.
