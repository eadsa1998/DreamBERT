Lifegame Roomset - small, high room - sort of an old school classroom, I think - pulling paper off a large board, taped to the sides - trying to do it neatly. The usual speech about setting it so they can get it. Soft carpet. Do we have something to put on the floor (like newspaper)? Outside room - a place where a lot of us are milling around, tables and benches, eating lunch. Is part of it outside or not? There's a kind of little terrace or platform - 3 or 4 steps up, then toilets to the left, maybe 4 or 5, and very busy. I need to go to the bathroom, and finally try to get up to one. Get beat out by a short-haired blonde girl. I guess I do get in shortly, and while I'm around here somebody is peeing and Sheryl J. is trying to read something out to a small group in front and has to ask for us to hold it a minute.
