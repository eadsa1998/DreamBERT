This dream is all about murder. A dangerous man has been allowed into the building I'm in. The building was like a hall or a school perhaps. It was evening and there are several people around I know including my brother, my friend Tim, and my partner. This man was apparently known to have been a killer in the past, but we didn't know that before he was let into the building. The rest of the dream is confused, but it ended with someone (I can't remember who) getting horribly killed.
