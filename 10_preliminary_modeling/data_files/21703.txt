I had a screen from a window. I held it in both hands and used it was a wing and I flew against the wind. I stopped where Rose Lasko, my Uncle John and other people had a picnic. I knew this was a dream and I looked at the people and they looked so real. I got home. I was nude. I had only a book to cover me. I wanted my Uncle John to get out of my way so I could get my clothes and dress. I was bashful. I closed the door when he came down the stairway.
