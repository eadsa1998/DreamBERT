It was raining in my dream and I was coming out of the hospital going over to another building. I remember that as I was running across I noticed the long line of people standing in line, out in the rain waiting to be seen by the doctor in the out patient Dept. Some were older men and women, and as I entered the hospital I remember feeling upset and despairing about seeing them out in the rain, waiting patiently. I thought that certainly other arrangements could be made for these people.
