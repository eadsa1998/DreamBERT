I went camping with my boyfriend and a few friends. We were falling asleep in the tent when I noticed a few frogs creep into the tent through a hole. I woke up my boyfriend and for some reason everyone was blaming me for the frogs. By then they were all over the place, jumping on our heads. The next thing I knew we were driving home with all the frogs in the car because I wouldn't let my friends kill them. I made them pull over so I could toss them into a stream off the side of the highway.
