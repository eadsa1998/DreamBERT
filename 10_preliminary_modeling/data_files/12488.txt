I had sport and Silas was there. I thought that I was in his class, but I wasn't. He was standing around though. I heard a girl saying "If you weren't a knowledge Sim, what would you do?" I remembered I had written that in my fat little notebook. She had read it. I looked in the book at that page and I had written stuff about Dmitri. Rebekah and Alyssa had a fight with me. They took my shoes. I went to sleep in Nana's room and they were going to cut my hair. They had big scissors. Nana woke me up and we both yelled at them. Ezra was there too.
