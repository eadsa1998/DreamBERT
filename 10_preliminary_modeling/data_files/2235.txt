I'm looking for a bathroom. I round a corner and am surprised to see Bonnie seated in the hall. She's volunteering to staff a room she sits next to and watches. I say "Hi," and then change my mind about the bathroom because police are coming. I go out looking for the exit. I see a man and he and I get into a water fight. We each have a garden hose and are pouring cold water on each other. I see his hair freezing into strands of ice. I decide to stop this before we get hurt. He's all curled up on the floor in the coldness.
