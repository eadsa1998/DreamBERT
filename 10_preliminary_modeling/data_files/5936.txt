Am in a hospital ward where people are all taking some sort of medicine and most objecting to it. A nurse hands me a glass some 2/3rds full of a watery, bluish liquid like weak milk. I am sort of sitting on very edge of bed and as I put my head back to raise glass and drink, I slip off bed to a standing position. Am aware that one is not permitted to leave bed or touch the floor and I pop quickly back on bed and start drinking again. But I slip again and still haven't tasted the medicine.
