I was at 'school'. There was this clothes shop and I was in there. This girl there used to be a guy. Her coat came off and I gave her my coat (which was black and big). I was trying to pick another coat for her. I complained about all the clothes. Darius had met this girl and was looking for her. He was bisexual. He thought he had found her, but it was a guy. Later I had messages from Darius and he wanted to know what his name was. His name was Allan Green. I had a message from Eugene but I don't remember what it said, but it was really funny. A lady saw me using my phone when I was texting Darius and she sent me to the office. At 2.55pm, Ezra got sent there too. I messaged Mom to get her to put $500 towards my car. She was getting a new roof in a few weeks.
