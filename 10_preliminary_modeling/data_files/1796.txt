I am in a house and it is crowded with lots of things and furniture. A small bird and a large blow fly come rushing in. I think it's a bee but someone reassures me it's a fly. There is a mask in a basket with a lid. I give it to a small boy and he takes it outside and dumps the old, musty, moldy mask. I feel relief. Suddenly the house is nearly empty. Lots of space. Only a stove moved in from a rental (our original old stove) and a table are left and I like it this way. The boy brings back the empty basket and I almost accept it back, but change my mind and give him the basket. I don't want it because it carries the odor and feel of the mask. I am outside. Two guys are up a telephone pole fixing the lines. They are hanging up there in a way that seems impossible, but they seem comfortable. One is there to "spot" the other guy in case he gets in trouble. They finish and come down the ladder and efficiently pack up their equipment. It was very graceful; each knew how to do each task and they just did whatever was closest at hand. I ride my wheelchair around their truck watching them and then I go to my front door and park the chair and walk in. [BL]
