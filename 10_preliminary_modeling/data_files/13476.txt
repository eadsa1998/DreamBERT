I was watching Gossip Girl for some reason. Blair was doing something and said her name was Leighton Meester. I told Ezra that was her real name. There were two guys and one was David Lee Smith and the other was made-up. I liked the made-up guy and he liked me. They made this funny face with their mouths open. I tried to take a photo but it took a while and they got bored and left. They were taking off their pants later to put a shirt on and were holding onto the rail of the stairs.
