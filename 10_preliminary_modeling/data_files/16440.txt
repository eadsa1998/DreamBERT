I finally got the gift that I had been wanting for some time. And, you know, I've been having these dreams. So I finally had it, and it was finally in my closet and I was so proud. And Dad was going to help me set it up in my sound studio, but first I had to learn how to flush the toilet without making it clog up. [laugh] And the trick of it was you had to hold down the handle until just after the stuff had made it down, and then let it go immediately after that. And if you didn't let it go, or you let it go too soon, the whole thing would be for naught, which for real life, in both of our toilets, we have to hold it down, but it's not the end of the world if we let it go too soon. So a couple, I tried it like three times, but it didn't really work right, and we had this big Jacuzzi like tub in the upstairs bathroom and Dad had to take a dream clog stopper out of the tub to kind of let some more air into the pipes, I guess. That was crazy. And, oh my gosh, there was a big flash of lightning outside. But anyway, I can't remember what happened after that, but somebody was going on a plane somewhere. I think it wasn't going to be Mom and I going up to Jackson. I think it was going to be Dad and Mom going somewhere, and I was finally going to get to investigate my gift. And I woke up before any of that could happen and realized it was a dream. If I keep having all these stupid dreams, I'm not going to know the real thing if it does happen. [laugh]
