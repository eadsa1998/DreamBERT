Last night's dream is vague to me.  There was a sort of hologram model of an island.  Very detailed.  It was solid, though.  I could feel the texture of it.  It was probably 5 feet in diameter and just as tall, and very intricate.  Then we were babysitting some cats, and somebody came to get theirs.  We had to separate the right ones - there were about 7 for two families, including our two.  I was also with a group of people, and we were going to go skydiving.  Not typical skydiving; parachutes were big inflatable type things.
