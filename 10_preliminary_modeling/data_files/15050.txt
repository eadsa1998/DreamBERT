I was watching Kenny vs Spenny [I watched it last night]. Spenny was chatting to some school girl with big boobs. He invited her to something and then I realised that she was only 13. Then he was drunk somewhere and had facial hair and was singing and then said "Heil!" at the end (like that little bit at the end of The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill) and I was trying remember what song it was from and I was thinking that it was Wishing (If I Had A Photograph Of You). I had to get Spenny approved by some insurance thing so that he could go into some shops. One was a kid's shop. Then Kenny and I were in a shop. I hadn't told him about Spenny and he had asked me not to. They had some lollies like those bracelets things. The 13 year old from before had a geometry test, but wanted to go out instead. I went to the park with Mom and Rover. There was a magazine with a diet plan where you could lose 2 kg in two weeks. Running was part of the exercise. I decided to use the mowed part of the oval to run on but Mom complained so I decided to stick to the abnormal route.
