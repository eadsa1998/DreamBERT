I was driving a new maroon car and realized when I stopped that I hadn't shifted gears, but had been driving in neutral all the way. The back door wouldn't close and I drove with one hand and kept trying to slam the door with the other. I arrived at my friend's apartment in M-- B--, but it was in C--. Everyone was walking around downtown C-- in beach clothes, very tan. My friend, her parents and several other girls were in the apartment. A man knocked on the door and said he had come to borrow something. He was eating sections of an orange. I remember remarking on the attractiveness of the kitchen. It was all red and white. There was a silent butler of bright red lying on the table. Some of my friends at the apartment were speaking of a birthday luncheon for another friend to which I had not been invited. One of the girls present was a casual friend at the U-- of W--, two were from M--. The girl from W-- was wearing a white half slip. I stood there in a black half slip.
