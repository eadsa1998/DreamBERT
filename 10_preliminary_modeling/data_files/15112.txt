I time travelled or something (it involved alternate realities and stuff). Ted Bundy was famous in a good way, although he had still killed. I was watching an interview with Will Arnett -- who was sometimes someone else -- and he had a young girlfriend once and there was a quote "I want to fuck her so bad". There was another video and Amy Poehler showed up at some event of his and he joked "not you". She was wearing a ballerina/fairy outfit with wings and had a wand (it was a reference to something). She went out in front of an audience and danced. Ted Bundy also had a girlfriend that he was going to marry. They were walking back to their house and something weird was happening. She ran into the house and he ran in after her. Then there was a gun shot and Jack (Lost) and I ran in. She got shot and Jack was angry and cried at Ted, "You did this!" and Ted was upset and said "No, I didn't. I love her," etc. I believed him. I think she died and they argued and then Jack and Ted left. I sat with her and it was pitch black. Then I heard someone move and say "don't look". I shut my eyes and I saw shadows as they left. I was really scared. I was trying to explain to people later that it wasn't Ted and that I'd seen the guy who'd done it but they wouldn't listen. Then I woke up [within the dream] and I was still scared and my heart was beating fast. I went out and Mom was on her computer and Darren was at the TV. I went to Mom and said I'd had a nightmare. Then Darren said he'd gone on my computer to print something out and that he'd found interesting dreams on there and had printed out copies. Ezra came out and they teased me about some dream, but I didn't know what dream it was. I went back to my room and I heard Ezra reading it out -- it mentioned Locke (Lost). I didn't recognize the dream. Cuddles was rolling around.
