I go out to this little island that's not too far from the mainland. I'm on vacation? Little house on island. Lucy is there. She's so cute, running around, being all courageous in the water. Climbing out windows. I want to buy some acid. Now there are a lot of people on the island - almost a party. I ask this guy who looks sort of like Kyle. I've know him in my past. He's changed - a little more sketchy. He says he'll get some. <br/
