There is an older woman, overweight, with long black hair, driving a car. She is stopped. either has already stopped for a reason or been stopped for some reason. She has her trunk open and takes a small box out of it. The things in the box appear to be something that you might use to repair a car. One piece looks like the connector piece of jumper cables. There is something on it though and the person with her looking at it thinks it is evidence that she killed someone. a relative. I'm watching the dream scene while listening to a conversation that is going on away from the scene. The scene is this woman driving, either on city streets or highways. It is dusk or dark because I notice the street or city lights. The conversation is about this woman the person she killed. They suspect her of killing one of her relatives. From what they saw in her trunk they are positive it was her. She is trying to justify it by saying how much he annoyed or irritated or bothered her. She was trying to make it seem that the murder was warranted.
