 I'm with a group of people including my friend Emerald Reinhold and her friends. I tell her that I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman. We talk. Many people are having a night for drinking Rolling Rock beer. I join in and say I'll drink (15 Rolling Rocks???) Someone is recording the number of beers that everyone wants. It costs five dollars for a 12-pack, which I think is cheap. I change my mind and say to Emerald that I would sleep in the same bed with a woman. I think may do this with intentions of sleeping with her in the back of my mind.
