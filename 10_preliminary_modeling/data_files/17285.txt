Dreamt of Sam Beckett at a party.  Was testing the caterer.  There were many dips for tasting, but they all tasted pretty much all the same.  In driving around the block of something, I saw a newlywed couple.  I was trying to figure out who the bad person was.  I saw people walk by.  My dorm floor mate Jupo with a halo of intricate spider webs above his head.  Sam and Al were talking alone, in the middle of a dispute.  Sam held me down for inspection, with one hand on my left breast.  " And down there's why", he said.  Finally he pulled my shirt up to reveal a blue-hoofed creature- a tattoo on the left side of my stomach.  That was the sign they wanted.  The caterer was the bad one.  I was then sitting in the passenger side of a car.  The caterer started cutting a grid into the windshield, cackling.  I screamed, and was now Sam.  I tried to climb into the seat behind, but it was reclined too far.  I managed to grab her left arm and hold her there, but she still cut my right hand as I struggled for control.  The cut went into my pinky, stopped partway by the nail.  Finally got her.
