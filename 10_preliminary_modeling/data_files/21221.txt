I heard Clyde Beatty was dead and was buried under where cars drove or under a road. I was a captive in the Japanese army. One Japanese tried to pick or flip the guard's gun off the floor and he was bayoneted thru the heart. He still came to me and wished me goodbye, shook hands with me before he would die and said, "You will be killed also." Ann was kidnapped and people would not believe that she was held a prisoner when we got a break and got away from the captor. I was walking in front with Ann and my sister Sue and Mary were behind us with guns. I had an automatic pistol in my hand, which was in my pocket. I was also a captive.
