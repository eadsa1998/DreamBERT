I am walking uptown on the sidewalk with a young person from the Book Cafe. I see Father Andrew coming toward me, hurrying to a meeting? I quickly say goodbye to my friend and turn around and run after Father Andrew. I don't reach him in time, as he gets into his car (a '38 Chevrolet) and he takes off. I follow on foot to the Fair or to a Church Bazaar where he is to speak. But I don't find him. Instead, I sit in a crowded High School classroom on a step leading up to the upper part of the auditorium. Then I go through the fair and buy lots of things, also remember carrying a heavy bag or box; we carry it together with another person whom I don't know. I see slippery places on the road, but don't fall. Finally, I buy some 10 cent bookmarks for our kids. ++ feeling
