Mom bought Ezra and I a present. His said "To Tom, from Izzy", with "Comment: Sam". I was confused about it but it turned out she had bought him a Supernatural bedspread and for both of us, three pillows. I took the one with Sam, because I figured Ezra would want Rover. The third pillow had Sam pointing.
