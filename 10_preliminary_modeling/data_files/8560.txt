I was driving through a parking lot getting ready to park outside of a grocery store. I've seen this parking lot before in a dream but it is unfamiliar in waking life. It was dark outside, very early morning, and not many cars in the lot. I finally parked in the second row from the front of the store, 3 or 4 spaces from the end of the row. It seems to me that there were some people, or at least one man, standing on a perpendicular sidewalk watching me. I have the feeling that he was watching my driving, though there was nothing wrong with it. I went in to the store and began down one of the aisles and then decided I needed a shopping cart so turned around and went back to the entrance to get a cart. The store seemed dark and dingy.
