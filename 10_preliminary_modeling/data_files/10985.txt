I was walking up Bascom Hill (University of Wisconsin campus) with my mother and met my friend Ann. Mother was going to a luncheon and walked on over the hill. Ann was directly in front of Bascom Hall (top of the hill), was carrying books and had on an outfit which she wore to class and which I always disliked. I was very anxious to impress upon her that my mother was going to a luncheon. Ann had a class halfway down the hill and I walked down with her. We stopped in front of the building which looked exactly as I consciously remember it.
