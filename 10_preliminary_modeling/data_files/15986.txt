We were at the Technical College and bumped into Mr Jennings. He asked if anyone else was coming to class today and I said 'there are no classes this week' and I mentioned that Friday had been the last day for results and he'd apparently forgotten and quickly ran off saying 'Shit! Shit!'. My first thought was that maybe he would pass Emmanuel despite him not handing in his assignment, and briefly pondered my result.
