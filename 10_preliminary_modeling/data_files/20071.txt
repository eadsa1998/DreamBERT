I was going to report for work in a printing plant. I had to climb three flights of stairs. Someone told me I was late and I'd better hurry. When I came to where the 2nd flight should have been, there was only a baluster there. It was quite tall. Where the underside of the next flight of stairs should be, there was only another stairway going back down. I was bewildered. I wandered in a daze until I came to an elevator and boarded it to try to get to the third floor. When I left the elevator, I stepped into a modern office. I felt awkward at first. I decided to pretend that I knew my way around.
