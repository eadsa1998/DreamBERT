This dream I am not a participant at any time. The dream first takes place in a train terminal. I see a boy and girl embracing. Some voice says that they both have one interest in common: oil. I then see two pipes which seem to be going up and down. The next thing I remember is their being married and settled in an apartment. There seems to be a story teller in my dream. He says that this marriage is a triangle including the man, his wife, and his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law continually called her daughter to remind her of appointments, etc. In the next scene the girl is making supper. She opens the icebox and I saw a gallon jar in the icebox. It contained huge pink and red roses in a fluid. On the bottom of the jar there is a label which gives a company name and says they preserve wedding flowers. The girl then looks into the stove. I see what appear to be different types of leftovers (meat pie, etc.) being reheated. The girl wonders if there will be enough and says she will just eat a little.
