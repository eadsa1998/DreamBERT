Am walking along an apartment house basement corridor to a room known as the "Doll Room." I have a doll with me and when I reach the room, a woman opens door and lets me in. Walls covered with shelves, all containing dolls. She asks if I have a stand to hold the doll in an upright position. I say no and then leave. Following day am riding a large tri-cycle bike in front of house and pedaling along down a two-foot wide curb on a retaining wall that curves around the apartment house. As wall gets higher and driveway alongside deepens, I stop the bike and jump down from the wall and walk into the same basement corridor as the day before. Go to the doll room, but things have changed and now the door has a number on it like a suite of rooms or an apartment. Also the door alongside has a number. Room I thought was the doll room has a light shining under door. I decide to try the second room, and as I go to knock, the door flings open and the woman standing there seems to know what I want. She points to adjacent door and without saying a word, then closes her door and I remain in corridor still not sure I am in right place.
