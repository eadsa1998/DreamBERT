I dreamt that my 19 year old brother and I had just left our house and were walking down our street. From a distance we saw two people (don't recall sex) on the corner. They seemed to be looking for someone to antagonize. It did not occur to me that we would be the unfortunate ones. When they saw us they began to throw sticks and stones at us. We turned back and started running down the street. We crossed the street and went through an open gate in a backyard (unfamiliar to me except that I seem to have seen this gate and yard before in my dreams.)
