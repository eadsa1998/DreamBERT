 I go into a house to rob it. There is an automatic teller machine. I use my card with the Discover logo on the back. My PIN number is 3134. I put the card in the machine rather than sliding it in and out. I end up getting a file-like packet about a woman. It contains all kinds of facts and figures. At the end of this huge file is email. There are some other guys there and they might be looting the home. I am worried that the owners might come home. A big dog comes in the living room. It is a nice dog, but I am still afraid of it. I go out the side door. I have a pillow with me. The people in the house have a stereo on so loud that I hear it loudly a few houses away. I run. I have trouble moving at some places. I jump over a fence and run through yards. I feel like I'm headed towards my friend Kevin Simpson's house in Wilmerton. Later, I go the house that we robbed and ask to borrow a cup of sugar, to see the damage. There is a young couple there. They are light hearted and optimistic. They don't seem to be taking any of the losses too seriously. They question me about the sugar. I say it's for frosting. When I realize granulated sugar isn't for frosting, I say I sprinkle it on top of cookies. The woman there is doing laundry.
