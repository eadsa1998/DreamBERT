 I'm in a third floor dorm room of some college that I get the feeling is down by the Brimson baseball field. There are other people in the room. We hear a buzzing that gets louder, and we realize that the smoke alarm is going off. We go out of the room, down the stairs, and outside. Not very many other people are evacuating. Form the outside I can see that there is smoke of steam coming from my window. It could be condensed air. I go back in. People are gathering things up from their rooms. Another guy and I squeeze into an empty elevator as the door closes. The fire is in the elevator! The carpeted floor beneath the button panel is smoking. It is a small, blackened area with an orange glowing spot and a small flame. I am barefoot. I tell the kid that I am with to step on the flame to put it out. He has boots on.
