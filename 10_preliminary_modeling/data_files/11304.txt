Somebody (someone unknown to me, but of obvious authority) accused me of a crime which I did not commit. I think the crime is murder. I'm not sure. At this time I was due to receive some sort of award in honor of some achievement. Because of the accusation, I do not receive the coveted award and I am heart sick. In my dream I am very aware of the feeling of outrage because of the injustice done to me. I finally awake with this feeling still persisting. I then feel very relieved that it was only a dream.
