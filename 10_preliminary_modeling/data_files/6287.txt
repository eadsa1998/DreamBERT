Last night I had a dream about my relatives. I was in my bedroom watching TV. I could hear a few people walking toward my door. As they entered, I noticed that it was my uncle and my aunt from Virginia. They talked really fast but I could make out some of the words. In the background, I could see my family and a couple of friends standing behind them. The main thing that my aunt and uncle wanted was to ask me about a girl that I dated. They were saying, "Who is she?", "What's she like?", "Where's she from?" I felt very uncomfortable and, besides, they weren't giving me the opportunity to answer. I tried to yell but I couldn't. It felt like I was on trial. I turned around and dove into bed because I didn't want to hear anymore. They turned around and left the room.
