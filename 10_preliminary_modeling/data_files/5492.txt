Dreamt of a flat, good sized box, and again I believe my daughter gave it to me. It was not a gift. It had quite a high priced price tag on it. I opened the box and inside were 6 bars of soap. So pretty, so lovely, and they were interspersed with designs between them. They were not neatly arranged, just random, with no pattern and I wanted so desperately to buy that box of soaps because I love nice soaps and I kept looking at the price tag and I couldn't see the price and I knew they were expensive and so I didn't buy the box of soap. I believe they were blue, a pale blue, and the designs which lay between the niches had roses and other flowers, pink roses and yellow roses and blue flowers and green leaves and just really pretty box of soap.
