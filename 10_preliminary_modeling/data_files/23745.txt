I was canoeing in an area with lots of lakes, the way it looks in Wisconsin - land with lakes all around, waterways connecting.  I realized I had not looked up or noticed my surroundings in a while, that I had been focused on the boat or myself.  I looked up and right there in front of me in the distance was a big perfectly round grassy hill.  Across the hill in a perfect row were big rocks.  They were lined up like a train.  It was so beautiful and perfect, I was amazed and glad I had made myself look up right then, or I would have missed it.  I viewed that hill with the rocks lined up across it for a long time.  I felt inspired and contentedly ecstatic.  I boated toward the hill.  On the way toward the hill I saw many islands, each island had a single house on it.  They were beautiful well-made houses, each interesting, artistic.  I said out loud that I would love to own one of those houses on an island, and liked the solitude and privacy of them.  Then I was on ground near the waterways.  I was collecting field samples of plants for an ecology job or project.  I was trying to label each jar or container that each plant sample went in.  It started to rain and I was trying hard to keep the labels and plant samples organized and clear.
