I was going to be put to death in the electric chair. There were two people in the room, I don't know if I knew them or not. They were both women. One was standing slightly in front of me and to my left, facing the wall to the right of me. She is the one that was going to pull the switch. The other one was standing just to my right by my hand, facing me. They did not seem to be okay with what was about to happen. The first time they pulled the switch it took a few seconds. My body tensed up, my head fell back and I went unconscious. They thought they had successfully killed me. Less than a minute later I began to move a little, my arms and hands, and then slowly raised my head. They couldn't believe I was still alive. They or I or both thought this was a sign that I should not be put to death. Then I was going to be put to death in an electric chair again. I don't remember the outcome that time. There was a third time. This time there seem to be a lot of people around, some of them I knew. There was a row of people standing along my right side, facing me. There were two women nearest my right hand. They were women I knew well, perhaps friends. I asked one if she would hold my hand while they did this. She couldn't. I don't know if it's because she just didn't want to or if it was painful for her to watch or to know what was about to happen or what. She just turned to her left and walked away. Then I looked at the other woman as if to say, How about you? She took my hand in hers in an effort to offer courage and comfort. Something happened and she had to leave. Now I was more upset than ever because there was no one I knew there. A man and his wife moved into the places where my two friends had been standing. They knew I wanted someone to hold my hand. They both reached out and as I tried to take one of their hands they seemed to be fighting over who should hold my hand. I was able to get a hold of two of the man's fingers and I just didn't let go.
