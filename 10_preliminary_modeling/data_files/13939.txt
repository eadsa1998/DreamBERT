Calvin and I, and possibly others, had built an inside swimming pool at school (which was different). It was for Year 12's only and there was no private shower or toilet. We hadn't gotten anything for doing it. Calvin, some others and I were swimming. I said something and Calvin said "yeah, Eugene". My bag was in the water. There were 'hoses' hanging from the ceiling that you could swing on, although you weren't allowed to. I was naked and was swinging from one. Some younger people told a teacher and Mr Willingham came and asked who did it and I put my hand up. I got my bag and some of my stuff was in the water, but it was ok. My phone, keys and iPod had been cloned. Somehow I had a time machine and Calvin, someone and I went back to 2003. We were at a shop and everything was really cheap, so we decided to buy heaps of chocolate and we did. There was a $200 bar of chocolate. We were buying it on these cards we had. We eventually ran out of money and we left. We only had a small amount of time to stay there.
