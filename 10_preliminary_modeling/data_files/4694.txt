["Killer worms."] I am in a house. A young native American man and several white men come to the house with the intent to enter and be there. I am unsure if they mean me harm. He comes in and wants my company. So does the white man. It seems friendly enough. One gives me a loose cotton dress to wear so I will be more comfortable and more accessible to touch when we lie down on a couch together. It isn't particularly sexual in feeling. I look out a window to see if I have possible escape if I need it. I see a huge ice covered river on both sides of the house, the side and the back, practically right up to the door. It would be dangerous to go that way. Now there are frightening and dangerous animals in the house like swimming moles or something. They are coming toward us. We hit at them and run outside and dive into the river which is no longer snow and ice bound. We are in a small rowboat. These huge long tube worms come at us trying to eat us. We hit at them. It is ineffective. We are in serious danger. One comes right at the boat. And smashes us. We dive into the water to escape it's deadly mouth. Other huge ones slither by wearing a plastic raincoat kind of covering. I grasp at a stick that has a nail at the end and strike the head of the closest worm. It is hurt and retreats. I find a plastic knife and hand it to the man. It is no help. I then find a small paring knife and he uses that. We stab at them as they attack and swim quickly as we can for shore. We manage to escape alive and unhurt.
