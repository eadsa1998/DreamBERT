Remember loose bear. My class was having a party in the same building they film either Star Wars or Star Trek, and we were going to sleep over. Our photography teacher was there and when the rest of the class was off doing something, I talked with Jan and he basically told me that he was homeless. After I talked with him I went to find a place to sleep. I went up to the loft and I saw Diana holding on to the top of her rolled up sleeping bag when it was vertical. Then it just fell over and I thought she could only do that because it was her birthday. I decided not to sleep in the loft because I would be so separated. There was a bear chained down in a room and after I looked in the loft, I looked under the wall to bear's room and I saw a bear foot chained down. I poked my head all the way through and the bear was gone. Steve was with me and picked up a rifle and I told him not to and he just scoffed at me. I picked up a rifle, then said, "OK, fine." I also picked up a handgun and ran out shouting that there was a loose bear. I ran into the room and they were filming Star _____ and shouted the warning and everyone panicked. I said, "Use only tranquilizer darts." Steve said, "Yeah, right." Setting: An old warehouse. Characters: Tom (photography teacher), Steve (classmate), Diana (classmate), Bear (I have no idea). Feelings and Thoughts: In control, operated. It was pretty fun when I was in charge of the bear search.
