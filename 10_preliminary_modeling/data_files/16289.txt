I was at school and Mom and Dad were going to pick me up. And I was going out to the truck and I realized I forgot my book bag, so I had to say, "Hold on a second, I've gotta get something and I'll be back real fast." So I went in, there was a whole crowd of people in the courtyard and I found where I had dumped it. And I went out and that was that. I went home.
