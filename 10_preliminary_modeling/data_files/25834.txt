 I'm at a gathering that is like a Teen Variety Night that I went to in junior high. A janitor stops the dance until the kids raise $600 for my boss' dog Gabby. The spirit of the crowd is reluctance at first, and then everyone starts throwing money in. I think if we divided up the money per person it would be more than five dollars each. I throw in the two one-dollar bills that are in my wallet, but not the five or 20-dollar bill. I put my one-dollar bills on a stack of money, which is ordered so that the largest bills are on the top and the smallest on the bottom. My high school classmate Tanya Simmons is there. I seem to be at Carter Elementary School. I am wearing only white briefs underwear. I walk down the north stairway, trying to look physically fit: not flabby with stretched out underwear. I go into the bathroom by Billie's Daycare. I am going to defecate. My high school classmate Mya Rousing comes into the bathroom. She says my name and tells me that she has vomited into the toilet. She says this like she needs help, like this is her weakness and she has given in to it. I sit on the toilet and fart. Mya hears this. Then I fart more quietly. I am full of gas. My high school classmates Carmen and Harmony Allure are there. Harmony has kissed a track runner from Bell College named Moab, who I think of as the track runner I know from Brimson named Paul. I come out of the stall. My high school friend Tiny Combs is there. He is naked, and facing away from me. I see his butt and butt hole. There is a pig in the bathroom. It is small and has muddy feet. My foot is bleeding like it has been cut on the bottom. I explain this in some other way.
