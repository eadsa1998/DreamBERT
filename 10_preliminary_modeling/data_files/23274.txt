I was looking for the director of an academic program at the university where I once worked-a Dr. Schoen.  I was in a suite of offices that I wasn't familiar with-they apparently had been renovated since I was there.  Mary Kodd spoke to me as she went into her office.  At first I didn't want to admit I didn't know my way around, but I finally asked someone where Dr. Schoen's office was.  They pointed out three or four offices that he used.  It gets a little hazy after that.  I did speak extensively with a man in black whom I at first took to be Dr. Schoen but wasn't.
