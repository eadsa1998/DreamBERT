There were these really cute guys outside of my house and they stopped at my neighbor's house to ask who I was, so I ran upstairs and told my sister. We went outside to talk to the guys but as we stood outside my mom drove up and crashed into the car in front of her. Setting: My house. Characters: My sister and four fine guys. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. I was worried that my mom would get in trouble for crashing, but I was happy to talk to the guys.
