I was walking along Euclid Ave. and noticed that all the windows were full of dresses selling for two and three dollars. The dresses were all very pretty. I came upon the Hippodrome Theater and noticed the billboard outside which had a picture of two men fighting on a rocky hillside. Suddenly one of the men was me. We were both bleeding. At the bottom of the hill a car was parked. We were rolling along the rocky hillside, going down. Another car came along at the bottom of the hill with people walking beside it. I thought that somebody would come and help me, but the people just watched a while and then left.
