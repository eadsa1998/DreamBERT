I got a flirty message from Benjamin and it had two links to his favourite sport scenes but saying 'this is when my love for you grew over 24 hours' or 'I like this less than you' etc. I was then at the back of a zoo thing and Mom was like 'this looks so different' and there used to be lots of trees but now there were none. There were elephants in the exhibit. Some Natives snuck through a hole in the fence and sat at the top of this hill. A young boy came down and took a can of cat food out of our bag. I grabbed it and said 'that's ours' and he tried to grab something else and I said no. Then the mother came down and ended up grabbing Mom's food and shoving it all in her mouth. I went around the corner to ask for the police and they sent a lady who dealt with Natives. Then I was playing a game. I heard an alarm but didn't know what it meant. Rover was on a platform near some water and I saw it break and I remembered the alarm was for a giant octopus. I called out to Rover and he just looked at me and a tentacle grabbed him and pulled him down. The game reset.
