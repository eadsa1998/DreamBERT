This dream takes place for the most part in a bus terminal, meaning a Greyhound Bus Terminal. A friend of mine and I, a guy that I know who goes to reserve meetings, were rushing to this bus that was going to Texas. We got on it alright. Then there was a second instance when we had to hurry up and get on this bus, and the second there were three of us and the other two guys got on it OK. I know what it was, it was after another drill. These other two guys got on alright, but I didn't remember whether I had my suitcase on or not, and for some reason, my mother was on the bus and I kept saying that I don't know whether my suitcase is here or not, where could it be. The first time I went on a bus, it was with a friend of mine, and the second time he was with another person whom I know.
