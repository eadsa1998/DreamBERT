I am a teen boy and I go into my house and steal things from my mother. She comes in the back door and I go out the front door. She yells at me and starts chasing after me. I run and get on a truck, hitchhiking. Now I charm all the young ladies and use them and then throw them away. Each girl is represented by a short box of Kleenex. When the box is empty, I sweep it out in a sweeper that is the same shape as the box, one after another. They cry and beg, but I love them and leave them. I am in a car, in the trunk now, and see I'm in central (state). I get out and wander around. I walk down a road and see berry pickers and listen in to their inane conversations as they talk to each other to pass the time as they work. Then I see I am in town and see a beautiful teen girl, a perfect cheerleader type. I want her and begin to lean on walls and smile and flirt. She looks directly at me, so that for a moment, I am her. She ignores him and is also very aware of him. She walks on down the street and he follows her everywhere. She goes into a cafe. He does too. She is eating. He says he wants her napkin. He gets up, in a flirty move, and takes her napkin, dips it in another boy's glass of water, flirting with him simultaneously and then hands the napkin to the bad boy. Now the bad boy is challenging her to a hot dog eating contest. He says three, she says no, just two. He insists. They argue the numbers back and forth. Then suddenly she falls to the ground and lies there in a trance. He gets up and looks. She has a cross-eyed mad woman look on her face and a message is written across this "picture." It says "Mad Dog Alison, brutally beaten." It was like she had another dark personality under her beautiful one because she's been abused.
