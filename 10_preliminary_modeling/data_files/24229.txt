Going on a trip. Monkey that is really a cat that is really hairy. Inside a zoo along the way. It is hurricane-force winds. I get down. Everyone else follows suit as we walk down the mountain. My sister gets high on a spliff from Ali Mellis (someone I went hiking with). Everyone is tired, and I am constantly thinking about water supplies. I am on a road trip through some strange road area, where there are multiple water parks. We're looking for one, but it is terribly out of the way. The others look like a lot of fun, but we want to find this one. I have a good sense of map in my head. We come under attack from a call of duty helicopter.
