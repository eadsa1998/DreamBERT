Two men come into the room. They both like me and flirt, at least the younger one does. I am, however, drawn to the other one. He looks like Hector and is Native American, short and overweight. He's been in prison and he looks at me with intense, needy loving eyes. I don't want to like him, but his love and need draws me. He picks me up and carries me across the room and puts me down on the couch. I can feel his sexual desire and I watch him closely, feeling attracted and hesitant. I'm not sure what I want, so I just don't move, but watch him. He leaves me on the couch and goes into the bathroom and takes a bath. I follow him into the bathroom. The younger man is sad and leaves. A police man or detective comes around to check out this man. I sit on a counter top and talk with "Hector" as he bathes. I feel embarrassed. After all, he's naked. "Hector's "  loving need for me brings him out of the tub and across the room to hug me. I'm aware of his sexual excitement and the watery feel of his still wet body. I stand up and hug him feeling his great love all around me. I relax into his embrace. Then a small girl comes into the room crying for her "Linda mom." She had awakened afraid and had walked out to find "Linda Mamma," even though she was afraid to leave her bed. I let go of "Hector" and pick up the girl. I hug her and say, "Linda Mom left, I'm the only one here. I'll have to do." She's sad, so I show her the bed that "Linda Mom" used to sleep on. It is piled high with laundry. Now "Hector" is back in the living room playing an Italian accordion squeeze box. Now there are two little girls and I dance with them. The littlest one dances between my legs as I hold her arms.
