Mom and Darren bought some stuff for an experiment I needed to do for school. There was other lame stuff "to pass the time". I can't remember properly or read my notes well but me and some friends pulled up like four 'beds (which had two [something] each)' or something on the road. Mom was there? There was an ambulance and we needed to go park and so we moved two into the carpark. Then I had socks on and I was with Alejandro and someone else. We had to go somewhere. I walked around wet patches and went to put on my shoes and one had a big nut or acorn in it and I cried out "Ow. Ow!". Zach Braff was there. I left with Mom and she was doing a dental course thing and you got points. There was a 'History of Russia' thing and something about Anton Yelchin and I said "He's Russian right?". We didn't know any of the questions. Alejandro and I were ahead of the group -- we had to climb up steps and step on the right answer. We were at a high one and we ran out of time. We were asked something and I someone said "yellow- red" and someone else (I can't remember if it was me, or someone else) said "It was yellow or red". We dropped down the other side; the others would go back around. We ended up in a cafe thing and someone mentioned his 'wife' and said it was actually a lie. Zach Braff then came in, exhausted. Also, I had had a kid but I didn't know when and I wondered why I counted myself as a virgin.
