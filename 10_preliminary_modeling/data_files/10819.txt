I was in my bedroom with a lover (no one I have ever known in actual life). There was something slightly sinister about him that made me feel uneasy, but I couldn't be sure what it was. We were doing nothing in particular, but I was very much afraid that my parents would come in the hallway and hid him in a closet. After my parents came in and spoke to me for a while, my attitude began to change. I became convinced that this lover was some sort of insect in disguise and that his intent was to injure or kill me and my family. I tried to warn my parents, but they would not believe me. Finally a huge hornet-like insect emerged from the closet and began chasing me. Then I woke up.
