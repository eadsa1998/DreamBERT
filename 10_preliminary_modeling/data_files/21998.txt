I saw a pile of red tomatoes. I was fixing something fitting it. I called John, the boss, to look at one of my machines. He started it and the tool jammed. The spindle stopped. He backed the tool out and it was bent. He got a bar and straightened it out. Then he told me to get a coil string. I got some wire and made a coil spring out of it. Nelson was opening up bottles of beer. He was sampling them to see if they were sour. He gave me one. I was drinking it. It was cold outside. Then the sun came out for a while and a couple came into the house with shorts on. They lounged around. I looked them over. The woman had a nice shape and the man was fairly shaped. He had a small waistline.
