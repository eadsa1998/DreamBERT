I am camping out with a couple of men and their boys. The other wife didn't come, so I sit alone while the men go out hiking or something. I sit rather bored on a log or something. I lay back and notice the sky. On the left side, it is twilight and an occasional star. On the right side, is a black sky filled with stars. I wonder why that is and look back and forth at the differences. I then see on the right side that part of the difference is there are lots of cloud-like things which is the Milky Way. Now the men come back with the boys and are cutting up a big meat loaf into strips and squares to eat. I say to one of the men that I wish his wife Irene were here so I'd have someone to talk to. Then I look up in the sky again and see ducks, lots of them flying by, big adult ducks and lots of baby ducks. One duck attacks another and bites it. I realize they are very hungry. I want to feed the baby ones and get some bread and crumble it up. Some adult ducks land and eat and then a baby duck comes down and sticks to a wall. I go over to see it and notice it is a piece of cardboard folded in half and I open it to see a purple colored jewel and realize these ducks aren't born yet. This is their embryo in this jewel-like thing and they are still growing and forming. I regret having called them down and try to send them back on their way, hoping I haven't caused them any harm.
