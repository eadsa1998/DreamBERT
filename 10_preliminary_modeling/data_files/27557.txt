In my dream, I went to a dance with a fellow whom I shall call "A." This person is known to me. Then I have a vague recollection of dancing in the dream with many different fellows but none of them was "A." Then the dance ended and the orchestra went home. All the people left, but I was still there. I was wandering around looking for "A," but I couldn't find him. I put my head down on something and began to cry and then "A" came and I was happy again.
