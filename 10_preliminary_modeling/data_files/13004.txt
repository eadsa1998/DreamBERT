I was at some place and I was running from a werewolf. It had a gun. I had trouble opening the door, but eventually managed to and ran in. Eugene, some girl and I were in there. I don't know what happened next, but Eugene and I were going out a window. He had been bit and had a couple of 'powers'. Later, we lived together in some house. One night the girl went out to a forest and started taking her clothes off because she was going to turn into a werewolf. At the house, some people were at the door and we were trying to decide whether to open it, then they started chipping at the window. We opened the door and there were two girls. Some guy wanted to talk to me and he told me that I had to be the "bad guy". They said they were going to take Eugene. I could run like Clark Kent, so I went to 'run' to him, which would actually teleport me to where he was, but it didn't work because of something they had done.
