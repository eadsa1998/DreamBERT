I was in Rivertown, PA. I went to see the boys play ball. I saw the Hegler girls and boys playing ball. I saw a man hitting out balls. Then I was playing ball. Our team beat the other team 20 to about 5. We hit the pitcher all over the lot. He was John Milcan. These were memories of my boyhood days.
