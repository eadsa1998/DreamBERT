It was science class, and Melissa, our teacher, was repeating the same things she had said today. But when she dismissed us, she started acting a lot like a little child, and she hadn't done that before. She was laughing and giggling and chatting and she seemed really, really little. I was surprised at Melissa because she's usually really sophisticated and totally adult- like. Setting: In the science room at school. Characters: My friend Nancy, talking to Melissa; Melissa, my science teacher, and some friends I didn't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Surprised. I was surprised at her, but I knew that sometimes I think about real things and change them a little bit.
