I was at school. Everyone was in this room. I was standing with Calvin and Eugene was there too. Ms Bigwood was doing some effects thing on photos. She got some off my Facebook and she asked me if they were ok. There was one of me smiling with Nana and I didn't like the smiling ones. Evelyn was standing with us. She kept saying "Eugene" which was annoying me and I wondered why she had started saying it. There was another photo Ms Bigwood did where she had made us covered in chocolate.
