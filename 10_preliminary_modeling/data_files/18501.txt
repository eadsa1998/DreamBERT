There was a freight elevator and 9 people total working inside the type shop. I worked next to a girl and in the back was a guy who checked basement statistics and he was unreliable and absent. We were printing negatives and there was only so much available space in the darkroom. The girl next to me was VERY BUSY printing photographs. Then there was me. Then there was the space where the guy usually worked. His work station. But he was too busy to be there. There were 7 coat pegs above the names and on top of the shelf was a lightweight collapsible mesh bag to hold 7 basketballs and the point was to play, bounce the ball like jacks. Onesies, twosies, threesies, but with the basketball, not a small ???. First I practiced and did it good. Then I couldn't get past onesies. I felt pitiful but there was nothing I could do. Some people could bounce it all the way to ninesies (sevens). Then I tried to print from the negatives. I was very said because I had NO; I did not have any black and white negatives to print of DORA. It was a page out of print. And there was nothing I could do. There was nothing I could do.* I tried to remember the names of those around me (the girl and the unreliable boy) and I couldn't and I got nervous and I sat in the desk and peed on myself I was so nervous. Then I picked up a magazine and dropped it on the puddle under the desk and I tried to act like nothing had happened. *"there was nothing I could do" does appear twice very close together in drawing.
