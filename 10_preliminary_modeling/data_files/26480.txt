 I'm in the Big Resort Area on Trout Lake with my friends Kevin Simpson, Tom Napper, and Tim and Niles Zelling. We have three canoes. One of these is a kayak that has a hole to sit in and a hole in front of that. I'm wearing black flippers on my feet. I sit in the kayak and it sinks. I swim with the kayak. We all gather in the water, holding onto a big steel pillar. This is our last portage, and then we're home free on Eagle Lake. We're going to have a difficult portage with three canoes. A person may have to carry a canoe and a pack. Kevin says he's going to take the 17-foot lightweight canoe, so I'm taking the kayak, but then I'm taking the Grumman. I put on several life jackets to pad my shoulders on the portage. I take the Grumman and go. I feel no pain. I walk fast, and a long ways without stopping. The Grumman feels light. I talk to the other people portaging, encouraging them and checking to see that they're okay. I'm strong, and I move deftly. I'm on the trail. I'm then on stairs, which I scamper down like I have no load at all. I go through doors, carrying the canoe is no problem.
