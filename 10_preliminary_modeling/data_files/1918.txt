I am lying on a raised platform. Mateo comes and lies down on a small blanket on the floor next to me (in front of me.) I say, "Come on up here and lie with me. There's room." He says no. I say, "Then there's a small pillow you can use near you." He gets the pillow and lies down. He doesn't look very comfortable. H. comes in and I sit up, I try to straighten up the things near me. Tap shoes. Eyeglasses (Evangeline's). I shove them off the platform. Then I see a coke machine and an old refrigerator. Water is pouring out of their broken handles. I ask Bonnie, "Is that my fridge?" I thought I had a big new one. I get up and Bonnie and I start to clean up the mess. She had already laid down newspapers and some of my newsletters over the big puddle. I get a mop and move lots of water and sludge. I carry the mop outside and squeeze it dry. I go back and forth, noticing how strong I feel physically.
