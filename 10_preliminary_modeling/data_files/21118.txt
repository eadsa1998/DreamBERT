I was doing some kind of work that I did faster now than before. I heard Mr. Arendas was outside of the house talking to Grandma. When I got there, it was Uncle Jake. He came to see one of his kids who got hit on the side of the face from a firebrick by falling out of its place. Grandma was throwing up a leaf of cabbage and catching it. I had a fork of coke that I was taking outside from the house.
