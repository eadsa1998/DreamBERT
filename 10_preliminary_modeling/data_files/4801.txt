I need to make a reservation on an airplane to leave immediately. I can't seem to find out where and how to do this. Bonnie is around somewhere. I see a group of people. One man is lying down on his side resting. It's like a MIUSA group. I am to teach a creative writing class. I tell about my stories and how I wrote them. I feel good about how I taught the class. Then as I walk away, a man complains. I return to hear him. He shows me a list of classic books he felt we should have studied. He showed me a handful of pills, big orange capsules and small round ones I didn't recognize and complained he'd gotten those to take during the class instead of two Tums usually given out. Meanwhile, during the class I had a baby to take care of as the people watched. I tried to get him to take a nap. I finally succeeded.
