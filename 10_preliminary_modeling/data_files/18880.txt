I'm in California and I've bought a 1930 Monterey Ford. I'm thinking of getting it painted. Then I think it's such a good car and was so cheap I'll leave it in California for the times when I'm there. It then occurs to me that I may as well use the California plates in Florida and I regret that I bought Fla. plates because now I have to take out California insurance, and I bought Fla. plates in order to save this Mass. insurance rates. Then I'm in a hotel room. Some man like a manager picks up a sexy looking woman by a string around her neck and hangs her on a hook. The idea is everything is legal as long as she isn't touched by human hands. She is there for sexual purposes and I'm not sure if she's going to put on a show by masturbating or if we're going to have a gang bang, no hands as it were.
