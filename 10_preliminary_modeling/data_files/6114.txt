At one night, it was so cold in my room because my radiator didn't have heat, so I had to get a thick blanket to get my body warm. When I went to sleep, I had also covered my head with the blanket. Later, I had fallen asleep and I started to dream. Now, I am in this small elevator with a crowd of people. It is so narrow that I can hardly move my head, and people keep squeezing in. The elevator is very slow. Although I am gradually suffocating, I keep telling myself that the elevator will open very soon. But, then I cannot breathe. Oh, my goodness! I am suffocating. Help! Then I woke up and my hands raised up high to remove the blanket from my head. I inhaled so hard.
