We were eating dinner, but it also seemed like we were playing a game, because our conversation was of that sort, and we didn't do the things that ought to be done when having dinner. When we had "finished," my sister volunteered to clear, rinse and load the dishes (which were all plates), and she put them in a skinny stack. When she ran them under water they turned into a deck of cards. Setting: At our kitchen table. Characters: My sister and I (unchanged). Feelings and Thoughts: Weirded. It's strange.
