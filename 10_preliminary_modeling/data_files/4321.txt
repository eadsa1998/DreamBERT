["Teaching my dream program to a research professional."] An important man in the dream research field is curious about how my dream program works. He is interested in possibly using it. He's famous in the dream research world, written books and so on. He is young, tall, dark and handsome, like a movie star. He listens carefully, asking good questions as I describe the dreamlinking process. I see the screen and am taking him through it step by step. He gets very excited when I tell him of the dream window and keeping the dreams in storage on the computer. It is going well.
