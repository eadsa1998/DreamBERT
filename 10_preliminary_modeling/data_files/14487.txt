There was a shop attached to where we lived. A family was moving into this section we used to play in sometimes. It was going to be a kid's bedroom (a very big one). There was a Subway right across from it. There was a young guy there and Mom thought he was hot and was being flirty with him. Mom and Darren said they were going for a drive, so I came. We got there and got out of the car and they put on masks to cover their eyes and black jumpers. I asked what they were doing and they said they were breaking in to get files off a computer. I waited in a room with a Chihuahua. It was looking at me and trying to nip our feet, so I started talking to it aggressively to let it now I was the boss. It went away and put its head down. Tigger and Gizmo were then there too.
