I was on Facebook and Greg Sestero [who added me on FB yesterday] posted the top 10 movies he'd seen this year. Seven of them were on my list, including Breaking the Waves. I was at a shop to sleep there and went into the wrong 'room'. I curled up on a lounge to sleep. Calvin came in asking where I was. He said "this must be why you're a girl" and lay down behind me, though I complained. There were water bottles in a fridge and filled some up. Ezra and some friends were there.
