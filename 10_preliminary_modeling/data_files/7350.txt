He had gone and he was going to carve gifts for the Xmas table. I was afraid he couldn't finish even when he returned for it was already a quarter to two. I asked if we could put the cloth on the table now. She asked me which of the old ladies I'd like to have sit next to me. I insisted that I couldn't say if she didn't tell me their names. Then another lady came and asked me to play tennis. At first I said I would but then I remembered and said "No, I've had warnings. Don't urge me or I might yield and I can't because I've sold my racquet." Then the station wagon was full and I asked if there was room for me. He said that I could sit in front with him. I got in and said I could pretend I was driving in England on the left side of the road.
