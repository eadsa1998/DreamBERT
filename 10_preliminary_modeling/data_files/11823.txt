I was at some weird school and this bomb went off a few miles away so we went over there and there were other schools there. The building was still in place but there were dead bodies everywhere. This guy, who was my friend, was with me and earlier on in the dream these people had done something that could make my pants fall down. Anyway, I told him and he said something about wanting something "good" to look at.
