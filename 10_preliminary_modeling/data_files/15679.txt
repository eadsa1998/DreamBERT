I was staying in a hostel thing. I opened my suitcase and a girl saw my stripey pink pants and made a comment and I said they're soft and she tried them on and agreed. Dad and Ezra had a fight at a museum and knocked over a zebra and lost 8 bones. I had some Turkish food for dinner and then ate back at the hostel. I had a diary protected by a key which also needed answers to questions. People were desperate to see it. I knew Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and was in love with him. At some point Lily said that she 'noticed how cute Ted was, and had to go home with my toothbrush for a bit'. We were lying on a bed and heard a hiss. There was a big yellow snake that he called an 'adder'. The girl said 'don't act scared', but I threw the blanket over us and we lifted it up and the snake climbed on her. I ran and she followed. It was night and I was outside in a park with a bus shelter. I ran down one side and she ran down the other. The snake ran down the path towards her but ate a lizard.
