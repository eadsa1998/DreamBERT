We had moved house, I think. There was a Sims 3 thing which recorded the number of times the songs were listened to [note: I found the site LastFM a couple days ago, which records the number of plays and I am currently obsessed with it]. Africa by Toto had a high number of plays. On the radio they said they were going to play 'rock' and they played Toto. It was a song I didn't know but then it changed to Don't Fear the Reaper and I was singing it. Mom and Darren were asleep on the lounge. I woke her and said I was going to bed. Also, some guy had found a sewing machine in the backyard of Mom's and because they hadn't 'claimed' it and he was going to take it. A friend of Mom's came over and Mom was going to get her to take it for now. I was then at dads and he was in the kitchen throwing out food, but it wasn't him? The fridge was where the old fridge used to be. I heard Mittens meow and she was outside. She jumped up onto the window sill. Tigger jumped up too. There was another cat which was orange, brown and white and was ugly-ish. It looked a bit like a dog.
