 I'm driving my mom's station wagon with Ramona. It's dark out, and I'm out of control: swerving and going on the shoulder of the road. I unbuckle my seat belt and sit kneeling on my legs. I steer by pressing keys on a piano. Both my hands are in C-position. If I press the G's I go to the right. If I press the C's I go to the left. I can't find home position and have to keep looking down at the keyboard, taking my eyes off the road. Ramona knows I'm out of control. <br/
