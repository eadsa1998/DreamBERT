["Upset with Charla."]  I am working, taking photos. Charla is near me and is interrupting me. I am frustrated. Finally, I pick her up by the scruff of the neck and carry her out of the room. I plop her down near my mother and walk back to continue working. My mother is upset with me. I am upset with Charla.
