Darryl and I were in a car, in Mexico. The car broke down. It was a red Impala "Scat wagon." He went for help. I stayed in the car with the baby. She was so cute. I was feeding her milk from a bottle and cooing over her. I took the car to a garage. I got out and sat in a manual wheelchair on the sidewalk, holding the baby. I was a little annoyed at all the inconvenience. Darryl came back, only he is Arthur now.
