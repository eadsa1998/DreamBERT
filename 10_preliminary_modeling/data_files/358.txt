I'm in England with some girls - not close friends, but we're travelling together, and we've set up a weekend on a boat up in Scotland before we go home. We all meet in the office of the agent who's setting it up, and she has a little dog (like a Cocker Spaniel) that's one of those nervous, flighty types that try to be friendly and cute but might bite, and I'm scared of her. We have a while to wait, so we sit around the lounge/living room and I try to stay away from the dog. Part of the time there's this huge yacht or boat maneuvering in its slip (which is now where we are, partly inside the room) and some of the machinery swings around and nearly hits me in the head so I have to duck. I'm not at all sure I'm going to like this. But we go. We drive to the location where the boat is, and this road used to be harder to negotiate - now it's been literally divided, there's a wall between lanes so that you can't get on the wrong road - just for a certain stretch, not all the way... We arrive, and there are some others on this outing with us, including Dan &amp; Lynn and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who's a sort of guide. We know each other a bit, and spend some time talking, and I'm saying at one point that even though he's done a lot of travelling around the world, I may have done almost as much, even if most of it's been to England - after all, this is my 6th time here. We're hugging close together while we're talking and I'm resting my head on his chest. The others are doing various setting-up chores, and shortly I turn and look at Dan, who's gotten some sort of stinging plant attached to his foot, and he's having to get it off very carefully. It's a sort of clinging water cactus.
