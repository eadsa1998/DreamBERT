 Something happens with a loon diving straight downward from the top of a tree. My dad is there. We are in a wooded area. We get a carp that kind of looks like a smallmouth bass. It is decent sized. We are ready to leave, and walk out of the wooded area. I yell, "Gassy!" to get my sister Ramona. She and my brother Wally both come out of the woods in different places.
