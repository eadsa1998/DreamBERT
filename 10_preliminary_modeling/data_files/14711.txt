I was watching True Blood. The town was still crazy but it was different. There were some young kids (like under 10) giving out death sentences. They gave one to a friend of theirs, who pleaded with them but they just showed no emotion (I think they were under the control of something). Sam and Jason met up outside somewhere and it zoomed in on Sam's mouth, which was in an open smile and then he turned into a rat. Jason did too and had only acquired this power recently and was still confused about it. Then it showed them naked on lying on the ground talking to each other. Then it went to some kids and they saw something and one of them said "ooh look at that" and then it showed an injured pig lying at the bottom of a hill. It was making squealing noises. It was actually Maryann and I said "Maryann got raped!". I wondered why she wasn't in her human form.
