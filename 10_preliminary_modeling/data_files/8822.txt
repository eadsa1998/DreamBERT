I was in a room that looked like a school cafeteria. It was a very large room and there were many people there. I was there for a council meeting but the meeting hadn't begun yet. There may have been a set amount of social time scheduled for before or after the meeting as people are gathered in small groups chatting. I was on some kind of a bereavement sub-committee. I was sitting with a group of people discussing something related to this. Aunt R's name came up. She passed away in July of 2005. We had received quite a few letters addressed to her. They had been written after her death and from people wanting her to answer some questions for them. Mostly they were questions about the afterlife but some were questions about her own life. I thought this was absolutely absurd. What did they think we were going to do with these? How did they think she was going to answer these questions? She might answer them in a dream, but then why send the letters to us? I told someone in the group that we had to decide what to do with these letters. One woman got up and left to do something related to our discussion. I saw someone enter the room. Maybe it was Father Jerry. I thought he could tell us what we should do.
