It is a school that I went to that I have this dream. In my mind I always think this is a scary school (spooky). One day I went to school. There were no students there. It was so blurry in the hallway. I went in my class to sit down anyway, because I thought I was early maybe. Suddenly, there were so many people with white long dress and long black hair chasing me. I ran and ran. Up and down the stairs. As I was running some of my friends came. We all ran together. We were all trying to find the exit doorway. It took us a while. We found it. One of them got one of my friends' leg. We pulled (hard) to get away from them. I felt so relieved after we got out. The school exploded. I woke up. When I woke up my two thighs are so tired.
