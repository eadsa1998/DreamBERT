we are at a very posh HOTEL and I notice a young woman who wears a kind of armor and a ruffled blouse; someone says she is single, but later her husband appears and is very ordinary looking; shift: a big ship is about to take off; I think I see my friend Pedro looking out of the window wearing a wool cap, but not sure; I look for him in the dining hall but he doesn't see me; he's with a young man.
