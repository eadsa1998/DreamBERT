 I'm going into Carter School. I've got a key. I put it into a box outside the school. There is a light switch and I turn on the lights inside. I know I was always a little scared walking in dark school hallways. I'm a sponsor for someone getting confirmed. My friend Niles Zelling is there. A girl I recognize to be Carrie Jones, from high school, is there.
