Last night I listened easily to a long and fluent account of the woes suffered by a plumber in Newton Highlands. One of his patrons evaded paying a bill of several hundred dollars by legal trickery. The neighbors subscribed and paid the amount! It was natural that I should awake with a painful start from such a dream. A plumber, of all men, to command sympathy.
