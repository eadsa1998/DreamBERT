I was in the car with Mom at this shop with all these really expensive cars in the carpark. This one car was a 'Ferrari Excel'. This lady was trying to get Mom out of the car. Then I was writing my dream down and she wanted to know about me. I didn't know what to say and was thinking about Runescape and Doctor Who. She took my dream and I was like "Hey! Give it back!".
