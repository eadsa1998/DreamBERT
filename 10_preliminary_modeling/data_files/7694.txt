I was looking at a picture of Matthew and myself standing in front of a tree. He was much younger than now and was standing in front of me. As I was looking at the photo another image of myself appeared in the picture, standing next to the tree, facing it, kind of hugging it. Then that image slowly faded until it was gone. Then the image of Matthew and me was replaced by an image of Jesus in long robes with his hands open/out-stretched but downward. Suddenly angels began appearing and disappearing. I was thinking how cool this was. I may have been lucid.
