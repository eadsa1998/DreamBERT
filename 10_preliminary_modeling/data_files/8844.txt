It had snowed last night, and the maintenance guys had come and cleared the sidewalks. However, they came so early in the morning like around five or 6 a.m., and it was still snowing. Later, I was going outside and the sidewalks were covered with snow again. I had put on my hiking boots and walked down the front walkway. I was thinking that the neighbor would notice my footprints in the walkway. I have no idea why that would matter. I didn't drive anywhere. I went back to my tool shed and got out my bag of sidewalks all. I was surprised at how little was left in there. There was probably less than 2 cups left. I could get around front, and I started by spreading it across the first step, right outside our doorways, than I moved down to the next step, but didn't even get that whole step done before I ran out. Seems that I may have thought about only using it on half of the sidewalk and go further down, but realize that would be very selfish and rude.
