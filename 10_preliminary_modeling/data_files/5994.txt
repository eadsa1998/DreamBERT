After a long journey I arrive at a house where I am to meet someone or encounter something. I wander alone about the house, which turns out to be my parents' house. Anxiously I wait for something to happen, vaguely aware that I will be meeting a group, perhaps of space aliens or magical elves. As I walk down the hallway and into the living room, I say to myself, "Now it's time." The curtains for the big picture window are open and there is a clear view of the outdoors. I step into the window as if to walk through it, but when I get there I find that everything on the other side is made of glass just like the window itself. I walk around in this glassy world where the view is translucent but blurry. All the objects I see, including trees, grass and rocks, radiate light through the eerie haze.
