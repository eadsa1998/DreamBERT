I was at a house with Mom, Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur and others. Uncle Wilbur got angry and yelled at the others about something on a cupboard from them. They were fat and they made him compete in something that he was pro at. He stormed out and Mom was like 'heh, look how slow he is'. He came back in and took his key.
