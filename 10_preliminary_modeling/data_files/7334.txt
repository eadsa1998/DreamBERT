When I entered the dining room with two long tables, Dora beckoned me to a seat next to her. As I faced a window, I hesitated but decided it would soon be less light and I could stand it. After I sat down, I realized I must get my medicine and went to the other table but a man and a woman were at my usual place and there was no medicine on the table. I saw a saucer of pills like mine on the sideboard which I took to Mrs. Mag. for identification because the larger tablets weren't quite white. She said they weren't mine and went with me to the nurse's room to look for mine.
