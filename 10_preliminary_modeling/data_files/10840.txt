I was standing in a strange bathroom watching a friend of my mother's washing her hair in the sink upon which a gray kitten was perched calmly watching the proceedings. Suddenly the cat's face contorted in a wild grimace causing the woman to become frightened. Picking up the cat, she threw it into a nearby bathtub which somehow was filled with flames. Horrified I saw the kitten's fur catch fire and the cat slowly begin to burn to death. The woman was instantly remorseful, but her main thought was to put the cat out of its misery by speeding up the burning process and beating the cat over the head. Before the animal had completely disappeared in the flames, I awoke.
