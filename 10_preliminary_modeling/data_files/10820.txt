One of my teeth hurt me. I wiggled it and found that it was loose. I kept wriggling it back and forth the way I used to when I was a child. It was rather painful, but there was a definite element of pleasure involved so I kept wriggling until the tooth came out. Then another tooth came out and still another and I began to be alarmed because these were supposed to be my permanent teeth. At the same time, there was something rather pleasant about it. The dream had no definitely conclusion. I woke up while my teeth were coming out one by one.
