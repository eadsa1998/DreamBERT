 I'm with another person walking north down the upstairs hallway of Carter School in Oak Valley. I feel that we are being followed, so we turn into the janitor's room to see who, if anyone, is following us. We wait a moment, and then the person I'm with points out to me that there is a gun being pointed at us through a hole in the wall, from where the boy's bathroom is. We are "caught", so to speak. Either I or the other person nonchalantly makes a move that seems like it would be of no consequence. However, we are harboring a mini-gun, which is used to shoot the person with the large gun.
