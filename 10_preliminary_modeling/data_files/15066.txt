To get my license, I had to do some weird test online. The first question had something about two workers at a cash register and they served some customers. Then I was asked what the name of the one on the right was, but it was hard to read the name tag and I ended up getting it wrong. There was a second picture and question, but I can't read what I've written. It was a joke though for Johnny Knoxville to get money for a party? The guy behind the counter pulled out a gun and he was like 'whoa' and I took his bag and went outside and was messing around with him in a playground area?
