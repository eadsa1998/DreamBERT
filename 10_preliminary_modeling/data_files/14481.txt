I was at Nana's, which was different. There was a big room full of beds. Outside that room was a shop thing. The aisles had horror posters, puzzles etc. There was a Child's Play one and a haunted house one. It spoke to me (it had an audio thing). I went to bed. It was dark in there as people were already sleeping. Nana and Poppa were in a bed. Dad and Ezra were in another. I said to Ezra later that instead of building one big bedroom, I should've them and a shop separately. We were clearing out movies. We had heaps missing including The Langoliers and The Happening and others. I found Ezra and he said he didn't take them, so I was looking for Dad to ask him. I went into a computer shop to look for him. I left and realized I needed to go back (we owned it and Dad had stuff there?). I was walking outside and I saw Turk (Scrubs) walking below. I yelled out "Turk!" but he didn't hear me, so I went closer to this fence and yelled again and he heard me. I told him to tell them to close the shop; he smiled in acknowledgment and ran back.
