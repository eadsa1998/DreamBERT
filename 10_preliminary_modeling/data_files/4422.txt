["Howard messes up my office."] I am working in an office. There are two long tables, perpendicular to each other. Lots of papers, books and supplies are cluttered all over the top. Howard is there. His stuff is on the table as well. I am trying to organize the mess. It feels fine that Howard is there, but I am annoyed that I have extra work to do. A woman comes in and asks for a post it note to use. I show her mine and each one is written on with projects and information. I pick up Howard's and so is his. I find one sheet I can share with her. A woman calls the meeting to order. I have made good progress on the mess. You can see some of the table top now.
