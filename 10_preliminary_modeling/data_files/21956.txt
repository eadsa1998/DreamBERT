I was at work. I went to the sink in the davenport dept. and I was surprised that dept. was not working. That was about 40 minutes before quitting time. When I came back to our dept., some of the lines were shut off and the lights were out. Carl Fisher had our lights out and he had my tickets written out. I noticed he had a mistake made on some of them and he had Vi and some VII and I looked at the drawing and it was VI on all of them. There were ladies' dust caps on the machine. I was going to put them on the pan of work, but only put one of them. I picked up two red soggy rags from the floor. Then I saw a young lady cry by Paul's line and then walk away and Paul's helper Dick then started to cry as of pain and he sat back in the corner and sort of stretched his body as he cried.
