I'm with Arvonne. We've been captured. We decide to escape. There are lots of musical audio tapes. I put mine in with hers and then when its time to leave, can't find mine so I leave them, regretfully. We go out to hitchhike but she's already called a boyfriend who drives up at that moment. She gets in. I am hesitant and then slide in the passenger side. He drives and I start to feel safer as more distance is covered. They'll never catch up to me now.
