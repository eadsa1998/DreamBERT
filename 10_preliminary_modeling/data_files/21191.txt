I was putting down a small payment in a couple dimes and I saw Indian head pennies. I picked them up and one was 1883 series and 360 series. The pennies were like new. I took them for my collection. My car didn't have the pep and I was angry. I was working on a drill press. I saw Whitey Volker and another man I knew.
