Howard is crying with true grief. I am surprised and tender. He says "Twelve years and I'm a failure." His wife Karen is divorcing him. He is in emotional pain. He says if he can't fix it, he'll commit suicide. I sit, lay down next to him, concerned. "How serious are you?" I ask. He says he knows how he'll do it. I mention that I have been counseling a young man who feels the same. Then I feel bad because it is the man Karen had an affair with and this will make Howard feel worse if he knew. I feel genuine sorrow for Howard. I want to help.
