I am assigned to sing a duet in "Oh Little Town of Bethlehem" with Marilyn, a girl I knew in high school band. I want to sing but my voice is bad. Still, I want to try. Someone overhears Marilyn say she doesn't want to sing with me but I still want to try. When the first duet comes I can't get to the front of the stage so I sing from the back. When the second duet comes I make it to the front but keep sliding and go almost off the edge of the stage but I try anyway. We never quite get to do the song and I think about telling her that I know what she said but I never do.
