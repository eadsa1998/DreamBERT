I was at school in English. I asked Ms Solomon for help with this graph thing, which was actually Biology work. My tooth was hurting and was loose. I was chewing some bubble gum and I sucked at it and my tooth came out. I spat it out and there was heaps of blood. I was wearing white socks, and they, along with my shoes got covered in blood. I got a tissue and then asked if I could go home.
