I had been ill for awhile, maybe even institutionalized. I couldn't stand up, but then this young man pulled up in a taxi and he was someone I was in love with. I was so elated and happy, I started coming back to life. This man's love was more tenderness and sweetness than sexual. I felt taken care of, rescued.
