I was in a bar drinking beer with my roommate. The bar was in Ft. Carson, but did not resemble any one we had been in. It most closely resembled a little lunch counter. In fact, the more I think of it, it was exactly the same. My roommate and I were fairly high on the beer we had been drinking. A friend we had brought with us was asleep on the floor between us. We were talking and joking about various things. The subject of age came up and my roommate was telling me how lucky I was because I never had to worry about I.D. cards now that I am 21. The bartender heard this conversation and thought it was I who was under age. He asked for my I.D. so I gave it to him, sure that he would find it okay. He didn't, however, and thought the card was a fake, so he booted me out. My roommate was laughing so hard it was all he could do to keep his seat. I too was laughing, but was a little mad at the bartender, so I started beating on the door. The bartender finally came, and this time looked at all my identification. Then he let me back in. I went over to my roommate, hit him on the back and bought him a beer.
