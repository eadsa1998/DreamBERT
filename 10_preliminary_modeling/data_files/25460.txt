 I'm with my sisters Ramona and Heather. There is a little door above the dryer in my basement. There is a race between us and a group of people to get to the door. I want to beat these people there. I tell Heather and Ramona to hurry. We get there after going through the tunnel-like structure we were in. We get to the dryer. I get on top of the dryer. I unscrew two screws from the dryer with my fingers. The first screw falls on the dryer, but doesn't fall to the floor. I open the little hatch door. Cold air and particles blow in my face. There is a policeman. I hold a hostage. I have a razor-knife, and so do other people. I cut a bit of skin on the hostage's throat. Then there is peace, after all. People, others, go back to Hawaii.
