I'm in some kind of a hotel and I'm looking for the elevator. I find it. Some other people crowd into another elevator that doesn't look right. As it goes up, the sides fold down on them like a crushed box. They start screaming. I rush over and push the down button and they tumble out. I point to the sign that says "Danger, Freight elevators" and say to the manager that it needs to be more clear. It really is written in obscure words and I tell her, "And even I, who am quite literate, would have trouble understanding the sign.
