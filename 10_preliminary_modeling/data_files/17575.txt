I was going to play a game with my housemate Andre, his girlfriend Suzie, and my boyfriend Jeremy.  Jeremy wasn't there.  Our friend Celia went to get him.  He was behind my parents' bed.  She came back and told me we had to talk in private.  I went back there and there was a cat and a chicken bleeding.  The chicken had human-like blood, but the cat's blood was clear red.
