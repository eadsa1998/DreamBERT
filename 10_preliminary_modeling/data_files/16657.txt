I was back at _________ at Westport High School, and I was going to some English class. And I knew that there would be a fire drill scheduled in the afternoon when I was in that class, but I had some homework that I really needed to turn in, so I went to this elevator. It was this really rickety elevator that wobbled and wobbled as you went up. And I was really scared in that elevator. But I got up to the class and took out and handed in my stuff and there was a substitute teacher and I just told her __________ schedule. And I need to already be outside so that I don't get lost in the shuffle. But it was close to the time change and my clock hadn't been changed an hour later, so I kept having to adjust in my mind and I was like doubting myself. And then I finally grabbed my books and ran down the stairs a few minutes before it was supposed to be 2:30. And I think I just went up to the lawn in the front of the school and sat down, and then I woke up.
