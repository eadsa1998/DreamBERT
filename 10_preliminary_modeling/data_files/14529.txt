The Sims 3 teasers were offline at the moment. There was a game that Ezra and I played where you play tennis in a jail-like setting. It always reminded me of Bellick (Prison Break). I was at home and I needed to change my shirt but had nothing that fit (it was all my old clothes). Someone in the family was over with a kid and someone was pregnant. Mom said that her pregnancy test was negative.
