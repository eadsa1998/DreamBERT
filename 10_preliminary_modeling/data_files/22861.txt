[In the dream, I have a sense of déjà vu, but in waking life I don't remember having dreamed it before.]  Some other people and I are riding down an incline on something like a ski lift--or an airplane, but not as high as an airplane.  Off to our left is a green meadow with several cathedrals, with various and beautiful architectural designs.  We are quite a bit higher than them, but can see all of each one.  Next, we are on a bus on the same incline, but on a highway heading down toward a river or a lake.  It looks like we will run right into it, but we turn on a highway running alongside it.  We aren't going very fast.  Next, we are on a dock.  Rev. Findley is flipping a quarter.  He misses it, and it falls into the water about 2-feet deep.  We can see it from the bank.  Jimmy Duggan says he will get it, but he doesn't.  I test the water, and it is lukewarm, so I go in.  I come out of the water dripping, but don't remember getting the coin.
