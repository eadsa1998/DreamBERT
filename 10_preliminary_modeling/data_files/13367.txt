Dad took us to this place with lots of houses. We were looking for house number 9. In it housed cousins of ours. We had met one of them before when we were little because the Dad had two brothers. One of them was called Eddie and he was really hot. The mother was a cow. They had had two more sons. One kid was gay and he and Ezra were playing. They had a parrot and it kept saying stuff about Darius and I was thinking of Evelyn. There was a DVD of Aeonflux on the floor and Charlize Theron was on the cover.
