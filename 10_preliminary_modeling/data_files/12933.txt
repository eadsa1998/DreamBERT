Calvin and I were going to some casino. Later, he turned into Tom Welling. It was night and there was this creepy dude down this street. We only had a couple of dollars so we got more money. We saw Seamus and Elijah and I said "Shiggan!". There was a bus stop and Ezra was with us. This guy asked us questions. He said that I was similar to his girlfriend because she was "anti-Christian". We turned into Pokemon and we were going to see Skarmory.
