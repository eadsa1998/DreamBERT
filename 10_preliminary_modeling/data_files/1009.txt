It's somebody's wedding. I'm going to sing a duet with the bride because she's nervous and doesn't want to do it alone. There's a crowd like at a movie theatre. I go out to get a cup of coffee. As I'm going back in, I hear her singing the duet alone. I remember the word "Jean." It's her name. I feel badly and I try to get there for her. The crowd gets in the way. I realize that she's doing O.K.
