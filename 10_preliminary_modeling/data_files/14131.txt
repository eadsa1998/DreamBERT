I was playing a Mario game. I called it Super Mario Sunshine a few times. It started off as a race and I had to collect stuff on the way. You had to collect people (celebrities) and coins and other stuff that was scattered around. You got stars (like in Mario games). I won the race the first time but skipped a lot of the stuff. I tried another time and there was Neve Campbell and Drew Barrymore and some other girl. The other girl had to take Neve's place and wear a weird hat. There was a wood slope up and you had to be Beaver Mario to get up. There was a platform with holes, which was covered in people. Dad came home and had no pants on. I told him and he put a shirt on. I told him I was playing because I was going to study later and it was boring.
