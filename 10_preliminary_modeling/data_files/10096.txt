We are with friends and I talk with them about MARRIAGE: I make the analogy of helping one's mate by "pulling them out of the mud" or clearing weeds away; when the mate is swimming in the lake. I also say: "If you have a 10-speed bike and you have an old 3 speed bike, you must stop and wait for the other person to get out of the mud.... Frank is very PLEASED, and we go to bed and sleep. I hear the alarm (in my dream) and say we don't have to get up we can rest....
