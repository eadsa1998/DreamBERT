My friend and I got in the car. She spoke of an old building. He said that was before my time. I thought Dr. And was older than that; but looking at the man more closely, I saw that it wasn't Dr. And though it looked like him, redheaded also; perhaps it was his son. Two more strange men came. Where could they sit in this small car? Then I saw two women in chairs beside us. I thought I'd read my paper but then a girl was passing refreshments. She gave me a rich cake. I wondered who our host was. There were other delicious-looking refreshments. The girl told me one was a peanut butter kind. I asked for its recipe. Then a man brought some 4' by 1' pieces of toast and some cheese. I tore off a similar length of cheese.
