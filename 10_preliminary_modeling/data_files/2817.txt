I am a business woman, a professional, and very busy. I am in a house and look out a window and see down below, outside, an old Greek style ruins with the wildness of an unkept garden through it. I wish to go see it; it looks interesting, but I am preparing for something. There are three strong, muscular men, my exhusband, a sort of Arnold Swartzenegger type, and a young Burt Reynolds type and a third man. They all love me and follow me around, getting in my way. Now I am me and I carry a cat that belongs to the busy woman the men love. I see a man who has been spreading rumors about the woman and I stand in front of him, looking down at him, and give him a strong lecture about how insensitive and cruel he was to speak about something he didn't know, only guessed at, and spread the word. Now it is causing harm to the woman. He is embarrassed and very sorry.
