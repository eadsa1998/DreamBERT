I was supposed to go somewhere with some friends, I think on a trip or something, and I was supposed to ride this bus, like a Greyhound bus. And it was supposed to come, it was either early in the morning or late at night, but it was dark outside. And I remember coming out with my bag and then afraid to get on it, so it just left me. And it went around the block and came back, and it backed up with the back-up alarm sound. And the driver yelled at me over the intercom to get on it, and so I did. And I was looking around for a place to sit -- it was a really big bus -- and I picked a seat kind of in the middle. And I put my bags down; it was my usual school bag, bag. And every time the bus had to turn, it had to use that back-up alarm sound, that two-tone back-up alarm sound. And there were two buses that were going on this trip. The one was the bus that I was riding and the other was another bus with a group. And this driver of this bus was so careless, when the bus needed to turn and had to use that back-up alarm, and it would turn in front of the other one and it would run it so close, it like scraped the front of the other one a few times. And I remember it was so close to an accident a couple times, and it was dark out. And next thing I know, I'm awake.
