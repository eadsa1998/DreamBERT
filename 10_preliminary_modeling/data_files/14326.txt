I was in the car with Mom and it was windy. There were these tent like buildings around, made of a thin see-through white material and as it was windy, these poles had been put in place to hold them and also gave them shape. Then Calvin and I were walking around outside. I wondered how deep the "doopy things" were and Calvin went and pulled one out and it was barely in the ground. He just dropped it and then we heard someone telling on him and he ran to put it back. This dude, who I thought was a teacher, asked him what his name was and he said "Bluth, Michael Bluth". We kept walking. Some parts were closed off and we had to take detours, but Calvin knew where to go so I followed him. We walked up this path which went up this hill and there was a rocky path. He suddenly jumped off the edge and I went to follow but realized it was a long fall and went to stop, but I slipped and was then hanging onto the edge. Calvin laughed. I started edging across until I got to a lower part and then I dropped off. A guy who looked like Bellick (Prison Break) was standing around and he had recorded it. I took a photo with my phone of the 'cliff' thing. Then we went to the Science Museum with Ezra. I said "I haven't been here for years". There was a poster on the wall when you first walk in, saying "squeal for 12 seconds". Calvin made a squeal and it was like a distorted echo and so I did one squeal. He kept going for a while. Ezra slowly came in after us and I motioned for him to come over. Everything was close together and it looked like Timezone. Two girls were playing air hockey and a guy was waiting for them to finish.
