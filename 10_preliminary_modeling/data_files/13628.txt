I was out the back. Clark Kent and Chloe (both Smallville) were in the pool. I asked Mom for some water. She gave me some and I went in the pool. I accidentally swallowed some pool water. I got out and was almost vomiting (it tasted gross). I took a drink and spat some out. There were maggots and these big worms in it. The worms had this metal looking armour on them. I complained to Mom "There are maggots in the water! That's disgusting!".
