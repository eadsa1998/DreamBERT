Someone was trying to break into my house through the front door. I realized that I did not have the alarm set, even though the dead bolt was set and the chain was on. They were trying to break the wood. I was leaning against the wood of the door to try to keep them out and I reached up and set the alarm. As they heard it beeping to set they took off. I looked out the peephole and saw that it was three young males all dressed in black. As they took off they had to run over a huge pile of rubble in my front yard that resembled the piles of rubble rescue workers are going through in NY right now. While I was dreaming I thought that's what it looked like. I realized the alarm wasn't working because it didn't set. I ran and got my phone to call 911. They came back and started trying again. I called 911 and could hardly speak. They found something to unlock the deadbolt. I managed to turn it back again and hold it against their efforts to unlock it again. Then I saw the chain was off and reached up and refastened it. I looked through the peephole again and one of the young men was looking through the hole back at me. I wasn't sure if he could see me. I kept to one side and was looking out at an angle. I slowly moved my finger across the hole to be sure he wouldn't see me. They seemed to be making progress at getting the wood in the door to give. I placed my back against the door where they were trying to make it break in and then I placed my feet against the steps directly across from the door. I thought this would keep them from being successful.
