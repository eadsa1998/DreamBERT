It was like The 4400 and Ezra and I had both been taken. We were at some place with a big forest. Nana and Poppa were there. I think earlier on, but after we had come back, that I was at a place with Graham Chapman and we both had an ear infection. There was a little 8 year old girl, called Sara and she was dead but some strange thing was going on, and she was married to Graham and was also dating five others, including a Michael Palin gardener guy. But she was only 8 and I asked about this, but I didn't get a proper answer. She told me and Graham to put ear drops in our left ear, so we did. It made a strange noise, but it worked. This gardener bloke had been taken as well, I think. I was 'dating' the Michael Palin gardener and also a Michael Palin other person. Even though I had only been back a day or two. Earlier, we were (all the people that got taken) at this place and it had a big ball of light in the middle and it got smaller and smaller and then disappeared. Then we heard it would be back tonight at this little house thing. 1400 people were in the country by the way. I was walking up a hill with Dad, Ezra, Nana, Poppa and Mike Palin gardener. The other Mike Palin guy was there and said hi. Nana joked that I was dating them. I was, but she didn't know. When we walked back down, Nana said she was going to do something and then come to see the light. I was trying to work out what my power was. We got to the house. I got to the middle of the house and there was Ezra, Dad and I and some scary zombie-looking girl. The light appeared as a little squishy ball and it exploded. The 'camera' went bird's eye view and showed heaps of birds flying out of the forest.
