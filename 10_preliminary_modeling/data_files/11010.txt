Bill and I were sitting at the counter in Wade's drug store when suddenly in came this blonde whore in a red satin tight-fitting dress and started flirting with Bill (then my steady boyfriend). As she walked in, the room changed into a bar all lit up with cheap neon lights and lots of noise and smoke. Then she went over and stood by the stairs leading to the hotel rooms and he looked over at her and asked me to excuse him for a few minutes and walked over toward her.
