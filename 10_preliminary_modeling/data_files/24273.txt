First, I was in the city where I did my newspaper internship. There was a big festival. A carnival. The streets were packed. I left and decided to just hang out with a friend. The fireworks came. They were massive and brilliant. I was sitting with her alone in a dark outdoor place. I remember seeing the faint trail of a comet in the sky; not just a far-away check mark, but a hazy spray of particulated ice. These turned into the fireworks display; I was surprised, since most municipalities are cutting back on fireworks. I said "I'm glad I didn't drive. If I did, I would have just walked home. I remember being across the river, near to my apartment.
