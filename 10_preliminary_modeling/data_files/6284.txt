This is one of the strangest dreams that I have recalled. There was a long table in a dimly lit room. The table had a long red cloth covering it. There were six or seven chairs, and seated in the chairs were brunettes. They were dressed all the same, in blue nightgowns. They were discussing about what they wanted for dinner. After a few seconds, a blonde appeared from the left side of the table and volunteered for the task to look for food, simultaneously grinning and exposing teeth. The teeth were shared by two pointed fangs with a touch of red at the points. I woke up realizing they were talking about hunting humans. Preferably men.
