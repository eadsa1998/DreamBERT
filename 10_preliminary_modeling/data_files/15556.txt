I was getting married. I was with a bunch of people the night before, getting drunk, and someone was unhappy about it. On the day of the wedding, I was worried I would get my period. There were people making jokes about the 'wedding night'. Mom and Nana were there. I went to the toilet and Kurt (Glee) was a part of it, and we were good friends. Some people were bullying him and he was upset. I walked past and there was a group protecting him.
