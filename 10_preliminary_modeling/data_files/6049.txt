I had this dream where my friend Jen was making fun of my puffy hair. Then my other friend Sara started saying more things about it. I then threw my keys down and ran out down the hall crying. Then I was in a supermarket and a girl I hadn't seen since high school came in line and she was comforting me, telling me it was all right.
