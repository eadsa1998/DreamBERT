 I'm in a building with my friend Emerald Reinhold. We run around, as if in a game, and go by our friends Holly Lapson and Jill Banks near some stairs. We try to sneak by them. We get into an area where a person is. It is like we shouldn't be there. We hurry to move. We go to a place where there is an "exit" sign, but I'm not sure if that is where we want to go. We exit. Something happens without an elevator. Outside the building and the elevator there are three black men loading bicycles into something. I am scared of them, but help them move the bicycles. I am bare foot. There is broken glass on the ground.
