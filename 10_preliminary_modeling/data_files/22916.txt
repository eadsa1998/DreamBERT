I was at some large gathering like a picnic, in the middle of a large field; as a matter of fact, it was near the Fairgrounds in my hometown, because I remember pointing out the "Golden Thriller" statue to Bonita.  We didn't know our way around very well, and decided we could guide on that statue as a reference point to get where we wanted to go.  Anyway, at some point, we were all in cars in the middle of this big field.  It was damp and rainy, and we may have been just getting in out of the rain, or we may have been preparing to leave.  On my home, though, either then or later, I was on foot.
