I was sitting on a stool peeling potatoes - they were piled up all around me ... and I kept trying to finish them but I didn't even finish one. Finally I saw a policeman walk by, and, I tried to get to him but I couldn't get over the pile of potatoes - My mother and sister were walking with him - but they talked to me just as if I weren't stuck or in trouble. My pleas to get away from all the potatoes were ignored - I recall crying and I woke up with a dry throat and slightly coughing.
