I was in Northern British Columbia and I was walking down a street. At the end of the street was a beautiful lake. I was wearing goggles and I found that I couldn't see very well without them off. I went into a drug store but I could buy anything. I realized this was where I wanted to live. My friends were making snowballs near the lake. They were wearing ski clothes. Setting: British Columbia, Canada, in a small town. Characters: Emily, a good friend; Will, a boy I know not very well; and a store keeper. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I wanted to see clearly without my goggles, but I couldn't. I felt trapped.
