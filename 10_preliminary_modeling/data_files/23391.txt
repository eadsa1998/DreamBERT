There were three guys -- I don't know if I was one of them or someone watching. I guess I was doing some of both. One had a girlfriend he slept with at like-a-college-frat house (that was a glimpse I remember). They all wanted to go to the top of a mountain and look at the stars or party -- something. But one guy was at the frat party and someone said he was shot. Next thing we were at the girlfriend's door -- it had her name on it. We went inside and the girl and the guy were shot dead. But it wasn't our friend, so we went searching for him.
