In this dream two guys were breaking into my car and one guy was trying to break into my house by breaking a window on the bottom level. I heard the noise and woke up and looked out the window. When I saw this I got my compound bow out from under my bed and was ready for the guy to come up the stairs. My father got my sister and called the police staying in his room with the door locked. When the guy reached the top of the stairs I told him not to move. He pulled out a gun and shot at me once. Then I shot back and hit him in the kneecap. I then ran into my father's room and got out his 9mm and was ready for the others. When they reached their partner I told them if they moved they would end up like he did except with bullets instead of an arrow. The police finally arrived and arrested them. I did not get in trouble for shooting the guy because he shot at me first.
