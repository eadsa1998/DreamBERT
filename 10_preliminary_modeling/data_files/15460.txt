I was at Nana's. There was a broom placed across the ramp to the back door. I asked why later on but I never got an explanation. Dad said he noticed the shoes had been put away and I realised I didn't take my shoes off before coming in. Someone was singing 'The Way It Is' and I went down the ramp near the granny flat. The geese and chickens were there and I squealed. Poppa was there and he tried to scare them away. I went inside and Ezra got a guy to call Uncle Vic (who was there) and tried to sell him something. There was a thing on TV with Alison Brie, then a thing with Chevy Chase and I said 'he's everywhere'. I said something to Ezra like 'I'm Chevy Chase and yeah, no" in an American accent. I tried to rewatch Juno and it was different and not as bad, but still bad and I said 'I can't watch this'. Mom and I went to a petrol station and I asked for a chocolate. The security guard got in the driver's seat and messed with the lights and we were confused.
