Am in some foreign city and look up to see smoke coming from open windows of a house. Then see a strong stream of water shoot into windows and note it seems to come from a light brown pistol which doesn't seem attached to any pump. I marvel at the force of water from such a small pistol and watch as the stream goes thru window and plays up and down and at shelves and furniture. Also note there doesn't seem to be any fire in room.
