I was in class on Friday and that my Spanish teacher was like a gifted teacher and a Spanish teacher combined. And she was like talking about these intellectual things and all, and on Friday I dreamt that she assigned us a paper to write in Spanish about our life and how it has been unfolding up to this point. And I was thinking that I would be able to do this because I was feeling confident about being able to express myself in Spanish, but I was feeling completely distraught over the fact that I thought I was going to have a week off, but here now I have this paper that I have to do, and that I'm going to have to do it on my trip because I have no other way to do it. And then, as I was slowly fading into consciousness, I was realizing that, hey, this is a dream, I don't even have Spanish class on Fridays and I got my Ethics paper done. And I know there was more to it, but I can't think of it at this time. And then that was it.
