I awoke cast on the beach of an island (presumably shipwrecked) with Janet, a girl from my hometown. We traveled around the whole island and found it to be level, about two miles in circumference and completely uninhabited. We had nothing but the clothes we were wearing. I set to work building a rough lean-to for the night. She gathered a wild grain stalk (either hay or wheat) to make a mattress of a sort. We got all of this material possible to put over us anticipating a cold night. We talked over our plight and made tentative plans for the next day. We retired early. As the night got colder she cuddled close to me. I kissed and embraced her and felt that she was completely mine. I respected her too much to take advantage of her and make love to her. With this thought the dream just trailed off into nothing.
