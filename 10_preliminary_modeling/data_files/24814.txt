All I remember is that I was in this nice big old medieval castle, with stone walls and everything, and I was having a really nice big feast. I also remember something briefly about a pig. Setting: In a castle. Characters: Pigs. I really like them. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. Well, I love food and pigs.
