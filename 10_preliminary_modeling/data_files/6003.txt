My girlfriend X. and I are on a guided tour of the White House in Washington, D. C. The tour guide informs us that tonight the President (Clinton) will attend a performance of a famous female singer (I can not recall which one.) The tour ends and I go to my parents' house for dinner. At the dinner table I mention that X. and I are going back out after the meal. We then get into a car and drive around a big city at night. We see a theater all lit up with a big marquee announcing a singing performance of the famous female singer. "Oh that lucky Bill Clinton", I say, "She is performing for him." Suddenly X. and I are walking around the inside lobby of the theater, where the furnishings are plush and ornate, and where everyone is formally dressed. Out of the corner of my eye I see my mother walk past. She is dressed up for the concert also, but she doesn't see me. I keep walking by, hoping not to be noticed. I vaguely hear X.'s voice behind me, sounding surprised at meeting my parents, but I keep walking ahead. Now there is an escalator and I go down. I hear my name being called but I am out of everyone's sight and I keep walking to another escalator, which I descend. Another time my name is called -- it is my mother's voice -- and now I feel as if I can not escape any longer. I look up and I see a balcony about two stories above me. There are my mother, my father and my girlfriend looking down at me.
