There was some supernatural thing going on. I was watching this video of this lady, who was a pro zombie killer, was left at this fake apartment block. It was night. At the end of it, this helicopter came and she went outside and all the zombies were dead. I was also a good zombie killer. I was at this house with some others and we had been fighting zombies. I came across this normal blonde haired dude who threatened us, but he got away. Later we were walking down a hall and he was there and had someone next to him and behind us. Scarlett was attacked by the guy behind us and she fought with him. I killed the two near me with a knife and Scarlett was gone and I figured she had been killed. I turned the corner and this guy with spiky black hair was there. I thought I knew him, but I didn't. I think I killed him and this guy I did know turned up. We were rivals. He walked out of the building, saying loudly, that I'd killed his friends and my friend, Scarlett. There were cops surrounding the exit and I was arrested. Then it showed Scarlett in hospital and she was ok. Callie (Grey's Anatomy) said to her, "I love you" and kissed her. I was let off and I ended up setting something up for the guy. I had gotten him to pick something (a number or a card or something) and he said "I pulled out 70". He chased me down a street and I jumped into a ditch and then the cops pulled up and got him. This old guy was talking to them and said he'd seen two people. They asked if he knew the names of them and as I ran off, I heard him say "Izzy Conell" and I was thinking 'damn it!'. I went home, which was different and was like a unit. I had to walk up steps to get to the front door (a second storey). Ezra had an empty water bottle, so I went to get more and he filled them up, which surprised me. We were having mudcake with cream [we had some last night and it was really nice]. I showed Mom and she was unfazed. We also had lasagna for dinner. There were Pokemon game boxes on the table.
