There was this girl called Cheyenne, who looked a little bit like the real one, but she was foreign. The real Cheyenne looked different and had a different name. She wanted to be my friend and kept following me, but she couldn't speak English. I was in a toilet and the door was munted because I went to the special toilets, there were two sections. One section had loose doors and was for noobs, and the other section had better doors and I changed to a good toilet. Mom, "Cheyenne", and I were in a car and Mom was taking us somewhere but I don't remember where.
