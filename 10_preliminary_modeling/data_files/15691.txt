I had this box thing and the only way to open it was using high temperatures. I was running and then I jumped into the water. There were all these danger/warning signs because it was hot there. I started swimming to the cooler side and stopped when it was tolerable. A friend or something came to help me and then I died. Then it was 2 years later and I was like a ghost. Apparently what I'd done had something to do with work and Howard wasn't letting me out of the contract. I complained to someone that I'd died and he was still keeping me here and he heard and I went invisible and walked away as he started yelling at me. It was Independence Day and I realised I'd forgotten and had also forgotten my birthday the day before. I was at an office building which had a weird elevator with multiple sections. I ordered a water from a little booth thing.
