Huge storm coming: I see waters recede and disappear. Sky is purple and green: ominous. Then a flood. We are in a RR car, going uphill against the flood waters. I see the debris on the RR tracks. We are stalled. We have only two or three cans of food left. Later I help Father Andrew with rehabilitation work. Father Andrew wears green corduroy pants.
