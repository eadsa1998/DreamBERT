I went skiing with my family and I saw the boy I like. My brother Adam and I went snowboarding. We went on expert runs and I was really good. We went on a run that had a huge rock cliff and I almost went over it. Then I was scared. At the lodge, the boy was hugging me and stuff because I was his girlfriend. I was really happy. Then we had to leave and I said I'd see him soon. Setting: A ski resort. Characters: the boy a like, who's a nice, good snowboarder. My brother, nice, good snowboarder. I didn't know the other skiers and snowboarders. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I liked it and hope it will come true.
