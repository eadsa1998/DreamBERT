["Angry at Uncle Wilbur."] I am on a couch seated with Uncle Wilbur who is going to be married to Dora. He gives me some advice and as he speaks I yell and talk over him deliberately. He is shocked at my rudeness and angry at me for being disrespectful. I don't care and continue doing it over and over. I have had enough of his bad advice. A good looking blonde man is now talking over to my left and I turn to hear him. This further annoys Uncle Wilbur. He keeps trying to get my attention and I keep ignoring him.
