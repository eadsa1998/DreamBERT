I was at 'school'. Fatima, Calvin, some others and I were outside of our class. Someone gave us a sheet of paper which said "I love someone" and my name was on there ('I' had signed it). I said that it wasn't my hand writing. They went to show someone else the paper and I followed. I left before them but this teacher lady made us all stay back. My desk was at the front of the classroom. We were seated: Fatima at the wall, Calvin, Lucia, someone, then me. Lucia was out of her seat.  We were doing some stuff on the floor. Eugene was behind us and he said that they couldn't fit behind me. I started yelling about them calling me fat and that I didn't "have to look like a prostitute like them". I saw Eugene looking at me and I was like 'oh...'. His friends asked him later to ask me out, but he said he didn't want to (it was mean). The teacher was in this office and said "Izzy?" and I said "Me?".
