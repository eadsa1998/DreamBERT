I was playing a game sort of like the Wheel of Fortune. You spun a wheel that had a bunch of wood panels on it. When you spun the wheel you pushed down as many panels as you could. Setting: I don't remember. Characters: I did not know the people in my dream. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, strange. I was happy, but I thought the game was really strange.
