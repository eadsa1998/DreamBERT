My sister, some man (about 25) who I didn't recognize and about 5 other people were in an airplane sitting right in back of the pilot. The pilot started the plane down the runway and the next thing I knew we were speeding down a highway on our way to C. The plane just stayed on the ground and the pilot kept talking to us all the time. I don't know what he was saying however. Then my alarm woke me up.
