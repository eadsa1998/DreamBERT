Leighanne and I are talking about writing projects. She is working on one and I am popping up with ideas which she uses in her project. I look at her formula way of doing the work. She creates a large board and puts (in this case) pictures she drew of walls because she's writing a book about horse things you can put on walls. As we talk, I say to Leighanne, "We are essentially equals." But I feel hesitant like maybe she's better than me. She kind of smiles.
