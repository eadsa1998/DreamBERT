Carla was in band and they were going to march in the May Day parade. She was getting dressed and I was helping her. I told her to put her shoes on. She did and she took her jacket off. I told her to put her jacket back on. Then she took off something else. I was getting angry and it was almost time. The band was lining up and she still wasn't ready. I woke up, so I don't know if she made it.
