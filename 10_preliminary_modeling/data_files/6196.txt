My last dream was that I was walking around the city, in and near the neighborhood I live in, in a rainstorm very late at night. I was warm and only wearing a T-shirt and jeans. I was alone. I mean there was no one around and (this is funny) no cars on the streets, passing or parked. There were no cars. So I was walking up Charles Street and the next thing I know I am walking into this dead end of a street also on Beacon Hill. Three guys jump me and I fight back. They say, "Give us your wallet." I say, "I'll give you just the money," and they say, "Give us your leg." I use a fake leg for walking (not just in the dream, real life, too). I say no. They end up beating me real good but they, in the end, don't get the leg. End of dream.
