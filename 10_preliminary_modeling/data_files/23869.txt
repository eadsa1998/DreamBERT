I had moved back to Moab.  As I drove and walked around the streets I knew so well, people came up to me and greeted me and welcomed me back.  Even people whom I could not remember their names, knew my name.  I was surprised people remembered who I was.  It was a good feeling, feeling missed and welcomed back, familiar, a homecoming.  I recognized the streets.  I remember going to a convenience store, parking, going inside, getting things.  I knew this place, it was familiar, even where I parked.
