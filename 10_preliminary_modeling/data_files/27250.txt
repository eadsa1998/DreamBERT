My former room-mate had an apartment and her colored maid was working for her. I came to live with her--I remember it was out of town. someone else, very fashionable but not very secure financially--I can't remember who it was--came to stay with us. She offered to keep house for us in order to pay &amp; I remember thinking it was a great concession. vaguely I remember we were always taking showers. If my room-mate were taking a shower I handed her clothes through the door. She followed the same procedure with me. I suddenly realized that I wasn't paying &amp; she told me that my mother was paying her mother in C-- for my board but she would appreciate my paying rent.
