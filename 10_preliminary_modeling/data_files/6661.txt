I was telling C.H. about my research. Said the average S.L. of the Chines group was 3.8% and % of nouns 5.0. She expresses surprise. Then told her about the E.I. difference but couldn't remember how much. Just then, Pres. C. came up and said, "My dear, how about your research? I am anxious to hear about it." So I eagerly told him I had just finishes calculation on one age level, had to explain that to him. He sat down to listen and I began to repeat what I had told C.H. [Actually did tell him about my research on April 3.]
