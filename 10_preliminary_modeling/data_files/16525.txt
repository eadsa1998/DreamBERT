I was getting ready to start packing up and moving, and I dreamt somebody gave me a Maya (?) Car_____ DVD as a present and not only did it have the concert of her greatest tapes, but it sort of told a little story in the background about her and what she would do before her shows. And so we had that on for a little while and I was outside at the picnic table working on DP or something, and my whole setup and everything was out there. And I was, I had like papers and junk all over the picnic table and all over the ground outside, and then I figured it was getting too mosquito-y, so I would come in and start packing up all the papers and junk. And I was putting them in this huge bin, this plastic thing, and then I came in and somebody wanted to take a walk with us. I don't know if it was Merrilee or who. But that was pretty much all there was to it.
