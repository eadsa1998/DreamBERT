I dreamed that the boy I am pinned to died. I could see him very plainly lying on a plank with his light blue sweater on. He is 26. I was crying very much, but every so often, he would sit up and laugh and I would be happy for awhile; however the people around me told me that he was really dead. Then I cried again and he once more sat up and smiled. This happened several times.
