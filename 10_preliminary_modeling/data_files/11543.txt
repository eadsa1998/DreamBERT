I was in my home in New Castle, Pa, with my parents. There was a foreign army marching outside. Our house was being guarded by a soldier in front and a soldier in back. There was also an enemy soldier sitting in the front. Our family was huddling in the kitchen trying to think of a way to escape. We decided to sneak down to the cellar and go out an obscure door that was very seldom used. We went down the stairs quietly so that the soldier in the front room would not hear us. Our family got out the door safely and then we all ran in different directions. I ran and ran and ran and the next thing I knew I was awake.
