There were cops at a petrol station and we had trouble pulling up. We went to a bowser and but we kept going too far forward. We went into a shop later and Calvin was there and he said hello. When we went back to the car, Mom said something about his mother dying and I said something like, 'why would he be working/he would've said something'. I was then at the old house and Ezra's room was different. He showed me and Dad his wallpaper on the computer. It was Dean's (Supernatural) face with a 'comedic' angry expression. I said "Fetch [no idea why]. At least he didn't say my least favourite word". I laughed, remembering the episode the wallpaper was from. I said it was the one with this dog which was crazy and barked a lot. But it actually wasn't and it was from the most recent episode. Then I was watching the episode and the dog chased me into this office and I closed the door. Dean shouted and said he was 'in' the dog (possessing it). I opened the door and I could hear him. He half joked about finding a female dog for me. Then I was watching Torchwood or something. Every child kept saying "where is Eugene?" and I was like 'I wish I knew [about Eugene]'. A group of kids saw this kid and stopped and realized the kid was 'Eugene'. They chased him up a tower.
