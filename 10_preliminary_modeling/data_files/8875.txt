It's as though I'm watching the TV program House, except that some things are very different than they were in the program last night. They were trying to figure out what the relationship problem was between Dr. Foreman and Dr. Cameron, why he had a problem with her. Someone said that it was because Dr. Foreman had a romantic interest in Dr. Cameron. As soon as they said it someone else realized that this probably was true, that this probably was the problem.
