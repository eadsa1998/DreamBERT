A married couple are fighting. The man is cold and selfish. The woman may be Asian. I see a baby, their baby, fall off a high dock into an ocean. I am afraid for the baby. The mother sees it too and dives quickly off the dock into the waters. His granny did too, but she's more hindrance than help. I feel dread and fear as I hope I don't have to witness the drowning of this baby, and there is not a thing I can do to help. I watch as the mother strongly swims over to him and saves him, then let's him float underwater, teaching him to swim, so if this happens again, he will be safe. I am anxious and want her to bring the baby up to safe, dry land right now, but I realize her strategy is best.
