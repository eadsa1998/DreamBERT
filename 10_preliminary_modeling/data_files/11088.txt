I was in a dance studio practicing and at first I was the only one in there. Soon several women came in to watch me. After a while there were what seemed like hundreds of children watching me and standing so close that I could hardly move. I was afraid to tell them to move, but for some reason or other they all went and sat down on a window seat. I got nervous with all of them watching and I went over to the barre to exercise. I was so scared by that time that my legs seemed to weigh me down and when I went to do kicks, I could hardly lift them. Everyone started laughing.
