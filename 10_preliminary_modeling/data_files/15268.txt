I replied to an ad for a job at Bunnings and was hoping there wouldn't be a group interview for it. Then I had to do some assignment. There was something about Nintendo and someone asked this other girl and she said that she'd been playing Nintendo 64 since she was young. Then they asked me and I said "60% N64 and 40% PC". They were like 'wow, N64 wasn't even the highest'. This guy was called Mike Spencer and he sat on a couch. Mom was nearby and I felt uncomfortable with her listening. I had to go down a level and had to do an interview with Mr Billings for some hospital thing.
