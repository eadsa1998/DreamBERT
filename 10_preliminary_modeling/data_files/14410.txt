I was at a funeral, but I don't know who for. I was with friends and people I knew. Then Gramps had died and we were at his funeral. I couldn't remember where he had been for all the years though. We were standing outside and Granny was crying. I was supposed to be the one pushing the coffin in (that was what happened, someone would just give it a push and it would fall into this thing). Afterwards, some others and I went to a room. There were seats and they were all layered (like steps). This teacher lady was talking. She had her young daughter (say, four years old?) who had blonde hair drawing in the front row. The teacher had brown hair. She asked if we thought only the important subjects should get taught at schools. All the people who agreed stayed. We all moved into the middle so it would look like more people were there. Evelyn left. Brent and Luciano were there and I was sitting between them. Brent's arm was in my way and I pushed it and he looked angry and pulled it away. I then felt embarrassed. The teacher started handing out pictures and things of musicians. I saw Beatles stuff and got excited. There was a John Lennon magazine? She then gave me and someone a heap of Curly Wurly's, a trolley and money and led us to a huge shop. Dad was at a funeral. I was then in a liquor store and Dad came in. I had been asked to buy this bottle, but as I didn't have ID, I asked Dad to get it "for Mom and Darren". Also, the teacher lady had some funeral as well. We were walking off and were all drunk. I felt light-headed and was having trouble keeping my balance. We went into this big empty house (there was a lot of us) and people started just falling asleep on the floor.
