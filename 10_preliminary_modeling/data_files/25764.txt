 I'm at home at Fishing Haven. An alarm goes off. My roommate Sean Williams talks a long time to get up. I get up too. I am working later in the day. I put on my brown corduroy pants, green J-Crew shirt, and blue sweatshirt. There is a dry erase board with a picture of my truck on it. The bumper of my truck has been damaged in a hit and run accident. The bumper is now rubbing the tire. I am mad! I go look at the damage.
