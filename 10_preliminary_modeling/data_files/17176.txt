I had a dream on campus, I'm not sure if I was trying to get my boyfriend Jeremy to stay over night or what.  It was raining, and I remembered getting ready for bed.  And somewhere in the dream, my teeth were loose.  I sort of woke up and had to check to make sure they weren't in reality.  My great fear.
