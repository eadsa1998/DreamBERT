I was sitting in the back of the car. Ezra was in the front and Dad was driving us home. There was this thing blocking the way. Dad drove into it but it was stretchy, so when we went forward Dad and Ezra were like "oops" and it flung back. I looked behind and saw a tree. I was picturing a branch going right through me, so I was thinking "I'm dead". Then it was minutes later. Timothy Stack had gotten in the way so he had been pushed into the tree as well as me, but we were ok.
