["Valentine cards at the wrong season."] I live in a kind of boarding house. My mother is the "house" mother. I walk downstairs. I am now sitting on a couch and trying to weave or knit something out of a soft creamy white yarn. A man sits near me on my right. He's kind of a nerd, like Charles S. of high school and a bit like the Charles I met last year at the conference in California. He seems friendly and I am not particularly interested in him. He comments on my yarn project. I show him the stitches and as he looks at them, he leans very close, and we keep brushing against one another innocently. I stand up and walk into the kitchen to find something. He follows. I see a candle is leaning too much to one side and try to position it more upright. He says Why don't you take a picture of it? As though it looked interesting. I sigh and say no, but then I change my mind and say what the heck. I go into the living room and pick up something thinking it was the camera. I am surprised to see it is a package of Valentine cards and I wonder out loud why I am addressing them at this time of year. I put them back and sit on the couch again. A woman is seated in a chair on the right. I ask do I know her? She says she thinks we were introduced. I say I don't remember you. Are you sure you didn't move in after I went away for a month? I then say I am the house mother's daughter. Oh, she says. So that's you, eh? Charles is near by again and suggests we look for the camera. I get up and go to a dresser and look around on the top. He points to a huge green plant hanging on the tall brick walls. He says I am surprised this cost $6 dollars. I say Really. Isn't it fake? He agrees it is fake.
