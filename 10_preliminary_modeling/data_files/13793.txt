I was at school. I had accounting and had to go to the library. Elijah, Daryl, Calvin and Genevieve were there. We went in and there was a guy at the desk. I explained we were there for accounting and he was like "oh, I don't know if I can let you" but eventually he did and I tried to sit next to Calvin but Genevieve got in the way.
