I am crossing a low and sluggish river where a bridge once was. There is mud and slime on everything, as if a flood recently had subsided. And it is ugly with dregs--toilet paper and turds like drying sewage? or little sticks? I walk carefully on the stones to get across. A dirty-looking man behind me sloshes through the mud and water, at times up to his knees. He seems to be following me. He has a scraggly chestnut beard, torn shirt, and frayed blue denim trousers. I think he is talking to me. Then I see his angry talk is to himself. Then I know that he is a scientist talking to portable tape recorder. He is reporting on environment, on harmful things in the river. A pollution study. I leave him by going up the bank by using broken timbers of bridge foundation as a ladder. I look behind and he is not following me. On a bank overlooking the river chasm, I have a secret apartment. I go in and immediately go to a bed against a wall and midway between two other walls. I have sex with a young woman about twenty. We try every position I wish. She is cheerful and obedient to my wishes. Mostly she is on bottom. We both watch my penis move in and out slowly. I'm impressed how long I keep the erection. It is a real size, not exaggerated. The penis is stronger in focus than the girl. She is pretty and honey-colored long hair. No talk or odd behavior at all. A grey blur? No. But not equally strong willed. I realize door is unlocked. What if my friend Jean comes to the door? I go and lock on inside. I must find the key to lock when I am away. I look for a moment in desk by door. I decide to search the room later, and head back for bed. As I went to door, bright moon made me think of Jean's hair. Or was it streetlight? I realize I haven't paid rent for 6 months.
