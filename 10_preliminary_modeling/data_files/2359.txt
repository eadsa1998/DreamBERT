A married woman who looks a little like me and whose hair feels like my mother's has suggested we make love. I feel uncomfortable, but also sexually excited, and I get into bed with her. I turn over on my side, with my back to her, thinking it would be better if we sleep first and then make love after we've rested. Actually, what I'm doing is avoiding it. So she approaches me and I shrug my shoulders and turn to face her. I can barely look her in the eye. I feel slightly disgusted and apprehensive. As she starts to take off my several layers of night gowns, I feel very excited, and then a younger woman comes into the bedroom through a skinny door by the bed. She glances at me and then says, "They're here." She goes to another door and opens it up. Several young, good-looking men come in and more women come in. These men are prostitutes. Her husband let them in. The woman goes to them and in a very business like manner. These people couple up, the man behind like he's riding a horse. They're all grunting and pumping. It's a pure sex act. I'm embarrassed. One guy comes to me and acts like he'll do me next. I say, "No." The woman whose bed I'm in is annoyed and disgusted with me. What a weenie! So she goes to the men and they're all going at it. I'm still sexually excited. I lay in the bed waiting for it to be all over and she returns so we can continue. Someone brings me the Visa bill to sign for my part of the festivities. I almost sign and then decide that since I didn't partake, I didn't have to pay. The woman heard this and glared at me. She's really disgusted with my wimpy behavior. I want to leave, but feel some obligation to wait and continue with plans as they originally were.
