This dream consisted of a vast grassy plain on a beautiful warm day. I was simply walking across this field. I just walked and walked. I was content and gay. I have no idea where I was walking to or where I was coming from. The setting of the dream--that is the field--is not familiar to me and I don't think it is any place that I have ever been.
