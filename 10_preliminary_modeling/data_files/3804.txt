["Driving the limosine."] Someone brought me a car. I look at it and am surprised to see it is a long cream colored limousine. I get in the driver's seat. Someone cautions me to be careful until I get used to the long size. I drive up a country road, mud and gravel and then turn, finding I can drive it with ease. It is fun.
