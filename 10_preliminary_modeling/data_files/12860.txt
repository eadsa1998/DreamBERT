I was at McDonald's. I was working and someone ordered 15 frozen Fanta's. I made two but then ran out of cups. I went to get some but I turned the corner and it was sparkling clean. I started talking to Co-Worker-F-01 and I forgot about the order. I then finished my shift and the people who ordered reminded me. I was then sitting at a table with some people from Queer as Folk (US). Hal Sparks and I were good friends. I wasn't really friendly with the rest of the cast. I was talking to Thea Gill and Michelle Clunie and I couldn't remember their real names, so was calling them by their characters names. Michelle kept saying that her character's name was Michelle.
