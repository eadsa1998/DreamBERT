A dream I don't recall well, revolving around the central theme that my wife and I are trying to get to know Frank Barron and his wife, or at least that I'm trying to get to know Barron well, but each time we try, I get involved in all sorts of irrelevant activities, get involved in the science instead of the personal relations. There is symbolism of a big tank of water being unbalanced because it is not sitting on a level surface and this is threatening, as it is dangerous if it tips. This seems symbolic somehow of getting involved in the wrong way. This theme of failing to get acquainted on a real personal level was apparently repeated in several dreams of the night -- I felt this in the dream, and possibly also felt that this was a very old theme of mine. There was also a fragment just before waking concerning some kind of prediction about our daughter's health, a dire prediction, but one that was not likely to come out. (Probably from day residue of our daughter cutting her lip badly last night.) This theme of failing to get to know another person or couple because of getting involved in trivia or "scientific" matters is one that has occurred in earlier dreams. Note: I helped Frank Barron test the people in the Oakland poltergeist case yesterday.
