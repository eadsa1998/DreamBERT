I drove through a very large car wash - unlike any I've seen in waking life. It looked like the type of large overhang many gas stations have that extend from their building out over several gas pumps to keep customers dry when it rains. The water for the car wash seemed to be coming down from this overhang, over the entire area, and whether any cars drove through it or not. I seemed to have entered it by mistake and had to figure out how to get out. I noticed toward one end if I turned a bit to the right and then to the left I would exit. At these points there were also some type of black posts, fairly small in diameter, that also seemed to have water shooting out horizontally. I had to drive between these to exit. I was getting ready to enter a McDonald's drive-thru to order breakfast. It was a very wide driveway. There was a car to the left with some people standing around it outside. There were also some people standing in the driveway to the right. I was baffled that none of these people seemed to be concerned that they were in the drive-thru and didn't seem to be at all concerned about being in the way of cars coming thru or about getting hit by these cars. As I pulled up to the speaker I was thinking about the fact that it has been years since I have had breakfast at a fast food place - something so unhealthy. As I came to a stop I heard the employee ask me what I wanted, they actually asked me about something in particular - one of their breakfast sandwiches. As I said, no thank you, I felt like I had to rush and order something. I knew I didn't want what they suggested. I didn't think I wanted anything like it because it was so unhealthy, but at the same time I was thinking that I used to enjoy the taste of their breakfast sandwiches. I was looking at the menu on the sign but was having trouble identifying anything quickly, so I finally just decided on something even though I wasn't at all sure that's what I wanted.
