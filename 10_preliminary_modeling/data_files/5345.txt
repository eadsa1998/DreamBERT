Last night I dreamed that Jackson was a horse manager/dealer or something, and Jessica and I were riding his horses in some show. Before the show we had to paint the horses. Jessica only painted one side, and Jackson was really mad. So I defended Jessica by saying, "Just because you can't get with her doesn't mean you have to be mean to her!" That shut him up! Then we rode our horses upstairs to the chairs outside the history wing. My mother was there, as well as all these mountain goats. Ben kept teasing the goats. Then I woke up.
