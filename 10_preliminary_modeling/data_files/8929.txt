I was working on a document for the SAID product booth. The document had information that was divided into about 12 different categories. I was working with a few other people and had asked someone to save and close it because I thought it was ready for use at the booth at the next conference. For some reason they didn't do it. I went to do it and I noticed within each category there were three sub-heads. Each one was underlined and in a different color text. As I looked at the text in the three sub-heads of the first category I realized that each one was just a different version of the other two. I knew this would not be good for the volunteers to work from. I thought I could quickly combine the three under each category so I began doing that. I'm sensing some kind of time pressure involved but I don't know what or why.
