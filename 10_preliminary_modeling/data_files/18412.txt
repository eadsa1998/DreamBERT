Then there's another dream which seems to happen some time after this, in which I'm wandering thru a big building that seems to be a combination of the university hospital and Memorial Hospital. And I'm trying to get back to my office. And I'm carrying a big bunch of wire with me. And this wire was used in the previous bank robbery, and it could be extremely incriminating if anyone caught me with this wire and recognized it for what it was. And I have to go thru a classroom, taught by an instructor and full of students I know. None of them seems to recognize the wire. And I get back in my office, and decide to take apart the string that holds this bunch of wire together, because that's one of the main things that would definitely place it as the wire that was involved in the bank robbery. And someone else wanders into my office during this procedure, but he apparently doesn't recognize that the wire was involved in the bank robbery. And he wanders out again. And I'm sitting there thinking what a terrible change I've taken, and why in the world did I rob that bank, and risk so much, when I'm so close to having a respectable career?
