I was working at White's and Louie Kaufman (deceased) was still foreman. I came in late, went by his desk, looked over the tickets where he had the line of machines for each operator and I couldn't find mine and the others were all nonsense, couldn't understand them. There was a tray of ripe tomatoes on the floor. I pushed them by his desk.
