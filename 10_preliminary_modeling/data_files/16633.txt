Somehow I found this ca__ that somebody must have given me years ago and I didn't know that I had. It was like a PDA thing, like a PDA thing for people that were visually impaired with sound only. And I couldn't really figure out what it did, or how it was supposed to work, but I was trying to figure out how it was supposed to work. When you first turn it on, it's really loud. I had to make it quieter to actually figure out how to make it work. And it looked a lot like the calculator I used to use in middle school. And that was kind of all there was to it. I guess it wasn't all that interesting after all. I could have sworn there was more to it.
