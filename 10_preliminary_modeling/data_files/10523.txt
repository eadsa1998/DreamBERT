I am riding in a crowded subway, meeting several people from the Book Cafe; when I reach my destination, Hillary comes on with JEANNIE (neighbor) and lends me a tiny camera. I take a photo, but I LOSE the CAMERA. I am worried and hope Hillary took it back home. I am walking to a subway and almost get on, when I realize that I have NO MONEY. I walk back home. It is 10 AM. I call Margaret to explain why; I am late. She thought I was sick. I am eager to tell her of my wonderful weekend, when I awaken.
