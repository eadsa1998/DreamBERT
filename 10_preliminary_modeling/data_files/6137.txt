I was reading the newspaper in the back room of my house which has windows around the entire room. A man with a patch over his eye was peeping in on me. When I got up to see what he wanted he ran around to the front door and left a bundle on the steps. When I went to grab him the man fell into the scrubs and seemed to have disappeared. All I saw next was a small frog hopping away from the scene. The bundle remained on my front steps and I proceeded with caution to investigate what it was. The bundle turned out to be a small infant with a large tattoo on the baby's forehand. I took the baby to the hospital. They didn't have room for it and asked me to care for it for a few days. They would get back to me to take it off my hands. (The reason I am calling the baby "it" is because I can't remember if it was a boy or girl.) The baby stayed with me for the following week and [illegible paragraph ending with:] a man who had a patch over his eye.
