I was outside somewhere and there was competition on. I went to this place to leave, which was a hotel sort of thing. This Asian lady owned it and she showed me the bedroom. It was small but nice and the bed had a really nice blanket. I text Mom and told her I was at The Dolphin [watched 1408 the other day]. Mom came and I couldn't find my phone battery. We looked everywhere.
