I dreamed that J---(M 22--engaged to me) and I went to visit two of our friends who were just married. They were living in an old house similar to one I visited when a child. G--- (M 23)was sitting in the living room and there were two huge rats sitting in front of the fire place. I said something to M--- L--- (F 23) about the house and she said "you should have seen it before we moved in. Then one of the rats jumped into G---'s lap.
