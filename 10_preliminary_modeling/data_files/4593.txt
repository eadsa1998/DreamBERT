["Enjoying the ocean."] I am at the ocean. Dovre, Paulina and Ellie are adults. They are running ahead of me on a sandy path to the ocean. I try to catch up. I look for them. I see windows and they are on the other side of the window (there is no building.) I am teasingly challenged to jump into the deep water. I do it and swim around, enjoying the swim. Grandma Anne is around some where, picnicking.
