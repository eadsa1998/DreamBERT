I had stayed at dads. Mom and I were driving back home late at night. I noticed that this lot of woods was burnt and I realized there had been a huge fire. I was like "Oh my God, oh my God!". We saw that Mom's house was fine and I was like 'thank God, I didn't want to have to lose the only other thing I care about [my computer]' and I thought about Tigger. It was really dark and once we got out of the car, it was pitch black. We heard a noise across the road. I ran up to the door quietly, and we could hear someone coming. I told Mom to get the keys and open the door. This guy came and I threw a plant pot at him. It was a small cactus, but it was heavy. I got a container with water and he snuck past me and I poured it over him and smashed him over the head with it. He fell and I got a broomstick pole and stabbed him in the eye, the ear, then whacked him and stabbed him in the chest (he was now dead). Then I went inside to go back to my computer.
