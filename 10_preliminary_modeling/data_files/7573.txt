Mary is lying on her back on a bed with her head hanging over the top edge of the bed. She is deathly ill and appears as she did in the last few weeks of her life - emaciated, deathly pale and extremely weak. Her head was not bald but the hair on it was very sparse - as it was when it began growing back after the chemotherapy treatment. I sit on the bed and cradle her in my arms. I ask her why she is lying with her head hanging back over the edge of the bed. She answers that this is the only way she has to prevent her from vomiting. Other things happened in this dream before and after the scene of me and Mary on the bed but I can't remember what they were. It seems, that before I saw Mary, I was looking for something.
