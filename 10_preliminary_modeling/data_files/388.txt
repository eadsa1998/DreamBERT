I'm with Dan &amp; Lynn and Peggy &amp; James at some kind of fair - seems to be on city streets - there's a lot of activity, and you can sit down and watch programs from time to time. We've been doing that, and I've been keeping an eye on this model of a temple (some famous ancient, maybe Biblical temple), which was flooded and I guess destroyed, which was its claim to fame. [I'm not sure if we're all watching this or if I'm watching it on the side - I have bought the model for myself, and I think it's the latter.] The water comes up and rushes through, knocking things down and so on, then recedes, how interesting. The program ends, and we'll be getting up to go elsewhere, but I'd better put this in the car or else it'll get lost, stolen, or thrown out. The car's just here, and I start to deal with it, but the others are going away - they're not even paying any attention to me, except James, who is looking like he can't figure out what to do, to stay or go, to protest or not. I'm aghast. How can they just walk off and leave me? I stand in frustration, what can I do here? They'll be swallowed up by the crowd in a minute, how will I ever catch up to them? Do I even want to? I'm so furious I'd just be - prefer to be - enraged at them. But apparently they're oblivious anyway. Damn... There's a cop or security guard nearby who offers to help, and we get to talking [much like me &amp; Russ at the Jewelry Workshop], which makes me feel better. We go nearby to his house, while he picks up something, and we're gonna catch a movie on TV. I've got a carton of Cookie Dough ice cream, and eat some while he's in the other room. When he comes back I offer him some, saying, "Have you ever tasted this?" And then when I'm looking away, he eats all the rest of it. More frustration. I'm just fed up.
