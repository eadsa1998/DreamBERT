I was at university. There was a room with steps and planks for chairs. My legs were close to the edge and I was worried I was going to fall. I was next to Evelyn. We got put into groups and I was with Eugene and Evelyn. I complained to someone that there wasn't enough room, and Eugene helped me pull out the 'steps' so there would be enough room. Ezra was there and I said I needed socks and he gave me red socks that were like my work socks. Eugene waited for me to continue moving the steps. He asked "can I add you as a friend on Facebook?" and I was excited but calmly shrugged and was like "it doesn't matter, it's only Facebook". Calvin was in the class too. He made a new Facebook account. The class ended and we left stuff under the seats for next time. I complained about having to "drive all the way down". We passed Alejandro and I asked him if we had chemistry labs today and he said no.
