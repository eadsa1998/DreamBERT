I was at the shop. Ezra and I went to the car and we noticed that the back passenger window was bent out. Mom went to find someone. Ezra and I went in car and locked the doors. The window was now fixed. I said "What if someone is in the boot?" so I got out to find Mom. There was a creepy kid at the ATM. Two guys came towards me, so I got back in the car. Then I saw that the boot was open and a creepy robber, like the one in Little Britain, was walking off. Mr Ripley and Mr Nixon were security guards. Mr Gutenberg was hanging around too. They stayed with us. The cameras watched you when you looked at someone. There was an evil old lady. Mom came back and she was short.
