I climbed over a fence to get away from an institution. Several people outside the fence saw me, and I feared that they would tell on me. A little later I sat down, and a Chinese boy about 6 came and covered me with a blanket. I defecated under the blanket so he wouldn't see me. Then I looked for a way to get away from the institution. I looked for the railroad tracks.
