 I'm in a movie theatre with my friends Elise Rooks, Hank Anderson, Emily Zates, and Tina Totts. I tell them I had a dream like this last night, in which one can act out on stage anything they want. The theatre may be for plays, because it has a small stage. We all sit down. I sit next to Elise. Hank wants to sit next to her, so I move seats.
