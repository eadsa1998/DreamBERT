I am in a house. It's near the edge of a canyon. I see two volcanoes blow up. I see huge ash plumes. I see some water splashing up over the edge of the canyon and I'm aware that the house and I are in changes. I tell Howard, "We have to get out." He's calm and ridicules me for getting excited over nothing. I see the water getting closer and grab the three girls and run for it. He is following me and telling me what a fool I am. I look back and I see an older man, a para, out of his chair, sitting on the floor. Water is raging and swirling around him. A black carpet, carried by the water, covers him. He's caught. I run to a telephone booth. Someone is in it. I see another. I get to it. It's not a regular one; it's a narrow, funny looking phone. I don't know how to operate it. I search in my coat pocket for a dime. Howard offers a quarter. I am relieved. I have my own dime, so I don't have to accept his money. I try to use the phone, but the buttons are more like my radio.
