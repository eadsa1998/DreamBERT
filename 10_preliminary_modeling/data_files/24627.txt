My mom was going to take me and my friend to our tennis lesson. But the car was filled up with my sister and her friends. My mom gave me my tennis bag and everything I needed for my tennis lesson, and drove off. I was walking around trying to find my friend. Finally, I found her and her dad drove us to our tennis lesson. I brought my lava lamp. Setting: At My school. Characters: There were people in my dream and I knew most of them (mom, my friend, my sister and her friends, my friend's mom). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. At first I was worried that I would never find my friend, but when I found her I was happy.
