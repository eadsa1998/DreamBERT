I am going to a graduation program in a church. It is not an actual graduation but I have a white gown that I lay over the seat because I have to go to the bathroom. The bathroom is downstairs in a dirty cellar that you get to by going down a ladder. The toilet is just a hold in the floor and everyone can see me. Kids tell me adults must use the other toilet. I go back up and finally find it but it is filthy. I think a church should have a better bathroom. I use the toilet and go back to the ceremony but all the others are now marching forward. My gown is gone and a lady tells me someone took it because I left. I am not very upset. Just disgusted. Everyone in the ceremony gets little bags of sample products as gifts at the end.
