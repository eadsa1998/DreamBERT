At a party of some kind I meet a girl known from grammar school. She remains tall, awkward and insecure. We end up in a bedroom where I try to seduce her. She resists. I become affectionate toward her, but she has trouble accepting my feelings.  When I go to the bathroom to pee, one stall is occupied by a boy in a wheelchair. The other is unoccupied, but an anxious man stands in the way. He leaves. The window in the bedroom is open. I think, if we have sex, people will hear us. The girl asks for a tissue, which I get for her. She is so awkward. I wake up.
