I was going to have a party and I hadn't had one in a long time. I was anxious trying to get everything together. The first few people came over and I wasn't ready for them so I sent them to Jessicas. More and more people came - John G., his wife and kid. They went into my backyard with some others. I couldn't find any good music and was embarassed by what was playing. I went over to Jessica's and the party over there was huge. Going back to my house there were people scattered all over looking bored. Later I came across a guy at a set-up stand selling beer. A-ha! This is what I had forgotten - Beer. Everyone at the party had chipped in to buy a keg cause they were so bored. <br/
