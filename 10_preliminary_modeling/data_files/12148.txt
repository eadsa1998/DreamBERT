A job at McDonald's came up, and someone told Evelyn that the interview was later than advertised, but she came early anyway. A big storm was coming. The sky was all orange because of the storm. I was at a hotel. We had been there three times; once on the 2nd floor, 16th floor and now the 9th? Something was happening and I took Dad's car keys and ran down to car but he followed (not that I could drive anyway) and I couldn't leave. He was going psycho [like Jack Nicholson in The Shining].
