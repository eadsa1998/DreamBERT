At a restaurant which was seated more like an auditorium. As waiter brought a neighbor a rice and stew plate, I asked for some like it, though it was a peculiar choice for breakfast. He went on serving others, apologized to me for delay. At last he dished up my order but it slopped over and he set the dish up to drip over a tray. He remarked that some of the trays in the pile were too small. Finally I said I had to hurry. Either bring me mine or put it on another plate. Then I was leaving and having some difficulty retrieving my newspaper.
