I am in a place that is partly a hospital and partly our former apartment. I enter the apartment without Mary knowing I have come in. I am in the bedroom and Mary is elsewhere in the apartment. I do not want to frighten her so I make some sounds -- maybe I call her name -- to let her know I'm in the apartment. We come toward each other in the hall, meeting in the middle of the hallway. We rush into each others' arms, embrace and kiss. Mary doesn't look exactly as I had known her. She is overweight and her breasts are unusually large. But it is Mary and I'm delighted see her, to hold her, and to kiss her. I know immediately that she is undergoing chemotherapy treatment, but has decided to stop taking it. She wants to know where the exact spot is where she'll make the announcement that she's discontinuing this treatment. She is looking for the place, outside the building, to make her last stand.
