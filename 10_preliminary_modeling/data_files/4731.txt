["Oops. I forgot my classes."] I suddenly become aware that I have missed University classes for two weeks now and am very far behind. I could very easily flunk. I have a paper due on Monday and haven't a clue what to write about. I think about writing just that. Then I realize I could drop the classes. I don't have to be tasking classes any more. It is a relief. It might be too late to drop them without a grade drop, but I don't care. I don't want to be taking these classes any more.
