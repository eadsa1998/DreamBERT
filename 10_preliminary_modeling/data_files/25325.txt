 I'm eating at a fancy restaurant with my aunt Willow Redding and my sister Heather and others. I have linguini. There are a few strands of hair in my pasta. Heather gives me some of her food, which has hair in it too. I am in what I think is my front yard. Grandpa and Grandma Redding are there. My cousin Steve Redding and his wife Loretta are there. I talk to Steve. After he expresses an interest in talking with relatives, I tell him that he probably doesn't want to talk to Heather. Then Steve is on the phone with Heather. She has called, and he answered the telephone. I have a deck of cards on a box-like footstool. I say there are two jacks of clubs. I am mistaken. There are two jacks of spades.
