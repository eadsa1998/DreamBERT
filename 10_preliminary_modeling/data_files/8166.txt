I was with Alicia J. At least during part of the dream I was a midget. We had midget cars that we were driving. Mine was a stick shift that I was learning to drive and there was some kind of race that I won. There was also a house that Alicia J had that all of these artistic people came to - something to do with arts. Something about a fireplace. I was also going to this town with Mari Kate S and Rachel S. We came to this house that had alot of Easter stuff for sale in their yard. It had many pieces of the same things - like you would find in a store. Aunt P and Aunt H were there also.
