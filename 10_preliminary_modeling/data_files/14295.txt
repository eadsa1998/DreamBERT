I was watching an episode of Doctor Who or something. They were at a hotel thing and there were prostitutes there. It was old fashioned. This guy had sex with one of them and he had disappeared. Now there were ghosts at the place. There was a list of guys that had been 'taken'. There were a lot more guys that had been taken abut this was a list of certain guys. I realized it was guys who had treated them well and had been nice and 'with love'. I had found this out because I said that it "didn't seem like these were bad people". The Doctor (as David Tennant) realized this saying that they were those who had been "gentlemen". He got 'turned' into a ghost and they were also wearing masks like in those masquerade balls and they had weird lipstick on. He started singing in this girly voice and then kissed this girl ghost who sighed and then disappeared and he was ok, because he was a nice guy. In the dream, it seemed like a pretty cool plot.
