I had two rooms at Mom's, which was different. One was a temporary room with my computer. I woke up and Mom and Darren said someone had broken in last night, but had only taken unimportant stuff. They got extra locks for the back door. We had bush behind us and Abigail lived nearby and we suspected it was her. She came over. Also, this guy on a motorbike was a kid when we met, and we met again, but he was now my age, in the bush.
