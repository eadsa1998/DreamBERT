Mary and her sister Kathy are busy repairing a carpet in Kathy's home. They are so involved in their task that they have no time for me. So I leave. I walk home along a street in the area where I had lived as a child. The street is very crowded with people and I'm having some trouble making my way through the crowd. It seems that someone touches or pushes me as I am walking, but I am not certain about this detail. Two women are following me, and talking about me. As I am walking, I am worried about where I had left the jacket of one of my suits. I am sure that it is lost and that I'll never find it again. I arrive home and enter our kitchen. It looks like it is freshly painted in an off-white grayish color. Suddenly Mary jumps up from a kneeling position. She had been painting the floor directly underneath the kitchen table. When she jumps up so quickly, she bumps her head on the table. Mary greets me enthusiastically and laughs at the bump raised on her head where it had struck the table. She is wearing a white smock. Her figure is slender and trim. She looks terrific. She is so happy to see me and I am so thrilled to see her. She runs over to me and we embrace. All the while, Mary is laughing and talking. The two women who had followed me on the street come right into our house. I know that they are there and I'm glad they followed me. Now they can see where I live and what a wonderful wife I have. As Mary greeted me, she said something that sounded like, "Don't I have a right to make a dollar...." I can't remember the rest of her statement because I'm awakened by my clock radio. I had seen her for only a fraction of a second before I woke up.
