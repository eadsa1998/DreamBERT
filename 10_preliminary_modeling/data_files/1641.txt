I bring a box of papers and things to where Arvonne, Jock and Sheila J are seated around a table. I take out and try to find six copies of my latest newsletter to give to Sheila. As I am getting them out, Jock says, "I stopped doing mine because it scared some people." I replied that I disagreed and pointed to a tall tree trunk outside the window. I said, "See that tree. Even if someone was afraid of that tree, I'd still plant it. Then the person can learn not to be afraid. You can't not have trees because one person is afraid. Everything would shut down, if you did."
