I was somewhere with the school and I was with Calvin. Eugene was nearby and I noticed he had a piercing and then I noticed he was wearing a bracelet and a ring on the middle finger of his left hand and I was really annoyed by this. I was going through my bag and there were lots of notes in there, a total of around $500. It had been given to us ages ago but I'd forgotten about it. Then I was at this building with lots of levels and secret ones below. There were parties happening on most of them. One of them had these baths with special blue water. They were very shallow. I decided to use one. I lay down and then I wanted to call Mom to get me later and I left the building to call her. I went on an elevator to get back. They were dirty so I was cleaning it first. Then it wasn't as shallow. This bath was closest to the wall and there was a square 'drop' in the bottom of the bath, near the wall and there was a little fish thing. You weren't allowed to take it out but I got a cup to get rid of it and it went crazy so I put it back. Then I was someone else and I was lying in the bath and the fish grew into this huge monkey like thing. It tried to have sex with me and held me down. It was rubbing against me and got bigger and I told it to go smaller because I was a virgin and it shook its head. Later, I think, I was at this little hut place next to Mom's to help poor people and Africans or something. I was helping for the day. I had to sit at a desk and ask a few questions and send them out this door. I also was prank calling Charlene asking about her water pipes, talking in a serious voice, and there was no end joke; all I did was ask questions about the pipes.
