 I'm on the telephone in a dimly lit room, checking my messages. Other people are there. I have nine messages. On the third message, I hear that my friend Holly has been hurt or killed. The message is like hearing a news report. It goes as follows: "Holly had been with friends all night. At 3:00 am, her friends and her were going to watch a movie. Holly turned to her Jeep, a man was there, and ..." The rest of my messages are in the same news-like format. Someone sits down on the bed next to me. I turn, and see that it is Holly. She is wearing a skirt, white socks, and brown shoes. Her face and arms are badly bruised. She is half lying on the bed with her head and neck up against the headboard. I ask her how she is, and she says okay. I touch her arm. She looks and acts frightened. She says we need to talk. We go into the hallway to my locker, which is glass inside a wooden frame. At first Holly is confused and thinks it is her locker. I tell her it is my locker, and she says, "Oh, right." She is confused because of the beating. Our classmate is Pauline Davies is there and she wants to talk to Holly.
