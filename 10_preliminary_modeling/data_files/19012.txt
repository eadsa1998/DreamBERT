The setting of the dream was a store where I worked when I was in high school. It was, well apparently I was back in the past again and I was assigned to clean up the back room, which was the stock room and pricing room and so forth. I was hunting for a cardboard box, which at times was difficult to find, either because they were all used or they had all been mashed up and put in the back. There was one other person who was talking to me. She was talking to me and saying personally that, a woman who worked with me for the store, so I recognized her as someone I used to work with. Then I went into another room which was not in the same design or not as the store where I used to work, went in there and I was looking for a box, empty cardboard box, and there was a woman in there, but I didn't recognize her, and she asked me if I got all the money that I had left there. For a change I replied something to the effect that, yeah, I guess. Money doesn't mean much or something. Then there was a fellow sitting in the chair who just looked at me and I looked at him, and there was just sort of like a shrug conveyed between the two of us. I thought to myself why I entered this second room. This was a real, well, it was nobody else and there was no activity, so I was saying that it was awful slow time of the year and a lot of people were being laid off, and I thought of my father and his business, and I was thinking, "Well, I hope that things aren't so with him."
