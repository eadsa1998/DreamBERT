 I'm watching television. There is an unsolved mysteries episode advertised with a man and a woman on it. The topic of the show I'm watching is "something left undone". I'm laying on the back half of the couch. I'm holding a couch cushion over my head so a dog that is in the house won't bite me. There are two kids around. They might be in the television show. My friend Terry Foss is there. She asks me if she can lay on the cough with me. I say okay. She does. I turn towards the back of the cough and try to sleep. Then I turn and watch television. I put my arm around Terry. We joke and wrestle. I throw her around easily. Terry is then my friend Holly Lapson. Holly has one eye instead of two. We flirt. I am lying on top of her. I try to kiss her, and then I pull back. She is laughing a crazy witch-like laugh. Her eye is red and almost flaming! Her hair is flying about: is messy and in her face. The door in the room slams shut. It then opens. I choke Holly. She has her hands around my neck in self-defense. A man comes through the door. He has light brown hair and a moustache. He is about 5'6" and thin. He is a hick; a redneck. He has a reptile skin hat of some sort. He wants me to leave, to be gone.
