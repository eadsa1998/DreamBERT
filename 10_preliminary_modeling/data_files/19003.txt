An overall underlying feeling of the dream was something to the effect of everything was moving along smoothly in the sense that, I mean, the action was just coming piece after piece. It was just a smooth falling setting in action. Then there seems to be no reason at all the action tries to go backwards and there's this conflict like a smooth circle and then this pulling back or sort of down. It's a very difficult image to explain, but in the dream action moves along smoothly and then one character started pulling or struggling with another and this is what created the feeling of pulling down and backwards. At first it was just a matter of a struggle and then I saw myself in that struggle. As the dream became more clear, it seemed to be at an airport, and many people. There's just a disruption in the even flow of traffic or movement of a crowd, but I couldn't tell exactly who the struggle was with, just a disruption in the flow of activity. At the beginning of the struggle it was like trying to force the victim underneath water such as like a drowning. Keep someone's head under or something like this, and there was a lot of movement as far as resistance fighting.
