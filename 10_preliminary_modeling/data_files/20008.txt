I was lying on my back. I was holding a large cat. Later I was sitting at a desk like the ones where I went to school. The desk was too small for me. I was taking a word test. A little later I was in a strange dormitory with a patient named Katz sleeping next to me. I returned a pencil to him that I had borrowed. I moved to someone else's bed. I was worried about the occupant returning. (I noticed the coincidence of the cat and the patient named Katz. Yesterday I petted a stray cat in the yard, and I have been having intellectual discussions with Mr. Katz.)
