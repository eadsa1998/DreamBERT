I was walking from our house to one of my girlfriend's house. The sun was shining brightly, and it was very warm. When I arrived at A___'s house, she was getting dressed. Her mother showed me a wardrobe case she had gotten her for her birthday. When A____ came downstairs, we left the house. As we were leaving, she told me her grandmother, who was 62, was getting married again.
