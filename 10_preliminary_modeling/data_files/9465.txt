I am in the mountains with Don and Greta and Frank and many children: see view of mountains like in Calif or Austria: I see them from a window. Then I dance with Don, cheek to cheek, great feeling of nostalgia. Then we make plans for next day's trip; they leave me out. Tremendous resentment against Frank; I will not baby-sit.
