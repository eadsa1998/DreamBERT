Now I was in a gardening store and I was looking at flowers, flower bulbs, potting soil, fertilizer and such. Now it seems that it's a drug store that is selling these things. They had what we used to call dump tables in the retail stores where I used to work. They were shaped like a box so you didn't have to worry about things falling off or getting knocked off. They had flowers in these tables. I touched one of them to see if they were real but they were silk. I decided to come home.
