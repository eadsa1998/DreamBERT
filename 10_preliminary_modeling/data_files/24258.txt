Trying to use the computer in my uncle's store in another country. The police have come by. Somebody has stolen something. It's not bad, but the police are strangely responsive. Why? There is political unrest about. A demagogue is rallying his troops to prey on xenophobia and fears of terrorism. I'd taken hundreds of photos. I was trying to set up my computer. I hid it underneath the frozen pizzas, my computer. The store is like a small grocery store, the kind with an Asian bent. The air is thick with the smell of raw fish and vegetables soaking into the walls for many unbroken years.
