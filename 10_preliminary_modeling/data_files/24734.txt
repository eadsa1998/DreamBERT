I was at school and one of the teachers came by and gave me these two bottles. When he poured them in the same spot and it blew up. Before he came by, I was asking a different teacher for some money to buy some snacks. He told me he had some in his car. I went to put all of this stuff in my locker. When I came back we decided to crawl instead of walk. The only other thing I remember is a room full of furniture. Setting: At my school, My school, in the halls. Characters: The two teachers were my real teachers today. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I was happy because a lot of people had given me this cool free stuff!
