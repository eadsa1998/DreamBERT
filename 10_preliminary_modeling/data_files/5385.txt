I dreamed that it was the last day of school. I kissed Lou and Jackson good-bye and made them promise to visit me. I saw Ian down by the lake and we drove to English class to discuss the exam. Then we were at the athletic center, and apparently all the girls had to ride around on bicycles. I did not know this, so I ended up with this hard, too-big bike. Then we played dodge ball.
