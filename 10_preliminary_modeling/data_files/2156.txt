Veronica and I are talking. It's sort of like a counseling session. I say, "But what's the bottom line? What are you searching for? What do you really want out of life?" She thinks about it heavily. "Just a nice life. All pretty?" I ask. "No," she says, "I want to be spiritual, search, come live with you." She looks at me shyly. I am some pleased at the reverence and a little anxious about protecting myself. I then say, "Seattle would be a good town to live in." We talk more.
