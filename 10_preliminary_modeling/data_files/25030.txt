 I'm at a gathering in a gymnasium. High school sports are being played. Basketball is played presently. My friend Gino Teavor is there, and is as intense as usual. I wonder if, and kind of wish, that I could beat everyone at basketball. Football is next. It is disorganized. There are some guys there from high school, including Simon Naver. We talk about college. I am making my way out of the gymnasium. Melanie McDyss, a friend from college, comes up and kisses me! I say, "Melanie, what are you doing?!" Then I realize that she's been drinking. She giggles and wanders off with a friend. <br/
