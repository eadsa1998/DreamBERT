I'm in the church. The main priests are Black--American Negroes. There are about four of them in the front pews. The four have purple scarves around their necks. When it is over, the leader of the Black Priests says, "We are always in the front here. Lay workers close to priests just behind us. Congregation behind. In the big churches or cathedrals, congregation in front. So we are active..leaders."
