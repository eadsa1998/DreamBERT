The setting of the dream was a grocery store. I was on my bike and I wheeled up to the store, and I parked the bike along the side and walked in. Inside was my brother Jack, and let me see, I believe it was, yeah, my mother and then there's some other people. My mother was running a cash register and my brother Jack was also. They were just sort of like spread out. There were some other people running cash registers. I went in and just sort of said hello. Everybody was buying candy, Halloween candy, so apparently it must have been close to Halloween. I said a few things to my brother and then my mother asked me what Dave and I were doing. Dave's another brother. I replied something to the effect that we're spending all our time missing you or something, something like this. This was about, this was the full content of the dream. I didn't' recognize anybody else in the store. I think the dream stems from anticipations of going home for Thanksgiving. However, I think I got my holidays mixed up.
