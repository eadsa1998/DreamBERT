I'm inside a library with my friends. There is my best friend (who I haven't seen for two and a half years). I saw her. She tried to get close to me, but luckily for me the table was between the two of us. I for some reason don't want to get close to her and I managed to get away from her with excuses. She doesn't seem to be mad at me getting away from her. It seems like she and the rest of my friends don't see it; just me. (The library looks more like one corner of Sawyer Library.)
