Then another situation. We (I and a group) were in a car which I was driving, but I don't remember the way it was or who was with me. Anyway, we were on a small road surrounded by trees and we were singing because we were going to a club. The club had two entrances. One was next to the road where there was a cliff and a bridge which led to the club which was facing the cliff, and for the other entrance, one had to go around a long way in order to get in with the car because the bridge couldn't hold cars. We thought we would leave the car in front of the bridge and then go over the bridge. I was thinking whether it would support the weight of all of us. When we got to the place, there was a car in the same spot and we were furious because we didn't plan on finding anything there. We got off and there were some women. After asking them to move their car, they screamed at us because we became foul-mouthed while at the same time secretly realizing that they were right, because if they went over the bridge, it would break, but they also didn't want to leave us any room to leave our car with theirs. They were all dressed in black and when we got in the car, angrily, thinking about the long way we'd have to drive, one of the ladies called me by name and in a panic, I recognized that it was my great aunt (my father's aunt) whom they call Aunt Nona. She was very affectionately coming to greet me and I, terribly scared, started the car and we left the place.
