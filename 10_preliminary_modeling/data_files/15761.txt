I was at the old house, sitting in the living room. It was night and there were people outside. I was a serial killer or something, so just calmly sat as they tried to get inside. I walked into the kitchen and took a sharp knife, putting it into my pocket and sitting back down. I text Mom and said 'come', but I thought that they might have her phone so I didn't say any more than that. Then I was in another country. There were these aliens who were taking over countries or cities, taking people and killing the rest. I'd come across them a few times. I was in the street (it was night) and there were lots of them marching around, doing their thing. I ducked in and out and around, trying to find something. There was a pile of bricks that I was hitting and they were falling apart like Minecraft blocks and I was taking the things that fell out. I needed to find certain coloured bricks to make this weapon. I ended up in a building where the 'leader' was and she was like 'you again'. She made no effort to do anything to me and basically said that she liked having me around. She warned me that they were blowing the place up and showed me the way out.
