I was in Chemistry. Alyssa came in with a note from a host. Mr Reilly was there. I was thinking 'Yay! The games have come!'. I went to the office to sign out. Mom said she signed Ezra out. She said that the wrong games had come and instead we got 'Solission' and Super Mario 2. I said "We have to buy them again!".
