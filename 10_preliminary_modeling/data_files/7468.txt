I am moving somewhere. I am carrying or moving various parcels from one place to another. These parcels are stacked on the sidewalk of a street. I am showing some people photographs. Many of these pictures are old. I don't recognize any of the people. For a fleeting instant I see myself pulling a suitcase off the road and onto the sidewalk. I see a car standing in the road. Mary's brother, Paul, is in this car. He tells me the suitcase belongs to him. I have a funny feeling that the people to whom I'm showing the pictures may not return them to me. I see a car parked across the road and Mary is sitting inside it. I can see her clearly. She is beautiful. She is dressed in white. I know that she is dead, and that the road between us is the dividing line between Life and Death. I am on the Life side, Mary is on the Death side. She smiles briefly at me, but mostly the expression on her face is serious. We have a conversation, but I cannot see Mary's lips moving. I emphasize that the children are well, particularly Maria. Mary asks me why we hadn't had too much sex during the last couple of years of her life, especially the time before she took ill. While she doesn't spell it out clearly, she appears to wonder if I'm "gay." I start trying to explain things to her. I don't remember what I tell her -- then the dream ends at this point.
