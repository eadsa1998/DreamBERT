They were singing "Swing Low" and we were had a bunch of guests over and I showed them my music so they could learn the alto part if they wanted. I was thinking to myself that we sounded just like the strings (?) and I heard this guy sing it, it was a solo part, except he was across the street in the hotel and I wanted to run over and see him and I did. And then I realized I was in the buff, buff naked, and so I ran past him and then I just hurried up and ran home. And then I woke up.
