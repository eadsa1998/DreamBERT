I dream about returning to my martial arts class after months of absence. The instructor has grown much older and fatter - he looks unfit and grumpy. When he sees me lined up with everyone else, he walks past and says sarcastically "So you've returned. Try to keep up". He then sets us a very difficult session. It is impossible for me to keep up. Another student puts on a frighteningly slick and fast display in front of the rest of the class - arms and legs moving like a kung fu machine. I notice we are in a much bigger training hall that usual. It looks like an old empty warehouse - rundown and spacious - the kind of place you see in gangster films. The instructor is giving me some very aggressive body language.
