I was just inside the entrance to some one-story building, in uniform.  A dumpy woman with a Spanish accent and big, black eyes was scurrying around looking for the "linen room."  I asked someone and found out it was across the front lawn from the building.  I pointed it out to her without being able actually to pick it out specifically myself.  She set out for it, walking along the sidewalk, and I watched her big rear end bobbing up and down-first one buttock and then the other.  She was grotesquely broad in the rump, but I must have been really horny, because I was attracted to her.  When I left the building, another young military officer was with me-and two girls, one of whom was his girlfriend.  We passed another group of uniformed men as we walked, and none of them saluted, but this lieutenant saluted them, and turned as they passed, holding his salute.  I don't know whether they outranked us and he was being ultra-deferential, or whether they should have saluted us, and he was reminding them of that sarcastically.  I suspected the latter.  <p
