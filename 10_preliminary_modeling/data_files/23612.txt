I'm drinking beer at a bar where the police come all the time to drink, on duty and off duty. I meet a friend of mine and we decide to go have dinner. We are eating dinner at a beautiful castle-type restaurant, about 70 ft. high, this restaurant is. Then four guys come in and stick up the place. During the end of the robbery I start clapping for them to show they have pulled a very nice stickup. The four guys decide to take my friend and myself prisoners. We go over to a nearby city and they stop at a school. My friend and I make a break for it. I get away by hiding under a portable, but my friend is shot. I get caught about 15 minutes later and just as one guy is about to shoot me, grab a revolver from one of them named Bruce. I then shoot all four of them. This kills three of them, but they don't die. The fourth can still fire a gun and does so, but he can't hit me because I'm running away from him. They get into their car and follow me to a gas station, the only place open in town. I get the keys to a car from the attendant, just by telling him to charge it to a friend of mine who lives there. But I can't get in the car. My gun is empty and every time I try to get in my car, the one guy who can still shoot does so. Finally, I get to the car and drive to the next city, where I tell the police, and the crooks are caught. I had an extreme headache when I awoke.
