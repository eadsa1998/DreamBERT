A very complex dream-not sure I can sort it all out.  My wife Bonita was going somewhere in her car, and I could see her in the distance as she crossed the Memorial Bridge.  I could also see that only the right hand lane was one way in her direction; the lane next to it could go in either direction, and in fact, cars approaching each other sometimes passed on each other's left.  This seemed to me a very dangerous situation, and I was glad to see that Bonita kept all the way to the right.  Next, I was in the car as we approached from the rear a big car transport truck and apparently drove right up its ramp.  Anyway, the road ahead became steeper and steeper, and I had to shift down to third (I was now driving.), and in doing so, and climbing even steeper, I lost more speed and had to shift down again.  Then we were traveling straight up, and just as I expected, we began to pitch backward from the surface and fall toward the water. Later, I had to fill out a report on the accident.  I can't remember whether it was the same evening or the next morning, whether I had survived the accident or had been miraculously re-transplanted from it before it occurred.  Gaylen Tuttleson was involved in directing me in the initial phase of the paperwork I had to do, and later Becky Hellman.  I remember having written, or seeing written, in the "Injuries" space:  "Driver killed."  Bonita was dead-no doubt about that.  Several people, some of them acquaintances, asked about the accident, but showed little emotion when I told them Bonita was dead.  I was in sort of a daze myself.
