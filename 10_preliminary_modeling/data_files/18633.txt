Eileen was teaching class. It was at the Y. Everybody had read and since the pool was open--though after closing when school started). We were going to do an extra class there. I carried a scribbled list of notes and climbed over the fence and looked up at the lifeguard chair I knew so well. Then it was time to go to class. I went to the bathroom. One real skinny girl who considered herself a hot chick, came running into the stall 2 doors down and was sick at both ends. Then she was throwing up on purpose and with all the bad noises coming out of there I opened the door to see if she was alright. She was trying to suck water out of the handle (where you flush.) I said her name with a question mark at the end of it. She said, "My story is gonna kick ass!" A lady was staring into space at the table. I heard my name. "Merri." Dora called me but it was a man's voice like Raymond's. I heard this. It was the way Dora said it and no one else. It was getting cold and me and Christian laid down sorta close to keep each other warm. We pulled up the blanket. He dumped a gallon bottle of Chanel No. 5 on the sleeping bag. I said, "That won't help you sleep." So he left me and slept close to a guy. (the only other person in the room) and now they were warm and I was cold. I walked up the hill with Harvey. Oncoming traffic made Harvey not want to walk close to the edge. We held hands and when we got closer we looked at the cows. Some were mad.
