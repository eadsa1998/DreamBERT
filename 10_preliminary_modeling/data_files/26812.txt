 I'm walking east on Main Street in Wilmerton. I cross the intersection and arrive at the corner where Dairy Queen is. I seem to wait to cross. Semi trucks pass. I go into the Dairy Queen. I look at the flavors of Blizzards and don't see any I usually order, and then order a large Milky Way Blizzard. It costs about $5. I give the woman a $20 bill. She gives me my change. I let the change sit on the counter, not noticing it. She comes back in a moment and gives me more money because she calculated my change wrong, and she's correcting her error. When she does, she gives me too much back. There is a supervisor-like woman there. I tell them to take about 60 cents away from my change. There is a large rose bush there. Its branches are thinly spaced. It is in bloom, and has pink blossoms. My friend Melanie McDyss and her sister Beth are there. We talk. The three of us are in a bed. I'm afraid they'll realize I'm attracted to them, so I play it cool. We're sitting at a table with others. There is a poem on the wall about Beth's adventures, particularly with men. She has been pretty wild. She goes and defecates in the bushes, and gives men her pubic hair. Melanie and I hug each other. I have been slouching in my seat with my elbows on my knees, while Melanie has been sitting upright. I'm so impressed by her. I'm in love with her. Her breasts are huge, which I notice when we hug. She is so amiable and friendly to everyone.
