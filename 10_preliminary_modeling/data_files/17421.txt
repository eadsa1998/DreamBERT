Was going to pick things up.  An old converted hallway, huge room but lame kitchen.  I talked to a lady in charge, maybe a gift store clerk.  There was a clock with the Chancellor's face making faint noise.  I held it to my ear, and it was wonderful music.  The lady pulled another one for me to hear, but I had to put it together.  I took it and walked into the courtyard.  I was to try it out, but not the clock.  Cement plates, and I moved them around.  A spawn plate, a re-generation plate, etc as if for a computer game.  I tried to put them in good spots.  The re-generation plate on the wall where the enemies wouldn't expect it, yet with a clear view.
