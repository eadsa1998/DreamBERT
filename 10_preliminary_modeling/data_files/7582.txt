I was at the beach (the Pacific Ocean) with my mother, Aunt Gwen (about 41 years old), cousin Mickey (aged 16), cousin Pat (14), cousin Susie (2 years old) and some other little children (about 2 and 3 years old) who were unknown to me. Oh yes, and a little dog. We were on a dock that jutted out into the ocean. It was a beautiful day, sunny and gorgeous, but the ocean had white caps on it and it was a little bit rocky. The dock was rocking. (Of course, I have never been out on the ocean in my life.) We wanted to go swimming, but we didn't have any bathing suits with us. And so I heard a radio broadcast (I don't know how there was none there, or anything), but I heard Jimmy Fidler saying that all the movie actresses in Los Angeles were swimming without anything on because the white caps hid them. Anyway, so we thought if they can do it, why couldn't we? So we all undressed down to our underclothes (we were a little more modest) and we went swimming.
