I was driving our car, a 1946 Pontiac, over route 42 toward Ashland, Ohio. The day was warm, and I had Bob (20, friend of mine who also worked with me on Sturdays) in the car with me. We were members of a baseball team which was to play Ohio University. As we turned towards Athens I remarked that the car was in fine shape. We arrived at Athens and then Bob remarked that he had to get back to Kent State University right away. While we were on the way the car broke down and I woke up.
