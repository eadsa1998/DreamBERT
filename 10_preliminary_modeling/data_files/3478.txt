A male dog is a friend of a female cat. She wants to go up the mountain to where the orange cats live. They are called "opal" cats. The dog wraps his tail around her hind legs to prevent her from going. She is annoyed. I ask her how she feels. She shrugs. He's a good friend and doesn't want her to get hurt, but she knows she'd be fine. It would be a fine adventure and challenging.
