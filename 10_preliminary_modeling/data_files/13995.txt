I was watching Supernatural/Freaks and Geeks. Someone was telling Neal (Freaks and Geeks) that the yellow-eyed demon was his father. I was saying "I knew it". His father had cheated with someone who was actually the demon and his wife had gotten pregnant from it. Lindsay (Freaks and Geeks) was around.
