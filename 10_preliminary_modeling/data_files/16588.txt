I could walk from home to my high school somehow, or maybe not. Maybe I was even back at Bancroft Middle School, but I could walk to school. But I had the option to take the bus home if I wanted. And I had to deposit some money in the Mercantile Bank. I don't remember why, but the one day I didn't make it over there because class let out before they were still open, after it had closed, I guess, I couldn't get in. And the next day I was going to try and get over there. You know how we had a situation where our car battery was kind of weak, and for a while there we thought it was because the radio, like the digital tuner, had to draw memory supply of power with the yellow layer that was a very, very little amount? Well, get this! In this dream Dad wanted me to write a letter to the Mercantile Bank asking if they knew anything about why that would happen. And he was showing me a schematic of the machine and all its IC's and its bank of capacitors and this and that and the other. And then I woke up.
