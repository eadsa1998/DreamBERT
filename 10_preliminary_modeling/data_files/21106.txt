I was awake in our house in PA. I went downstairs to put the lights off and in the front room I heard noises. I put out the lights and looked in and saw spooks moving around. I threw objects right at them, but it didn't faze them. One was coming at me. I made a sign of the cross and he disappeared. I closed the door and it pounded on the door. I heard noises in the house that sounded like kids running down the steps. Jack Delatt came in. He told me of two horses, but I can't remember them. He then went to bed. The bulb (light) was thick that we had in the hallway. Ann and I went downtown. Trixie followed us. I watched a car spin and skid, then jumped the curb into the other lane and then the driver started to skid because he drove too fast. I was lost in the post office downtown. There were so many doors, I didn't know which one to go thru.
