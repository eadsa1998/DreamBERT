I don't remember how, but Classmate-M-16, Jakob, Leilani, Verity and I were carpooling. Classmate-M-16 was driving. It seemed to be taking a while to get there and I thought the train would be quicker. We got on the freeway and Classmate-M-16 started smoking and when he threw it out, it flew back in and I squealed. It was the day before the human biology test [which is today] and Verity mentioned that she sucked on the chemistry test and I said 'yeah but you were on holidays for two weeks'. A song came on the radio that I liked and Jakob, Classmate-M-16 and I sung along a little. Another song came on that was Feels Like the First Time and it sounded like Foreigner [note that I haven't heard the song before, but it was quite vivid]. It sounded like a cross between I Want to Know What Love Is and Hot Blooded. There was an ad that mentioned yoghurt and this guy was copying Michael Westen's (Burn Notice) voice and there was a Burn Notice competition about the yoghurt. I laughed. We got to university and we were waiting outside the class (which was different). I said I should've studied and Classmate-M-16 was like "Izzy!", which I took as 'you will do well anyway'. Jakob asked when I finished for the year and I said "I'm doing the same units as you man!". I went into class and Mr Epstein was in there and he said that calculators were allowed in the human bio exam as long as they didn't "take up time". Then he told us to start the test. The first question was about before a game starts and "opposal adversary into solute silver" and something about resolution. I put my hand up to say it was wrong.
