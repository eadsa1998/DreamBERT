I am underground in a rock hallway, tunnel, and suddenly think, "Oh, what if there were an earthquake and I was here. I'd be killed." I start to feel afraid and then I resolutely think, "But there isn't, and let's just hope there won't be." I walk on. I see the stairs and the elevator and choose to walk up the stairs. It is some work, but it is OK. I get to the next floor and look in a door; I am going shopping. The door opens into a huge classroom. I peek in and think, "Well, this isn't the store," and go on down the hall to the next door and look in. The store is there, aisles and aisles of products. I go in to shop.
