My mother was preoccupied by teaching in my classroom. I was talking to the teacher and for some reason it hit me, I remembered that my maternal Grandma Jane was dead, and so I was distraught.  I wanted to talk to my mother but she wasn't available, so I went to the mall and wandered, looking for a place to sit down and cry. Some part of me wasn't completely convinced, though- it was too odd that my mother was in teaching and not grieving, and that it had been a couple weeks and we hadn't had any memorial service yet. But still, I was sobbing. <br/
