[1997-06-24] I was at work, involved in my usual work when a woman who is involved in the United Way campaign with me, who would really be my supervisor, came down and asked me if I had been counting the coupons. I said "No, there's no urgency top it at this point, we still have plenty of time." And she said "Oh yes, there certainly is urgency." And she went to my desk and ripped open my drawer and grabbed those coupons out of there and started to count them. I got all upset and that was it.
