I was in bed and I heard escaping air. I went to the valve by the wall and the plug was out and the air was escaping. I put the plug in and the thread on the plug must have been stripped because it wouldn't tighten up and the air pressure would knock it out. I got some thread and was going to wind some on the plug so it would tighten up. Grandma was sleeping in bed and so was Grandpa. Bob got up and hid under the bed, but I saw him so I called him out. We were going to sleep in a coal shed. There were about three bulbs that were lit up. There was too much light, so I was going to put them out, but I noticed they were all by an electric switch and I would have to turn the bulb out to shut it off. A fellow gave me a push down a stairway. It was high. He made off as though he was falling, but his intention was to knock me down the steps and over the railing to a drop where I would kill myself. I got hold of a banister and stopped myself. I knew someone was after me, and sure enough, they threw poison bombs at me. I could smell the poison, but I kept going and then it seemed they were chasing another guy. One came around a building and I waited for him. I really gave it to him when he came around. I had him knocked out. I threw him around like a rag doll. He was a hillbilly and he had two babies. Ann looked at them and said, "How old are they?" and I said, "The larger one is 4 years old." "I thought they were small for their age," she said. Then I saw a big fly on the baby's neck. It was as large as a queen bumblebee and it had a thick stinger on its mouth.
