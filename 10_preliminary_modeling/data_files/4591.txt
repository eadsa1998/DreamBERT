["Struggling with stinky issues."] I am in a house. Bonnie and I are going on a date. Her man is like Bill W. We've dated together before. I say Hi to him. We chat. Now I need to go to the bathroom and sit on the couch and pee. It drips down my leg and I feel messy and stinky. I am embarrassed. Bill will notice. I need to go up a ladder/staircase. It has a break in the middle. I am upset. Now I'll have to go back down and go up another way. It seems too dangerous. Somehow it heaves me up and over the breaks, so I continue climbing. Knick knacks and pretty things are stored on the steps. I carefully step over them. I reach the top and see Ginny already there. She looks tired. She's trying to call someone on the phone. I go back down. It is steep. I am holding a baby. I nearly slip and fall going so fast sliding down the steps. I barely make it. I need to change the baby's diaper. It is soaked and stinking. With urine. We are going to go to the football game. And I need to help the baby get fresh and clean. I don't want to take off his little shoes. I'm tired. He pulls them off. I sigh.
