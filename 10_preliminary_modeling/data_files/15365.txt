I was going on a trip overseas for school. I can't remember where the first place was but I was also going to Greece for a month or two. I had a daughter, who was about 3 years old, and she was Asian -- I had been dating a Japanese guy. I asked Mom to look after her and Mom said no and I got angry and yelled at her. I said I needed her to because it was too difficult to organise a passport for her. I got some guy I knew to set up the flight for me, but we hadn't organised a hotel yet. I asked Calvin what day he was going for the second trip. Then I was going on holiday, except Ezra and I were going. Dad and I went to the airport the day before. I forgot my shoes and I ran to get them. I went outside and I chased someone through snow which was freezing and I said 'Ocean Reef' and it went back to normal. I tried to get to Centerville Cinema but it was another one and weird. This bad guy copied this gay guy's outfit which was orange and yellow. Ezra and I stayed at a place and watched some weird show. Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry and John Cleese were in it. I didn't get to sleep until 3am.
