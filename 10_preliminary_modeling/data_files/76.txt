I'm out someplace on an errand - the setting is very pretty, lush green, nice building, don't know what it is. Or what I'm doing there. I'm leaving shortly and having to decide about going to La Madeleine for bread or sweets or something, but it's a drawback because it's farther away from my place even than I am now. I consider doing without but then I remember another rustic little French cafe/deli more nearly on the way and I resolve to go there. It's not a place I've been to much but I think it will have what I want, and it's pretty cute.
