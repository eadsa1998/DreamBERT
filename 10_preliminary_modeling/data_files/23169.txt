I was in a hardware store when I felt a vibration under my feet.  I thought at first it might be a freight train passing near the store, but then it became too strong for that, and the whole building started shaking.  I asked someone if it was an earthquake, and they said yes.  At first I was going to lie down on the floor and cover my head, but I decided it would be better to run outside and try to get away from the building.  Another person and I got through a back door, but he told me to keep running, because the building was tall enough to fall on us.  I looked up, and sure enough it was like an office building-about five stories high, and all glass.  This guy kept pushing me, and I kept trying to run but was not moving very fast.  I was irritated that he kept pushing me, because I couldn't go any faster.  (At this point, I woke up.  Anita was pushing me to wake me up, and asking me if I was having a nightmare.)
