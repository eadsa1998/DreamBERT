Talking with M. about her childhood. She was complaining of her mother's failure to stop her thumb sucking at 3 years. "She just didn't care." We were turning pages of a book. M. spoke of he dual personality. I was much interested and asked for more information but instead of answering she began to talk of different times she had made use of illness to avoid work and school, a broken toe among others. She was not always successful. Started to say she had graduated from highschool anyway, but remembered she hadn't.
