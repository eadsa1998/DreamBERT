All I remember is being a caterpillar (I think I was male, because I remember coming "home from work" and finding my wife already there). We were in a cherry tree. The first dream I can only remember hugging a fairly young boy, and his two older brothers saying something along the lines of "Don't become too attached." The dream after (before the caterpillars) I as in the Nature Company store, or maybe a science museum gift shop. Setting: In a cherry tree; I don't remember the next one; in a museum gift shop. Characters: My caterpillar wife; a boy of about 10; his older brothers of about 16-17 (I recognized none of them). I think I saw Anna (an 8th grade girl at My school). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised. The dream I wrote down second is the one that interests me the most. I know there was more to it, and it was a lot more complicated, but my mind just moved on to the caterpillar home.
