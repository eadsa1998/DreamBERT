I was getting picked up from school at like 2:00 o'clock, and I had to talk to Dad, but the radio was on in the car and he turned it down, and I was missing the Friday festivities because he was talking to me. And I dreamt that we had to go to this bus travel seminar March 17th, and then I dreamt that [big yawns] I had attended a bus thing at school and the internship ladies were reading like these dumb little things that you had to answer yes or no on your application. And then I dreamt that me and some other girl were singing in the living room to this Christmas music. We were trying to put "Away In a Manger" to a rap beat! [laugh] And my voice was like the only voice that could be heard. I like couldn't sing out for some reason, I don't know why. It was like I couldn't sing out. And after that I woke up.
