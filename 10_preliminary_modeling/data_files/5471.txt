I was back in the house that I grew up in and there was a child there who I was supposed to be looking after, who appeared to be 5 or 6 maybe. Who didn't appear to like me very much. Then again, the visuals on the house appeared to be very clear and although I could see the child... not with any clarity, just sort of a vague form, but I can't recall any facial features, I could hear her voice and the inflections of her voice, she didn't come very close to me. I don't remember particularly what I said to her but just remembered feeling very awkward which I guess I do around most children, in any case... at one point I was going out to get our family dog. To get our dog we used to have to go through the kitchen, into the garage, out back to where he was tied up. So I left the child in the house and went out to get the dog, I came back in and the child was sitting at the dining room table, and I could see her there, vaguely, and I could hear her talking to my sister who was sitting with her and they were coloring and I was somewhat relieved that my sister was with her because my sister was always much better with children, but I had also felt somewhat hurt that the child would sit with her and play with her but not with me.
