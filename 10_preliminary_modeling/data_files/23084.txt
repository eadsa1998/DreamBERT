Another the agency dream.  At first I was outside the building, and saw three of the Marines from my office -- Nick Klaus, Bob McNamara, and Jerry Pohlert, with a guitar -- from a distance.  They came to where I was or vice versa, and I began to join in some kind of game they were playing.  Bill Clay came up very humorlessly and asked if it was someone's birthday again.  We said no, and he ordered us to stop playing and get back to work.  I was just a visitor, however, so I left.  I had no badge and was wearing just a t-shirt.  Just before I got on an elevator to go down, a little Asian guy about my age shone a flashlight on my chest and pointed out that I had no badge.  I was really scared -- it was the first time in one of these dreams that I have been caught -- but then I noticed that he didn't have a badge either.  I explained my situation to him and went on down on the elevator.  When I got off, I saw that I was going to have a difficult time getting out.  There were lots of guards and not many people leaving.  And sure enough, I did get caught.  The guy that caught me took me to another guy, and that one took me to another, and so on.  I ended up with a heavyset young lady who seemed to understand my explanation, but said I would be sentenced to "vertical cleaning"-and that's what the Asian guy did on the other side of the building; he was a prisoner too.  When I asked her how long I would have to do it, she said probably the rest of my life.  The only alternative would be for me to go back on active duty in the military and take my chances.  My heart sank.
