 I'm at my friend Tiny Combs' house. He and I are in the garage. Tiny smokes, and is smoking a cigarette. We go around the side of the house near his parent's bedroom window. They are on the floor of the bedroom frolicking. I am inside the kitchen looking into a small refrigerator. Tiny's father walks into the kitchen and catches me looking into the refrigerator, looking like I am hungry.
