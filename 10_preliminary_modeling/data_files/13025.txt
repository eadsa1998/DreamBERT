I was going through a DVD of The Fast Show. They had documentaries and Paul Whitehouse was dressed like the Brilliant Kid, which was his natural clothing. They were trying to use this 'skimmer' thing. Charlie Higson was there too. Bizarre Love Triangle was playing. I was looking through these pictures and Dad was in there and I was like "Oh my God! Dad knew Paul Whitehouse!".
