I was absolutely sure that I was awake. I was hearing a sound in the house and I couldn't identify what it was. I was trying to get a picture in my head of my bedroom. I was trying to visualize my bedroom from where I was laying but couldn't. I was disoriented but so sure that I was awake. I thought if I could visualize my room it would ground me. The noise was relatively loud and constant. I thought maybe it was a storm or some kind, but it's almost as though the whole house is vibrating. I can't move. I'm trying desperately to lift myself from the bed and I can't. I want so much to open my eyes and lift myself from the bed and move my head so I can figure out what is going on. I'm getting more frustrated and upset because I can't. I feel like I was able to lift myself off of the bed a few inches but then fell right back down.
