My mom and I were in a room. We had two aquarium tanks, small, in front of us with mud and sand in them. My mom had a small crab that I was afraid of, and she wanted me to hold it, and I didn't want to. She put it on my shoulder. Setting: It was not significant. I think in my brother's classroom, then a white room. Characters: Me, my mom, a crab (the crab was not intelligent). Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. When I woke up, I was afraid and was wiping on my shoulder.
