I was at a village and they put a fence around and some people left. Some guy had employees and they were going to make more money without him? I was watching this movie with Simon Pegg and his back caught fire. Ezra and Dad liked the movie a lot. Simon was walking up the stairs dressed like a girl. Edgar Wright was on the phone. It was Mexican like.
