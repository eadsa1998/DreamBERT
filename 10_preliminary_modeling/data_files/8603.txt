I was doing html work on a web page for CAS. My alarm went off while I was working on a bulleted list. When it went off I thought I would just hit the snooze button while I work on the list a little more. Each time the alarm went off I thought the same thing and would reach over and hit the snooze button again. Finally, I decided I was close enough to done that I would just turn that alarm off and keep working until the other alarm in my room went off, that would probably give me enough time to finish.
