I had to go to school at Westport College and I had to ride a bus, and for some reason my classes didn't start until 9:00 o'clock so the bus could wait until 8:25 to come and it would be okay. Well, let's see, oh, first of all, I dreamt that, well, first of all in real life, there's a substitute teacher that comes in to electronics class when Mr. Martenson is out, his name is Austin Reilly. In my dream Austin Reilly didn't think I was doing up-to-par work, and I was going to write this paper to prove what I knew and I was going to hurry up and write it long-hand before the bus came in the morning. And I can't remember what we were talking about, but Dad and were laying on the bed talking and talking and talking and before I knew it, all my time was gone and I didn't get to write the paper. And then -- this is the crazy part [laugh] -- there was this candy bar, actually on all the Phi Beta Kappa candy bars I had the notion that they would look interesting if we drew some kind of picture with like frosting. And I seem to recall the wrapper having that kind of picture, and before I knew it some kid ran up on the porch and offered me three treats out of his Halloween pumpkin if he could give me back one of the candy bars he bought from me, and that was cool. And I used that one, and I could have sworn the wrapper was going to have some picture on it for us to draw from, but it didn't. And I was saying how, if I had the time, I would be creative and I would draw little things in each square, but I didn't have that kind of time. And I can't remember why I put it [laugh]. We were eating pizza for breakfast, the leftovers of Brittany's pizza, and I think I remember something else, just before I woke up and Dad was walking out the door, he said something like, "But I'm not sure, but you guys just hate it!" And then I woke up.
