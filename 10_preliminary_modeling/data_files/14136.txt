I ended up taking a Technical College course except it was actually a university course for those who didn't do well and it was at Westland. It was veterinary nursing and was my first day. I was in the car with Mom and Darren and I said to Mom "I don't even have enough clothes to wear a different outfit every day". I gave this girl there a sheet to say who I was. There was a random mix of people there, one was an old lady and there was a teenager with the rest of her family. There weren't many people there though. There were microscopes. I discovered there was a forensics course there but I hadn't seen it when I applied and I was annoyed. The first class I had was mixed in with another class which contained Bradley, Eugene and some of the others. I was sitting in a room with benches and this old guy gave me a drill thing. This other guy came later and gave me a bigger one and I said I wasn't part of that class. I asked Mom if I could swap classes. There was a video of a heart rate experiment we had done. I didn't like Eugene at the time and when he was near by heart rate didn't change, but when Dmitri was near it went from '46' to '100'. His stayed the same when I was near him though. There was a list of information about people in the class. For me it said "adoniss" and I had a number which was white and a 7 and thought 'No it's Eugene's', his was number 8. I was then on a plane, I think. Calvin was there and we had photos.
