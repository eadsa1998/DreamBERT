I think we were washing my car.  I think my brother Stuart was there.  We were cleaning it up and there was a spot on the trunk that didn't look too good.  Stuart started scraping the paint off the trunk.  I was horrified, but the undercoat did look better, but it was still so risky I didn't like it.
