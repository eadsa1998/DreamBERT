I had to take an Ethics exam, and I didn't know a thing. My mind was a blank, and I could feel the professor looking closely at me, thinking I was trying to cheat, but this was not true. But I was moving so much in the desk, and wasn't writing, that he must have thought I was. It was an hour filled with anguish, but then I laughed a lot because they told me I had gotten a very good grade. I laughed because I hadn't written anything down. Afterwards, I felt terrible because my mother told me that they had probably given me someone else's grade. Then I don't know what happened. There were lots of dolls and my mother told me to pick out one, but they were all so pretty that I couldn't decide. Then I saw a doll who was looking at me with tears coming out of her eyes. It was a doll with a baby. It was a pink doll, with short, curly and messed up hair, and it didn't have any clothes, only the ticket in her hand. I chose that one, and they didn't want to sell it to me and all the other dolls were laughing. And then it seemed to me I wasn't in a doll store any more, but in a place with lots of babies who were crying, and I got frightened and I don't know what happened.
