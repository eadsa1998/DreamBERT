I was taking care of some children in a school. One afternoon I took their ball away from them (in the recreation period game) and I gave it to one of them so that he would bring it back the next day. The surroundings and the characters (I only remember the children) were unknown to me. The school (I only remember the garden) looked like a park there is near my house.
