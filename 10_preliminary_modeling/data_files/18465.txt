Eddie and Harvey were working in the darkroom, which was light, and was actually Nanny and Grandfather's living room. The pictures were where the fireplace was and under Bryan Hunt's table in the middle of the room on the shelf level, close to the floor, were empty metal coffee cans that held pencils and paintbrushes. But Harvey was looking for real coffee. "I want the instant kind!" he said, and he meant "Krasdale" or "Parade," in the plastic bottle that looks like it's glass. I wanted to help him but I wanted to watch him too. I remembered where I put it but he was having such a good time looking for it, that he was going to keep looking for it, because it was sort of like Easter eggs. I had all these tee shirts hanging on a hat rack where I was suppose to have fiber prints drying and then I spread them out on the couch, but I remembered that Jasmine sat on the right end of the couch on her break from class. I thought, "Let me move these tee shirts over," and I arranged them so I could see one letter (not the whole word) from each tee shirt. Each tee shirt had its own personality. I said, "Wait! One tee shirt's not here. I know Eddy didn't move it and Harvey didn't move it." It was white and had blue letters on it. A post adolescent black girl was wearing my missing Ware Shoals tee shirt and stretching it all out because she had really big boobs. She was very cute and had a bad attitude. She said, "Do you want this back?" And I said, "Yes." She said , "Well let me go over by the screen door where I can hear the music coming over the loudspeaker in the garage."
