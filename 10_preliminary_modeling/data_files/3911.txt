["Calaepia and My Mean Son."] I am an old woman who lives in a large house. I have a young lover who is gay. My oldest son comes over and is very upset. He totally disapproves. I laugh at him and tease him. I dislike his arrogant prejudices. I have a creature I enjoy living with me. It is a caterpillar, that flies. It has wings and a cute face. I like it. My son decides to kill it in revenge for my bad behavior. He chases it with an ax or acid. Something dangerous. I am trying to type in my description of the creature, like I was typing in a dream. I wanted to type caterpillar, but the word Calaepia comes out. I know there is another word to explain him as well and I type the word analog. There are nazis around somewhere.
