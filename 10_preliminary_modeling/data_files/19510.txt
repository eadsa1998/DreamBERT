The house at Bigfield Farm was huge, high-ceilinged, old fashioned. Large staff of servants -- also some who were either tenants or hangers-on cluttered up the rooms. It seemed that the farm was run at a loss, but it could not be sold for its true value; furthermore it furnished the livelihood of a good many people. When asked about selling certain things (furniture, harness, etc.) the owner replied "They would never receive proper attention." One of the servants is a woman who has a big appetite; but in spite of this, her fondness for ice cream is so great that one meal in each day consists of nothing but a cup of coffee ("Java" in the dream) and a large bowl of ice cream. This bowl holds nearly a quart. It is a plain white one similar to our old bowls. Someone remarks he saw John M in "one of your home towns," referring to my brother and Chicago. John took a special, 6-month course in geography and had then taken a position with the Geographical Bureau. His work was chiefly drawing maps.
