I was in Fairchance, a town of my boyhood days. I drove my Pontiac up the hill of the town and when I was nearing the top, a truck passed me up because my car was slowing up from the steep hill. Near the top the traffic light changed to green, so I shifted to second and passed the truck. Someone was telling me he bet $600 on a horse and won $2000. The bookie came over and said that it was only $1000 won by what the horse paid to win. The boy figured by the odds on the scratch, but they were different at the track. He gave me the $1000 in a roll of bills. I put them in my shirt pocket because the boy was not there. He gave me the results on the name of the horse. He or someone had written over it with a pencil. It was marked. I looked thru my magnifying glass and couldn't make it out. So I looked at the paper and I couldn't find the race results. There was spaces on the paper like where there are results, but I didn't see no results. It was blank. The farmer was amazed by his boy winning that money. As I rode in the buggy to the farmhouse, we passed a neighbor of his and she said, "You were lucky, Sonny." The father said, "How did you get so much money to bet?" The farmer lady heard him ask the boy, so she said, "I gave him the money." He was surprised. I cannot recall the name of the horse that the boy bet.
