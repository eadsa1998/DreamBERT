You know what, guys? This is a horrible tape, and I should know never to use it again. It's getting old and it goes, "Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak!" And it's got these little breaking up on the cell phone type of sounds when you play it back, so I'm never using this horrible tape ever again. Let's have a go. For a simple mono voice track, one voice up close that doesn't really record a whole lot, yes I will use this horrible tape. And some -- I don't know -- I used to think it was years, but now it's like a couple of months down the road I might be able to rip all my dreams to MP3 files and put four or five tapes on one disc, because I don't have to worry about the big long explanation, I'll explain it later. Space is of a premium here. I had quite a dream last night. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty and I were in the little theater and first we were just standing and talking, and then we were sitting down in chairs next to each other. And next I was sitting on her lap, like Mom and I sit sometimes when she says, "You big baby." And we were talking about like how the altos have the tendency to want to be more riled up and more street-like than the sopranos do. And then we were in the auditorium, and I was standing up on the stage and watching all of them coming up on the stage, and it was real clear this morning -- the rest of it. But the tape rain out and I didn't have enough room and I was going to do it on another tape but I didn't have time in the morning; it was like 8:00 o'clock already. But now it's all kind of like vague and foggy. I should have put it on first thing, as soon as I woke up. The bit I do remember is that we were supposed to, we were gearing up to go to this Sweet Adelines workshop and next thing I know, Dad and I are in the car and Mom's riding her bike alongside, and then I woke up.
