 A bridge is being constructed by Main Street in Wilmerton. There are some cement blocks being laid. There are a few parts of the bridge in various stages of construction. I lay some cement blocks. I have some pixie sticks and a small magazine, which may have pornography in it. A man comes and explains the structure of the bridge to me. There is an outside path: a strolling lane. It's a love strolling lane. The man describes the plans for this. A class is going on a trip to the love lane. It is a rambunctious class. Mother Theresa and a man are there. We're all by the White House. The President may be there. The class and I are taking photographs of Mother Theresa and the man. No one goes up to her. I move closer to her, and then go up to her. She asks me where I see God. I tell her I see it in the sun, warm and loving. Then the whole class comes over and sits with us. <br/
