A black man, powerful, with a fist and a pointing finger in place of his head, pointed at white man pretending to be a jiving black man. He pointed at him and said in a very powerful voice, "Don't mess with the L." It was so strong that the jiver fell to his knees clutching the belt of the big guy and stammered. "No, I won't. I promise." He was thoroughly impressed with the strength of the statement "Don't mess with the lady!"
