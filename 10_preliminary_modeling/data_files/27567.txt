I was in a hospital basement in a kitchen. One of my friends was sick and she had asked me to fix her some poached eggs for breakfast. While I was fixing them some of the other girls (nurses) came in to fix their own breakfast. They were going to scramble their eggs and tried to persuade me to fix mine that way. However, I wouldn't do it because the friend of mine wanted poached eggs. When I had finished, however, the eggs seemed to be as hard as a rock and not soft like poached eggs usually are.
