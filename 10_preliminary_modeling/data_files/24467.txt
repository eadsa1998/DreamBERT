I am in charge of a LRRP squad which consists of myself, Larry R., Joe D. and a good-looking young woman. We stalk through dull and gloomy jungle. I have a crush on the girl. She does not respond to my overtures, but she does not push me away. A new man is sent out to replace or challenge my command. I shoot him in the leg. There is some kind of alert and I begin to sort through the bandoliers of ammo. Larry R. or the girl tells me to just hand them out. Then we are ambushed. I am up in a tree, drawing fire. I shoot back with my forty-five. The bullets are strong and powerful. I yell to Larry R. to throw a frag. I can see the dinks shooting at me. I yell to Larry R. and the girl that I am not going to die for nothing. I tell the girl I love her. Then I am shot.
