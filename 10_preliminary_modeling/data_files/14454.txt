I met up with some old friend of mine and we started hanging out quite a bit. A cat appeared, which I recognized, and they tried to get rid of it. It kept coming back and they decided to just keep it. I can't remember what happened, but I killed my friend. I attacked her and pulled her face off, etc. I left and then sent her a message to ask what she was doing, to try and cover it up. Then it wasn't me. The person, who had killed her, was having vivid nightmares that she thought were real. Then it was some weird day where people turned into whatever they were thinking about at a certain point in time. This fat lady that I knew was talking to me. She said she had just had sex with this young guy, who was called Brad (he looked like a surfer).
