I was standing and the waves came in on the lake. I saw the banks of the lake washed in. A string of freight cars ran into the lake. Then I saw the impossible. An engine was over the bank and he ran backwards up the bank and out of the water. There were cars, autos, they had tried to make the grade up out but couldn't. A lady slid down the bank, then she tried to climb out. I was on a farm in the fields. I had a steel nut in my hand. I wished to see a rabbit and I did. I threw the nut at him as he ran and missed. I hid in the tall grass. I had a club, stick. A kid who knew me came yelling, "Get out of my farm boots. I see you." He knew where I was. Two fellows and a lady came by us as we lay on the ground. We saw small bugs on the ground. The man stepped on him and he ran away. We said, "You didn't get him." I was riding a bicycle uphill with Hank on the rear. It was hard peddling, but I made it. Audrey jumped on a rock. It moved on the water, then turned into a yacht. Bob had the captain's cap on. I took it off his head, then I put it back on and let him be captain. He said, "Plug up the holes," and the crew did it. Our TV was on a blink. I noticed tube no. 9 was the one.
