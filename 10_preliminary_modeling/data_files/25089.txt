 I'm at the Peterson's cabin. There are a few people playing games. My girlfriend's mother Tamara Thomas is there. We talk about towels: if they are meant to warm a person. I open the doors to the porch. There are no handles so I just push them open gently. As soon as I walk out to the porch Tamara reprimands me. The porch is off-limits because that is where Mr. Peterson died. I move to close the door and leave everything in order. The house tilts, like it is on a ledge. I tell everyone to get to the other side of the house so George German and I can straighten the porch up and keep the weight balanced at the same time. They do, but there is still too much weight on our half so I tell George to go over to the other side too. I go back on the porch. There are boxes of breakfast cereal and empty beer bottles on my left. On my right are three or four pairs of shoes. There is a white table cloth-like rug that needs to be put down. While I scramble to put the bottles in their case, the house is tilting down on my side. It tilts all the way, even though I'm the only one on that side. I get the stuff in order, and straighten the shoes: one tall black pair of boots, my Nike hiking boots, and my Vans. There is a clear pair of glass or gel boots that are missing. Someone is wearing them. I put the rug down and close the doors. I think the house is tilted back to normal now. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. I'm in the kitchen, having come from the porch. Melanie comes up to me and looks like she is going to hug me, so I am going to hug her back. But she pulls my head and cheek down with her left hand and kisses me on the lips. I'm surprised! I try to hug her, and she thinks I'm going to try to kiss her again, and that isn't what she wants, so she holds me back. I indicate to her I didn't want to kiss her, just hug, so we do. Then we joke about me being clean and brushing my teeth.
