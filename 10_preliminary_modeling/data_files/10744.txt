I was in a girl's dorm. I remember entering the girl's lavatory - quite a large room. I sat there for some time. When I finished and re-entered the outer part of the restroom, it was no longer that but a cafeteria. I remember seeing SM who shouldn't have been there because he attends Miami University. I asked him if he could help me find a date for GS who was coming in for Thanksgiving weekend. This was peculiar because it so happens that GS also goes to Miami and is a steady date there of SM who is not coming in to Cleveland. I know I was thinking about getting her a date before I went to bed.
