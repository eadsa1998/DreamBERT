I was watching Big Brother and someone had written some stuff on a piece of paper and it was in the corner of the screen but I saw it had Stalled written on it. I was thinking of posting it on the Facebook group, but decided against it. I somehow came across a video of supposedly Dan Palmer, but the guy in it didn't look like him. He also had piercings and lots of jewellery and I was grossed out and trying to work out if it was actually him. When he spoke, it sounded like him but I couldn't work it out. I was annoyed that he wasn't as perfect as I thought.
