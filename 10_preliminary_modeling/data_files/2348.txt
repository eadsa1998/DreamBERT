I go to writing class with a story and a play. The story is a rewrite of one I've already done, only with dream sequences in it. It's called "Lucky Girl." Dennis and a young woman are the other two students. The teacher is out. We're waiting for her to return to read my story. I am pleased at the way I contrast dream material and reality stuff. I say, "I'm good at that."
