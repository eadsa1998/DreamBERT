I was walking down some street with a girl and others. It got dark and we saw someone and it was Jason Lee, so we brought him along for protection. People kept attacking us, but Jason scared them all off. Then I decided we should run down this alley. There were lots of people in the alley. I couldn't punch properly and thought it was a dream, so that I could punch and I hurt my hand. Then it was Max and Liz (both from Roswell) and they were in her father's water bed. This bad guy was sucking them into it. Liz was swimming up and just as her head came out, he pulled her back down and I was annoyed.  Then her father and someone were looking for her. It showed the bed and there was movement under the sheets and they were naked in bed. The father saw them and Liz was like "Dad! Pops!" and it was awkward.
