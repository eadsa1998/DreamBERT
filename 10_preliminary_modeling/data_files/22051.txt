I am in my school. Suddenly I see a priest who used to be my spiritual director. We don't greet each other (it is necessary to note that a year ago I had problems with this priest because he meddled too much and interfered with my freedom, which resulted in an argument and a distancing between us. He is not the same priest that appeared in my dream of 6/16/70). Suddenly all the juniors and seniors were in the dining room at the school. Another priest, friend of mine, was publicly criticizing the other one. I ask to speak and accuse this priest, joining in the accusation of my priest friend. But I see that my priest friend, who was accusing my spiritual director, does not allow me to accuse him and criticizes my attitude. I continue speaking and violently leave the dining room, slamming the door. Then, in order to avoid the consequences of what I had done, I pretend I am mad. To escape punishment and avoid all responsibility, I say that I am not responsible for what I say, and behave like a man who has lost his mind.
