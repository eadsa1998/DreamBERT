 I'm at Brimson. There are two events going on, one of which is a play. My friends Kevin Simpson and Tom Napper are supposed to be in the play at some point. People in the play cancel their performances. Kevin is needed to go on stage, but he is somewhere else. Tom is there, and is supposed to be in the play. People take turns doing their little shows, like a talent show.
