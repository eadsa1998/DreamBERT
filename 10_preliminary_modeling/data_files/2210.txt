Dolores M is the clerk in the fabric store. I want to make a nightgown. She says, "OK, but if you buy that material, you must also buy this material to make six pairs of socks." I don't like the sock material; it's a flowered print cotton with ruffles. She says, "You don't actually have to make the socks, you just have to buy the material." So I do. Then I see a crowd on a lawn in front of my bedroom. Two comedians are doing their routine. One's white and the other black (Bill Cosby). I go around the crowd to get a better look and I see two wheelchair guys being interviewed by the TV media about accessibility. Then two orange-haired black kids come over to Bill while he's working and want him to take them to the store. He stage whispers, "Can't you see I'm working? Go ask your mother." He's their father.
