We are in a NEW HOUSE. I play "blind man's bluff" with our kids, mostly Zena's friends. We laugh and have fun. I wear a red sweat shirt We wonder how we lived through the time of our old house being torn down. Frank jokes and tells us they put the old boards into match stick boxes! I go to the refrigerator and take out olives and potatoes; when I look at them closely, they are little live creatures. I am surprised.
