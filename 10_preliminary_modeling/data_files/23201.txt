I was on a college campus between classes, or just before a class.  As I sat on a bench, I saw John Kerry campaigning for president.  Grace Terry was campaigning against him.  She was handing out little slips of paper of irregular sizes, some of which were torn.  They didn't even have her name on them.  People were supposed to put them into a kind of ballot box.  I told her if she was going to run for president, she had to be a lot more organized and energetic and determined; she couldn't run such a slipshod campaign.  I don't think my advice had any effect; in any case I was late for class and had to rush off.
