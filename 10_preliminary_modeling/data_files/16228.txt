We were having a little picnic in the back yard, and we were playing the "Snake Bite" song, and we had this birthday cake that we were lighting candles on. And apparently a fire got started, a little fire with some of the matches, and Dad was showing me how to put out the fire that distracted me from being scared of the voodoo in the "Snake Bite" song. And then I dreamt that there was this movie that Mom and Dad were going to see. It was in the middle of some kind of a theme park. And how they would do it was, it would be totally, totally, totally dark in the place where they would go and stand, and this mask that they would put on would be blue. And they would not see anything until the movie would come on, and sometimes that would be a little scary. And I don't remember too much else, but it was kind of fragmented last night.
