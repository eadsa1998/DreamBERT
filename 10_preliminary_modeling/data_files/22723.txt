I don't remember exactly how the dream started, but it happened at my house. Some classmates from the university were there and other people. We were walking when we saw that these classmates came out of someplace. They had gotten inside in order to steal some books. Then we were in a meeting and we started to attack them with questions and they denied everything. Then my grandfather and my uncle appeared and they said that they had also stolen from their house. They were making phone calls. A neighbor of mine (male) also appeared. I was angry and wanted to hit everybody because they were lying. Then we were sitting in a restaurant and a girlfriend of mine appeared wearing a black lack dress, almost transparent, and she looked at herself in the mirror and was cavorting around so that the men sitting at my table would look at her.
