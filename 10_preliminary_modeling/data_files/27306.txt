I dreamed I was dancing at a ballroom I have been to and that I was having a wonderful time. All of a sudden, practically all of the people I have met in the last year within a certain crowd came in. Then I became panicky for the fellow I was dancing with, was not the boy this crowd knew that I went with. I was terribly afraid someone would tell the other fellow I was unfaithful. I felt trapped, as if I was trying desperately to escape from an enclosure of steel.
