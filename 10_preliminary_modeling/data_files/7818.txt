I was at a fair with Lilly H and Tonya H. We stopped at this food vendor to get something to eat. I was third inline behind them. It was all desserts and fruit. I had decided I was going to have some of the peach cobbler and a few prunes. I wasn't sure if it was peach cobbler but I knew that was what I wanted. When it was my turn, they took that away and left only vegetables and prunes. I said I wanted some of that meaning the cobbler but she ended up giving me a plate of something that looked like huge green beans. At first she started putting them on a very small plate but then she put them on a larger plate. She put the prunes on their plates too. When I went to sit down with Lilly H and Tonya H, I saw they were with a bunch of family members. I thought they should have told me if they were coming with family and I wouldn't have come along. I went back and tried to find my purse and couldn't. I finally found someone who was working there and asked her. She told me she had hidden it to keep it safe for me. I was so grateful. I pulled out my wallet and was going to give her $5 for doing that.
