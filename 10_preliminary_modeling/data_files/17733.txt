I was at a large house at the edge of the ocean with two other people.  For some reason the other two people I was with wanted to toy with a man and steal his checks.  The tide came in and flooded several feet around the house.  It was kind of pretty, actually.  We found out the man we had been fooling with was going to get married.  I started to feel guilty for what we had done and wanted to return things to the way they were.  Another woman showed up. I don't remember her name.  The man did end up getting married, but to the other girl, not the one he'd planned.  His fiancee was mad.  The man somehow got our cell phone number and was going to call- then I realized on the drive home- the other two people in one car, and I with my mother, that my mother had the cell phone.  The guy driving the other car wanted to switch with her so she wouldn't have to drive, since she was having trouble with directions- we were able to get the cell phone back then.
