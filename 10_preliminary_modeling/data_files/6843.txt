Lining up as if to go into chapter. Leader starts speech and then says, "Now we'll repeat together the well known prayer." Now all are saying the Lord's prayer. At the same time I hear many deep men's voices. And a soprano trying to sing. She is usually drowned out by the men. I see a colorful Chinese garment hung on a pole like a banner and think this is hardly the occasion for a prayer.
