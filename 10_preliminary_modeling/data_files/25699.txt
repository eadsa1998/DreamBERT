 I'm walking with my roommate Stephen Ramos down 1st Street in Oak Valley. We talk about the weight of canoes. I tell him my dad's canoe is so light I can pick it up with one hand, but it doesn't have a yoke. I'm going fishing. I'm at Mr. Black's house on the northwest corner of 1st Street and Old Avenue. I'm with a woman. Mr. Black's wife gives us lunch in a big brown paper bag. There are a lot of cookies in the bag. There is a little dog that doesn't bark. I pet the dog, and it jumps up on my shoulder. There may be another pet there that Mr. Black's wife has.
