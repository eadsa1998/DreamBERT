I dreamt that a close girl friend of mine who has been married for over a year was engaged to another friend of mine who is unmarried, but probably has never said 10 words to this girl in his life. The girl's parents (from whose apron strings she has not as yet untied herself) gave her a huge party when the engagement was announced. Everyone was very happy and she was to start attaining her divorce the day after this party. Her husband came to the party but left very early (as he always does). I told her how happy Bob and I were for her (Bob is my husband), but I said that after all, passing value judgements upon her life was not my affair. At this odd point I awakened.
