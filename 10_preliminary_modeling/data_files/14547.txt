I was watching Angels and Demons [I haven't seen it yet]. It was an early cam, but it was a good copy. It started off with teenagers (sometimes the movie was real). One of the guys liked this girl (who was me sometimes) and I liked him too. We were at a shop and Silas and Ezra were there and put beanies on their heads. I can't remember what the joke was. Anyway, we were in a car and some trees were on fire? Then it was a movie again. The Chief from Grey's Anatomy was the president. There was a flashback which showed a group getting ready. At first, it looked like they were bad guys, except for me and they tied me up. There was a really cute puppy. Then I was in water and they saved me and then a light went on and the 'cops' were all around me (in a circle) and fired their guns. Then there was a flashback and we were in a house or something. I was with my guy friend from before and a girl. It looks like it says [mag had he after], but I don't know what it's supposed to say. Anyway, he was wearing a jumper that was an expensive brand. I was wearing the jumper Mom made me. There was a fire and the guy was joking and grabbed me saying "hold me!". We were then at a place where the bad guys were. He tried to pretend he was one of them, but they were suspicious. Then in real life, I told Mom what I was watching and that it was funny. Ezra was there. She was watching The Da Vinci Code and I said that the first one sucked and I wondered where Tom Hanks came into the second one. There was a video that Jayson made, although he was Silas sometimes. It was a funny version of what happened with me and the bad guys.
