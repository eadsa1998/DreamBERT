Bertrand and Janie Therber were in town.  Janie's students were putting on a performance, I believe.  I don't remember much except for my wife Anita getting out of a car in a very tight blue costume like a ballerina or a bug or something; she had very wide epaulets or wings or something on her shoulders.
