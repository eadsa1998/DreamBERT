Margaret calls me to substitute because "Sue" got sick suddenly. I go over and see her lying down in bed; very sick and telling how it came on suddenly. She looks like Kathy Olsen, but when I approach her it is Marissa Camden. Later I talk with friends and tell them that either you feel well and it hits you suddenly, or you are sick and stay home and only later feel well.
