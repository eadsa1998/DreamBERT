I was at the gym with my sports acrobatics team, and our old coach Youri came in. We really liked him, so we were very happy he was back. The only other things I remember are that I said to my friend Rhonda (who is on my team): "Look, Youri's here!" "I know," she said, "isn't it great?" And also I remember playing "nerf" tennis in the gym. Setting: The gym. Characters: Youri - my old coach, really good, I liked him a lot. Rhonda - my friend and teammate, also liked Youri a lot. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, excited. I wish it would happen in real life!!
