I dreamt that I was sitting in Kulas with my father. There were 6 beautiful chandeliers on the ceiling. While we were sitting there, a bomb fell, but it didn't harm anything and the people continued to sit there and the program went on also. All of a sudden I decided to find my mother. I left my father and went near the back to sit with mother. I had just sat down when they called me up on the stage. They asked me to tap dance. I told them I couldn't dance, but I would sing for them. I started to sing and found myself in my own living room singing for my grandmother, mother and father.
