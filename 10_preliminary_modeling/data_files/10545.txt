We go up to Kevin's place; I say, "How come you spent 3 hours in the library?" but Pedro doesn't seem to see the joke; he asks Kevin about a message on his answering machine which Kevin did not understand; Pedro berates K. severely and K. is downcast. Even more so when Pedro dances with me and not with Kevin. Kevin has an apartment in a posh hotel and we walk down a marble flight of steps to the lobby; I worry about my raincoat which I think I left in the car.....
