There are two papers to pass on, this sheet to teachers and the brochure to parents. I ask if I may take more than one as so many of my brothers and sisters are teachers. Another lady and child enter but there are no empty seats. I point out a sofa filled with dolls and suggest picking up the dolls so they could sit there.
