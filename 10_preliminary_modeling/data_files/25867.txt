 I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel outside the student union at Brimson as I walk down High Avenue. I say hi. My voice is very high-pitched. Inside the union are people. My high school classmate Tanya Simmons is there. I ask her if she is sick. I ask her about how she is going home: which route she is taking.
