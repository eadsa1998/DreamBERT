I was working with a bunch of bibliographies that were in Excel spreadsheets. I copied and pasted them all into one worksheet. I then put them in alphabetical order and went through and removed all of the duplicates. I was working with someone else on this but I don't know if it was by phone or email or if they were actually there with me. We were determining which ones were needed for DTM.
