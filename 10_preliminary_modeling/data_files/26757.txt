 I'm looking down on a place where I know my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is working. It's dark: few town lights are on. There are several buildings with a road in front of them. I stand, or have a viewpoint from the top back of one of these buildings. There is a space or alley between buildings, which I know is where she works. We may meet. I don't see her completely, or see her face. I remember having my hand on her butt, on the outside of her black tights. I may move my hand under her pants and touch the flesh of her butt.
