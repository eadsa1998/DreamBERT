 I'm in a party-like atmosphere where people are performing skits. I try to mingle with the popular and famous people who are there. One of the famous people is the actor from the television sitcom Friends: the character of Joey. I manage to get a few words in because I smile and laugh. I am always smiling. I vomit up baked beans. There are people singing. I try to sing, echoing, shadowing, or singing along with a group of men. I don't sing too well. My classmate Pauline Davies is there. She is up higher, maybe on a table. She dances and sings. She has huge, well-defined, quadriceps muscles. [Note: I ate baked beans for dinner last night]
