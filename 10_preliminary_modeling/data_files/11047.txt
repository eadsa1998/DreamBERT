The stairway hall at home. I am standing at the front of the stairs, repeatedly working the light switch up and down, trying to get the light to go on (it already is on, but I keep trying to turn it on), but nothing happens. The doorbell rings, and my youngest brother is at the door. I am quite annoyed with him, because we had him started to school in plenty of time to get there on time and by coming home again, he will be late, and also because he has taken his coat off against orders. He says something about being hungry and I decide that he has forgotten to eat breakfast.
