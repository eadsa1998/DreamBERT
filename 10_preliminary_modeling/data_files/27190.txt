This dream took place over in Europe. I was there with a friend of mine. We were planning to escape by plane and fly back to the U.S. As we were making plans, my father got into the plane and started the motors. The plane was unusual in appearance. It seemed to have a brown cabin with wings extending on the end of the cabin, &amp; was very awkward looking. H___, the friend who was with me, and I stood there in amazement watching my father try to fly in such a small area that could be used for a runway. There seemed to be a lake around &amp; in one of my father's unsuccessful attempts to fly away, he landed in the water. Then the plane diminished in size to the size of a toy plane, and it also changed from brown to black. I waded in the water and pushed the plane on shore. Then I opened the small door and my father, in miniature size, got out of the plane. The minute he stepped out of the plane, he again became normal size.
