In this dream, I was getting married to an old boyfriend I had seen on the street the day before. He looked really handsome and the whole ceremony went really great. The bridesmaids wore green. Just when the ceremony was going perfectly, I saw that his current girlfriend was one of my bridesmaids. This was really weird, because we do not get along with one another. Another strange thing about this ceremony was that once we were married, we were running in the Summer Tunnel but we could not get out. There were other people walking there too. It was like one lane was for driving a car, and the other lane was for walk-throughs. It was real weird. I still had on my wedding gown and he had on his tux. We just could not get out of the tunnel. It seemed like we walked for days. Then in the next scene, we were in a [illegible] house that was unfamiliar to me and we were eating pizza and grapes. I still had the gown on. Then in the next scene we were still in the tunnel but sitting down taking a break from running. The dream was not like a story, it was just like a bunch of scenes that did not make any sense.
