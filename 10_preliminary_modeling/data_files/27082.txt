I seem to be at the dormitory which I am now staying. There seemed to be some sort of a fight going on - all the girls were fighting, can't seem to recall who or what they were fighting I remember I was sitting at the top of the stairs after the fight was over and one of my present teachers, who is a nurse about 38 yrs old came along. I seemed to be thanking her for helping us, she seemed glad that she could have helped. I remember that many of the girls had their faces cut &amp; clothes torn. I give them first aid, but I don't believe I was hurt.
