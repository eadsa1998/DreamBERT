Something's in the air. A change. Someone goes by saying, "Let's eat. Where's the grass?" Someone else laughs. That's all past. No more, meager veggie meals. Now it's meat! A man approaches a woman and offers her two fat volumes of some books and an empty baby seat if she'll make him a baby. People are making babies all over now because they feel strong and vital after so long. I am handed my plate. I am aghast. There is a live little brown furry animal on my plate, already garnished and cooked. "I refuse to eat live food," I say, quite disgusted and upset. Someone offers to cut it and chew it for me so it won't seem so horrible. I refuse. Then there is dancing. An energetic old white-haired man in a tweed suit claims me for the dance. I feel his strength and vitality. I smile shyly. He wants to kiss.
