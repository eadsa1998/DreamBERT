A conspiracy - really insidious - purpose unknown. I'm with (my brother?) in a tiny house and there's been someone else here. There are some really strange guys been looking for that other person (a young boy) and my brother doesn't know what they want but I'm afraid I do. They won't necessarily hurt anybody but you can't be sure and I've gotten very paranoid. I tell my brother and we start talking about plans to get away and I even think about starting over somewhere with different hair and clothes, etc., it's depressing. While we're talking I'm breaking a couple eggs on the counter and scraping them into a dish or something - we're trying to look busy.
