I remember I dreamed about a seismic movement in a place where I couldn't see other people, but I could feel the presence of other people by their screams and cries. I remained calm and tried to calm the others. The strange thing was that the ground on which I stood, which was an open field, wasn't moving. I only saw that the houses were falling, one after the other. I awoke rather scared and worried (it has been a few days since I moved to another place, to live alone in a room).
