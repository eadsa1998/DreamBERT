Am walking down a street and pass a couple, middle-aged, woman dumpy and with red, fuzzy hair. Suddenly she leaves her partner and comes over and propositions me. I look at her and say that I would never believe she was that way. Later am sitting at a table with 3 or 4 persons eating. To my right is the same woman sitting, oddly enough, in what appears to be a row of movie seats. I whisper to the guy across from me so she cannot hear, that in case he didn't know it, that woman there was a "prostitu√©e" and I spell it out after saying the word.
