I was at school. We had an assembly. Calvin and I were a bit late. On the way there I had bright blue pants on and I realized and was like "What the hell?". Eugene and Darius were behind us, talking. Calvin said "you know sexy Marconi?" and I said "No, but I know Lucia Marconi". When we got to the place, it was full and we had to go upstairs. It had floor hanging over so if you looked down you could see the assembly. The floor was broken so we had to sit back. Elijah came up there. When they left I put my proper pants on. There was this room there which was a mess and things were broken in it. There was a badge with my name on it. I suggested we clean and fix it and use it. Then it was clean.
