I had a dream last night. What we were doing was changing class, that we had to switch classes and we had to bring all our books. And I got real nervous and so I brought the wrong book to class and the teachers yelled at me. And I went back into class that I interrupted the other class, and I got the right book, and I brought extra folders. And so I was carrying too much, and I couldn't see.
