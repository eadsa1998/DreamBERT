Mabel comes over to my house. She's going out on a date the next night and wants to borrow a blouse or a sweater as I always have nice things to wear. She wants to look special. I look around in my closet and find pretty, white, soft, translucent blouses. She tries them on. She can't decide which one. I find her a blue skirt. Then she tries on a pair of shorts and a pink blouse with a bow at the neck. I say, "Oh, you aren't going to wear that are you?" Then I find her a pretty blue dress. We both agree that it will look very nice.
