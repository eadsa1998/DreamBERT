In my apartment (looks like this one), I'm with the cats (there are 3), and they're having a pretty good time with the packing up. They keep bringing me things, including chain headpieces I'd forgotten about. All of a sudden I look and they've brought something else. The last is a large beaded one I swear I didn't know I had. It's long, and has biggish red and blue beads, very outlandish for that sort of thing but quite impressive. There's a noise; we all look up, but it was short and we ignore it. But a little time passes and now I hear the front door squeaking. It's creaking as though it were open and swinging a bit. [We're in the bedroom, and the door's supposed to be shut, probably latched, but maybe it isn't!] I'm very alarmed, and crawl on my hands and knees silently to the bedroom door to look out. The door's open, all right, and swinging, you see daylight all around. But nobody there, which is a relief. I turn back to the cats, then back to the door, which I mean to get up and close. But now there's somebody standing between me and it - a short, black figure, skinny - maybe a human black child, but with the sun glare behind him it's hard to see. It doesn't really look like a child, and it's definitely hostile. I can't see that it's wearing clothes, either. I'm frightened, knowing it's here to rob, but will attack me now that it knows someone's here. I barely have time to think all this and wonder what to do, before it runs at me through the door. I trip it with my body - after all, I am on the floor, and it goes down headfirst with its legs in the air, which I grab.
