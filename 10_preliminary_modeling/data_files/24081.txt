I am in an unfamiliar classroom and I seem to be taking care of or supervising a boy about the age of five. He has blond hair and seems very average in appearance. He is playing quietly by himself and I really have no contact with him at all. There are many toys strewn about the room and everything is multicolored and bright, like a kindergarten classroom might be but more vivid. The room is full of other people including other adults and children, it is a busy atmosphere with movement everywhere. Nevertheless, my attention is not where it might be expected. I am sitting on the floor by the boy and near me are two very good-looking, dark-skinned girls. They tell me that they are both 17 years old and that they also both have the same boyfriend. At the exact same time all three of us say, "Lucky guy" (meaning the boyfriend is lucky). I remember being more interested in the two girls than the boy I am supposed to watch. The dream seems to end with me talking to the two girls.
