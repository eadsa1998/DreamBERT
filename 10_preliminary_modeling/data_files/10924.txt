I was standing on a chair landing in the dorm when one of the girls went by and called to a boy (22) to come on up. I knew him, but when I saw him, I was surprised to see him. One strange thing I noticed about him was that the back part of the top of his head had a brush cut while the front part was shaved. I asked him what happened and he told me he was undergoing treatments at the dentist.
