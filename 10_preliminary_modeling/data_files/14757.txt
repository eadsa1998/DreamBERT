I was at dads. I was getting ready to go somewhere. I got there and stayed by myself. It was like a 2.5 hour drive. I was in a big room and there were no curtains (just those frilly things). I was watching a movie that was 2.5 hours in and still had 2.5 hours left. It was dark and rainy/stormy outside and I saw shadows of people. I text Dad telling him to drive here now. He sent back saying 'you scared?'. I went to this other building with some people while I waited. There was this guy there who I kind of liked. I thought people were watching us unlock the door and then we had to put this thing out so no-one could get past. Then Ezra was there and we had to do it again because we had to let him through. Then it was 4am and I text Mom to say Dad still wasn't here.
