I played 3 horses in a reverse and I won. I was doing some kind of work with Fisher. There wasn't much of it and a lot of people were working on it. A forelady was calling for a hay patcher. Carl said, "Go, you like that work." I said I had a cold and it would make me sneeze. Then I saw a gang smearing old oil on a road. I was in a small shanty nude and a woman came in with me and I let some gas out. She said, "It smells bad in here."
