["Wheelchair racing."] I am watching wheelchair racers on some odd bumpy curvy uphill, down hill race course, which isn't a round track but some sort of street area. They seem tiny and fast. One of them is a paraplegic man. He is very good. Now he rests and my job is to help him. Giving massages and so on. I am doing that. Then another man comes by, someone I know in the dream, and we kiss. This makes the paraplegic man jealous, as he is attracted to me. Then I decide to be a wheelchair racer as well, although I am able bodied. We are racing. He is very fast and far ahead of me. I work very hard and manage to pass some other racers. On big man glares at me. I try to catch up with my man. I manage to finish 3rd which is still very good for my first try. I shout in victory and cry in defeat alternating. The man and I hug in jubilation.
