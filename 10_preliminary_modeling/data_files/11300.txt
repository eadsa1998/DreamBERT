I was seated in the living room of a girl (19) who has slept with me in the past. A friend of mine (m, 20) was there as were the girl's parents. I next found myself seated at the dinner table with the girl and another man (22) who was blackballed two semesters ago from my fraternity. I found myself cutting and heating his hand, instead of the food which was on my plate. I was impressed that he felt no pain. After dinner, we returned to the living room and then left her parents there and went to her bedroom. As we were going to bed, I noticed my friend coming into the room. I took a shot at him with a gun I found by the bedside. Suddenly this other man (the one who had been blackballed) leaped into the room and attacked me with a knife. I was terrified.
