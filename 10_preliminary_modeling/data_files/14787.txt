I met Jensen Ackles and had sex with him. It was then a gay guy who had had sex with him and Jensen was in a restaurant/cafe. The gay guy walked past and Jensen saw him through the window and stopped him. The gay guy was annoyed. Jensen came out and the guy said "you fucked me" but said he didn't want anything to do with him. Then I was watching a video tape of a school. There was lots of tall graffiti on the wall of the gym. Ezra, Mom and Dad were there. Mom took me to Dad's old place and I was out the back with Dad. The house was different though I didn't notice. Some stuff was still there. Nana and Poppa were there. They said to go out the front and put this poster in the bin. There was a door next to the garage doors. Dad yelled at Ezra for some reason. There was a kitten and a puppy on the poster. Nana pulled out a cord and the put it back in and it shocked her. I discovered that Dad had decided to keep the place. I was happy about it. Mittens and Tigger were back there and I pat them. Mittens was meowing [in real life, Cuddles was meowing and it woke me up].
