I am driving somewhere in my car and talking with my dad on a cell phone. The car conks out and I have to pull over to the left side of the road. My dad seems to be blaming me for something. The place where I pull over is a prison and I have to get help there. Someone takes me inside and we go up a lot of stairs. I can look out over water from a tower in the prison and I see another part of the prison, which looks like Alcatraz, out in the water on a rock. Then the prison turns into a nursing home and some of the women are senile. They are wearing robes and slippers. A little girl is with me. We get to the top of the tower and look down and there are kids swimming in dirty, dark water and I know the water is very deep. I tell the little girl "don't ever ask to swim in that pool!" Everyone smiles as if they understand.
