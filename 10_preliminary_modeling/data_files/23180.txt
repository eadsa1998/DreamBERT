I got in a van or small bus with some other people-all girls, I believe, and we headed across Widespan Bridge to the city where I worked.  I was under the impression that the game was being moved there.  On the way, we were discussing what kind of music each person liked.  A black girl riding next to the driver said that she didn't care about others, she was going to listen to her favorite music-from the 50's and 60's.  I slapped her back with enthusiastic approval, and said "WMZQ?"  I think I meant WYXR(?)  When we got to the city where I worked, we parked and they started getting out of the van and filing into some shop or department store.  I was greatly disappointed and asked about the game.  They said it was still going on in a nearby city, so I was faced with the prospect of walking back there and would probably be too late to get into the game.
