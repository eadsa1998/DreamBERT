Mother and I were driving along the street when I saw the mother of a girl I knew from high school who had just been married. We stopped to talk to her when the girl whom had just been married the day before came toward us. I wanted to talk to her. She came towards us backwards and when she turned to face us, she was a heavy Negro girl. I stared at her for a minute. I said, "I hope you got through it alright," meaning the wedding ceremony, but my mother and the girl's mother thought I meant something dirty. I tried to convince them that I hadn't meant anything obscene, but neither would believe me. I felt terrible.
