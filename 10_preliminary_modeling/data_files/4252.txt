["Dressing for success."] I am in a room. Nate is there. I want to hug him. He starts to bend down, but I say wait. I want to hug him standing up. I struggle a bit and stand up. We have an awkward hug. Now it is time to go to a meeting. Maybe it is a job interview. I am walking, wearing a peach colored pretty business suit with white trim. I feel unsure if I should be now in my wheelchair or walking. I also can't decide if I should button up my jacket or not. I get out of the elevator in a back hall of the office. I realize I have an opportunity to sneak down the hall and check out info on how the business operates and I'd do better at the interview if I snuck a peek. I feel guilty but do sneak down the hall and then decide to be honest. I return to the main reception area which I enter from the back door. I maneuver around lots of desks and barriers and finally make it to the front of the front desk to announce myself.
