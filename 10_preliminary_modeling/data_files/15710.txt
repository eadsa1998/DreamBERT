I lived in a weird house with Julian Barratt and two others (one was a girl, but I can't remember the other one). I had a huge crush on Julian and everyone knew (including him), but he didn't seem to be interested. There were also these people who sat outside my window all the time, two were dressed in animal costumes (a cat and a fox?). They creeped me out and I always kept my curtains pulled to, but each window had its own curtain and it didn't fill the entire window. Mostly I just ignored them. My room was big and had two single beds over each side (one next to the windows and the other one next to wall, where door was). One day something happened and we had sex, but I think he was forced into it? We didn't speak about it and kept on as usual. Two of these people were girls, one who did stuff for me and one who was nice and perky, but she kept flirting with Julian. One day I got sick of it and I told the other girl to get rid of her. Then these chimes kept going all night, so I had to take them down and put them away. I also talked to the people outside once and asked why they were here. They said to monitor the relationship with Julian? The guy in the fox suit was called Tom. I went out and walked down street and hadn't really paid attention to what was around before. There was this big gelato shop with weird flavours and stuff was around Â£2.50-3.00. Some blue ice-cream, other weird colours and flavours. Nothing really interested me though, so I left. Back home, Julian was complaining to one of the girl's about something and I walked in and was like what and he was like 'I NEED TO FUCK' and he seemed frustrated and annoyed. I was thinking like 'dude, I'm right here and up for it'. He then seemed to realise and started motioning for me to go into my room.
