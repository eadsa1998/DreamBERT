I see a baby boy who has a psychological problem. He holds his legs funny. I approach him and say, "Let me see." I lay him back and hold his legs like I'm changing his diaper. He has no balls. I say, "What has your mother done?" He looks embarrassed, like caught. His mother had hurt him when she diapered him, like molestation. [BL]
