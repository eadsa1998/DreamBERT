["Weird interview."] I am at a workshop for some social service agency. A man named "Bob" comes in and talks about his sort of public radio/TV/Internet agency. After the workshop I go over to a small room to do an interview for a job with his agency. He is friendly and talkative. He busies himself dusting the vent door near the ceiling where the computer stuff is stored. It is very dusty. I sympathize. He hands me a curved and long test paper to do. It is very wordy and doesn't ask the straight forward questions I expect. It is confusing and frustrating to fill out. I skip a few questions and have come back to do them. I struggle with my address. SE 40th or is it NW. I try to look it up on my driver's license and other cards. It's all wrong on them too. Then Bob comes back in and interrupts me. He has a rectangular cream colored purse. He thinks it's mine and I left it in another room. I tell him its not mine. I have my small black one (like Ginny's) with me. I am distracted with his conversation. He asks very non essential non related questions. How did I hear of this job opening? What shows do I watch on Fox channel? A disabled show, some news and an occasional movie. I unsnap the question section off its curved answer track. A device that is black and cumbersome. I keep trying to smooth out the curves so I can read the questions and answer them. I realize this is a very right brain work group and I am very left brain. I feel frustrated and aware I'd have to adjust to understanding what they are doing and do it their way.
