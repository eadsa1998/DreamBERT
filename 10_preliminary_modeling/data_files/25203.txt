 I'm at Carter School with other people. We go up on top of the stage, by the catwalk. There are mice there. My high school classmate Ron Lind and the football team are up on top of the stage too. There is another level, higher up: the third floor. I think that is where they are. I am outside the school by the basketball hoops and trees. There is soup there, with some kind of little balls in it. I eat it. A family friend, Doug Zirbes, is there. He is an actor (but not in real life). There is a man there who blew the 9:00 curfew whistle that I heard when I was a kid. He is on a 1986 Topps-like baseball card. Holly and Megan Tanks are there. I fight some people. They are unsuspecting of my aggression, and do not retaliate.
