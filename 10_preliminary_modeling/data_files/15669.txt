I was at Leederville IGA [I had to cancel the job which was tomorrow]. I was having trouble with my sore arm and after 2 hours I was still stuck on the same shelf and kept knocking stuff off. I was having problems with the ladder too. Calvin was there. I went to get Co-Worker-F-02 to ask her to go home. She was upstairs at the back of the store. There were bedrooms and hers was empty and the light was off. I heard a noise and went back to the stairs but then she came out of one of the other rooms in a costume -- it was Halloween? She said she would normally cover up with makeup when she was dressed up, but this costume covered up her face and I said "it saves time". I explained to her about my arm, but she just got some other people to do my shelf and I was unsure of whether I could leave or not.
