 I'm at Rival High School with either my friend Kevin Simpson or Tiny Combs. There is a ramp there for freestyle bikers. I have a bike. We go out, I say excuse me to a guy coming in. I give Kevin or Tiny a buck on my bike back to his car. They have to step off the bike when I ride down the stairs. Near the road, I vomit. It is a weird feeling that I rarely get. I cough up thick chunks of food onto a newspaper. I vomit up two whole hamburgers! A man in a funny looking car drives by. While I vomit, Kevin or Tiny laughs, saying, "You're puking!"
