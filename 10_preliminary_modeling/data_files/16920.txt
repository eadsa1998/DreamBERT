My cousin Anita is planning some kind of performance. We're at a house (my childhood home). She has an eccentric plan that involves getting two easter eggs and wearing them in a bra as a comedy act. I offer to go out and try to find some Easter eggs. For some reason it seems 'risky' to do this, as if it's illegal, or very dangerous to go out after dark. The streets outside are in fact full of gangs of youths carrying knives and perhaps guns. Apparently I have a fight on the road outside the house. I either take a gun off someone or I have one already. I have it stuffed down the back of my trousers. It goes off in the scuffle.
