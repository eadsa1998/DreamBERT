 I'm fishing on a pontoon-like raft with another person, who may be my friend Matt Yams. I'm using two fishing rods. It's difficult to cast and reel with both rods: holding one in my arm while using another. I get a fish on. My line goes taut and the fish jumps. It's a good-sized ocean fish, about ten pounds. I seem to have hooked it in the back, or by a metal ring that is attached to its back, like a Shad Rap fishing lure. We land the fish. I have a metal stringer. Later, I'm fishing with my friend's father Mike Reed.
