I was living in a log cabin in the north woods with two boyfriends of mine. We were up there deer hunting. One afternoon while we were cleaning a deer that one of my friends had shot in the morning we smelled smoke and looked up the moutainside to see a small forest fire starting. The cabin had Indian pump guns in it for fires that might start around camp. So Don and I took the two guns and got our horses and started for the fire while Chuck rode for help to the Forest Rangers. When we reached the fire it was getting pretty well out of hand but we held it down so it would spread not too much further, and thought we had things pretty well under control. Then a strong wind got behind the fire and we had to get out and join the rangers who were coming to help us when they saw what happened. They started a back fire and soon the fire was out.
