I was watching South Park with Mom. Kyle and Stan had grown up. Stan and others were making fun of Kyle and then they left and Kyle was upset and they told him later they were just joking. I was with Ezra and a friend of Ezra's. We went to this creepy neighbourhood which I'd dreamt about before. It was like World of Warcraft. I had to go into this cave and get something but there were mobs around and they were hard to kill, so I was trying to avoid them. They attacked us and we ran. I went home and it was different. Mom went out and was going to be a while. It was night, about 9pm. We went to this ice cream shop. Later they wanted to go out again and I said that I wanted to come. I grabbed my keys and was going to follow them but they got in this other car and took off. I did a two finger salute at them. I noticed that there was mail in the mailbox. The postman came walking up. He was sort of hot but was like an average build. He gave me some more mail and left. But as I took it all out, he came back and I realized he was dodgy and whacked him with the mail, which included some chocolate. I ran to the door and he tried to open it but it was locked. I said that my brother has the key. I stabbed him with my car key. He started to bleed and I unlocked the door and went in. He blocked the lock, but let it go for a second and I locked it. I locked the back door too and he said "forget something?" and he had come through the other back door. We ended up in a bedroom with two beds. I was half hanging off one and he was on top of the bed, raping me, except he was somewhat gentle and I liked it. He told me to hold the bottom of the bed. At some point before I had managed to get on MSN and told Ezra that a guy had broken in.
