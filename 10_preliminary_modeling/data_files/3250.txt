I am a housewife and cleaning up the apartment. It is constant work and I do it willingly. I fold clothes, do the dishes, cook meals, and care for the small kittens. I pick it up and cuddle it saying in a soft sweet voice, "Oh, there's the little kitty." Later, I have children, two half-grown boys and a six-year-old girl. I then am lighting the candles and am dressed in a 1950's housewife, pretty for my hubby, and he walks in the door with an unexpected dinner guest.  I am distressed, but handle it gently and with dignity. Later, I am cleaning up, he's now drunk and off to bed calling for me to come to bed and I am still cleaning up the sink from after the dinner. Woman's work is never done. [BL]
