The setting takes place in my room on an average partly sunny April morn. The dream was fairly familiar to me but I don't remember everything about the dream. However, I definitely knew I had the dream when I woke up. I remember dreaming that I got a phone call early in the morning and woke me up with a girl asking me to a dance who I thought didn't want to go with me, but it turned out she did, and the next day we were going together to the dance. This was a pleasant but frustrating dream.
