I was fencing with somebody that resembled Jimmy. Only, he had a sword and I didn't. So I pretended to have a sword, which worked pretty well until he noticed. Then a sword appeared in my hand and we really began to fight. We fought for a long time. We were both really getting into it. Finally, he had me at his mercy and we stopped fighting. I thought to myself that sport is the most sublime meditation avaliable to the average individual, to be completely in tune with a healthy body. I thought how much better this was than the time I almost drowned, in shallow water no less.
