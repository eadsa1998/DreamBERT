I dreamt I was in a dorm room and saying goodbye to someone I had been dating. He was going off to school. In the next scene the room was full of people and then suddenly empty again, except for a pile on the floor in the corner that consisted of a corkboard with old pictures of me on it. This room must have belonged to the guy I was seeing, because I thought it was unusual for him to have these pictures of me. He really liked these pictures, which made me feel like he was really going to miss me, which surprised me. He was trying to kiss me goodbye, but I hesitated because there was a carload of my friends looking at us, and they didn't approve of our relationship. He left and I went back into the room, and it was filled with things all of a sudden. Then my new roommate was there and a strange guy came out of the shower and took off his towel and I got a shocking eye-full. Then I went to my mom's house, where I found my dog; she is actually dead in reality.
