I was at a shop. I was with Mom looking at the men's clothes. There was a shirt with a rainbow like thing on it and Mom suggested I get it and I said that "rainbows are gay". Then I was with others at the shop and we were vampires. It was hard to tell who was a vampire (they had small teeth, normal skin colouring etc). Everyone was feeding, but I had trouble finding someone. I found a lady with a baby, but then it was a guy. Someone took the baby and I tried to bite the guy's arm, but all it left was a little scratch and I tried sucking on it but no blood came out. I used some medical equipment and discovered he had no heartbeat and then he smiled and he was actually a vampire and was playing a joke on me. Owen (Torchwood) and I were sort of friends but argued a lot. There was a montage of us arguing. He was then rambling, as he does, and said we should have sex and I said, going along with it, "oh we should, should we?". Supposedly, vampire sex was really good. Then I was at a house. I was talking to some people and I said Mom was getting an abortion and they questioned it and I had actually meant getting her tubes tied but I couldn't remember what it was called and said she was "getting her nuts cut". Darren was related to Martin Sheen and I couldn't see the resemblance.
