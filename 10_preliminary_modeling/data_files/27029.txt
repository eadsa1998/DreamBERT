My mother, father and sister came to visit us and parked their car behind our house on the other side of some railroad tracks. After they had loaded the car with their baggage and had said good-bye, I saw my mother and father coming back up the back walk. Mother's eyes were red and daddy had tears in his eyes -- my sister had been hit by a train while crossing the tracks to the car. I never before realized how much my sister meant to me until now when she was gone.
