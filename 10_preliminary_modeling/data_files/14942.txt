I went to dads. He had a girlfriend. The house was on a street with fancy houses. I went to one and this lady gave me expensive clothes to wear to some place. She ended up getting annoyed at me so I left them there. Mom had a pool. We had blow-up toys -- a crocodile and an alligator/hippo. Farrah got on the crocodile and tried to jump in, but you had to go in at 40km/h. People were coming and we had to wait too long. Mom said "60!" and we jumped and held our breath. Furio (The Soprano's) was in some film/TV show, but it was actually someone else. I couldn't remember his name.
