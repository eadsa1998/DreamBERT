I get in my hang glider and fly over the vast acres of trees and crops I own. I am very wealthy. My wife is trying to take it away from me. She's a glittery, non-caring woman, selfish. I come back. It's hard because I'm gliding against the wind. I finally make it work. She's stealing jewelry from my house. I want to kill her and prepare to do so.
