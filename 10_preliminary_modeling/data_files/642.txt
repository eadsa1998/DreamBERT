My son, daughter and I are driving around town looking at all the nice Halloween decorations. Then my daughter is in a contest like a race. A classmate of my son's has a daughter who is also racing and some adults are in the race. One woman appears to be naked but when I look again she is all dressed in gray. We go through a series of buildings downtown including bars where there is a lot of smoke. At the theater we enter at the top and there is a steep stairs. My son makes about three jumps to the bottom. I walk. The stairway is curved at the top and bottom. We get outside and my son is having an asthma attack and is lying in a puddle of cold water. I put snow on his chest and he says it helps. No one seems to notice we are having trouble.
