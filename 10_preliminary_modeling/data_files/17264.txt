A performance.  My friend Jenna was next to me in the bleachers.  We were supposed to be singing.  Someone in back was playing a didgeridoo.  Few people were participating, clapping their hands and singing. Someone suggested that we cycle through the crowd- they'd have to participate if they were singled out to lead.  So it started, and it worked.  Then people started leaving, and all of a sudden the multipurpose room was gone.  I thought about running the track, but it would have gotten in the way.  Somebody kicked a soccer ball into a high barbed wire fence.
