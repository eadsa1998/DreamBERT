I was walking home from somewhere, and every apartment entrance I passed I would go in and go to all the apartments in the building, as if I were selling something.  The last time, I realized as I climbed the stairs that I didn't know why I was doing it-that I was tired and wanted to go home, and didn't have much farther to go.  Nonetheless, I continued my climb to the top of the stairs, knowing there was no reason for it, then came back down without knocking on any of the doors.  As I walked, I was talking to Waldo Row.
