["King Of His Own World"]  An average ordinary man decides to create his own little kingdom. He has a group of followers. I am with a new group of people coming into the kingdom. I am there, but I didn't choose to go. I am with a family. We line up along a wall. The King and his sons are holding an audience. As the people mill around and shift position, I end up very near the front of the line, right across from where the sons are standin at a doorway. They are trying to signal their servant to give them orders. I see their signal, and then I mouth to the servant who is also across from me and to the right of the sons, what the sons said. A narrator voice, male, says the sons have created a special bed for themselves on the throne area. Soft warm sheets, lots of pillows. I think, I'd do the same thing. The King now signals me to come up to the throne area and talk with him. He wants me to sit right next to him. I scoot slowly closer, not wanting to be any closer. He keeps insisting that I get closer. Finally I am right up against him. He kisses me on the neck. I don't like this and feel very uptight and uncomfortable. He continues. Finally, I stand up and say Your Majesty, I'm leaving. I walk back to my place in the line. Now the sons are interested in me.
