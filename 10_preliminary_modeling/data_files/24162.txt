I was at my dorm here in Santa Cruz here with a bunch of people. These people were both from and my buddies from back home. We were all partying and drinking, and I remember that my ex-boyfriend was there. In my dream I kept worrying about my current boyfriend knowing that he'd get mad that he wasn't there but my ex was. Then it was a different day + my ex I bumped into + he was mad because I had given him accidentally a wrong number for my room. I told him I must have been drinking too much and got the number mixed up. That's all I can recall.
