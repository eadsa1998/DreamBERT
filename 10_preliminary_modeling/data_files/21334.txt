Bill Kotnik had a high step ladder on the lawn. I climbed up part way and the ladder was shaky. I cam down and made the ladder solid, then climbed up. I went up above the trees. I saw walnuts and then I saw red tomatoes growing on a vine. I yelled down at Ann to look up at the red tomatoes to see if they were tomatoes and then she said they were. I took one and ate it. It was delicious. I was driving my car on the highway.
