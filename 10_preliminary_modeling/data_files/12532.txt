Evelyn and I were sitting next to each other in an assembly place. Harlan was sitting behind me, measuring jumpers on my back. He got to the largest one and he said "This one's for her!" (about me). I got up and yelled at him saying "Yeah, you're frickin' hilarious because you can't tell that it's way too big and I'm wearing an obviously smaller jumper now, you frickin' retard!" then I walked off.
