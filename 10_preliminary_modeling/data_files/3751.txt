I am helping Bill Clinton show a group of people some souvenirs he had: a pair of red slippers from Japan in a plastic wrap. I take the package from Mr. Clinton and walk over to the group and hand it to someone. This goes on for awhile. Now it's over and I am going to go teach a class at elementary school. I walk through one classroom where they have no furniture; they sit on the floor. I see a man and say to a friend that I am interested in having a relationship with him. I go on. She tells him what I said. He thinks it over and then follows me into my classroom. He, I realize now, is slightly retarded or slow. I wonder about my choice. I am resetting the heater. I put in a new part and start it up. He says to me, "Did you hygenate it first?" It needs hygenation. Or it will blow up." I realize I hadn't even considered looking at the directions and missed this important step.
