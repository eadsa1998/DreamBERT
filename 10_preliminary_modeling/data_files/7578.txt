I was out eating and it was a very nice place. There were five of us, Mother and Father and two other people, a man and a woman. Father was on my right, around the corner from me, and to my left was this other middle-aged man, and next to him was my mother, and next to her the other middle-aged woman. I was talking to this man on my left, but I overheard my father saying in a low voice to this woman next to him that he was very embarrassed about his daughter because of her poor eating manners. I woke up crying bitterly.
