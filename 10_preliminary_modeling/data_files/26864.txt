 I'm in the back end of a station wagon at home. My mom and my sister Ramona are there. I have a banana. I explain to them that ripening fruit gives off a gas called ethylene. That is why if you contain a fruit in a plastic bag the gas that collects in the bag will cause it to ripen faster than if it's in the open. I tell them that I just learned that fact.
