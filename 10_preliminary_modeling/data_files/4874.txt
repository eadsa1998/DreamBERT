I am in a house with visitors who are there for some meeting. I am the hostess and am walking around trying to keep everyone happy. I see some pieces of pie on plates and pick one up to take it back to the kitchen. It is a colorless sort of lemon meringue pie, and it falls off the plate. I get a Kleenex and try to wipe it up, and I keep seeing more spots of the pie on the floor like I had stepped in it and walked around leaving sticky footprints or blobs where I stepped. Even though I only had one Kleenex and I am worried it won't be enough to take care of the mess, it keeps becoming more Kleenex and I keep wiping up more messes. Some couple comes by and tells me to cancel their subscription to the counselor newsletter. I say OK but wonder why because it hasn't been up and running for months. Now some meeting is going one. Something important is being discussed. [NOTES: I had the TV on and news coverage was going on about the current crisis.]
