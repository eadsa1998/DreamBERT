I had a dream that it was the morning of the first day of school. I was going somewhere with a few of my friends from high school. I kept worrying about being late for my first class. Everytime I said something my friends would get angry and kept telling me not to worry and stay with them. Then it got to a point where something happened to where it was beyond all of our control to be able to get back to school in time. Then I woke up.
