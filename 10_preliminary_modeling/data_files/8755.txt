Danny [unknown] needed information about sleep disorders and didn't have much time to prepare for whatever it was he was preparing for. I told him I had a small manual from the last sleep conference I attended that might be useful to him. It would be a fairly quick read. He was happy to have me lend it to him. Shortly after I lent him the manual he did something that aggravated me, but more in a prankster kind of way. Someone told me he was taking shower and reading the manual as he showered. I went to the shower and quickly pulled back the shower curtain, taking him quite by surprise. He stood there silent and stunned. I grinned, grabbed the manual, and left. A few minutes later he was out of the shower and standing in front of me, still unclothed. We were only about a foot apart. There was a counter or table behind him. I started talking to him and as he did he leaned backwards until his back was almost resting on the table. My face was still only inches from his. I'm grinning the entire time I'm talking to him. I finally walk away.
