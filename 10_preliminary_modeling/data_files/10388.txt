Our son-in-law Joshua has moved much of our furniture to the back porch so we can have more room for our Christmas packages on Christmas morning. I am not pleased, but let it be. I cook everyone some eggs for breakfast and remember dropping one egg and having to clean it up. I am with a client and don't feel comfortable; it is as if "my words just hung there ungrounded."
