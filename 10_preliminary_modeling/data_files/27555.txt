I dreamt I was riding on a streetcar. A man got on the streetcar and sat down near me. He had an unusually long nose and I was fascinated by it. I simply stared at his nose until he rose to get off the streetcar. I was compelled to follow for some reason. I followed him for several blocks, but I lost him soon as it was dark. I remember nothing about the man except that he had a large nose.
