["Under the island."] I am with a group of people. We are a unit, like a soldiers unit. We are on an Island. Then we are under the island in a submarine. The enemy is bombing and we are going under the island to escape. I look up to see the flat under part of the land. Then the enemy gets us and we are trying to escape. We are outside the submarine almost tied to it's side. We hang on as best we can. We survive but it is a long ordeal.
