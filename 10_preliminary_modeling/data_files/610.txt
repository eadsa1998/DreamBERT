I am in a city and there is something about a TV show. I am driving on the highway and see a little old trailer and wonder why it is in such a nice neighborhood. I turn the TV on and realize this is like a movie set. On the TV a man and woman are arguing about her not cleaning up the place, which is clean. She is baking cookies with red jelly on top and they look good. I see the place again and need to go back but I am going too fast to turn around. I can't slow down. I then go backwards down the highway and nearly collide with another car and the people glare at me. Finally I get slowed down and begin to drive back to the trailer.
