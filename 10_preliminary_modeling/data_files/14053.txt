I was staying at this hotel place with Eugene. It was Tuesday. I went to this shop to check my downloads. There was a computer screen with a computerized woman on the screen who looked like Hilarie Burton. Then, Eugene, some others and I were outside in a carpark behind a tall shop. This helicopter had smoke coming out from it and crashed into the other side of the building. We ran to get away because the helicopter was still going crazy. Then I was in a building somewhere and I was filming with my phone. This guy there gave Orlando Bloom a room. This guy was in manhole in the floor and he went under to see this girl and then his chest and throat were being ripped apart by little hands. Then it was happening everywhere where there was a hole. These babies, or deformed monkeys, would tear you apart. I went to the shop where the computer was and there were lots of emergency vehicles on the road. I checked my downloads again. This hole nearby started opening. I ran outside and this guy in a beanie was there. We were trying to work out what to do.
