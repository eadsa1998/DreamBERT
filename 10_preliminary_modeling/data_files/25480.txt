 I'm going on a field trip. The bus is leaving from the back of Carter School, by the bouja kitchen. I run out to the bus, past my ex-girlfriend's father, Bill Thomas. He says hi and starts to talk in his friendly voice about mundane stuff. I keep running. He stops talking. The bus is like a metro bus, with a row of seats along the sides of the bus in back. I sit next to my roommate Stephen Ramos. The field trip might be for math class. The bus drives down the alley towards the playground. It is winter, and snow is all around. People are outside. The bus turns left and goes on the service road that runs along the railroad tracks.
