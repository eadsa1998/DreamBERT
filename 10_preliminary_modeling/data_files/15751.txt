Not sure what was going on properly, but I went back to London. I was with a group and we were split into two and given rooms. I wandered into one and someone said I'd picked the wrong one because the other room had a big comfy bed and this one had crappy bunks. Then, I was with Benjamin. We'd somehow been put into a group together and still hadn't spoken and were on friendly enough, but awkward terms. We had also slept together in the past. Our room was quite big and had a big fancy bed in the middle. We were lying on it and it was day time. I stared out the window and saw that Gherkin building and sighed. I wasn't sure what I was doing here, but was hoping that I'd be staying here this time. Benjamin and I were talking and giggling and it still felt weird, but a bit more comfortable. He was sitting up against the bedhead and I was sitting on the other side, with the blanket over my legs, but facing him. We kind of looked at each other at one point and he moved closer and started touching my leg. I fidgeted but let him and he got closer, moving his hand further up. I started to resist, but gave in and lay back and he got under the covers and on top of me and started kissing me.
