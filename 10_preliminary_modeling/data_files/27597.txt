I have a dim memory of having had a sentimental scene with a boy I have been dating off and on for some years. He's a chronic invalid, &amp; in the dream he was regretting that he could never plan on marriage, because he wanted to marry me. Then I was discussing it with my mother - we both felt very sad about it. I told mother that a man I work with had just proposed to me, &amp; I thought he was congenial &amp; would make a good husband, but was not physically attractive to me, so I refused him--it was rather embarrassing. I wondered if he might have aroused me if I had ever permitted him to make love to me, &amp; said to Mother, "But if you never try, how do you know?"
