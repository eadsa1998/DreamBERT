We were going to play ball. One of the choosers of teams said, "I will take Evans." He chose me as the first player. I told the kids he chose me because he had to choose me on one team and the other big fellow was chosen on the other team because you smaller boys would squawk if we two big ones were on one team. I was in a man's basement. I looked it over. It was quite narrow, but a long room. I went to another basement. It was a bank room. A fellow banker was giving instructions on how the safe was used. I was cooking a meal. I found an Indian head penny.
