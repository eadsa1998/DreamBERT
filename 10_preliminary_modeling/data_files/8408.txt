I was in the apartment getting ready to do a load of laundry. But I was doing it in the toilet in the downstairs bathroom. I had a very large load of permanent press clothing. I thought I could do it all in one load. I realized there was no way I was going to get it all in there at once so I started pulling some pieces back out. When I thought I had enough things out I flushed the toilet and it started pulling one piece of clothing down and then it started overflowing. I was quickly pulling clothes out one piece at a time and dropping them onto the floor where the water was overflowing to soak up the water and keep it from spreading out further. In just seconds the water was like 3 or more inches deep but it wasn't leaving the bathroom into the kitchen. I think I finally did get enough of the clothes pulled out to either soak up the water or to block it so it wouldn't go out into the kitchen.
