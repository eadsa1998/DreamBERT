It was a winter morning, and I was going to the university. Near the door of the university I found Sarah and Susie. We kissed to greet each other, as we usually do, and I was walking with them. I saw in the distance that a nun was coming with two girls. She had taught me in high school and the two girls were unknown to me. The nun was in the middle and in her hand she had a brown paper bag which had cookies inside, and they were eating them. I stopped to greet her, but she continued on her way without seeing anyone. I was surprised about her attitude and started to speak, and at that moment I awoke.
