 I'm at my friend Nat Miller's house. There are some chicken fingers there (the food). I go into the "old" room. I say every house has an old room. It has a green carpet and green sofa. My friend Fran Susse is there. I look at old photographs on the walls. They must be Nat's ancestors. There is quest music playing.
