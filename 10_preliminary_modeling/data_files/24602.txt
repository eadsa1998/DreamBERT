My teacher and I were in a room together. There was a man with a goatee standing near us. Then he sat down on a bed and started reading a bright orange book. "Le Trusty Leon" - the trusty horse was the title of the book. My teacher wanted to know how the book was, and the man said okay. My teacher said she might like to read it sometime. Setting: In a small brown room with a bed. Characters: The assistant music teacher at my school, and a man with a small beard. Feelings and Thoughts: Nothing. I was watching. I'm not sure. I just think it's unusual and in the title of the book I know Leon doesn't mean horse.
