I go into Aunt Elaine's house and get lost because she has remodeled, lots of kitchens one after the other. I come back to the original kitchen laughing and say I can't find the living room. They point and I go in. I see they have put color TV sets inside the two player pianos. There are four TV's on and nobody around to watch. I shake my head at such stupidity.
