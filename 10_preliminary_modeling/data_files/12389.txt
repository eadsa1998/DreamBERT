I was at school. Calvin was there, but he changed into Dmitri and he had cool hair. There was a brush. Then I was at a shop. Samantha was drawing pictures. Someone had power. The shop had stuff for free. There was a diary. They had The Thing. This guy and kid were in a car and stole stuff for educational purposes. There was something about an ear?
