There are two railroad tracks going in different directions. I'm being chased. I hide under a table, a big round one with a long table cloth that goes to the floor. There is a hole in the floor and I go in there and someone covers it and makes it look ordinary. The man chasing me is very suspicious and looks over carefully, but the camouflage works. I then start running very fast around and around under that huge table in order to exercise and build up speed, strength and endurance so I can escape. My helper warns me not to run so close to the table cloth because as I bump it, it will give me away my presence to the man chasing me. Finally I am in good shape and I am ready. The cloth goes up and I sprint out down a huge aisle where an audience of people is painted on the floor. I run and run and have to be careful not to mistake the real audience for the painted one.
