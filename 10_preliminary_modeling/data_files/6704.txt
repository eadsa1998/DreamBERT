I heard Mrs. S. scolding the children about climbing into the stream. I was on the toilet in the bathroom, had a Turkish towel spread over the seat, disgusted to find feces in it. Just then a girl came in. Noticed a big gap in the wall and said, "I can climb down through there." I said, "No you don't and don't you dare come in again without knocking." I take a ruler and tap her lightly across the buttocks once and thought, "MY, won't her mother be mad?"
