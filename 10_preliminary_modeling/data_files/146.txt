I'm in a small place, an apartment or motel room, where I'm staying with my mom and [somebody else - a brother or 2?]. A very abbreviated place, small rooms and flimsy fixtures, like the Motel 6 was. It has a kitchen. There's a telephone on the wall next to the kitchen. It hangs sideways and has a round earpiece and the mouthpiece is sort of the end of the metal rod that you hold. You can't prop it on your shoulder. Mom's not here. Somebody else comes in, a boy (we're all young here) with some clay figures to show us. He takes them out of plastic bags. He hands me a sort of rabbit-lady, and I quite like it, but it's still a bit soft and some of it comes apart in my hand. I'm afraid if I grasp it with my other hand I'll smush it. Or if I put it down. I feel terribly responsible for it. Nobody else is paying attention yet, he's showing others to my brother and I'm sitting there, very uncomfortable, and I would really like to get up and go do something else. Finally I get tired of waiting and I put it down. It does bend a bit but it's ok.
