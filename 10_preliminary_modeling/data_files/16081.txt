This is the morning after. I have to record this dream before it slips away. It is now firmly implanted in my head. First I dreamt that Josie and Marilyn and Dad and I were staying in a hotel, and I confronted Dad about canceling the Buxton House in the spring, and he actually felt bad about it. And he took us to this -- right when I confronted him, he was wearing this robe like judges wear -- and then we went to this park called Cumidy (sp?) Inn Park. And it was out towards Miramonte, or Josie said it looked like we were going to Miramonte. And when we got there, we didn't have to pay or anything; we just walked in. And we went up these stairs. Everything was in water up to our ankles. We were walking up this path and went up these stairs, and then we got in this pool and started swimming, and there were jets and vents, but I wasn't terribly concerned. And we walked, or we swam -- I swam right behind Dad, who whistled once in a while to help me echo locate him [laugh], and we pulled into this part of the pool that was under an overhang, and it got closer and closer and closer. The sides got closer and closer together until I had to get out and just crawl on the side. I couldn't swim any more, they were so close together. And then I realized that in this echoing overhang they were playing a tape of scary sounds and I mixed it, without a mixer [laugh]. How can you mix without a mixer? But anyway, after that I was just glad I could get down out of there, and Mom was saying she had to clean that pool area pretty soon. And then I woke up.
