I am in college and dating a black man. (I am white). He wants to marry me. I need to think it over. Most people are nice about this but one woman is nasty and one man is nasty. Someone makes a comparison to a Muslim parent. They say a Muslim parent can tell the hospital to kill their kids and that is okay. The black man is real tall and not good looking. Just nice. I wonder how to tell my parents. I don't think they will take it too badly. The black man has freckles. He also has initials for a name but I don't remember them. He proposes in a dorm. I think about a small wedding and maybe giving popcorn to everyone.
