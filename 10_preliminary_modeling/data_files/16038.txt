Sometimes it was me and sometimes it wasn't, but I had this room which was like a fully contained flat and it was connected to this backyard which was fenced in. I was thinking that it would be a good location for a zombie film and have it all be based in that room/yard with the character not seeing anything beyond the fence. Then it was night and I was standing at my door and suddenly sirens sounded off and there were these red flashing lights and the fences were all closed off and extended higher. I was confused and then this kind of medical team came running in and ran up to me to test me and there had been a zombie outbreak. I ended up leaving and was somewhere else. The zombies were fast and when you were infected you changed within seconds. I was with some other people and this lady got bit and I looked around for a weapon and stabbed her in the heart, which was difficult. Everyone screamed at me not to but she had already started changing when I killed her. There were a couple of guys I was interested in and I was wondering if I should make a move. A young Stephen Merchant was there (looking like he did in Extras) and I really wanted to get with him. Topher (Dollhouse) was also there and he had a crush on me and everyone knew but I wasn't that interested in him, though I thought he was ok and would go for him at a last resort. I was trying to get in the room to talk to Stephen Merchant but there was suddenly an emergency and we all had to run.
