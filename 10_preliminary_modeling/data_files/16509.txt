I was at some man's house, I think it was for some kind of a reception thing. And I don't even remember what we were supposed to talk about, but I was helping him set up a sound system and stuff. And we were in his like porch veranda thing, and he had this trellis-like type thing that had shelves and plants and stuff. And we were rigging up all these wires to go around it, and I stuck a lavaliere mikeup there and ran the wire around and dropped another _____ down from something. And I think we might have even set up some Christmas lights. And I don't remember who he was or why I was there, or what else I was setting up, and I just had it a minute ago. I shouldn't have gone to the bathroom before I started recording this. But another little scene thing that was before that, that's really clear in my mind, that I dreamt that Dad found out what a teetsy (?) thing is, which really that was something unreal from back in the day when I was real little, that was like a guitar-shaped, light-up flashlight thing that would play the end of "Have You Seen Her" and stuff. It was sort of a synesthetic (?) response to the sound that I heard. Well, fast forward 'til now. I dreamt that Dad thought that it was something that you would have to connect to the phone line in order to use, and that it would make your phone bill go real high if you did anything on it. And some boy had it, I think. And I was pretty upset and a little afraid because I was under the impression that it wasn't real, and here he's talking like it was real. And I tried to tell him it isn't real, but he said, "Well, I saw somebody that had one, so it is real." And I was terrified. And then I, in my dream I went downstairs after being, I don't know, up here, and Mom and Dad were watching TV and I kissed Mom good night and I whispered in her ear that she should come up when she can. And I think in my dream we stood around talking, but I don't remember what about. Then I woke up.
