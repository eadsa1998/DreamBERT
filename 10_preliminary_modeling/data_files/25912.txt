 There is an old woman in a workout room. I go through the crowded room carrying four unwrapped bars of soap. My classmate from Brimson Jim Miller and his buddy come in acting exhausted, like they're recovering from a trip. The old woman says the room closes in five minutes. I say five minutes is all I need. I start doing my back exercises. My left ankle is sore. I am in a different room. My classmate from Brimson Eric Dole puts a present box in the hallway. It is a gag box of jokes: it itself is a joke. Someone drops a big box of Styrofoam peanuts out from above. Eric complains to the president of the college that he is ill. This is his ploy to draw attention away from himself concerning the gag gift. People all know it is Eric's ploy. Everyone knows except the president.
