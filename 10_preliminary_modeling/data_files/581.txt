I am investigating a case with a Jim, a male friend. WE are at a restaurant in a house. I see the wanted man once but no more. After dinner I ask Jim if we can go to dinner again to look some more. He says yes. I say I will pay for my dinner. He is waiting outside but I can't get out. He has a nice, long car. I have an ordinary car. My purse is mixed up with another woman's and at first I have more money than is mine and think someone gave me more money. Then some people block my way to the exit. Then I forget my purse again, but don't realize it until I am outside. I have a long crooked steps to climb to get back into the restaurant and I wonder if I can make it up and if Jim will wait.
