 I'm at a casino. The Indian man at the bakery that I work at is playing blackjack. He doubles down when he has a 15 and the dealer is showing a seven. The dealer busts with two 10's and two 7's. The guy wins. The dealer initially had trouble counting the right number of chips so the man could double down, and then had trouble after he busted; was not sure about he payoff. The pit boss comes and shoves the chips at the Indian man. My teammates Tony Kramer and others from Armstrong High School basketball are there. We are standing around. I am sitting. A few guys from Rival High School walk by, including Al Tall, who is a guy I often played against. We say hi. There is a big sign up explaining the rules to this special kind of Black Jack. The player gets incentives: if he gets dealt blackjack with a jack of clubs or a green queen it is something special. I am going to sit down with the Indian man and play. The dealer looks at me weird, and may be trying to tell me that I wouldn't or couldn't win.
