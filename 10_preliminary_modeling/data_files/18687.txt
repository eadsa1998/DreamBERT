Nick invited me to his wedding. He was getting married in the water like being baptized in the ocean. He was marrying a girl named Claire. Really she was 2 girls named Claire smashed into one. I was standing on a hill watching the practice run they were filming. I was confused. It looked like a baptism to me, except for the sailing crew operating a bunch of pulleys underwater. I didn't have time to go to the wedding. Alan was on a TV news talk show. They edited the interview with him so he was just saying a string of pronouns. "I you me she you she me it." Then it didn't seem at all like Alan. I was sitting on a table with a green background and tiny white stripes--dotted (teeny circles) like a tick tack toe board--stripes about 1/2 inch apart, maybe 1/2 and about 2" long or 3". I smeared the dotted stripes with my hand and made them go different directions and they were beautiful--laminated under the table top for ever and ever. An Asian girl named Malaysia was watching. She said it was beautiful. She asked how'd I do that under the lamination. I didn't know. It just happened. I had 2 sweaters hanging from the ceiling. A me-sized sweater and a kid-sized sweater.
