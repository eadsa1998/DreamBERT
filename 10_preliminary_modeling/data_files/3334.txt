I am on a boat. I will be traveling for several weeks. I left a place of                                                                                                                                                                                  danger and change. I ask the Captain where my room is. He gives me a number and I walk down narrow halls looking for the room. I open one door and see the back of someone's head. Nope, not my room. I keep walking. The boat is old and wooden. The paint is chipped and peeling. I find my room. It is filled with a couple of old junky metal beds, twin size, and an ugly purple overstuffed chair. Boxes of stuff are laying around, crowded and junky. I start to clean it up. I am sorting piles of papers and so on. I decide to go to the storeroom or the ship's library to get other nicer furniture. I go in and see shelves of video movies. I decide I could watch a movie a day with all this selection. I go back toward the room. Now a man like Chevy Chase likes me. I am attracted to him. I am laying on a berth in a room and I motion to him to come up and join me. He is standing next to a black man and the black man looks confused about whether I signaled for him or for Chevy. I do these elaborate signals to confirm it is Chevy I want. I want to make love to him. Even though we are in a room with other people around and would be exposed.
