There is a big celebration at the Retreat Center. An artist makes beautiful paintings,; murals etc. She get a certificate that she is a Christian, but she is afraid that the devil will come to take her to hell. I pray with all that is within me, wringing my hands. I believe that the devil will come in the form of cats. Just then a friend from M. City arrives with a litter of 4 kittens. I am quite relieved when I recognize my friend and that it is not the devil in disguise. Happy. We play with kittens.
