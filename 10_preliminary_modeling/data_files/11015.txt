With some friends, we decide to take a boat trip on a river. We spend the night at the house of two girls, reading wonderful children's books instead of sleeping. The next morning everything is happening many centuries ago and seems as unreal and beautiful as in the books. We are in the 15th century. Our clothes and the boat are those of the century and the river is in the middle of a town which looks like Venice. Then we want to stop and land for a few minutes (to buy books), but when we want to go back to our boat, we cannot, and find that we are surrounded by golden chairs. The building we are in looks like a bank and is made out of yellow and brown marble. But along the building, instead of a street, is the river. Some of our group stayed in the boat, and we are worried about this.
