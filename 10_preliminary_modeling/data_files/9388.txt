E.C. (a popular psych teacher) is conducting a new class in psychology to a very large group of students; they hang on her words as she walks about and through the rows of seats. I am an observer and sit in various seats. She is radiant with a new hairdo. She ends the lecture with a simple prayer. She holds a cross in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other and asks that we all may learn to understand Jesus' teachings better. Silence. Then students crowd around her and I walk away with her, feeling very elated.
