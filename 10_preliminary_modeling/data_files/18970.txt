In this dream I was a radio announcer or some type of public speaker. I remember the momentous news I had to tell everybody was that the new Evinrude outboard motors had just been introduced, and that this new engine was really going to be something this year. And I was using as a comparison the best type of engine ever made, an old Packard engine, saying this was what all the rest of the engine makers were trying to come up to, Packard standard, something that they made, say, back in 1938 or something. But this new Evinrude that's coming out is supposed to be equal to, if not better than, the old Packard engine.
