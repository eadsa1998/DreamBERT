 My boat has new boat seats. They are green plastic, and they look a bit hard, but nonetheless they are nice. They don't have backs, but are just the seat area. They're not high up like seats in a bass boat: they're low to the boat. My dad must have gotten around to these boat seats sooner than he thought.
