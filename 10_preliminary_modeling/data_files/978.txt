I sitting in a pickup truck on the passenger side. I park near a side walk. Lots of people are parking around me, like we're camping together. A man is angry at me because he parked in that spot before. Then a Japanese man hops in and says he'll help me and now I'm being driven in their station wagon to another spot and I will be with their family, wife, and kids. I don't like that. I want to be alone for awhile. I hesitate and then say, "I'm sorry but could you drive me back to that spot where I was, before someone else gets it. It's important for me to be alone." They look annoyed, but comply. I assure them I'll be all right. I can sleep on the seat if I get tired and the kids can be in the back if they want. The angry young man walks by with his nose in the air. He makes a snide remark. I make a sarcastic remark back. He's angry at me for wanting to be alone. He's like Ashton at uni house.
