On Sunday night I was trying to go to sleep and when I closed my eyes everything was small in my room. Then when I opened my eyes, it was back to normal. I didn't think anything of it, closed my eyes, and fell asleep. I had a dream that everything was bigger than me. The dream took place in a big, dark warehouse. Inside was just me and this other girl. The girl was as huge as the marshmallow man on ghostbusters, but was wearing clothes like Raggedy Ann. She would roll big tires at me, and I would have to dodge them. That's all that happened. Then I woke up in a sweat.
