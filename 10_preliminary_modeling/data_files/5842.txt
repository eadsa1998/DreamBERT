[1997-06-25] We were getting ready for my daughter's wedding and we were setting up chairs. The dream was short, it was mainly going out and borrowing chairs and tables from all our friends and relatives. And I could feel the chairs, some were made out of wood, some were metal folding chairs, some were plastic and the thing that bothered me was somebody told me the chairs didn't match. Their colors didn't match and some were made out of wood some made out of metal and plastic and I remember running around trying to find a matched bunch of chairs and while we were unloading them, that's when I woke up.
