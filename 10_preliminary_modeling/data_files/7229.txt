Mrs. Lan would take me. I go to her room but the door is closed and there is no answer. I come back again but she's gone. ...Showing off my long shoehorn ...At a Chinese restaurant with two women. Waiter comes. Neither want rice but I do and I say so but the waiter has gone leaving a bowl with one grain of rice in it. Why don't they bring us something to eat.
