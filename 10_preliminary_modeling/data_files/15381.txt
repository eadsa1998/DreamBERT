Mom and I were near a busy road. Spaceman kept wandering around and we had to run to catch him. He was near the edge of the road and a bus drove over his head and paws but it didn't kill him. He was limping and acting a bit odd. We took him to the vet and they said he might not make it and I was angry at Mom for leaving him and I was upset. There was a British Mission Impossible movie except it was called The Thing and it started off silent. It was made in 1974 and John Cleese, Michael Palin and Courteney Cox were in it. A goth/punk girl and two friends went into this person's house. The lady was asleep was on the lounge. They were just sneaking around, but the lady woke up and saw the girl. She knew she would tell her 'supervisor' and so she ran outside and stabbed her with a metal star knife thing, but everyone saw. She got into pretty big trouble and I thought it was silly because it wasn't really her fault.
