["Volunteering in a book shop."] I am in a beautiful book shop. They are very busy, with a long line of customers at the counter. I ask the woman owner if I can help out as a volunteer, because it would be fun. She agrees. She is sitting at a table in the cafe part of the shop. I go to the counter and customers step up with requests. I handle them well, enjoying working with books. I am asked to do a search for titles and am writing the numbers down on a request paper. The feeling in the shop is one of busy friendly enjoyment.
