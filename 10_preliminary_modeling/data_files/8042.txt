Staying in a hotel by the ocean in a bad part of town. I was there with Matthew. We were talking about me looking for a job and what we could do and things such as this. I thought it was a dream and then said, Oh, it's not a dream. This is great. It was not a very safe part of town. I wanted Matthew to be very careful. It was the type of hotel that people normally live in for short periods of time. They had kitchens, sitting rooms, etc. I decided to go out but I don't recall why. Once I got outside I wasn't sure which direction to head so I just started walking. A Young mother with a baby in stroller and another child passed me. I decided to stop her and ask her for directions. She directed me to walk up this steep hill and reminded me that this was not the safest part of town and that I should be careful. As I was walking up this steep hill I came to a church. It was very interesting looking. Nothing at all like any church I've ever seen nor would I have imagined it to be a church. I went up the three flights of stairs to the entry. The entry was a small square opening. In waking life no one, not even a child, could fit through it. Yet, somehow I entered through that small square opening. There was a reception or something going on in the church. I met Robin Williams and his wife. They were an elderly couple. We hit it off and they invited me to come home with them. I did so and called Matthew. He joined us there. Robin was very distraught. I think they were both tired of living. They want to die. They tried to kill themselves along with two children in a small square pool inside their hotel room. I found them in time to save them. They were not pleased, as they really wanted to die. There was something else about going through personnel files in an office.
