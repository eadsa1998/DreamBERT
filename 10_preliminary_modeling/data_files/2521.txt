There are long hallways and corridors that all keep going down. I don't want to go, but am drawn. I go down long stairs that curve, feeling scared. I enter a room that is luxurious, a waiting lobby before you enter the Prince's room. A woman is there and the Prince rejects her. I am hiding behind a curtain, watching, and he sees me and I come out. We talk. He seems to like me.
