I was sitting on huge rocks which formed a breakwater. It surrounded a small body of water. There seemed to be several people sitting on this breakwater with me watching fish which looked a little like seals jumping around in the water. Everyone was afraid to walk across the water because these seals could bite so hard they could kill a person. However, they wouldn't bother you if you stood still. All the people had their legs tucked under them and were on the rocks. I decided to walk across the water. When I did, not one seal bothered me. But as I returned to the breakwater rock and stopped for a moment, they started to jump at me.
