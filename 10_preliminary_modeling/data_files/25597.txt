 I'm with my friends Niles Zelling and Tom Napper in a car. Tom says tickets to the Red Hot Chili Peppers are only $2. We're outside an old brick building. There is a radio station in the basement on the left side of the building. My classmate from Brimson Al Gurney is there. Niles tells us that he should have said or done something. We're in my mom's station wagon. I wipe fog off the inside of the windshield with a shirt.
