A city guy had been learning to chop wood and needed lots of practice. He started on chopping lumber strips. Then boards. Then thin, thin logs without bark. Sawdust was ground into the ice and I was laying a fire with the wood scraps and newspapers in the center of the ice for when we got cold and needed to warm up. The ice broke and part of me knew if I stepped frontward even more ice would break and everyone would drown in hypothermia water. The safest thing was to let the ice break and my father swam under the ice like an otter (seal) and I wasn't afraid to let him know I needed help. Then he was cold and I wasn't and we did the backstroke down Chestnut Street and it felt like I was skating. We were going to ride horses and needed to get a halter and I realized I needed a construction vest to work the halter. I found one I liked too. They were different shades of yellow . ??? Pre-washable, a horse harness.
