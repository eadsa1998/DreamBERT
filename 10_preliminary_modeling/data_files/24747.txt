I was at a place where I always go camping. But now there was a building with sports equipment in it. Everybody was trying to swim up stream holding onto a log. Setting: Camping area with river. Characters: Swimming experts. Friend's dad. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. When I woke up, I thought it was pretty silly to try to swim upstream holding onto a log.
