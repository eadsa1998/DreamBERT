I went to an amusement park place with Dad, Ezra, Farrah and Valerie. We weren't allowed to leave. We were shot at and caught by the president of the park. We escaped and drove the car through some water, which was hard. There were pieces of paper with people on them flying around. There were chickens running around in the water.
