I was at 15 and H Sts. in my car. It was snowing slightly. Marion Ferrell, a tall, graceful girl dressed in rough skirt of khaki, over which was a blue overcoat, crossed the street and then removed blue overcoat and shook all the snow from it, the color being impermanent. Some other people across street were in outlandish costumes. These people wait on curb until stop-go signal is green, then they all cross.
