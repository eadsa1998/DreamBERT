I am in a cabin way up in the mountains. I love it there, alone and with all the free time in the universe to think and write. Charla comes to visit and very much wants to stay with me. I love her company but it is time for her to go back to town, with a woman who I know (but only in the dream). I love her and I want my alone time. She clings to me, hugging me ferociously, pleading. I try to soothe her, reminding her we will be together again. She cries as I walk her to the car. I am holding her in my arms and she is clasping me with both arms and legs. I put her in the back of the station wagon car with lots of other things. Now a man (like Claude) loves me. We've had time together and now he must go back to town for the week. He kisses and hugs passionately. I love it, but I also want my alone time. He says, "It's always me that wants it more. You want it, but can let go of it." I sympathize with him intensely, but still know for a certainty it is time for him to go. It is wildly snowing outside, the wind is blowing violently. I caution him to be careful and not get stuck in the snow drift. He does not want to leave. I return to the cabin. There are women in there, talking. I sit apart from them on a couch. (chaise lounge kind of thing). There is some discussion of lesbianism, but I am not attached. Later, I look out at the wilderness. I love it here and there is some concern that a bad man might be out there and I could be in danger. I am not overly concerned, I just notice the possibility. The good man (Claude) is back and we are saying goodbye again, hugging and kissing and murmuring endearments. It feels so good and I feel sorry for him and think of sneaking up on him in the laundry room and making wild passionate love before he has to go. He'd really like it that I initiated it.
