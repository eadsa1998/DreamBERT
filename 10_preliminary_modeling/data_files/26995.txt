I dreamt I was looking through a beautifully illustrated magazine. The pictures were so nice that I wanted to cut them out and save them. My husband came along, and saw me start to cut the photos. He said what a shame it would be to ruin the magazine. For a long time I struggled with myself as to whether I should or shouldn't tear the magazine apart.
