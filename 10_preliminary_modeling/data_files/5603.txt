[1997-05-31] I dreamt that Mort and I had a child. A little girl. We were out shopping somewhere and someone was home here, taking care of our baby. I don't know the baby's name because I woke up before they could tell me, but evidently, I must have just come out of the hospital because everybody was congratulating us over just becoming parents, everything like that. I couldn't understand, but they were giving us a party and everything, probably a late baby shower because the baby came a little early, just like we did!.
