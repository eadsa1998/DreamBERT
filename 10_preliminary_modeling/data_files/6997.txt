It is four o'clock and I start home from the university but I haven't selected my books so I ask a student if the library is still open. One says, "yes" another, "no." Remember it is in another building. Go there but find the stairway barred but climb over. Room upstairs is under repair but it is the library for books are on some shelves and others piled up on long tables. A man is washing a large canvas in a big tub.
