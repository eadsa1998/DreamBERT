I was at university. There was a big lecture in a small room. There was a canteen outside with hot dogs with weird curly cheese. I asked "how much are they?" and they said "$2.50 and 25c". I found a door that lead to the carpark and there were a few cars, but mine wasn't there. There were three carparks. I ran to another one on the other side of the university and it was book and ocean themed? My car wasn't there either. I went to the last one and found it, but there was no licence plate on the back. It was near a cemetery. I called Mom, but she said she couldn't find the plate.
