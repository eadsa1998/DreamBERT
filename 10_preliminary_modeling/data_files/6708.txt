Looking for someone. Rang the bell upstairs. Wanted #19 but from the pencil scrawls on the door couldn't make out how to ring for that number. Hearing voices within, called to ask how to ring for #19. Girl who opened the door told me I had to put money in the slot before I could get a number. I asked, "How much?" She said, "I think 25 cents." She let me in through their apartment. There were 2 or 3 other girls there. I think I was looking for J. Davis.
