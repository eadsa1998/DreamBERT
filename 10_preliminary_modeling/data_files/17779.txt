I was on the docks with some people.  There was a mechanism like a sort of moving platform that went alongside the dock in front of each of a bunch of doors.  I figured out how to work the platform pretty quickly, and took it down to a length of doors after a left turn on the dock.  I went into the front right door.  It felt like evil was looming.  All the places looked pretty dingy and old.  Somehow we figured out that doing what we'd done there to every front right room in each hall would help deter the evil.  I remember something about licking the doorway.  Towards the end, the evil was much stronger, fighting back.  I think someone in our group got hurt.  There was a narrow escape through a side door, and then we were in a big room.  It seemed like Christmas.  There was a lot of candy around, and I got a large box full of candy canes. Some were extra long, about a foot.  Then there was an interruption and people left.  There was an attraction between me and one of the guys in the group, but before we started making out, a girl came in and pushed the guy out.  She was very domineering and started making out with me, pushing me into a dark room with windows and lots of chairs, sort of like a conference room.  I lay down on the floor and she was on top of me, kissing me.  She had me very turned on.  Through the windows, though, I saw chaos- people running, and there was a fire.  But the girl didn't seem to care when I tried to tell her, she just continued kissing me.  I think someone came in and got us up.  We went outside, where it was dark, then.  I found a box of candy- almonds, See's, and chocolate rabbits, but I couldn't find my candy.  I didn't remember what it was, but I referred to it by a specific name.  Someone came over and pulled it out of a box in the corner.
