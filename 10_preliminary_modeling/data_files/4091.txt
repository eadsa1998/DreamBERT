["Bathing In Love"]  I am at the home of an Native American family. I am tired. They decide to give me a bath. The entire family, including a young man who is attracted to me. They assist me taking off my clothes and ease me into a bathtub. They open a set of warming towels for me to lean against in the bath. They are large and the ends get wet. I try to get the towels pulled up above the water. They help me. They invite me to pour in a few drops of scented lotions. A floating device is a waterproof light bulb. I pick it up and examine it. I am trying to turn it on. There are two small bulbs, one white, the other yellow. An elder man of the tribe gives me a small handmade book. I open it. It is handwritten. It is bound in beautiful buckskin. He made it himself. I am touched and impressed he wrote an important story for me by hand. Now the bath is over and I am dressed, in another room. A young native american woman is talking about how she loves chinese things. I see she is wearing black and red clothes with chinese designs. I tell myself to remember to buy her a gift of something chinese. Bonnie comes in. We are chatting about a trip we once planned on taking. I speak in spanish. We can't remember precisely where we had planned to go. I think it was down to the tip of Mexico and then I joke, "Totas las piases." We laugh. I feel too warm with all the clothes I have on, and I change clothes.
