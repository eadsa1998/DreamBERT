A pilot friend has died and I am going to the airport for his memorial. I'm supposed to get film to someone regarding his death. My Avon lady is a pilot and my son is a passenger in her plane. For some reason the plane must be started before I deliver the film. My instructions are to run up to the plane and hand them the film at takeoff. They leave and I forget. When I remember again it is too late. I can't find them. I am in one part of the airport and find My husband and a woman in a booth, like a restaurant booth. Both of them are sitting on the same side. I try to explain what happened and they aren't angry but they aren't interested in the explanation.
