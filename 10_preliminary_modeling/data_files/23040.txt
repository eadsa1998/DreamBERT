I climbed up a very steeply inclined yard-just far enough away from 90 degrees that it could be climbed.  I don't know why I climbed it, but it was very scary coming down.  I made it, though, and when I looked up to the top I saw Trish Roothe starting to come down.  Someone else at the bottom with me foretold somehow that she would fall, when only 10 inches from the bottom, and be killed.  I was horrified and couldn't figure out how such a short fall could kill her.  Then a thought suddenly struck me:  Though I believed the guy's prophecy (who knows why.) , I realized that we could thwart its fulfillment simply by catching her when she fell.  It was a weird feeling to think that we would thus somehow alter what was destined to be in the future.
