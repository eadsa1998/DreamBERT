A flying dream. Sometimes it was easy to get up and soar. Other times, it was a real struggle. I was in a large department store. I had to fly above florescent lights and under wires. It was a struggle. Then, Bonnie and I visit a woman. She brings out her old maternity clothes for Bonnie to try on. We both say, "Oh, how cute!" I say, "...But it's not my style, thank goodness." It's tailored, peter pan collar, pleated skirt, and brown. I look at myself and remember what it was like to be pregnant and I'm relieved I'm not. I then fly again. I'm in a grocery store. I pick out bananas and other things. I look around for a store clerk. I ask Cory if he snuck some ham before he went to chicken. He said, "Yes." I start to. I'm afraid I'll get caught but I don't have enough money to buy all the food I need.
