 I enter a building like the Big Electric Company building in Wilmerton. One needs access to the large metal door, and I get in. Inside there are some couches, paints, and things that I think will need to be separated or grouped. My friend Sherman Andrews is there. He runs and jumps up on a couch, putting his feet up on the back of the couch where one would lean back. He leaves footprints of splattered paint on the couch. Another person splatters paint footprints on the couch. A person I know from Brimson, Alec Johnson, is there. He and I cover a couch up with a blanket. First, he leads this and places the blanket the narrow way, exposing the ends of the couch. I say that we should turn the blanket. When we do, it covers more of the couch.
