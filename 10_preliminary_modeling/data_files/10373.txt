Visiting an Episcopal Church, sitting in the front row on wooden pews and hearing about a woman saint who brought together huge crowds by her simple teaching; her symbol was a PINK HALO, shaped like a key, and we all hold pink paper haloes as a remembrance. I walk out with a minister and we talk about this saint; warm goobye hug.
