Joshua Jackson was complaining about Peter (Fringe) being lame. I was going through some stuff and found a crunchy snake lolly and threw it away. Mom picked me up. There were toys on the road which I put there to sort out. To get back 'home', I had to climb up these stairs which were held together by some teenager's bubblegum. There was a pretty girl there called Izzy. The teenagers were sitting on the set of stairs I needed to pull down so I waited. Walter (Fringe) scanned something that was 1800lbs (which equaled 80kg) to work out something about me. This boy got bit by a vampire but the process was different. There was only like one vampire in the world. I bought this game and you go from town to town doing puzzles and helping the citizens, etc. Ezra and I were driving and we went through a red light. I said I wasn't going to do this again and that I needed Mom with me.
