Dreamt that I was in Bond's store returning a tie which I had purchased and then discovered a flaw in it. It was the only tie of its kind in the store. Though there were several hundred other ties there, I couldn't find one that I liked. So the salesman said that they would send to Rochester and have one made for me out of a perfect piece of goods.
