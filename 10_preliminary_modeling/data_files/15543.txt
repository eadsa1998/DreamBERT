While we were in London, we decided to go visit Leif in his country. Soccer or something was on, and they gave me a Macedonian scarf to wear for it. I couldn't work out how to put it on and I said I've never worn a scarf. They said I didn't have to wear it if I didn't want to and I said I would, but I'd prefer a local one, so they gave me one. Leif and I went to see Klovn, but it was a different movie to his one. It was in English as well and Aidan Gillen was in it. It was based on something that had happened in Leif's part of the world. There was a celebration thing and then afterwards this room had been trashed - monitors had been scratched on, smashed etc. It was based on some kids who had died. Eugene was there in the cinema. He was from a Scottish background. I thought that was weird.
