I was having some pretty interesting dreams last night. First of all I dreamt that Mom &amp; I were riding bikes, and we were going down to the beach. And there was some kind of festival with a lot of music going on at the Scenic Point or Becker Park or something like that. . We were walking along the shore and we were swimming in the water, we were walking along, even when we were walking along the waterfront, and apparently there was some place where we could get down by the water to swim. And I was saying we should go over a little bit closer to where the festival was so that we could still hear the music. And we had some kind of picnic, and I'm trying to remember, I think before that we were at some kind of show and there were these girls in all these pink dresses and they were like singing or dancing or something. And Dad was there, and I think Mr. Dawson was there, and Mom was there. And we were all going to go to a park or something, and I just ______, "Oh that's so boring and so ___________ always do that. I don't want to do that again." And that's when Mom and I went to the beach. I was thinking how going to the beach with Dad would be so very boring, but with just Mom &amp; I, it was pretty fun. In this dream, the weather was very nice, too.  Then I can't remember any songs that I really recognized, but they were playing, like, oldies songs.
