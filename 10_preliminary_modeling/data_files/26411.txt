 I'm alone in a dark room that seems to be my bedroom at the Whitman house. I have a flyswatter handle inserted into my anus. I probe the handle for stimulation. At one point, I insert the handle so far that I feel it poking out on the inside of my right thigh. I am lying down, and then sit up to turn the light on. I flip the light switch, and a second switch next to it, but both light bulbs must be out. I find another switch lower on the wall and flip it, but that bulb doesn't work either. I have a huge erection: about 2 feet long, and rock hard. I grab it with both hands and bend it slightly towards me and suck it hard. I can detect the pulsating action that an erection has: how the ejaculate emerges in spurts. I can't give myself fellatio as well as others have given me fellatio. My erection is a big, hard, rigid object. I suck it roughly and forcefully, and feel my teeth bump into it. I try to deep-throat my erection. I want to ejaculate. The fellatio is pleasurable, but I don't feel close to ejaculating.
