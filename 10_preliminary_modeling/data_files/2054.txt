I am going to look over Howard' house to decide if I'll buy it. A man shows me the basement first. There are pipes that have liquid running in them and they are for heating. They are noisy and brightly lit. I think, "I'd change that." I see the man's room and servant's quarter. The bed is tiny and fills the whole tiny room. The walls are slanted like in an attic and I think, "How uncomfortable! Stingy Howard." We go up to the main living quarters. Now Howard's first wife (like his mother) follows us around. She's uppity and doesn't like me. The rooms are spacious and rich. I am in awe, particularly the kitchen! It goes on forever, sinks and preparation areas and more sinks and stoves and refrigerators. I step up to one sink and a conveyor belt moves, under my feet. I nearly fall over. Dovre says, "Be careful, that sink looks too complicated and sophisticated." I see a plainer sink and feel relief. I see a door that opens to a restaurant's kitchen. Howard bought it from them. A man comes in; he's the owner of the restaurant and wants the kitchen back. I feel a strong desire to have this house and feel afraid he'll get it and I won't. Howard says to him, "I haven't decided who will get the house. Maybe I will sell it to you." I turn away, hoping passionately I'll get it, but I don't want Howard to know it matters to me. I'd longed for a ritzy place like this and now can almost afford it. Now I get on an airplane, a small, private one. My father is piloting. We are going to see the house in his home state. All of a sudden we tip up and pull high into the sky. I see we had a fender bender with another plane. I get nervous because my father's driving like it's a car and doesn't have flight experience. I tell him, "We should call in a flight plan and get an assigned altitude." We arrive at the lovely rich house in Howard's home state. It's at 8200 feet and I wonder if I'll have trouble breathing at that altitude. I seem to be fine.
