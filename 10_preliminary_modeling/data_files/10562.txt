I am walking along and see Marissa Camden (died '91) coming toward me; I walk up to her: she looks happy, healthy, tanned and friendly. I tell her how glad I am to see her and kiss her hand. We walk together. She tells me she has been in New York at Art Colony run by BEVERLY (her daughter-in-law, who will be giving the keynote address at Nat'l Day of Prayer). She gives me all the info I need to go to that colony and suddenly I am in an ART STUDIO where Father Andrew is painting many small canvasses, boat scenes. He is busy painting, so I wait to tell him how good his reflections of the boat in the water are. (CF. WW painting) But before I can tell him, he climbs up a steep LADDER to a Loft to be with someone who needs help. While I wait, two young BOYS come along and start throwing the brushes around and threatening to smear Father Andrew's painting. I get so angry, I slap the boy and order him to pick up the brushes; he gets sassy so I bend down and help him pick them up. I say "You know, Father Andrew is such a saintly man, he would not have wanted me to slap your face." The boys are contrite and leave. Father Andrew comes down from the ladder and has to leave, but he promises to talk some more about the painting. (++ feeling, vivid)
