We were at Tesar's home. All at once one of his cabinets started to fall apart. I pushed it in place, but it was built of pieces and it fell apart again and I let it go because I couldn't do anything with it. There were a lot of men learning to be firemen. Tesar came over and he took one small hole with a damper on it and took off the damper and made a draft which got the fire burning. He then put some coal on it and he had a good fire going.
