Two or three other persons and I are supposed to receive cars.  Willard Furst is there to unwrap them.  (They are all enclosed tightly in a cover like a bass fiddle cover.)  He finally gets one open, and inside is a beautiful grey 1958 Pontiac convertible.  I can't wait to get mine, but I wake up before my turn comes.
