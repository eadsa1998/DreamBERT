It was election day. I stopped at Pauline Lenarcic's rooms. Her sister was there and Pauline seemed to be angry at me. She threw a few remarks at me, but I stayed and took off my clothes to my underwear and lay on one of the beds. Her sister came over and played with me. I went down to the election meeting and I parked my car near some beds. My sister Mary was passing out drinks. Steve gave me a highball with water. The water seemed to steam a little as he poured the whiskey into the water. I was then hanging out some sort of election returns on a clothesline. We Democrats won. Bob and I were in the country in a field hunting. We came to a walnut tree and I found a sack and was putting nuts into the sack. The nuts were big. I put them into the sack. I heard the bird squawks in the country or their songs. I broke a table. I tried to pull the legs together, but it wouldn't give, so I sat or jumped or bounced on it with my rear and it finally crashed in. I was saying, "Big crash, a big horse should win." I saw 6-8. I was supposed to go to a wedding reception.
