I'm under the control of a couple of guys, one blonde, one dark-haired. The blonde is in charge, more or less but the other is his henchman. [I don't know what they want with me but I've been their prisoner not very long, in a house.] They don't have weapons but think I can't resist them. I get hold of a long square stick/pole and brain the darker one with it - he didn't think I could do it and all but laughed at me. It was kind of fun and I sort of want to hit him again but I need to get out before he wakes up. The blonde guy comes with me. We get in a car, back seat, somebody else driving.
