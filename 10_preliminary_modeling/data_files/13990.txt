I was out the front of home and there were lots of kittens near the garage. I was trying to put them in the garage, but there were so many and they kept getting out. I started putting them in boxes instead. This guy was there and I said "damn, an adult is left". He reminded me of REM for some reason and then later I found something with Everybody Hurts on it. We got all the kittens in the garage, but I had to leave. In case he closed the shutters and took over the place I was hesitant to leave. Eventually I said "you promise" and he agreed and I left to get water and a light. When I came back he had closed them. I opened the bottom of one of them and he popped his head out and I aimed and squirted water in his face and said that I'd shoot his kittens, but he had a gun and shot them himself. The kittens ended up letting me in. Light was shining in my face. The kittens were now people and they killed him. I told the kittens not to go near the pool. Then I was watching a movie and Jason Bateman was in it and he was keeping zombies in his garage. All the zombies were kids or teenagers and they were just like people. His garage was fancy and looked like a house. He had a bed in there and these two zombies (girl and a guy) were on a couch under a blanket. Jason Bateman's character's father said "is that the guy-," and saw the girl zombie pop her head out. And he said something like "you and that girl". I liked the way the garage had transformed and so liked the movie.
