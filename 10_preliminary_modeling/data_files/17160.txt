I dreamt that my "mother," whomever she was (not actually my mom) was not really sane.  We were staying at some community house/shelter.  She took the toaster with her into the bath and electrocuted herself.  A woman entered after her, unknowing.  She shared my "mother"'s fate.  There were four stalls.  I tried to keep a young boy from entering, and took him 'home' to his family's section/tent/stall (like train sleeping cars) of the building.  It was hard to find where he was staying.  The police said my "mother" ended up like hamburger.  I was still in panic more than I ever started to cry over her death.
