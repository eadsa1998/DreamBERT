 I'm with my friend Fiona Ulness, a man my age, and a flight instructor. We're going to fly a small plane. We stand behind it and run with it. When we reach a certain point the instructor flips a switch and the cockpit opens. The two people running in front get in the cockpit as the people in the rear continue to run along the back of the plane. When the front two people are in the plane, then the back two get in. The plane then takes off. All this happens over a very short distance, in tight areas where the plane is being steered through trees and buildings. I'm on the front left side of the plane. We begin to run and Fiona hops in. I climb up to get in but have trouble and see an ominous pillar in front of us that is just at my level, stretched across the makeshift runway. I hop up onto the pillar as we get near it, and the plane goes underneath it. The flight instructor looks back and sees me standing atop the pillar. He gives me a look as if I should have hopped down the other side of the pillar and landed in the plane as it came out from underneath the pillar. But, the plane is turned around and we try again. It's later. I'm in a room with the people I flew with. We have won one of the plane races, maybe because others let us win. It was our first race attempt that we won. I'm happy enough with this. I think we should all take a photograph. Everyone is wearing yellow and blue rain jackets. One of the men is cooking a pot roast in a microwave oven, which is actually an oven. There are fixings with the roast. The man seems like Mick from the university caving club.
