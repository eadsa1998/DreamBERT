I am a doctor/physical therapist and work with children. I am loving and touch their faces in a loving way and this is their therapy. Now I have to go to a staff meeting or conference and I am very annoyed because this takes up my time from my patients. I find the room and go through the double doors and see a table where three or four doctors (male) are already seated. I choose to sit away from them at the nearest end to the speakers. If I have to be there, I want to be most efficient and not waste time. The head doctor at the speakers' table is Capt. Kirk and as a joke he walks over to me to give me a long kiss. I am annoyed. Why waste time playing around? The male doctors make fun of me for being so business minded.
