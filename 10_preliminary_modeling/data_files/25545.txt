 There is a drama going on involving a gay man. He has abused a privilege by keeping something a secret. He may have been keeping his homosexuality a secret. I talk with friends about this drama. They want to hear about my dream entitled "It's Pink Day". I realize I need to know about that dream before I tell them about it, because it could be really important.
