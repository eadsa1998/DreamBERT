I was watching Lost. This actress (can't remember who) kissed this guy underwater and I thought "that looks like Ethan (Lost)" and it was. She said he tasted nice and he said "I didn't think you liked the taste of cigarettes". She thought he tasted like soap. There was an interview with the actress and she said she was shocked at how turned on by the kiss she was. Then I was somewhere else and there were room. A Nightmare on Elm Street movie was playing in one of them. I went in and Ethan was like "try to attack me" so we closed the door. It changed to House of 1000 Corpses and there was a party for New Years or something. Mom was there. Hancock was the only movie on TV. There was a baby on the screen and it was when they did a dance, but it was near the end [made up storyline for it]. Mom said "it's near the end". Then I was on an island with some others. There had been a plane crash and it was like Lost. We had locked ourselves in this big enclosed outside area, as we thought 'others' were around. There was a hole in the door and I saw an eye peering through and then went away. I said "Did you see that eye?". As I walked up to the door, two girls hugged and kissed. I looked through the hole and then the eye came back up to it. It was a blue eye. I asked if it was Ben (Lost) because the eye looked like it belonged to Michael Emerson. He asked if I was Izzy. I stood back in shock and we let him in. He looked and sounded like Michael Emerson, but it wasn't. Then it was a show/movie. This lady, who I think was Gwen (Torchwood), lost her son and husband in the crash. She hadn't had a chance to cry yet and then I was her and I started crying. It felt good. Then it was the movie again and Mom was watching and she was like 'pfft, she's just looking for attention'.
