Traveling mountains. Tough going. Lydia and I take a journey together. We start to look for a road or path. I say, "Not too easy, not so scenic." She points to a steep hill with trees and gravel. I look back at my mother. Then the hill is a stepladder in a closet. We climb up the ladder and get to the top shelf. We look into the next room. 2 young women, cousins. They join us on our side. Something about cold, starving, but we survive.
