 I'm near Granger Field at Brimson. I'm sweeping and cleaning dirt, sand, soil, and leafs off benches. It's a groundskeeper-like job that I find degrading. A man is there who says there is a party at the Whitman house. I go up to him and tell him to uninvite all of his friends because the party is invitation only. My grade school classmates Gino Teavor, Eric Stoner, Jerry Kasper, Patrick Bergman, and Matt Yams come up to me one by one, until we're standing in a group. There is another man there. I greet three of them, which includes Gino and Matt, by shaking their hand, and to the others I give a half-hearted "Hi". I don't' respect the others, and though I respect the first three, we have no real connection. I see my mom and my family. I realize that because all these people are here I must be dreaming. I see a short kid with light brown hair and I turn him into a woman. She is also short and has shorter light brown hair. I walk towards her and she smiles at me. I get near her and she has turned a bit to her left as if to walk off. I touch her arm to get her attention. We kiss and fall to the ground. We have sex, with most of her clothes on. She is on top. Then she is naked, and we roll over. I rub her chest, which is slippery with moisture. I rub her clitoris and realize that the flesh I feel is my foreskin. We flip over and have sex on her side.
