The small boy at the foot of the bed kept pulling the blue blanket away from me to wrap himself in. I looked at both clocks. By one it was too early to get up, by the other not. I went to the shower which was different than my former one. Someone wanted me to use her combination soap and washcloth, but I preferred mine.
