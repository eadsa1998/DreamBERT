I dreamt I was on a street in Euclid, where I live, but that street was in Bena. I got on a bus and as I was riding along, two of my girlfriends (from Euclid) were yelling to me from a window of a house. One of my girlfriend's house. As I was riding, the bus turned into a bicycle. One of my girlfriends yelling from the window was ill and she wanted me to come in to see her. From the house next door the two girls' mothers were saying hello to me out the window. That was all that there was to the dream.
