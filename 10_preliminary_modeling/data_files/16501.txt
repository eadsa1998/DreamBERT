I was going in a van with some other people we knew and Mom to this ranch, and this ranch had horses on it. And there was this lady named Greta that was kind of acting like Aunt Christine. Come to think of it, I think Aunt Christine was with us and this lady she ______ Greta, and a kid named Travis, and some guy and Mom and I. And this ranch was, first of all, in this van the seatbelt was really, really hard to snap together, and it was sort of a big and roomy van, but it was sort of like a, not really that nice to ride in. And this ranch had horses, and I had the notion that they had lots of stuff they were going to do there, but they were not going to let me stay there by myself because somebody licensed has to be with the horses at all times. And you had to be a licensed driver to be able to take care of these horses. And that was kind of weird, but I felt sort of inferior because I'm not a licensed driver, but what does being a licensed driver have to do with being able to take care of them? And they were, they just seemed like kind of prissy people that didn't belong in the country, if you know what I mean. And I think this deals with deeper issues in that riding a horse isn't necessarily like driving, but people like to box people in, and I think I've been feeling some of the red tape that I'm having to cut through in life and that's what this dream is all about.
