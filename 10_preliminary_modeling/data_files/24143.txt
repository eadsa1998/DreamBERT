In my dream I was at work in a large office filled with desks. I was in Santa Cruz and the building was on a pier over the ocean. I was talking to a co-worker when a friend (we'll call him Gabe) called. He lives in another state and I was surprised to hear from him. He said "fine" but that he really needed to talk to me. (Well this worri4ed me because he usually doesn't say stuff like that. Gabe and I had been friends for a few years but we kind of had an on again, off again interest in being more than friends.) Anyway, in my dream I could see myself in the setting and I could see him where he was. It was as if I was observing my own dream. (He was standing in a bar. He's in a band and it looked like he had taken a break from practicing to call me.) He told me over the phone that he was getting married in two days, and he wanted me to come to the wedding. I asked if it was to his ex-girlfriend and he said yes. He didn't sound happy. I preceded to tell him all the things I thought about us and our relationship and started to cry. I said I felt like I was loosing my best fried. He sounded upset like that changed a lot. He had to go because his fiancee walked into the room, so I left my office to take a walk. I ended up walking to my best friend at home. That's all I remember.
