I was married, but I don't know the man I was married to. That is, it is nobody I know now. First I had a pair of twine. In the beginning of my dream I had eleven babies and this is how: first the twins, Michael Allen and Margaret Ann; and then within the year after, I had nine babies born all at once: 8 boys and a girl. Mary Alayne, Dennis, David, Mark, Terry, - that's all I can remember. Everybody -- all our neighbors and friends and relatives -- were all here trying to take care of those babies because they all looked alike. Every last one of them was identical, and we had the worst time because I would keep on saying (I was in bed), "Have you fed Dennis?" And everybody said they couldn't tell if they had fed Dennis and they didn't know whom they fed or whom they bathed because they all looked alike. So I kept saying, "Well, start all over again." And they would, but still never knew. Everybody was going nuts. You never saw so many people, I know I was a nervous wreck. Then they were going to take the babies up to bed and I said, "Where are you going to put them?" And Mother said that there was one bed that the twins could sleep in and there was another huge bed that all the 9 could sleep in. And I said, "Are you sure it has sides in it so they won't fall out?" And she said, "Oh yes, they will be perfectly all right." They were getting me ready because the photographers were coming to take my picture since I was the first one to have nine babies all at once.
