I am on the campus of my alma mater.  I'm not sure why I am there, but it is night time, and I don't have a place to stay.  Or rather, I have a place to stay, but I'm not sure where it is.  I remember getting a room in the dorms, but I don't remember which one.  I find the dorm (which strangely faces University Drive), and I go in one of the entrances.  Michael Smith is coming down a staircase inside, and he asks me how to say something in "essential Russian."  I think for a second, ashamed to admit I don't know, and while I am thinking a guy I don't know is coming down the stairs, and he says he is president of the "Inessential Russian" club.  He knows Russian very well and is able to answer Michael's question.
