Bonnie and I are homeless. We have learned though. We have long johns and mittens, ear muffs, etc. I think, "Being without a home is better and safer because it's real. When we thought we had a home, we didn't protect from the cold because we believed we should be warm, even though there was no heat in the house. We walk upstairs and a stair, path through the woods. There are patches of snow and particles of dry wooden path. I am glad to see the dry patches, some places to sleep when we get tired.
