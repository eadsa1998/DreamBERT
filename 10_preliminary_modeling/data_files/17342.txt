I dreamt of being pursued.  I think my boyfriend Jeremy was there, and we were driving on unmarked roads or something.  I was up a bit, like on the tops of buildings.  A dog attacked me.  First I tried commanding him.  There was a boy higher than me, I think I asked him to keep the dog away.  He did nothing.  The dog attacked me again, less obedient this time.  I caught his jaw and physically could have snapped it, but morally I couldn't do it.  I clenched the jaws together and pushed until his gums started to bleed.  When I saw that, again I had to stop, and I felt bad.  I pushed the dog away and went.  The right, with the boy, looked like a dead end.  I wanted to go left but opportunity did not provide, so I went up to the right- wanted to go down the hatch.
