Kaitlyn, Jocelyn and I were friends. We were in class at some weird place and I said something about Fat Nicki and Kaitlyn having a fight and Kaitlyn got upset. Jocelyn wrote me a note or email saying I was cool, but I shouldn't have said it. Something happened at a video shop, but I don't remember.
