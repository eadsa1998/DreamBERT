I am riding with my brother X. on a long train which I later realize is the Long Island Railroad. The train is one of the modern, electrified lines and we are moving along quickly. As I peer out the front of our car, I see the car being disconnected. There is a thick cable pulled out of the front of the car, and we are reconnected to another train. Now we are moving much more slowly. I see the train we had been previously connected to now on a parallel track to the right of us, and it passes us. I remark to my brother, "This is as slow as the Port Jefferson line!", referring to an older line with diesel trains.
