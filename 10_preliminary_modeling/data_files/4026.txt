["Many rooms, remodel."]  I am moving into a house. I am walking through the rooms to look it over. There is a great deal of work to do to make it livable. The plywood is rotting, it's old and dusty. I am amazed at how many rooms there are and how large they are. I open a boarded up window and look down to see a huge basement room, with dead leaves on the floor. Patricia and Aunt Elaine come to visit. I am showing them the house. We move now toward the front rooms of the house. Here they are in better shape. Elaine exclaims, oh, here's an other door. It's on the other side of the entry. I open it. It has some wallpaper and is very spacious. I like it. I see four doors. I open the one on  the left. And find myself in a clothing retail store. A sales woman rushes over to shoo us back into my room. She follows us in. I say to her, does this other door go into the store too? She says no. I open the door that has a ramp with shallow steps built on it. I see a flight of stairs being renovated, fresh cement being laid down on the steps. I close the door, trying to lock the little flimsy lock. It keeps falling back into an open position. When I locked it, the hinges on the other side of the door pulled out a bit. Then I tried the next door. A closet. I didn't see anything in it. I didn't like how it felt to look in there. The last door  is another closet. I open the door and four heavy golden brown men's overcoats fall out on the floor, just like four dead bodies. I am startled and a little afraid. I tell Elaine that this room will be for Howard and me. But I was thinking I want Howard in another room and this room is for me. Now Patricia is outside driving a VW bus. The sales woman runs to the window to look disapprovingly at her. Elaine and I go look. She is driving around in the front parking lot.
