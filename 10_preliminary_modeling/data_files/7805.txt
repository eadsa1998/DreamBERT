I was in the yard of a house we were living in. I had bought a huge piece of something like Astroturf. I took it out of the plastic wrapper and unfolded it. I laid it out and on top of some trees and bushes. I wondered about cutting holes in it to get it around the trees. It didn't cover the whole front yard. The very front had a small embankment. I went and looked at the backyard to see about putting it there. I decided it would fit well there either. A friend of Matthew's said they were looking at that for their yard. I said I wasn't sure I like it anymore. I told him I was going to need three of them for the front yard alone. Darren said he wanted some time alone so he was going out for breakfast and a hike. He had a backpack on. As he walked away, I was thinking that he doesn't know how far it is to the restaurant. There were lots of Matthew's friends around. I was in the bathroom and some of them opened the door, came in, washed their hands, and then left again. They didn't knock and didn't say a word about me being in there. I realized that I should lock the door.
