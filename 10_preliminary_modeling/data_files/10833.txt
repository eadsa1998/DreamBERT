I remember being in South Dakota with my former college friends, and we were on a tour singing in our school choir. We were traveling by bus and were visiting different towns, singing as we went by, Christmas songs and religious hymns. We were all having a wonderful time visiting people in these different towns. We were having a grand time in the bus making a great deal of noise and were attracting everyone's attention. The participants of this dream were June Ramage, 19, a girlfriend Esther, 19, a girlfriend Evely, 20, girlfriend Ruth, my sister age 24, Shirley age 21, girlfriend. No colors were seen.
