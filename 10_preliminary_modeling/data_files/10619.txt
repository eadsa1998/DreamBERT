I was at school and my brother went there too. We said we'd meet after school but I couldn't find my bike. Finally, I found it and there was a sign on it. I had a fight with these two adults to get it and they kept picking me up and I screamed, "Help!" Then they took my bike and sped off in a train. We tried to catch them. I went into this weird house with all these different colors with some boy from school, my brother, and one of my brother's friends. It was strange because anything you wanted to see or not see would appear. Anything you were thinking about would almost always happen. There was some other boy from school there and some other girls I couldn't recognize.
