Frank is about to leave for a trip in the dream, but he does not tell me where he is going. Confusion at the station; Frank misses his train, but seems unconcerned When I return home I find out toilet is missing and there is only a slop jar with shit.... I am furious; I return to the station and see Frank lying on a bed "entertaining" several men and woman; I try to tell him about my problem; he just evades the issue.
