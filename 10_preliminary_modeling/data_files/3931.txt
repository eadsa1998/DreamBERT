["Freedom."] The same dream continues later. As I am in the glass container a sheriff comes by and announces that we are free. We are so numbed by our dreadful experiences we can hardly comprehend. I am a young woman, fully able bodied, and I dazedly try to follow the man and woman I had been with. The sheriff is taking them to a federal building. I suspect a trap and we will be killed. But I doggedly follow them. I lose track of them and go to the Sheriff's office. Many regular people are there, they are all seated on the floor, in semi-prone positions. I go to the Sheriff and ask where my friends are. All the people pull back from me, shunning me. The sheriff tells them that I am no longer just a creature, but a real person. They must learn to accept me. I feel alone and scared and disbelieving this will change and I will really be free.
