I called my brother Stuart an asshole- twice.  We were in the rumpus room and he was bragging about how he could unlock the sliding glass door, but I couldn't.  I was frustrated and aware the name-calling wasn't called for, but couldn't help it.  I went to do my logic puzzles.  There was one about water slides.
