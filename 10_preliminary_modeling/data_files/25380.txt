 There are two gangs. A sign is flashed and one gang takes off for its territory. The other gang has figured out the sign, which occurred on either a license plate or a billboard. The second gang (that figured the sign out) is going to try to beat the first gang to their territory. The territory is a rooftop. I am climbing floors in a building, going to the roof. My family is with me. The walls of the top floor are tent-like. There are people on the roof who say, "Hey, that sounds like the Hansons." It is two of our cousins and their spouses. The come in from the roof. I recognize them vaguely.
