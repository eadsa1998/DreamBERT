I tried to make a call and my phone was unplugged. When I plugged it in it started to reprogram. A picture appeared; it was like a video. It was Alice; she started to undress. She was wearing a teddy under her clothes. Then another girl and a guy appeared. They started kissing her. Then all three of them were in bed having sex. Finally, it went off. I called Zack and yelled, "What the hell is this trash of a bitch doing on my machine?" He didn't know what to say. I said, "I'm tired of this shit." Then I gave him a choice: marry me or stay the hell away from me. He said: "You have to be my friend." I said, "I'll be your best friend if we are married, but if we're not, I won't be your friend at all."
