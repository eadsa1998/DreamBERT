I'm looking for a boy - I'm my own age, probably, but he's around 20 - I'm asking a girl about him - she's trying to look him up in the phone book, under Smith, (Bobby?); then I call and ask for him, and he says the name was Williamson, and he recognized me. I'm surprised. Now we're together; I haven't seen him in years, I'm glad to be visiting with him, it's comforting to be back in my old home (town? neighborhood?) for a while. We went to feed his cats in a big old barn - it's dark; (we? I? he?) put(s) the light on. I pet the cat, and a friend of his comes in - she's a big, farm-girl type with long blonde hair and overalls or jeans and a (plaid shirt?). She offers us each a hamburger and brings them in. My friend complains that his hasn't got any trimmings on it; she says she's been working hard and he's lucky to get one. Mine, however, is big and has a lot of stuff on, kind of clumsy, as a matter of fact. She served them in bowls. My feelings are warm, friendly, welcoming, grateful, overall very pleasant attitude.
