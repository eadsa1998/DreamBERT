 I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson and Bubba Hacker at the local Hill Park. Bubba just got back form boot camp. We see our friend Stephen Ramos. He is mowing lawns. He doesn't recognize Bubba at first. When we get closer, he sees it is Bubba. Stephen says hi, but doesn't express a lot of emotion, which surprises and disappoints me.
