The setting is what easily could have been Psych 316, psych lab class. Well, on second thought, it could have been any class. We were given different assignments much as is given in my drama class, and we were in anticipation of the date they were due. Prior to awakening, I had just plotted out an axis with the angles too acutely drawn. The drawings were graphs and merely consisted of intersections. I had just finished drawing an intersection for another member of the class, and I made the angles too small. They were supposed to be 90 degree and they were probably about 30. It was a man I had plotted the angle for and I believe most of the members of the class were men, including the instructor. I hadn't recognized the instructor or anyone in the dream. It didn't have a class setting in the sense it was spread out in rows of chairs. The dream was confined to a small layout sort of going from a large foreground to a small background so that you would be going straight back instead of outward. It was as if it was just one row of just a few, small people working on these assignments, whatever they were. The setting was like a combination of the experimental psych class and the drama class, the drama class in the sense that the assignments were due certain days by each individual, such as one person was expected Thursday or Friday or some day, and the work that we were doing was much like a lab class in that like plotting out graphs, something like this. The graph was something like stamping two lines at an angle over a sort of curved surface. At first, not thinking it mattered that the lines intersected 90 degrees, just stamped them and when it was inspected by the student who it was for and the instructor, they noticed that the angles did not intersect at 90 degrees. However, they mentioned it would still be able to be used.
