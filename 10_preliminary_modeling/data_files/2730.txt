I go down some stairs. I enter a room. An older, slightly pudgy man is there. I am accompanied by a man. The older man is smiling at me in a neutral sort of way. I come into the room. He shows me a garbage disposal unit that shoots out acid and kills or disfigures anyone who accidentally uses it. I am shocked. "What about the children?" I ask. "If they don't know this danger is there, they will be hurt." He shrugs. It doesn't matter to him. He smilingly tells me this whole room is booby trapped like that. I am afraid now to move because I don't know where the traps are. I look over at some sinks and reach over and kick at the side panel of the cabinet. The cabinet faces the man and the man gets concerned because, I guess, I have found a potential trap and it is pointed at him, not me. He moves quickly. A cat is attracted to the sound of a frightened bird flying out of the room and the cat (the helper man who was with me) runs in pursuit of the bird. Now I'm really scared because I'm trapped in this crazy room. I see some pills on the floor and run suddenly to get them. The man tries to get them before I do, but I scoop them up in my hands. He could easily take them out of my hands and I know that. I edge away, hoping my helper man comes back soon. I feel frozen with fear because if my helper man doesn't return from his hunt. I am going to be eaten by this older man and he will crunch my bones in his teeth after stripping off all the meat. Then I feel confident that all I have to do is wait and this man can't hurt me and then the freezing fear would return.
