It was someone's birthday. We were at Nana's. Poppers, Uncle Wilbur, Dad, Nana and Poppa were around. Poppa was answering questions about turbans and how if they get stolen you get one back free, but if you lost them you got in trouble. Ezra had this necklace thing which was some Greek thing. I was thinking that "the person I like is Greek". People from Queer as Folk US were there. I remember seeing Scott Lowell. Then it was Eugene's birthday. Jeremiah and Alejandro were there. Darius and someone else were missing.
