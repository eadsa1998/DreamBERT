I dreamt that I was in Florida. I was walking along when I came to a small road that led to a little lake. The lake was sheltered from sight of the road by dense foliage and palm trees. I was surprised to see that I had come to my uncle's home near Tampa. I was even more surprised to see that my cousin Lynn was there even though she had been married about three months before and was in New York. My cousin Lynn is about 25. My uncle is about 60 and his wife the same age.
