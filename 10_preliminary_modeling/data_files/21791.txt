I was in Rivertown. I visited the Minkus family. I met Zeanie, his mother and a granddaughter. Zeanie couldn't recognize me. I told him what house I lived in and I finally told him who I was. I said, "It's a long time since I left here 38 years ago." I talked with the granddaughter and to my surprise there were new brick homes built where the old homes were wrecked for the strip mining. I looked in surprise at the homes and thought where do the people work. Then I told them about Judy, but the way I told it, I was her brother and my mother had her. I said how beautiful and smart she is and the granddaughter said, "It's only in your head," and she touched my forehead with her finger. I asked Zeanie where the Knetzer's went, and he said to Houston, Texas.
