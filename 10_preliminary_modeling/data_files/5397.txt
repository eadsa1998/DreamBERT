First I dreamed that Kylie and I went to another one of Jon's parties, this time with more people from my high school. There were so many people there that they made us get into two lines, 1 of boys, and 1 of girls. Whomever we matched up with next to us was our hookup partner for that night. I got someone gross, so Kylie and I left to go home and watch a movie. I went to work out the next day, and there was a hockey camp there. There were lots of boys in the gym, and I was a little intimidated. Finally, I dreamed that I was a beautiful princess and I was at the beach. I saw a Norwegian prince and we fell in love at first sight. But it was like Romeo and Juliet, and our parents didn't want us to be together, so we had to run away and hide at the New York Times, where I had to write an article about us eloping.
