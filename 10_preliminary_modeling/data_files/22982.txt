I pulled into some parking lot and stopped.  It was dark-early morning, I think, before dawn.  When I got out I noticed I was parked next to Kathy Reynault's car, and she was inside.  She was kind of slouched down in the front seat, and when she saw me, she reached over and unlocked the front door.  I could hardly believe it.  I got in and asked her how long she had been sitting there.  She said she didn't know.  I assumed she must have been there all night.  I knew something was wrong, or she wouldn't have let me in the car (not to mention her sitting out there all night), and when I asked her about it, she said simply, "I don't have any friends."
