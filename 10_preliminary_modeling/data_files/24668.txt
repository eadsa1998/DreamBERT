My tooth fell out the day I had to go to the dentist to have one of my teeth sealed and my tooth came out at school during lunch. (They were all saying ew, gross, disgusting. It was funny.) Setting: School. Characters: Helen, Arlie, Nancy, Starla, and myself. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, grossed out. I liked it because I have a really loose tooth.
