I was at the CAS office. I opened a file drawer and it was almost full with red file folders. Each file had a white label on it with a series of numbers. I don't know if the numbers were a date or something else. Each folder also had a stack of papers in them about one half inch thick. They were all very uniform. As soon as I saw them I realized it confirmed my suspicions either that Bill C has Attention Deficit Disorder or that he suspects that he has and has been either researching it or testing himself.
