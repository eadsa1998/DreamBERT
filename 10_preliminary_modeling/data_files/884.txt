The girls and I are somewhere. I have a new cat. He's there to replace the other one. The cat's job is to hold things for me. I hold the cat (a half-grown kitten), and he holds the articles in question, some yarn and other things. He's new on the job and drops some things. He apologizes and says he'll get it. I suggest that if I hold him sideways to my chest, he will be more comfortable and will be able to hold the articles better. He agrees to try. I change his position. He's being held like a baby. His little paws are curled up over his fat little tummy. The girls and I are walking past a building. It's an apartment. I hear gospel singing. The windows shine with light. I am sneaking by quietly. I don't want to disturb my neighbors. I peek in and see blacks singing (women with bandannas on their heads). I enjoy the music but somehow feel drawn and simultaneously hold back from it. We go on.
