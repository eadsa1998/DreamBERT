Caring for baby. He is wet. Then I am trying to put diapers on myself. Eating, two children at low side table. Table is almost bare. Father is at table at my right. Morning prayers, several visitors. Difficulty in gathering. Visitors in next room singing popular songs. I am almost the only one who comes to prayers as expected.
