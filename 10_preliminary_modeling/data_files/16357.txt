I don't remember how we got there or anything, but I dreamt that there was this fair thing, and we were visiting this small community with somebody we know, but I can't remember, I can't put my finger on who. And, you know, like they had relay races and stuff -- well, this was kind of an odd type of a relay race thing that a family could do. What it was, was when there's a lightning storm and the power goes out, some of the things that you can do to salvage things. And the first thing was you had to run all the way down to the end of the block and make sure that the transformer was still intact. Then you had to run back to your house and turn off your main circuit breaker in your panel box. Then you had to run inside and change your equipment to run on DC, and I don't know where we would get that from. I didn't remember anything about any kind of a generator, but I thought, "Oh, how neat!" Two other people did the going down the street and coming back to the house and all, and I would change, our sound system receiver had some kind of a switch to go from AC 110 to DC 12, and once it was in DC 12 mode, 12 volts, it would revert to this weird surround recording room that had a ____ and two surrounds and nothing else. And we were going to play a CD or something, or watch a movie, I don't remember what. But I think I was going to do it out while the storm was brewing and banging outside, and I don't remember exactly all the details; it's kind of foggy now. But that's what it was. And then I woke up.
