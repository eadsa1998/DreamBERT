I am going to go on vacation, and swim and have a good time, but somehow I get taken as a prisoner by the Arabs and taken to a desert fort made of thick adobe walls. I think, "If it keeps raining a lot, it will all melt away and there will be no prison." Fat chance. A woman takes all my vacation money and acts like it's hers. She's an Arab guard, or something. I'm in trouble, and I don't really know it yet. She says because I was captured in the IS. Galopadoes (meaning island galapadoes), they will incarcerate me in that section. I'm being put away for a long time!
