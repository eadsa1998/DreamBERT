I had an apartment thing at school. I lived with three others. It was quite messy. I went to the toilet and when I wiped there was this green, plant like stuff on the toilet paper. I wiped again and then the toilet paper was the plant stuff. I left the toilet and in another room there was a guy with his head on the desk and he looked like Daryl. I left the apartment and ended up in this undercover area and I took my shoes off for a second, but then I couldn't find them. I asked this teacher guy for help, but then I found them. I text Mom to get me because I only had private study left. She said ok. I told her to go to the far end of the street so that I could sneak out and didn't have to sign out. She said she was going to get some ice-cream first. I sat down at a bench and saw some white shoes walk past and I looked up and Eugene walked past with his brother, talking to him. Calvin came with some girl. We got some photos and we had our leavers' jackets open.
