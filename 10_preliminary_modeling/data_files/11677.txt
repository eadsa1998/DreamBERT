I dreamed that it was early in the morning just before my father left for work. I was sitting at the breakfast table half-sleeping and he yelled at me for being out so late the last night. I yelled back. From there we talked about school and he said he objected to my taking such useless courses as philosophy. I got very angry and screamed back at him, asserting my rights. My mother told me fearfully that I should not excite him, but I did not care. He had already gotten a pressure on his heart and had to take a pill for it.
