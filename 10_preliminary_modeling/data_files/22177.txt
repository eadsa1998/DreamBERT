Last night I dreamt that a friend (M) who studies at the Institute of Public Relations was visiting me to invite me to a picnic that was being organized by his class. The picnic was to be in Chosica and we would go by train. Afterwards, I found myself in Chosica next to a river and at that moment a girl fell into the river. It must be mentioned that the picnic consisted of boys and girls. After this, I asked a boy for the time and made the following remark, "They are very late in crossing the river, almost one hour." Then I awoke.
