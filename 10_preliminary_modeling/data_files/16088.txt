I was already in Spain and that we were staying at this place, this lady was big and fat, and she spoke more English than she did Spanish. And she had a husband and three sons and we were all swimming in a pool, and then we got out and I remember that her house was kind of dark and that, hmm, let's see. We were walking around these gardens and things and it was all supposedly a city of Salamanca, but there were no real buildings besides her house. And hmmm, I don't remember anything else now, but I remember that I was so shocked that this big, fat woman could hardly speak any Spanish and she lived in Spain.
