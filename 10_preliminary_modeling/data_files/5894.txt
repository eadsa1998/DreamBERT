Am in some strange small town in the mountains and as I look up, I see someone skiing down a long and narrow run on a hill far away. I am with someone, but cannot recall his or her face. We start walking up toward the ski area which seems far away, but we finally reach an open square or plaza covered with a few inches only of snow. Just then a skier, a young boy, comes across the square fairly fast, heading for the corner where there is a sharp right angle turn which then leads down a narrow ski run. He doesn't make the turn successfully and crashes into the fence. Not too hard; gets up and shakes off the snow. I note he is using old wooden skis and wonder whether I would risk my own metal Hart skis on such a dangerous turn and on snow that is not packed.
