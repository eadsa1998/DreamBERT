I am at some college function. The entertainment, two black men who are blind, comes. I happen to be sitting right where they sit down. I am pleased and say things like, "My friend Lucy is blind." The black man, with thick lips and dreadlocks, looks toward me scornfully and says, "Who asked you?" Then he starts picking on me. He asks me how come my lips look so funny, all pursed out when I say words. I start to explain it's a combination of entertainment and it's also sort of the way my lips just move. Then I say to him, "Well, you should talk. Look at your lips, all thick." We do this back and forth for a while. Now I am running on a track. There is a cluster of uniformed track women running ahead. I, the dreamer, watch them pass and I look way beyond them down the track and see me dead last. I have a limp and I am slow, but I am up and I am running. I feel good about that. Now I go to my dorm room, only I accidentally go to the 7th floor and have to walk back down some stairs. I find the name Vfabray and know that's my roommate's name. I go in and see belated Xmas presents for Charla have arrived. I open them, and notice my roommate has already opened some and put the tiger lily flowers up in a hanging plant thing. It looks pretty, but I wish she'd waited for Charla. I look out the window and see some things like kites flying around, not making it very high and crashing to the ground. They are not damaged.
