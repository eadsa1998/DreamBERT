My wife is trying to reach a ship out in the harbor. She jumps into the water fully clothed and wearing her new gray winter coat. She swims steadily toward boat as I run along the shore shouting encouragement, knowing she is not a good swimmer. I am extremely nervous for fear she will not make it. Others also are in the water swimming toward the boat. She continues to swim fairly strongly and eventually is out of sight and I know she has reached the boat.
