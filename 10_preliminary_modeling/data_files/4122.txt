I feel tired. It is 6:30 am. I am aware that my father has moved to Seattle. I miss him. I am now traveling. Andrea and I are going down a gravel road next to a wide broad river. We are traveling by placing our hands in a blue plastic bowl. I think this is the best way to travel because there are no moving parts like wheels and so on to break. Now I am in a building with a man. He and I are spies. We are pretending to be the church people at this place. We are helping officiate a wedding. But someone discovers we are spies and we must now escape. I grab some things and try to shut a door when someone comes to find us. We sneak out the door and move on.
