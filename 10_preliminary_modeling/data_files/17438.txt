Dreamt about paintball.  First game we stormed a tower like at the park.  Defending it was so easy!  Most of the time my balls didn't fire, but squirted.  It worked fine for close-up.  Tag after tag after tag.  My boyfriend Jeremy loaned me paint to reload but air started running too low.  I hid.  Someone from below got one over the wall I was hiding and it broke, right at the game call.  I was so pumped.  Second game was in my bedroom, our base.  I hid behind the bed.  I was ready for them.  But everyone coming in had red armbands (on my team), and had been shot out.  Finally a tall man with a yellow band came in.  I hit him twice in the mask.  He knew he was out but didn't care.  There were no judges in the room, and he was pissed at me for something in the previous game, and so he shot at me.  It turned into a brawl.  I finally got him in a sort of headlock.  I tried to rip the skin on his neck, and I almost took a hammer to his head.  The next game, I was using a little plastic pistol, so no air was needed, it just squirts.  I ran out so I took a few balls from other places in the gun.  My car.  I was huddled around the floor of my car warning not to get paint on it, at least not on the upholstery.  At some point my eye was stinging- somehow paint had gotten in it.
