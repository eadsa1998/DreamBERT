I dreamed I was hiking. I came to a wide open place, maybe beside a lake, or maybe beside a large meadow.  There were rocks all around the edge of this open place. I looked up, and the whole sky was made of rock! It was arced, or curved, so that it was high overhead, but appeared to curve down and maybe connect with the horizon or edge of the earth. The rock sky was made of plates of rock, very large, and the hue was white to light yellow to dark yellow, almost yellow-orange. It was not one solid rock, but overlapping plates of rock.  The amazing sight filled me with euphoria and love for the canyon country I live in.  As if the thing I love the most became my whole world, completely surrounding me.
