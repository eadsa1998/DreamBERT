I have moved into an apartment on the top floor of a building in some large city, As I walk into the apartment I hear much noise from the next apartment and note that there is a glass pane door separating my apartment from the adjacent. Most panes of the window are covered with brown paper, but here and there it is torn and I can see a family next door sitting at the dinner table and eating and conversing noisily. I note two little girls in dark green dresses and with light brown hair eating in the seats right next to the glass door, where the table is located. I am annoyed at this noise and lack of privacy and immediately start to place pieces of brown sticking paper on the open spots on the door. After this I look out of window at other side of room, which gives a splendid view out over a very large city. In order to see directly down, I remove the screen, which is an old-fashioned type held on with two flanges at the top. The screen slips off the flanges and I hold it tightly and try to get it back on the hooks ... without falling out the window. Slowly and carefully I get it back on and then close and lock it. Later walk downstairs and in lobby of apartment house see some Chinese people and I feel friendly with them. I see a man who is the janitor and owner and with him is his Chinese wife. I offer to help him sweep a huge red tiled lobby area and I tell him that my wife also is Chinese. All three of us - janitor, his Chinese wife and I - sweep a section of the floor with straw brooms. It occurs to me that he really needs some large foxtail push brooms in order to do a more thorough job, and thus make less dust.
