I went to a play. It was actually stuff from people at school of when they were younger. Some of it was speeches. We had to sit in seats in certain areas and there were only two seats left -- one was next to Eugene and the other next to a teacher. I asked if I could just sit somewhere else a little further away and they said no, but I did anyway.
