I was rolling a ball up a long hill and another person with me told me to be careful and not let go of the ball. Just then an old Model A Ford came by with a lot of people. I recognized it as a car I used to own a long time ago. While I was watching these people the ball got away from me and rolled down the hill. I chased the ball to the bottom of the hill where it hit a rock and bounced up into the limbs of a tree. I began to climb up the tree when my alarm clock went off.
