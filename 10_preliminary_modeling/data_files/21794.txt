Ann and I were in a building. I walked to a doctor's office and I said, "Why do I have to go in here?" So I walked away and we went to an elevator and the big double door closed. I was with Bob Lippert. He picked up Bob. He was small and carried him. I looked into the shanty and there was snow on Bob's watch he left there.
