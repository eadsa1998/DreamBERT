There's a "Dating Game" TV show - the 3 contestants are nice young girls, all quite different. One's black, I'm not sure if the other 2 are both white, but they all work at pretty ordinary jobs and have pretty ordinary lives. This game has a new twist: of the 3 guys they each get to pick from, there's one "ringer" - a blonde, gorgeous hunk that none of them would probably connect with in real life (he looks rather like George Michael, but less nasty) - and he gets to be in each group. If any of the girls picks him they get an extra prize.
