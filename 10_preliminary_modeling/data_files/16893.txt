I'm 'at home' with my partner. We live in a carpeted place, slightly scruffy. There's a long hall with the front door and stairs at one end, and a back door at the other end. An 'intruder' cat (a dark brown tabby) has got into the house and is standing in the hall, about to run up the stairs. I swiftly stand in it's way to stop it. It is forced to run up the hall towards the back door. My partner lets it out the back door.
