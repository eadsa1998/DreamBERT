I'm sitting next to a girl and a young blonde guy, looking hip (like the guy at the play but prettier) - we're gossiping and she says look who we've got gracing our party (is that what this is?) - she means this guy and points. I don't recognize him and she ID's him as an actor who's well known from one of the nighttime soaps, only there he looks rather preppy-ish. He's sullen, reminds me of Michael J. Pollard. I'm popping my little finger by pulling it out - whenever I do that the last joint comes off but there's another next time. I'm very amused by all this.
