I was at a shop with Dad. He went to buy condoms and I left to go to the toilet. I walked to a cubicle as the one next to it flushed and a guy walked out. I thought it was weird but I went in anyway. He washed his hands and walked towards the door but didn't leave. I then saw the feet of the girl in the cubicle next to me hanging and it sounded like she was choking and then it stopped. I text Dad saying 'guy in here, dodgy, come here'. I waited for a bit and then I got up and walked out towards the door. Then Dad opened the door and I left with him. Then a heap of others and I were on this little train and then the tracks ended and were replaced with some weird thing then we were walking over it. As we were going back the train started coming and we got off. Then Sylar (Heroes) was gay and had killed his boyfriend by putting him through a mulcher like machine. I met him at one point and liked him so helped him but he ended up turning himself in because he missed his boyfriend. Then I was Sarah (Chuck) and he was being held in this weird room with a guard. I went in and I told him to go but he refused. There was a cat in there too. The guy came back and saw the cat and he was like 'come on sweetie; let's get you out of here'. Sarah could turn invisible and I was thinking 'I thought she had a different power'. I had asked Sylar at one point what he did with his boyfriend and it had something to do with a lathe. I was starting to like him a bit and then he stopped to do something and this thing blew up killing him. I was upset and angry at this. I left and there were police digging up bodies in this forest area. There was also this funny message that he had left on my phone and I kept listening to it, crying and laughing.
