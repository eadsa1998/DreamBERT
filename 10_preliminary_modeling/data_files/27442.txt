An old friend of mine who is 1 1/2 yrs. younger than I came to my house one day, and I was very surprised to see that she was no longer "pinned." She has always been an exceptionally pretty girl and she looked even more beautiful this day. When I asked her if she and her boyfriend had quarreled she smiled wryly and took off her skirt. I looked at her standing in her slip and commented that she had put on weight. She laughed and said that she was going to have a baby; and did I blame her now for breaking up with her boyfriend.
