I am giving a huge celebration party for my parents. They are 70 years old. I see my mother sitting sideways in a small motor boat with a child. She looks old. I am surprised she is there. She seems to be enjoying herself. The house is large. I go back in and show Bonnie how I've set up the rooms. I go downstairs and say, "This is the hardest room." A huge table is set up with a tablecloth but nothing else on it yet. My concern is that there will be too many relatives and I want them to all sit down together to eat. I show Bonnie two other areas where chairs have been set up for people to sit and converse comfortably. I see there are so many chairs that there's hardly room for the people, so I say to Bonnie, "Let's put up the folding chairs and make more room." She and I do that. Now Aunt Naomi is there and Aunt Rosalie and some cousins. We great them. I see some cousins sitting in an adjourning area and see their small newborn baby. I think it's sweet and I go in to get a closer look. I then see another cousin holding a squirrel and I pick it up instead of the baby. It has a large black dog-like nose. Now I give it back and go to the stairs. Everyone is going upstairs. I try to walk up the stairs, but halfway up I am stopped because the step is huge. I have to stick my right foot way up on the banister and try and hoist myself up. I can't do it and I say to Bonnie, "I'll meet you up there, I'll go find another way." I see another door and walk toward it. I see a ramp leading outdoors and see a dog turd on it. I go outside to go around to the front door and back in. Dwight is there somewhere.
