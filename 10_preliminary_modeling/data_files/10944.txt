I was coming off desk duty at 1 a.m. I picked up my books in the dark and started to come upstairs to bed because I was exhausted. When I arrived at the bottom of the stairs, my legs gave way and I slid to the floor. All I could think was how silly. Now I just want to lie here and sleep till morning, but people don't do that. Then a fire door opened and there were kids from the house peeking at me through a crack in it. They said, "Did she faint?" But I couldn't answer because I was just too tired to bother. Then I was coming out of the drugged state and started to laugh because I was still at the foot of the stairs and not in bed.
