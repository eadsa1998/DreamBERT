I am an old soul, one that's almost done with lives on this planet. There are two young souls, men who are in relationships with me. They insist, it's part of this life's lesson. One is a good housekeeper and very supportive of me. I feel a little guilty that I don't care for him as intensely as he cares for me. The other is like Burt Reynolds. His room is covered, including the floor, with colorful posters of himself. I put up with them, like they are puppies and I'm an old dog.
