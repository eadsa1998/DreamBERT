Then I saw Mr. K. and asked him to help me hang my pictures. He thought two others ought to be moved to make better balance. There were many pictures on a long, low wall. The hangers were sticky tape that peeled off and yet stuck again when the pictures were moved, but those on one picture were wearing out so I cut some off from an extra long piece on another picture. When Mr. K. finished and all the pictures were hung, I started off to take the bus. I walked along over a gravelly waste.
