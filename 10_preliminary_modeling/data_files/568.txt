My hypnosis instructor, Eric, is at my house going over a hypnosis lesson. At the same time, we are in the midst of a big party. The house is a very large house, several stories high, with many rooms. Eric is not feeling well. He gets into a blue van to drive home which is a town next to my hometown. For some reason I have his ashes at my house. I am communicating with the ashes as he is driving. He sounds very ill and tells me to induce him. I do, counting back from 20, pointing out different times in his life when he was healthy and happy. He begins to feel better. Someone at the party takes the ashes and dumps them. I must find them and do so as I am midway through his trance. Then I am going upstairs to be alone and finish the induction. On the way I pass a room where my daughter, Julie, is lying down trying to get "one of the kids" to sleep. she gets up and demands to know what I'm doing with the ashes. I whisper because I don't want Eric to hear. As he is in trance I can hear music he is hearing, stuff from the 1940s, and other sounds at stages when he is supposed to be seeing the things I am suggesting. I continue with his trance, asking if he is okay. He says he is almost home now. He mentions that sometimes people ask him if he is flying he gets there so fast. Then he tells me this is the worst hypnosis he has ever heard by far. I suggest I study theory and not practice for awhile and he agrees. Then I add that since he is feeling better it was not a total loss. He reluctantly agrees as he arrives home.
