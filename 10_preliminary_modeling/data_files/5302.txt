I dreamed first that I was riding back from a hockey game with Caleb. We were cuddling and just sitting next to each other. Then when we got back to school, Caleb was going to go with the Varsity Girls team to their game. I was kind of upset and volunteered to drive the bus to the game so that I could be with him. Then I realized that I didn't know how to drive. The bus keeled over and Matthew came to save us. At the hockey rink, Lou was tickling me and flirting with me, and he hurt his back. I traveled to the hospital in the ambulance with him, and kissed his chest over and over again, hoping that would help in some way. Then I was just so mad about Caleb that I kept throwing things around and stomping on them. I was in a rage because he had ditched me earlier. Then I woke up.
