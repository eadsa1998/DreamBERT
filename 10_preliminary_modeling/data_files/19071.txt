In this dream I remember that I was at home. I was planning to go to the beach. A couple of my buddies were going to come by and we were going to go over to the beach. They came by and I imagine we went over there, but I don't remember going over there. I remember coming back and it was at night. We were riding along on a causeway coming back. This sports car went flying by us and it looked like there were 6 or 7 guys in a sports car. I remember as they were going across, they were holding up some sort of flag. It looked like a white flag on a pole as they were trying to cross. I remember that we had something similar, only we had a blue flag. We decided to hold that up too, and we were both just going across the highway like that. I remember over on the other side for some reason they stopped and we stopped, and we got out and we were talking to them. And I remember for some reason I found out most of them were from Barry College except for around 2 of them who went to the University of Miami. After that I don't recall, but, any more about how I arrived there or anything. Then I remember driving down the highway toward the University, U.S. 1 and there was a party, and we pulled in and went to the party. All these other kids were there. It was a large party. I remember this one sports car came pulling in. It was red. I don't know what the make was, but there were 2 guys in it and a girl with real long brown hair. They pulled in, they just kind of looked around and then they pulled out again. That's all I remember.
