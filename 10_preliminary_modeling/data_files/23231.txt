On my way through the city where I worked, I hear Max Ardol's voice, talking on the phone.  I trace it to the patio of a house, apparently his, where he is sitting at a patio table.  I stand around waiting for him to finish talking on the phone, but he doesn't seem very interested in the fact that I am there.  When he is finished, though, he hands me a packet of photographs to look at.  I am surprised that they are all in black and white, and the people in them are no one that I know.  I wonder why he thinks I would be interested in those, and he is not interested in my move to another state.
