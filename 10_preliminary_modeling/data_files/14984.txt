I was driving out of a carpark at the shop. I needed to turn right but something was going on. I had to go on an escalator to get out. There were people behind me running around. I finally got out. It was stressful and there were lots of people around. I was then driving down Princess Rd and there was a lot of glass. I pulled into a shop. I was walking with just socks on. Mom was with me and then Darren came too. I left and had to go the other way but I didn't know how to so I just kept going the wrong way and I was asking what to do but they wouldn't tell me. Then I found out where to go. There was a weird way to get home. We had to go through this shop and then climb out of a fireplace (like, we came in from behind it). There was a lounge in the way. It was a new house and it was lame. I went to 'college', then I came back. Then I was there with Dad, his girlfriend and Farrah and Ezra. I said that the baby better not be in my room. Then there was a movie and there was a mushroom cloud. I explained it to Granny, who was also watching it. It showed the survivors and there were a lot of people outside.
