I was at school and I had computing. There was a big chair and a high computer somewhere. Eugene did something and him, Darius and Jeremiah went down this tunnel. Calvin, Evelyn and I were sitting on a long bench. I was sitting on the edge, then Calvin, then Evelyn. Darius sat next to Evelyn and kissed her. Calvin and I were trying not to laugh. We had all done stuff in a movie or something. There was some party thing and I was trying to find photos of Eugene. I was on this Sims 2 website and I found this guy who had made a Sim of Dmitri, but it had pink hair. He liked cricket and I was thinking that Eugene likes cricket.
