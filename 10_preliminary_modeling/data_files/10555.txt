I am walking up some wooden stairs with a group of women, looking for what? I see a big mess in the rooms and rummage through an old, beat up dresser: I am looking for a coffee pot, but find two bags with some jewelry and other treasures: I find a beautiful metal CROSS that is shiny and heavy; I decide to keep it, since it once was mine! I see Earl and RUTH returning from a trip. (Vague) Earlier: a feeling of being enclosed in a large plastic wrapper. (Hiding from what? protected from what?)
