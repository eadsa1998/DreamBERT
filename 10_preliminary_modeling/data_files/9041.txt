I was sitting somewhere talking to a famous, black rapper. I would say he was in his late 20's or early 30's and somewhat small in stature and build. He was sitting on the end of a sofa to my right and I was sitting in an arm chair sitting parallel to the sofa. We were eating something. He struck up a conversation about his wife and how hard she works. That somehow led to him saying something about how difficult it must be for single parents. I told him that I was a single parent for 18 years. He looked very surprised, stopped eating, turned more to face me, leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and asked me why? I shrugged my shoulders, tilted my head slightly to my right and quietly answered that I suppose I have commitment issues. I told him that I wanted to make sure I got it right if I got married a second time. He said, but you've been asked haven't you. I told him that I had been asked, but I have never felt confident that it what was right or that it was a marriage I could make last 'til death do us part.' He had a very sad look on his face. I understood the look of sadness as it sometimes makes me sad myself. I try to comfort myself with thoughts that perhaps God has called me to a single life. I recognize that many of the professional and academic things I have done over the last twenty years I may not have been able to do had I been married. Besides, there is no guarantee that life would have been easier or better.
