I am flapping my arms to get up into the air. It's sort of a swimming motion and a flying motion. I get airborne, the sky is very clear and blue. I see nothing but sky until I see a short small missile with a green metal tip coming at me. I duck and then the next and next. I am exhausted because they are coming fast and deadly. I must keep this up or I will die.
