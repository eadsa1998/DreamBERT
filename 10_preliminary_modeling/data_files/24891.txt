I was on the hill and a lady called me to come to a building. The place felt like camp. A whole bunch of people went to the building. There was a lady there telling all the kids where they could go and then she dismissed them. I stayed in the building and tried to talk to a boy. There were some people next to the door at a table talking. I also saw a project that I had been working on at home. I also saw the same boy drawing a large landscape. Setting: In a meeting hall like at camp. Characters: The lady was like a counselor. She was taller than everyone else in the room. The boy had dark hair and an intelligent face. The people at the table didn't have any definite features. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I was angry because the boy would not talk to me.
