["Graduation late."] I am in a huge outdoor field where high school graduation just took place. Now everyone is gone, but me and Darryl and 2 other men. I missed my graduation, or was very late to it. Darryl is interested in sex and I decide to go along with him. I know he doesn't love me, but I want to have sex with him. I follow him. Now it is the next morning, and Gaston comes over to me. He is preparing a picnic in the park and wants me to go to town in the van and get some things for it. I am tired and don't really want to go, but I do. Apparently it was him I made love to after graduation and this is the morning after. I get in the van and drive. It is a Sunday morning and there is no other traffic on the road. I am driving in a store. I get out of the van. Celeste wants me to take some boxes with letters and maybe a fat laced piece of meat. I walk with these items looking for the van.
