My wife Bonita and I were preparing to go somewhere with a lot of people and were looking for some equipment that we couldn't seem to find-ice skates, a neck scarf, maybe a football, and other things.  Then something vague about being in the back seat of a car with other people on the way to wherever we were going.  Then I was playing football, either among some dormitories on a college campus or among some apartment buildings.  We weren't really playing a game, just tossing the ball around.  There were numerous trees, and they always seemed to be in the way of long passes I wanted to throw.  The timing had to be perfect in order to have your receiver in the right position to throw to him through openings through the limbs, but the ball was slightly bigger around than ones I am used to, and it kept slipping out of my hand at the moment I was about to throw.  Then, because I couldn't grip it well, I couldn't throw it as far as I knew I could otherwise, and my passes kept falling short.
