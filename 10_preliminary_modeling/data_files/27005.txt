I can't remember enough of the first part of the dream to record how I got there, but I found my self walking down a hallway, dimly lit, trying to get out of a saw mill I think it was. I tried first one door and then another that led off from the hall and each time I looked out to find a long drop to the earth below, thirty feet or so. Finally I returned to one door and then decided to descend by way of an unloading machine parked there. It had a series of wheels at one end, covered by huge rubber tires in groups of three's. By jumping from one set to another I was able to get down. Several men stood and watched my progress, I thanked them for letting me use the machine and then walked into a valley where I entered a hotel verandah. Here I found several friends (girls) of mine who asked me to stay a while, but not having been home for a while, I refused. I then found my self emerging on C-- H-- and started walking up F-- B-- to go home.
