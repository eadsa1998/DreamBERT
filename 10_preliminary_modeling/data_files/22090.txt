We were supposed to be home, although really I had never seen that place before. There is a party and almost everyone is dancing. I am with my father and a friend of his, whom I do know, in a room which has a door that leads to the place where the people are dancing. This room is quieter and there are only three people there. My father and his friend are sitting face to face on two chairs, and I am standing up. That friend has arrived recently and it seems that before there was another person sitting in his place. The gentleman wants something to drink and he accidentally knocks some glasses, which were on a tray by his side, on the floor. My sister brings a beer for him, but when he is pouring it, he spills it and my father and I start to get annoyed at him because all of a sudden we realize that he is drunk.
