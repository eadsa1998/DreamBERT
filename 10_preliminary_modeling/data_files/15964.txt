A war or something had happened and there weren't many people left. I had been hiding out in this house on a hill in the forest but had to leave because bad guys were coming. I went into the city/village and found some good people. Some of them ended up dying but I was with this one guy who owned this chain of shops which all had an underground storage area in the back. The bad guys were coming and we went into one. At the front it just looked like clothes storage, but further on there was a bunker area.
