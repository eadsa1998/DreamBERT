I am in a department store (resembling H--). I seem to be on a floor other than the first. Preparations are being made for a style show, in which I am to participate. I seem to be wearing a wool dress of checked material. I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said "We allow no pets here." One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says "yes" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row. I am particularly impressed with the variety of bright colors which they are wearing. I recognize one of the girls as my former roommate. She is dressed in bright yellow. She waves to me and shouts that she is getting her grades the next day.
