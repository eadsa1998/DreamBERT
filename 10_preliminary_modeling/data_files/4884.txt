["Desperate need to be perfect."] I watch a man who is a wonderful singer perform. He is delightful. Full voice, perfect pitch. Everyone likes his work. Then he is done singing, only he can't seem to stop. He now insists we listen as he vocalizes the exact sound of each instrument in the orchestra. He does the "a" note like a violin. A "d" note like a cello. He is very good at it. But people are getting restless. Time to move on to something else. He doesn't want them to go.
