I wondered if they'd charge me if I didn't wait for Dr. B. Went to the elevator and pushed the button for down. It was an elaborate gold button, square, only one side of which side pushed in. The elevator passed me going down, then went higher and brought down a sick patient on a stretcher. Then she was put on a ledge behind the elevator. They covered her face so I thought she was dead.
