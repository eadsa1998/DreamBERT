I got 50 kills in CoD4 and the match sent a message to everyone saying I'd be right back. I teleported away to a bonus level. In the game, I was in a sniper battle with this guy wearing blue body armor. After I shot and killed him -- it took four shots from behind with a sniper rifle, and one in the field -- they interviewed him. How do you feel about Cannondale (my in-game nickname)? He's all right; I've got nothing against him. Never played with him before. And then they released dogs, which attacked more like fast attack bears. I climbed on a fence and shot down at them. I didn't think they were much of a threat. One came in close and I shot at it, and ran in circles and kept it from pouncing on me. There was a creepy old house set out in the middle of nowhere. It had no doors, only high windows that were sealed tight and small. Strange things began to happen. Like I was transported inside, with just the few items I had. Though one of my items was a .357 magnum revolver. I had fired one shell outside as a large attack dog came at me. I hit it, and its injury showed up on a camera attached to its collar. There was like a witch inside operating the whole operation. I saw her replay of the incident. The dog wasn't dead, but my shot, which entered below its neck and went through its shoulder, caused it to scurry away and stare.  Inside I tried to check my gun. I opened it and dumped out the shells. Uh oh. Half of them were corroded, falling apart or filled with dirt. The witch. I figured they might still work. They wouldn't be nearly as powerful or shoot as far, but they'd still bark out a mist of junk that would injure or disorient or scare an opponent. I had a hard time separating the dirt from the powder. I put them back into the gun and hoped for the best. I saw my allies, outside and looking for me. I thought they were transported inside. So I wasn't looking for them. They were looking for me.
