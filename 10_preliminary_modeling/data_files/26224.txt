 I walk with my dad and several friends. We go by the end of a building where slaughtered cows are hanging. It smells terrible! We can see a bloody mess inside the building. We go around the side of the building and into a door. We walk through several rooms, in succession. We are going to order food. I get two bottles of Leinenkugels beer, and my dad gets a maple flavored Leinenkugels. The man asks to see my identification. I show it to him. He tries to sell me parts of fake ID's for underage people to use. We sit down. Our food is really fried and greasy. The atmosphere is dark. We're close to the room with the slaughtered cows in it. My brother Wally may be there.
