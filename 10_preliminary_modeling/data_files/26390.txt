 I'm on a plane that is crashing, it is going down. It seems to spiral downwards. We get close to the ground and one or both engines fire explosively, blasting the plane up and averting the crash. The firepower of the engines at this point is unfathomable. The plane was crashing, and the boost from the engines was immense, like a rocket, and the plane blasted up into the sky. The plane may fly in spirals, because only one engine may fire. The plane crashes in a lake. It seems to crash relatively softly and horizontally. Many people, including myself, survive. Some people die. I'm on shore with survivors, and I tell some people to go gather up the dead bodies, which are in the lake. Others and I go with a man who informs us of a new type of power that was used in our plane, experimentally. I am surprised by the use of this new power, and want to learn more about it. The new power was being tested on that plane. I was very impressed by the power of the engines to avert the crash, initially.
