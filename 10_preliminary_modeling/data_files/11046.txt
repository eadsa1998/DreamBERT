Setting the back yard at home. A group of neighbors are over visiting. I start pushing some sort of cart down the driveway when a green car turns up the drive. The driver is A (mentioned in earlier dreams). He keeps coming ahead and slowly pushes me and the cart back into the yard (in a spirit of fun). He gets out of the car and I go to find him expecting to be greeted with some warmth, since we had not seen each other for a year, but he is not particularly affectionate. I decide that this is because of the other people around, particularly my mother. I mention to him that I had just sent him a letter since I wasn't expecting him home for several weeks yet and he just shrugs. There are several small children in the yard and we amuse ourselves by playing games with them.
