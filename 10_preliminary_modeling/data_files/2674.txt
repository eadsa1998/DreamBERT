I and Ellie and counselor are at a counseling session. Our task is to knit things as we work through our stuff. There is lots of distance between the three of us. I am knitting, I have a cast-on row and am trying to knit the first row, only stitches slip and nearly fall off and I am constantly readjusting the row and picking up stitches. I lie down and am aware that I could wiggle around and create sexual feelings and masturbate. I feel embarrassed, my face away from Ellie and the counselor. What if they saw my movements and figured out what I was doing? I sit up. I feel annoyed at Ellie. I am doing more than her. I go over to pick up two rows of cast-ons from previous sessions. They are on bent knitting needles or ink pens and stuck on a stand like an ink pen would be. I only find two and feel guilty I haven't done more, but then I feel this isn't fair, I've done much more, And I open a satchel bag and see (display) many cuffs and partial baby sweaters and blankets I've done, all in baby pastel colors, green and pink. I look over at Ellie angrily that I'm doing all this work, and she's doing only the minimal.
