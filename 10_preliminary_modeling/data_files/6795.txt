My table mate tells me to hurry as the dining room will be closed at 1:30. I look at the clock and see it's already that time, but I can't chew fast. A Japanese waiter, a small man, brings me coffee. In a pleased manner he points out that he has added cream and sugar for me. I tell him I'm sorry but I'm not allowed but one cup of coffee a day and ask if there's a dessert. He said, "no more, the kitchen is closed." He has one eye much narrower than the other. I try to persuade him to get some dessert for me.
