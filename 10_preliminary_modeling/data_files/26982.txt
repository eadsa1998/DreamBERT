I was at a factory working. I saw a college girl-friend of mine. I went out to lunch, and while outside, it started to rain very hard. I returned to the factory early from my lunch and asked my girlfriend if she would lend me her head-scarf. She said "yes" and, after putting it on, I went outside again.
