First of all I dreamt that I had met some man who had given me sort of an adaptor like type thing. It was a little machine and then a thing that you would attach to a tape. And he said that it was an adaptor that would turn a regular tape into a tape with synchs on it. So what you had to do was you had to put a regular tape in my desk tape player with the sound system, and then you had to run the signal output to it with RCA's that converge into like a ______ adaptor, and you had to plug it into this little adaptor machine thing. And then you had to connect that, you had to put a blank tape into Big Bird and he would record it as a tape with synch on it. And that was kind of silly. And I dreamt that this guy also gave me like a behind-the-scenes making of "A Very Special Picnic" that you can hear how it was made, and they would take about like some of the writers and how they actually did it. Then the next scene, I was making spaghetti or something in the kitchen and I think I was warming up pizza and I was making spaghetti. And I was trying to put the cover on the spaghetti dish. Actually it was one of those plastic Tupper Ware things, and Mom was like trying to do it with me, and she didn't think I could do it myself. And I yelled at her and I said, "Let me do this myself. This is such a simple thing." And she said, "But you're going to spill it on you; you're going to spill it all over." And I said, "No, I can do this. You need to back off and let me do this." And so I did that, and then I was deciding whether we had enough slices of pizza for everybody. And then I woke up.
