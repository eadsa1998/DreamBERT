I woke up with a bit of a headache. My hair went full curly. Dad's room was scary looking and orange and I thought he and Ezra were high. Dad kept saying to Ezra that he wanted my room. They were talking about TV shows including A Bit of Fry and Laurie and others. Dad complained about me going psycho the night before. I didn't remember. I had had a dream about soccer balls. I went to school and I met up with Calvin, Fang and Evelyn. Fang had a chocolate version of Operation. It got stolen. Jake and someone else thought that I was a guy. The teachers were acting weird. There were lots of soccer balls. I started walking around at home later, and I was screaming and hitting someone to try and wake myself up. What had happened the night before had happened again. This woman that Dad was going out with said that I'd died, while I slept. I tried to work out how to save myself again. I was in a taxi and the taxi driver was a guy. KA PLEEZ was written somewhere in the taxi.
