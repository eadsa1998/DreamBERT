I was driving my father's car and there was an unidentifiable boy with me. We were trying to go to the Shaker Club. Although we knew where it was, I was continually being thwarted by turning down streets that I was familiar with and having them come out in places where they shouldn't or being very long and seemingly without end. We reached the club but it was completely dark and then there were no cars around and I woke up.
