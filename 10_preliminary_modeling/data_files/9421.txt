Edward talks long distance with M's wife but does not tell her that I am coming out to B. City. Mad at him. Then the old cheap hotel is transformed into a beautiful modern place with light colors and large windows. Shift: party at a hotel room where I see all the old B. City crowd, especially L.Z. (my other analyst). Sense of warmth and friendship. Moment of complete happiness as we talk in a corner. Then he must leave and I have to get on a plane. Shift: back in B. City where there is a heavy rain and I get terribly wet. I meet old grad students and friends at our old house. Then I walk to see my analyst, Dr. Smith, but feel very self conscious wearing shorts, blouse hanging out, long sheer stockings and high heels. Very inappropriately dressed and also dragging a blanket through the rain. Shift: At a party my C. City analyst Dr. Feingold appears, beautiful with silver hair wearing gorgeous gown, smiling, while I crouch under my blanket. "Now let us really get to work" after some delay.
