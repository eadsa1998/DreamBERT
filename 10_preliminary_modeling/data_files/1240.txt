I put daffodils in a crock in a tile, took a hammer and pounded them in like a nail. It mussed up their pretty faces. I was sitting next to an old man. In a large car, my father was driving, I found room far in the back. There was a baby somewhere. This old man was with an old woman, they were like grandparents. He was somewhat famous and knowledgeable but his speech was slow from age. Yet, I recognized him from my high school. I asked him if he ever had lived in M City. He smiled. He looked younger now. He said, "No," but I thought he was teasing me. I turned to him and said something. He kissed me. I turned my head and said, "Really!," pretending to be shocked. I was attracted to him.
