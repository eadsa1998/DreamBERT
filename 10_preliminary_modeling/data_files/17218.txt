Dream started out again as Sam and Quantum Leap.  Something hadn't worked right and we were going to walk a long trail back home.  Then it wasn't him anymore.  There were lots of people with me.  We walked partway down the path and there was..my long time classmate Jim Schumann and a fox.  Apparently he'd trained the fox. It dug a hole, pulled out a one-time use camera, and was going to take a picture of me.  I told it I'd rather have a picture of it.  It turned the camera around, snapped a quick one, and aimed it again at me.  I went back to the group.  Then I heard some farts, and a truck pulled up.  There were some black girls, and I started working with them on an odd crossword puzzle.  Later, my good online friend Del pulled up.  He took me to the passenger side and introduced me to someone named Herman.  One of the girls and Herman were Del's friends.  They cam for his spring break stay so they could move on afterwards, almost like a touring band.  Herman had on a military uniform.  There was a schedule laying in the front seat of all they were going to do.  Del went to move the truck.  He started pulling some cords like that of window blinds, creating more fart sounds to get my attention.  Then we took a walk.  He said something about wanting to bond with me, and I realized we still hadn't hugged yet.  I made a move to hug him, and woke up before I could.
