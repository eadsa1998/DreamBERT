I dreamt I was packing, getting ready to leave the dorm; only my bag was just the small purple one.  My old roommate Chelsea was there, getting my info or something.  We started to talk.  I was waiting for my boyfriend Jeremy.  She was complaining about her 100 relationships.  I told her I wouldn't know, I'm on my first.  She said no, it was my second marriage.  I heard a faint noise that I perceived to be a knocking and I ran downstairs.  I opened a door to the outside of the large boat.  Jeremy wanted to get something to eat, and suggested Thai.  We went to the area that looked like a food court.  We sat down at the center bar.  To my left I could see 'Canopi' food.  Things were put into the holes of these huge breads, making them tall and difficult to eat.  Beyond that was some space ice cream; bottles of color with spheres and lumps in it.  There was something similar next to it, and he ordered one of those, too.  Then we went outside. With a very religious girl and another guy, Jeremy asked for the next stop at an island with water pouring down the side.  It was a very colorful island.  We climbed on and as we went further in, where there were blocks and it looked like giant books.  The ground was still moist and slippery.  Jeremy was skating on it.  He had two wheels on each foot.  They did rent skates off in a little cave to the side.
