I was in a military headquarters in Nancy, France where I had served a number of years. I had the unpleasant duty of being officer of the day. I called a very good friend of mine to see if he would mind taking my place. I received no apparent answer. After being on duty for three days without relief (usual tour of duty - 24 hours) I approached the adjutaret and claimed that his duty roster was not correct. No answer was received. Then I tried to call someone else. I had his telephone number on a piece of paper in my mind. Each time I dialed, I received a wrong number. After an infinite number of calls I gave up. Later I helped a friend move to a new apartment and became completely exhausted. Everyone in the dream was male.
