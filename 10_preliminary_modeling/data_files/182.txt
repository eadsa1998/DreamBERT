I'm with my brother at a place like a hotel with a race track, and he wants to practice driving. It's rainy and getting dark. We walk over to the place where the cars are and we meet a couple of old friends from years ago. They're all going to get together later. My brother drives off, one of the other guys goes ahead, and the other guy and I decide to mosey back to the hotel. [I'm unsure if I wanted to go somewhere else or get my stuff out of my car and go in.] Just before we get there I realize he's got my car key. I'm very concerned about this and I wonder if I should go flag him down in the car or not. First I go back across the parking lot to look on the ground for it. No dice, and it's gonna start raining. Just about the time I start off to flag him down, I find the key in my purse. I'm relieved. Also: I'm with a girlfriend (we're both quite young, aren't we?), having left my house walking through the neighborhood, and we pass by this guy's house. He lives here, we think alone, and he's pretty good-looking. (Dark hair, 30's, well-built.) His door is open, and we're not sure if he's home, but we take it into our heads to look after his plants. We come on in, looking round a bit, and get to watering and futzing with the plants - he's got a lot, hanging and on stands and things, in pots. Nice place, eclectic, lots of high ceiling and air in, interesting shadows. He's here, actually, but doesn't mind what we're doing - he's something like a writer and not very social, but not unfriendly either. Doesn't pay us a lot of mind. But his plants do need attention. While we're here, a woman comes in, around his age, nice looking - surprised to see us here. I don't know her, but I think she may be his girlfriend, and I hope she doesn't think we shouldn't be here. She may think this is her job. I'm uncomfortable and I expect we should go.
