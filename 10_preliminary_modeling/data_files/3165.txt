I am with Jock and we are going to visit a writer at his house. Jock goes on ahead in a car and I lose him immediately. I stand on a grassy area where the road goes both left and right and I wonder which way Jock went. Someone says, "There he is." I look to the left and see his car parked at a house by the sea. I follow along and go there. Now I'm being given a tour of the house. Robin, the scriptwriter teacher, lives there with his wife. There are beautiful curtains that can be pulled down in six lovely different designs. A big window is present to see the lovely view. The ocean is off in the distance to the right, so when you want, you can go sit at the window and look at it. There is a kind of wooden tree fence which has spaces between each tree so you can still see the ocean, but it is not a totally open view. This seems a good thing. I admire this house saying, "If I had a house, this would be it." Jock tries to show me the different designs the curtains make. There is gray and pink wallpaper, but I wouldn't have chosen the swans on it. I love the colors, though.
