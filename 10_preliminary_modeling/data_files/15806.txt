I was out somewhere and I saw Lawson sitting at a bench. As we walked around we saw Cat was with him and was very pregnant. She was later walking around looking at these photos/head statues of rich people. She had her hair up in a wedding-like bun, had big red lips and was wearing a fitted dress. She was looking for names for her baby.
