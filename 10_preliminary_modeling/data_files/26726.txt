 I'm traveling on a road. I pass a baseball park where the Oak Valley team is playing; they are in the field. They are losing. The batter hits a stand up double. There is a cross-country race taking place. My friend Reed Maxwell is in it, as well as my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper and others. I float along this road, hovering three to five feet above it, going past people. I cheer for Armstrong High School. I get past the large group of people and am in the New South Wales bush, in an area with CCA duck boarding. I wait for my mom, my sister Ramona, and our neighbor Anna Gates. When they arrive I hug them and kiss Anna on the cheek, which is somewhat uncomfortable. I dive off the duck boarding and fly over the side about 30 feet. My friend Kevin Simpson is coming and I want to see him.
