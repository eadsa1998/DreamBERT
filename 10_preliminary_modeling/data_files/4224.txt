["Howard has a girlfriend."] Howard and I are in a park. He still wants us to get together again. I don't want to. I am packing my things in a back pack. Some of Dovre's things go in there too. She left them behind. Then his "mother" starts talking about a girlfriend he might go see. I feel a little jealous. I know she doesn't want us to get together. She doesn't like me. Conflicting feelings. I don't want him but I don't want someone else to have him. Then he tells me someone has parked in the Deputy Provost's spot. He wants me to report it. I walk toward the building to do so. Then a man comes toward me. I suspect it is the one who illegally parked and I turn and walk across the field. He follows. I then see an old fashioned black telephone on the grass. It is near where the bad man is. I bravely, but with fear, walk up to the phone to report him and then walk away hoping he doesn't hurt me. He looks at me menacingly but doesn't come after me.
