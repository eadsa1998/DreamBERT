I am at an inn over 100 years old. Across the street are some people and one of them is a woman who claims she was Alford Packer. (Packer was tried for cannibalism in the early history of a western state.) I get her to come into the Inn and I'm trying to interview her. My parents are there and so is my husband. He is making it difficult for me to interview the woman because he keeps putting her down.
