 I'm at the old Wendy's restaurant by the Uptown Mall. I'm waiting in a truck in the parking lot on the north side of the restaurant. My housemate's mother Isabelle Ramos has gotten out of the truck and gone inside. There is a man in another maroon truck nearby. A second man goes over to the passenger side of the truck and may get in. The truck drives over to the far east part of the parking lot. I pull my truck around the south side of the restaurant, where there are no vehicles parked. I go inside. Isabelle is talking to another woman, and asks where the truck with the two men inside went. I point eastward, and the woman communicates this with Isabelle. I'm in line to order. My mom and my sister Ramona are there. My mom is paying with a check, so I order a lot. I get a burrito meal: a roast beef and Swiss, with spices. We get our food, and there is some confusion, about which burrito is which, but the one with mushrooms must be my mom's I say. My roast beef and Swiss is a patty, and there is no bun on top of it. It comes in a clear plastic container.
