This girl, Locke (Lost) and I were on this island. There was a swimming pool and it had tides. There were bees around two guys and there was a weird psychic. I started going out with Hugh Laurie. I didn't see him for a while, and I met this doctor guy called Ethan Methowicz. This woman was taped to a pole. I was saving her and this wave came, but Locke saved me.
