Some children are going to show me the "life thing." They pull me into a room and are going to stand me up on a short platform but I want to be more important or higher, so I insist I stand on a dresser. I hold my arms up in the air and then notice a clingy sensation around the fingers of my left hand. I pull it down to look at it and am appalled. A thick spider's cocoon is wrapped around them and spider eggs are in there and hatching! I squirm to get it off me, and then I see there are snakes wrapped around me and termites or maggot insects on me. It is all nightmarish and scary and disgusting. I wish I'd never been so arrogant as to want to be higher. The children knew this and see I've learned my lesson and help pull off the snake. there is a strong sense of life among the decay - the seamy side of life.
