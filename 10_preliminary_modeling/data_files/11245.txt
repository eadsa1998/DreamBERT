I was just entering a dormitory on campus to call on a young lady. As I entered, I met, to my surprise, a very good friend of mine from my hometown. He was rather angry at me and would not speak to me. Just then a young girl whom I have not seen in at least 3 or 4 years came walking down the steps. She, also, was angry at me because she said we had seen each other on campus a few times, and I had not said anything to her. I jokingly took her in my arms and was kidding her about my not having ever seen her. At that moment the alarm rang. The fellow is a very good friend of mine, while the girl in the dream was and is a rather strange acquaintance. I went to school with her, never had any associations or interests toward her. Both people are the same age as I am.
