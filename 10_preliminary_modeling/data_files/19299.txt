The dream was of my best guy friend and I getting married, each owning the vehicle of our dreams and owning a huge mansion next door to Brad Pitt. I cheated on Jeff with Brad, but Jeff didn't care because he still loved me and was happy I told him about it. Then a giant monkey killed Jeff and Brad and I became a drunken widow.
