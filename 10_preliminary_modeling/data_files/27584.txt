I dreamed I was walking down a corridor in a University bldg. (One of which I had never seen before.) I met "E_____," one of the fellas I date. He ran over to me and tried to kiss me - He was with another girl who was "dressed up." She wore a black dress, pearls etc. I told him to stop bothering me and go back to his date. I told him at least I was the natural type (I was wearing bobby socks, skirt and sweater) and didn't get dressed up so "fancy" for class. As I was talking to him my best friend came down the hall with a fella. He looked exactly like "E_____" - but she called him "P_____." - The resemblance was amazing.
