I was going up to the observatory again.  The drive was different, though.  It was sort of below ground.  We got to a point.  I wasn't the only one going up.  I started telling the others of what it was like, about the cold.  It was a sort of open spot where I did this.  I sent my boyfriend Jeremy home there.  For some reason I woke up with the thought of it being Myst.
