I have a room full of people, a class or something. One of my students is a good-looking young man but he's a quad and he hates it. He has a bad attitude. He' withdrawn and hostile. Some girls come in, selling used books for $2.00. I buy one for him with his money. Then I buy one for me because it's such a bargain. I get too much change and quietly keep it. I have some guilt. It's Mexican pesos. I tell him that she liked him. She had smiled at him. He gets very angry! "Don't tell me that!" I grab his shoulders and shake him and pull him up so he has to look at me and say, "It's your attitude that's paralyzed, the disability is not the problem."
