The setting of the dream is a tall building of red brick. Inside are cages of chickens and ducks. A pharmacist about 50 years old, from the drug store that I work at on weekends and myself are crawling around inside the cages going from one to another. A fire breaks out in the lower part of the building and he advises me to use the fire escape but I decide to get down to the ground floor by means of an elevator. Two women, about 30, and I get down to the bottom level but the door jams and it is only after much struggling with it that it can be pried open enough for us to squeeze through to safety.
