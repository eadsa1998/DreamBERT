I was relieved to see Mrs. Brown at the next table since I was to join a group of four women who were to cook and eat together. Mrs. Brown explained to me that the paln was that each of us would take turns a day at a time. My turn would come next Thursday. I was worried since I am not much of a cook and wondered what they'd want for breakfast, asked for a recipe. Well I'd have four days to observe what the others prepared.
