There were several episodes with my wife Bonita and my daughter Christina and me going around various places.  I remember, for instance, sliding down a big hill towards a swimming pool or something.  No snow-just a hill covered with dry grass.  The only other thing I remember is Dede Schaffer giving me the news that Bonita had had another baby, and it was a girl.  I saw it, and it looked just like Christina.  I couldn't hold back the tears and started to cry, because we had had all the children we planned to have and didn't have a boy.
