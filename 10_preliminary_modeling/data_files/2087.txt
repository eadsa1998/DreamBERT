A man is in an antique shop and I'm thrilled they have a thing I've been wanting. The man says, "Just a minute," and goes away. I wait and wait, looking in drawers and seeing letters and poems and so on. I see him on a couch, talking unconcernedly with a woman. I walk over there to look at the books. He's a little embarrassed. I'm a little annoyed at him, keeping me waiting for no good reason. He points out some 45 records of Elvis of the 1950's. I almost decide to buy one, but decide I didn't really like him then, so why bother now? The man spills (pours) Pepsi down his shirt front and I laugh at his clumsiness.
