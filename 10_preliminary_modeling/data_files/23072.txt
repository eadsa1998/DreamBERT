My wife Bonita and I were in Germany.  We felt quite at home, having been there before, and we were trying to decide where to visit that we hadn't been before.  None of the cities sounded too interesting except Berlin.  We had more time for this visit, it seemed, than we had last time, so we could go just about anywhere we wanted to.  I was excited about the prospect of going to Berlin, but then remembered we would have to cross East Germany, and that was prohibited by my the agency restrictions.  Still in Germany, I think, I was visiting with Bertrand Therber at his house.  He had to go out for the evening, and I had to stay there with his mother, who was much younger and more attractive than in real life.  Oh yes, and Bertrand had wanted to go to a movie or some other such event, which I certainly didn't want to spend an evening in Germany doing, and I was surprised that he did.  I think his mother went to bed or something, and left me alone in the house, which was rather large.  I was a little scared at first, and went around shutting all the doors.
