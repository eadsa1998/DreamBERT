I was back at Bancroft Middle School, kind of, and I was in a stairwell, and there must've been ten alarm boxes all on the same wall. And some administrator was saying that when the alarm goes off, these doors locked, and then you were stuck in there for the next half an hour. People would tell me that the doors close to prevent the fire from spreading, but I was afraid they'd lock, too. I also dreamt that I got caught shoplifting that time, and I dreamt that I had stuffed some pens and scissors in my socks and walked out, and one white person and two black people were not going to let me pass. And I dreamt that a police officer came and put me in handcuffs and then I woke up. Never experienced this for real, not sure why I'd dream it. The next one I don't even remember.
