I was at a shop looking for posters of The Beatles and Monty Python, etc. I couldn't find any. Ezra and Emery were there too. I did find some Beatles bags but they were lame. Mom was also there. Ezra said that Dad had put all the Pokemon clothes together. He had a cool one. Only one of the rest sort of fit, but it was too tight and was green with a Pikachu on it. We were then at a house. Nana was there. She asked if I wanted something and I said that I didn't know what it was and she took out ice-cream tubs (like in the shops). There was pink and blue stuff and then white as well. She reached her hand into it and handed me some of the blue (it was light blue). I took some off with my finger and ate it and it was nice. Then there was green, which was nicer. She gave me an icypole thing but it was attached to seven others and they had to be eaten in order and the green one was third. Nana said to not eat more than one. I went to Ezra and Emery and they took the first two. A young James Spader was in a room. Dad and I were outside and had to climb up this big vertical net thing. When we got to the top we didn't know how to get over. I went through a hole and then Dad did. I don't know what happened then. Dad had a site and the address had INXS [something] and then a slash. I couldn't remember it and Dad was annoyed. My site had a background of space and stars and I had dreams on it. They were in a firey colour and it was hard to read. Dad complained about it. I said I was going to go to a list of dream characters and he was nervous about it. The page wasn't there though and he said he didn't want to see 'boys' there.
