I am teaching a class in an old high school. The room is very large with high ceilings. There are many students. I am teaching English or Language Arts. As I am lecturing, students talk among themselves. I get up and walk around. I am annoyed and raise my voice. I continue lecturing. They escalate their voices and move around in groups, deliberately trying to be disrespectful and belligerent. I raise my voice. I tell them they must sit down now. They ignore me. Now we are full blown involved in a power struggle. I am very angry. I threaten them. I demand. I continue to talk. They are more disrespectful. Finally I stop talking and write on the board they will all be suspended. Go to the principal. They are already (some of them) out in the hall. I tell them they must write a 2000 word essay on civil disobedience due on January 2nd. They will flunk if it isn't handed in. They are now converging on me. I am out of control. Holding in my anger just barely. I wake up, still feeling angry. I can't let go of the feelings.
