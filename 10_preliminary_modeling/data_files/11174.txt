I found myself in an apartment where I lived about 12 years ago of my life. Before I had a chance to look around, the landlady's daughter (35) came out and hugged me. This part of my dream was peculiar, because during all the years we lived in that apartment, this lady never cared for me. She took me up to visit our old suite of rooms. In reality the rooms are quite small and plain. In my dream the rooms were spacious, light and beautifully furnished. The sun seemed to be streaming into all of the rooms. There was a lady in the rooms whom I thought I recognized, but she wouldn't look at me, so I couldn't be sure.
