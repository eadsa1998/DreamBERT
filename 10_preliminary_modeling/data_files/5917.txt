Am in a stamp store waiting in a line of about six people to buy stamps. Appears to be a confused double line and next to me is a small and abnormally fat man, looking extremely uncomfortable. A man standing roughly in front of me appears to be a friend of fat man. The fat one gets annoyed with someone standing behind him and he then passes in front of me and stands with his friend. I feel sorry for the little guy. Later I have only one person in front of me, as a stranger walks in and stands close to front of line, near me, waiting to cut in when merchant and first man are through. This annoys me and I follow the transaction closely so I can cut in and command merchant's attention before stranger cuts in.
