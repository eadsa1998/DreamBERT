I went to a restaurant that had a billiard room in it to meet one of my boyfriend's friends from his soccer team. This restaurant was a place that my boyfriend was working at in the dream. My boyfriend saw me and asked what I was doing there, and I said that I was here to meet his friend to play pool. My boyfriend told me to wait a minute and he would join us because he was just getting finished with work. I said OK, but I felt disappointed because I wanted to do something by myself. I was always waiting for him to be free to go out and at that moment I wanted him to wait for me.
