I was at this house and we were making a movie and there was a killer who killed us and the killer had keys and I said, "Don't kill me and I'll just fake being dead because that's like part of the movie". And the killer killed some other people. Then there was the steal killer and he stabbed me in the head but I was still alive and I saw the mark the killer made from the stab and it was cool, it was like scratches on my face. [Mark then said, "I liked the dream because it was like a movie"]
