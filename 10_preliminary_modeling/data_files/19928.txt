I was on the street, and I heard my name called. The voice came from the second floor window of a hospital building where I was a patient. I climbed the fire escape. A teenage boy was there and he had the patients' records kept by the doctors. I asked him to read mine and tell me what it contained. He said he'd go inside and look for them, and come back later.
