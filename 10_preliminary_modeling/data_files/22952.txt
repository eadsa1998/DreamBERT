I was at someone's house with a lot of relatives-maybe it was where Uncle Jack used to live in my hometown.  The only two people I remember are Patty and "her twin sister."  They looked so much alike that I had to ask them which was which.  I don't remember the other one's name.  We were sleeping on something like a screened-in porch, with them just on the other side of a low partition from me, or on the other side of a large, low, open window.  I was sitting up in bed talking to them, and I took the liberty of putting my hand in the tops of their pajamas and feeling their breasts.  One had breasts about the size of my wife Bonita's; the other's were noticeably smaller.
