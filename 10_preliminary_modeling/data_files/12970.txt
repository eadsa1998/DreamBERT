I was on an excursion. We missed the bus and had to drive there and were late. It was some wine testing thing. I was wondering why we were doing wine testing. We had to pick a name but the instructions didn't make sense so I picked a really long one. Someone said something about a "sky of Milo". There was a book which was full of Heroes pictures and there were lots of Milo Ventimiglia. Calvin was next to me and Samantha was sitting on my other side. We had a quiz later to remember the names that everyone picked. Calvin's name was Nubu. I tasted this wine whose name was the name I'd picked and it was really hot. It burnt my skin too and everyone was throwing up from it. There were no booklets left, to mark off each wine which also described each one, so I had to tell this woman. She was all fancy like and looked like the Petrelli mother (Heroes). She was a cow. She didn't come until it was over. We had to stay until 1.30am to buy wine. Evelyn said "I can stay till four". We were sitting near the bags and I went to sit down near Eugene's bag, thinking about taking stuff, but then he came and took it. Calvin was sitting with Genevieve.
