Blackbirds, with suckerfish mouths.  My mother and I were getting in the car to go to the furniture store.  My elementary school classmate Tate wanted to come too.  We were parked in front of a police station.  There were 2 of the sucker birds, a mother and son.  They had a problem.  There was another, cocky black bird with a pointed beak.  The two birds got inside.
