I am seated in a chair with a man. We are watching a Chinese play involving a woman who discovers another woman who is rich is her cousin. She tries to tell the woman of the relationship and is rebuffed. It's all in Chinese. I try to interpret it for the man. The play stops in the middle. A woman (Chinese) says they should never have attempted to pretend to be on TV. So it's time to cleanup our picnic mess and go to our hotel room. I am surprised to notice that I am sexually interested in the possibility of going to bed with him. I think, "Well, that's unusual," and agree that if the feelings go away, then I won't, but if the feelings stay, we'll make love! Then I get domestic and clean up his area and then go to my kitchen and clean up. I am surprised again that I can do this. It feels pleasant. I cut up hot dogs and stuff them with more hot dogs and put them in baggies. I offer him a lemon meringue pie, asking if he likes them. He says "Yes, but what about the cherry pie we bought?" I didn't have to go to that trouble. I laugh and say, "Let's invite the other couple over and help us eat it."
