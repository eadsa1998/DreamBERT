It was the last day of my assignment at ITI. There was an error in my paperwork. I think it was related to my final paycheck. It was in my favor but I wanted to get it corrected before I left. I was trying to find the right person to take care of it, but kept get passed around from one person to another. I spoke to Tanya D. They were cleaning out storage closet that had once been an employee locker room, for coats and personal items. They wanted to return it to a locker room. There were several people working in there, and I was in there with them.
