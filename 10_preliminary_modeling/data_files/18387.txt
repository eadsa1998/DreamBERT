I was in a dental chair in order to have some cavities filled, and the dentist was Nick Olson, a graduate student at a nearby university who was in Psychology that I knew reasonably well, and I was quite surprised that he was now in dental school. He was still a student dentist, and he was trying to fill this particular cavity for me. So he put a little Xylocain on my gum, a little Novocain on my upper front gum left; waited a few minutes for that to take effect, and then he put some cotton stuff in my mouth that would absorb moisture. Then he got up and left for a while. I wandered around a little bit. Then we were back in the dentist chair again and he had to put some Novocain in the upper left side of my jaw near the front. He had this very large hypodermic syringe and he told me to take the point and stick it in as far as I wanted to. So I didn't like the idea, but I did partly, then told him to push it in the rest of the way if I wasn't sure. It hurt just a little bit, but I was already partially numb. So he pushed in some more and then injected it, the major part of the syringe, and now as I look back at it, it must have been about 30 cc, which is astoundingly large, but I just thought it was a little large in the dream. Then he went ahead and drilled out the cavity in my left front tooth, filled, it, and then about the only major thing about this dream that I remember, the waiting room was right there where the dental chair was too. The number of people of waiting varied from one or two people up to about 30 people. It seems they were all waiting to be worked on in this chair also. I was there for almost all the day, and so their wait was in vain.
