It concerned itself with my selling my car, which is a small European car, and buying a very large used truck. The truck was a dump truck and it had all sorts of extra pedals that I didn't exactly know what to do with, but there were standard brake, clutch, and accelerator for driving in standard gears. There were several gadgets I worked which didn't seem to do anything. I drove carefully in driving it because it was so large. I seemed reasonably happy to have bought this truck at the time of the dream.
