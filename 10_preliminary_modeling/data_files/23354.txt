I came along Central Ave. and reached a house which seemed to be the one next Mr. B's. I noticed with surprise that some accident, perhaps an explosion, had occurred there. Windows and ornamental woodwork had been shattered. In a moment I was horror struck to see in the front room downstairs a young woman seated stiffly upright just within the window; her fixed, wide open eyes and expression of congealed terror convinced me she was dead. As I stood gazing at her, I became conscious of a movement upstairs, and, glancing up, I saw another woman walking about in the room directly over that containing the corpse. I made gestures to attract her, striving to have her understand that there was something amiss below, and shortly she hurried down and came out of the front door. As soon as she stepped upon the piazza, she turned toward the window which opened on it, then, catching sight of the dead, she started and fell in a faint. This was too much or my nerves and I woke in a tremble.
