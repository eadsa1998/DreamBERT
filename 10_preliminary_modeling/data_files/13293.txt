I was watching Arrested Development, except it was set at home. Oscar Bluth, except he was called something else, came over. I couldn't remember which one was the 'real' one. He wanted to play some game on the computer. I then remembered George Bluth was the proper one and I said no. Then I was Lucille. George Bluth came back and saw that Lucille and Oscar Bluth had had sex and Lucille was saying to someone that Oscar Bluth was much nicer.
