My parents, myself and some other kids have moved to a Mansard style house. I am single and a young adult. I want to have my own apartment but realize I have to live at home because of finances, at least for awhile. There is a nice attic with a tall ceiling and all the junk is up there. I tell my mother I am going to fix an office for myself there and get all the old books sorted out so I can have them where I can find them for research. Lot of old clothes are there also, but I will get those cleaned up too.
