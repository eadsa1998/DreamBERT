In part of the dream I was arguing with my now ex-roommate, I think I was with friends but I can't remember any facts. I think I was in our apartment, I don't remember seeing anything distinct about it, but the setting felt comfortable. She is the same age as me, and female. I think we were arguing about her leaving, I wanted her to go and she was refusing. Then she said or did something and I began to physically hit or fight with her. It was horrible. I just kept hitting her and hitting her, then I could feel myself sleeping. I was trying to wake myself up, because I felt so horrible and I was actually crying when I woke up.
