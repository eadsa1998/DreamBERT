I am the head resident of a sorority and we are having a party. I am dressed up in a lovely long skirt and blouse. I walk up the flowing stairs and around watching. Now the men are arriving. Someone says, "Oh, oh. It isn't good to just open the dance to any man off the street." I see quite a crowd of them streaming in. They are rowdy and I am more busy being vigilant. I go to my quarters and get the key to the front door from my purse and hide my purse and then put the key in my pocket. Now Anddrea comes in and a shy young man named Ted. Andrea begins to work with him as a counselor. There is an audience of students watching. He is shy and we both encourage him to tell his dream. Andrea lays down next to him talking in soothing accents. He begins to tell the dream and then interrupts himself and says, "Oh, I get it. The answer is money. I need to make lots of money with my writing." Some man smiles and gently shakes his head no.
