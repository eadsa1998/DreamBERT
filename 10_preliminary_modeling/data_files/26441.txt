 There is a famous young actor: a handsome movie star. He is driving a 1950's sports car, driving 180 miles per hour on a highway. He is driving in northeast Australia, but I know this to be northwest Australia, going cross-country. He comes up to an intersection, and then seems to be driving a white camper, which may have a trailer. I'm behind the vehicle in a vehicle of my own, or I am a vehicle, which seems to be gray. The white camper goes off the road, though a "T" intersection, and up a hill into trees. The actor dies. I don't think that I'll make the right turn at the "T", but I do. I'm on a bicycle. I ride on cinder blocks over a stream. My bicycle falls into the muddy stream. I like the water. I feel spontaneous by enjoying the cool water. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in the water too. My camera is there, and it gets wet in the water.
