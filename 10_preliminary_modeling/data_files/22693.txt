I was on the balcony of my house when I saw a girl I don't like very much passing by. She asked me if I had seen her friend, and I told her I hadn't seen her. I saw her with short hair in the front; she looked good, but when she left, I saw her hair long in the back. Then I saw my boyfriend coming towards me with his arms opened, with his two nephews and his sister. At home the three of us started to talk and the children played with Mother and Grandmother.
