I was on my grandparents' farm in N-- C--. I was walking through the woods when I came upon my blind uncle. I helped him back to the house, and he asked me to stay there two or three days longer, instead of going to I as I planned. I told him no, that I was leaving as already planned. My aunt, 40, came into the picture then, and we had some sort of an argument about the younger generation.
