 I'm driving with my mom and my sister Ramona. We go up a steep hill, but the new car makes it. It is winter. There is a frozen lake. The land is dry and frosted: crunchy. I comment about going on the lake: I wouldn't go there without a truck. Later, we're in a pub-like place. Some fish are mounted in the place.
