Ross from Ireland baked cookies--two about 4 inch by 8 inch oblong-rectangles. One dark molasses, the other tan. Both cut into little rectangles and I assumed more for ceremonial bread than for eating. The tan cut into even neater and smaller rectangles the size of sugar cubes. As he picked it up to distribute it as at the Mass, it suddenly became five layers thick, beautiful and golden tan, too precious to take and break up its perfect geometric shape. He passes among us and we admire its beauty.
