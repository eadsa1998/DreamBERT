I was supposed to play next and some guy claimed that he was supposed to play next, and so I was arguing with him. Then for some reason or another I went outside and started picking weeds, real tall, high ones. There was a fence there and the word came, "Pull the weeds." Walked around the fence, and the guy was still at the table waiting for him to write the (bowl?), and I was saying to myself, "I hope he wins and then I'll beat him bad," or something like this. I was really emotionally angry. [Were you angry at the guy?] Yeah, quite mad because I said to him, "You know I got orders," and he said, "No, you don't." I do. I says, "You know how long I've been waiting." He says, "Yeah, but do you know how long you played?" I said, "I've been waiting here since 7 o'clock, whatever it is, which is about an hour and a half." So it went on like this. That's when I woke up. I got half way around the fence pulling weeds. Most likely I went outside to pull weeds to expel my temper or just get rid of it on something other than hauling off and slugging the guy. This had happened that day in the sense that this is probably just a retake of what happened to me this evening, but it wasn't quite as bad. There were three others in the dream, two fellows that were playing and then at another table there was, I believe, only one fellow. There was no distinct scene or recognition. It was as if I was over at Eaton Hall where they have the pool tables. I was standing looking right at them, arguing with him. It was this one fellow and when I went outside, I looked back at them pulling weeds. It was someone else. It wasn't the same person as far as face, but I referred to him as being the same person, so it was just somehow or another the face of the person changed. I do recognize the faces as far as being some fellows who shoot at the union, but it wasn't the face of the fellow I had actually got in a small argument with tonight.
