I met Margie S., a friend from work. I loved her and she loved me. I was hugging and kissing her. She was now fat. We met again and we were in bed. We were loving up. I covered us under the bed covers and I started to intimate her. She had a baby and came to our house by Grandma's. My mother, sister and brother Steve were there. I called them in from the front room and introduced Margie as my friend. I was further away now and Margie was changing her baby. As she was bending over, I said I could see her boobies because her dress fell away from her bosom. Judy and Margie's babies were playing and Judy fell over hers and got hurt. There were lions outside and they were running wild. One was coming at me. I ran and made a jump up on the perch on one side of the building and perched there. The lions could jump that high, but I was prepared with something I had that I could knock them away as they came at me thru the air. A couple tried it, but didn't jump at me.
