I was a patient. I was leaving with a group for the dining hall. I had to put on my shoes. When I looked up, the others were gone. I did not know the way to the dining hall, and I wondered how I would get there. (When I awoke, I wondered why the hospitals in all my dreams were hospitals that I had never seen in real life. Many, I recalled, had thick walls like a monastery.)
