I was doing a movie, but for a scene, some guy had to perform oral sex on me. When he did, no-one was around. He did it for ages, but not much was happening, I was just very wet with saliva down there, which was gross. He stopped and told the director, who then replaced him with Hurley (Lost). I walked out before he got there. I complained and they said "well, don't you like Bradley Cooper?" and I said "Yeah I do like Bradley Cooper". I was telling Ezra about the casting and how a fat, old director casts an old, fat actor and a young, thin director casts young, thin actors. The director of this movie was Judd Apatow. Later we were doing something in these woods and talking about camping. Something happened with a dog.
