Acquaintance-F-01 stole our digital camera and took photos. I got really angry and chased after her and strangled her to death. I was swinging from buildings by electricity wires [like Spiderman]. The city was near the sea. There were big waves. I landed on a big hill at a park. Cedric was walking up the hill and I fell in love with him. Then we walked over to the side of something near the sea. A big wave knocked us into the water. I grabbed him and we swam back to shore.
