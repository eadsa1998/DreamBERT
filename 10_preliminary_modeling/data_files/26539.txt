 There is a large wooden pirate-like ship with large sails. The captain sees a problem with the ropes for the sails, from a distance, and he yells and quickly goes to correct the sail problem. The sails are lifted up all the way, and then let swing down, all in a plane, attached to a rope. The problem is caught and people try to fix it, but it takes some time. The captain says the last six ships with this problem sank! The boat spins in circles and gets out of the predicament.
