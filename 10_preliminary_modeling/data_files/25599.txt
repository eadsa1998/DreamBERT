 I'm at a lake. Someone is fly-fishing. I get the rod and start casting. The lake is rectangular. I cast about 20 yards out but realize I could have gotten it there a lot easier by going to the opposite shoreline. The cast landed about five yards from the other shore. The big yellow fly I am using is very near the other shore. A fish hits the fly. It is a huge largemouth bass, which is fighting well. I think it looks like about 10 pounds! My mom is holding the rod. I scramble to grab the net. My dad is there, and picks up the fish without a net. I'm worried it might get off the line, but it doesn't. I hold the fish. It is not a very big fish, maybe a pound and a half.
