I was walking down K-- when two men passed by in a truck. A small boy began to annoy me. He screamed and kicked and said he would only be satisfied if I would give him my leopard-trimmed dress coat which I was wearing. The two men tried to tear him away from me but I finally had to give in and give him the coat. He took it and gleefully threw it in the gutter. I proceeded to a dinner with the two men. It was at a large beautiful home. The little boy was there too.
