I was laying in bed.  I worked at a rest home, and I guess I either lived there or was taking a nap.  I was lying there after waking up and an old woman wearing lipstick kissed me on the cheek.  She was very childlike.  She introduced herself and said she wanted to be called Loga.  She sweetly explained to me that unless I treated her like a child, she would not respond to me.  Another woman who worked there came up and was going to update me on clients as a shift change, and when she got to "Loga" I said I already knew, and worked with Loga with relative ease.
