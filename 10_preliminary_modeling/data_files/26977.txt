In my dream, I first saw a group of girls standing in front of a school building. One of the girls I recognized as a high school and church friend. She was laughing and singing along with the other girls, who were all standing in a circle. The group of girls stood there for a few minutes and then ran away from the building. I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a sewing basket and removed a cloth, with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors, and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him.
