I was going to be the sound technician at somebody's wedding, and then I realized that it was Sandra's wedding instead of Zane and Chelsea's wedding like we're planning. And Sandra was in town staying with us and we were hanging aaround and it was like 2:30 in the afternoon and the wedding was supposed to be at 4:00. And I had to get all my stuff together and hurry up and get over there, and I got over there finally in time. And Sandra took me up in the church to show me their sound board and I was kind of assessing it and everything, and Sandra is standing in front of the window that overlooks the church, you know how sound booths have, and she's standing in front of this window to keep other people from seeing in. She's kind of pointing things out here and there, and then up comes the pastor of the church in his loud preaching voice, up into the booth and says, "Now who is doing what up here?" And then I woke up.
