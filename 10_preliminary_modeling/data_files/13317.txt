I was watching this awards show and Michael Cera was on it. He was older and looked wog-like. He didn't speak very good English. He had rings on and I was like 'ew'. Alia Shawkat was angry at him. I looked my name up on the internet and something came up about Michael Cera having a crush on me and that we were having a baby and I was like "What the hell?!".
