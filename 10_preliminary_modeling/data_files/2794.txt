I am on an airplane sitting near the back. Mary, ex-roommate, sits near me. We are observing a man up front that says it's OK to throw people off the plane if they annoy you. He opens the door and tosses someone out. Mary and I look at each other, a bit concerned. Now the plane is gone and we are traveling low to the river. I am seated on a four legged high bar stool kind of thing and wearing a pretty dress. Howard and another man are seated behind us and everywhere we look fish are jumping or swimming and Howard really wants to fish. It's driving him crazy to be so close to it and not be able to do it. A fish jumps into my skirt and I laugh and say I'll net them. We travel on. Now the river is a road and we stop (we are not in a car, but travel like we are). I see the railroad signal and say, "Stop, a train is coming." We stop and then I say, "Go on a few more feet," and we do, so we are between two sets of tracks. I then get concerned because what if I miscalculated and the train uses that space and we get squashed? But we are OK. Two sets of railroad cars come out of tunnels in front and behind us. One set of cars does not couple right as the train drives up to it and I watch, worried. It tries three or four times, and then finally the metal tongue of one car clicks into the slot of the other car. I am relieved. Now my girls are with me and we decide to shower. We all have our clothes on and I say, "I hope they dry fast." The stream of water from the shower head is thin and small. Dovre gets in front of me and a man, naked, is behind me, Howard or perhaps Tony (of dream group). He has a soft penis and wants to cuddle, spoon fashion. So the girls shower and he cuddles and then they all leave. And now I'm watching two young teen girls, one crying that she's very frustrated because she had been turned on and now there's nothing. What is she to do? There is a bulge near her pubic area like a scrotum sac. They stand near a river.
