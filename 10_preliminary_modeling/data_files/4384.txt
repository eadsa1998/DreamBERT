["Aliens destroying the spaceship."] Captain Janeway is in a large room which is a part of the spaceship. Chacotay is there as well. He gets frustrated at something and throws a ceramic planter against a wall. It smashes. Janeway stands up and looks at him as I to commiserate with his frustration. But he needs to get it together now. The coffee break is almost over. She then pulls out a pack of cigs and lights one. She remembers she is inside and steps out the door to the city sidewalk and smokes the cig. She looks at her watch and realizes it is 11:05, five minutes late. She throws the cig down and begins to go back in. Then she realizes she can't leave a burning cig out there and steps on it. She rescues her last remaining unlit cig from the crumpled pack and walks back in. Now she becomes aware that there are nearly invisible aliens in there and they are making holes in the walls and ceilings. Plaster crumbles from the ceiling exposing a hole. A hole develops in the fireplace backwall. This is serious damage. Then she looks outside and two tall buildings, one a city skyscraper and the other the spaceship are being melded together. Tall giant aliens that look like people are walking around the area. They are destroying the spaceship.
