[1997-06-20] I dreamt that I was in school again and that guy who committed suicide a few years ago was there and we were listening to a sewing machine on headphones for some odd reason and then he got into trouble because he was trying to do something, rather, my headphone cord got stuck between the needle and the sewing machine motor so I had to rip that out. Then suddenly my sewing machine was moved to another place in the room, magically it seems, and I was sewing some sort of towel and I was trying to go straight, and I couldn't go straight for some odd reason so I had to remove things to make it go straight, very strange.
