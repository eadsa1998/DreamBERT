The girl complains to the child of the noise he is making moving chairs and tables around and tells him to leave. I explain that he has settled down now and can stay. I try to continue reading to her but she wants to do other things first. I tell her I get tired waiting for her, then she gets so impudent that I turn her across my knee and spank her. After a few hits, I lift her skirts.
