I am back at our B. City apartment and meet our upstairs neighbor again. He is very friendly and embraces me. Also meet an old woman who wants to stay at our house. She is the original tenant, lan dlady? We go to the garden and she asks to urinate into the fish pond! Shift: Edward is offered a job in Mississippi. Two men take us down there in the rain. Dismal and terrifying. Shift: On the way to L. City there is a heat wave and a snow storm! "I guess there is snow (pain) wherever you go." It is again beautiful and calm.
