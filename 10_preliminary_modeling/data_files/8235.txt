I was with Matthew standing at a register in a store. He was standing to my right. Eight or nine times someone came up and stood to Matthew's right. Each time it was an actor. Matthew would nudge me and point out who it was. One time it was Robert Uhlrich. I haven't seen him act in a few years but I used to think he was very handsome and hearing about some of his community work representing some illness I've also respected that work. I introduced myself to him and told him it was quite a pleasure to meet him that I've been a fan.
