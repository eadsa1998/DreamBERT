Russia took over our country and they started to work on us, making slaves of us and taking away everything. Grandpa was prisoner, was to be executed in three weeks. I went out and I noticed I was followed (shadowed). I thought I would get around a corner and fly away. I found out I was might. I could fly, make myself disappear, could not be shot and I was might. I started to work on the communists. I pushed them off walls, got them by the feet and whipped them on the ground and threw them at a distance. I was tried to be killed by their gunner. He tried to shoot me, but couldn't see me. I roared above them and they all fled. The gunner and his partner hid from fright. I saw their feet stick out from the hiding place. I yanked him out and whipped him on the ground and killed him. I was master of them and they were sure because they were afraid of me. A woman was denouncing our government. I got hold of her and tossed her across the street.
