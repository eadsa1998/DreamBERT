I was in my parents' house checking email, and somehow or other the dream got transferred to some kind of workplace. One of my coworkers was a black woman and I discovered to my horror that somebody had sent her a message IN MY NAME inviting her to a movie and calling her a nigger. In my parents' house I found a dream notebook containing several lost dreams, or dreams I thought I had lost forever. I sat down at the computer to type these out in email for Jimmy; that's when I discovered the email thing. Well, it changed into an office and I went to apologize to the woman and explain how appalled I was about the message, that I would change my password. I saw a large poster of a middle-aged man with a moustasche above her desk. Supposed to be her father. The caption read: DADDY IN A BAD MOOD: WATCH OUT! There was the same picture with caption on the desk. <br/
