I was at a shop. Mom was there. We were there to do a drug deal. Then a fat blob (literally) came and we hid from it. I was with someone, who later was Calvin, and we were crawling and running from the blob. It caught up with us and said it had its stuff. I left. I was trying to call Mom to pick me up but she didn't answer. I was waiting outside and Evelyn was there and she said she'd get her car and get us.
