The end of the dream was again, this time it was an airplane carrying the boss, the boss of a company, something like this and was landing at the airport. Every time it seems I'm part of the controls as far as following it in, guiding it and such. We were just watching it. The executive was old, not old but 60's, baldheaded, heavy a little bit, not heavy, just a little. Just a typical-looking executive boss. By controls I was referring to it's almost like sitting up in the control tower watching the airplane land down on the field. However, I didn't see a setting that would represent a control tower. It was just the position I was in and the anxiety that I seemed to have as the airplane came in. These anxieties weren't anything different than a normal person watching a plane come in. They were in the other dream also of the airplane.
