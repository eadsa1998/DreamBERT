A room with double doors sliding. In the doorway in the Dutch house my father's elder brother is standing, dressed as a bon vivant. He has a fight with Mammie, my mother. I take his side. I forget what the fight is about. I see my uncle with a foulard draped around his neck and a checkered suit possibly with knickerbockers, as if he were dressed for the Mardi Gras he used to love so much. I storm out. At the door I see Pappie, my father, sitting on a couch. I look at him and decide that I haven't seen him for so long, I'd better stay. He had been very ill and had almost died, but he hadn't. I go over to the couch, which is at the opposite side of the door. I hug him and tell him how much I love him.
