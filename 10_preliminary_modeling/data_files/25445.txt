 I'm at Many Fish Lake. I'm walking on the south end of the lake. I am on a sort of a fence or a wall. The land abruptly ends there, and appears to be five or six feet deep where the wall is. I crawl along the wall. I see a huge northern pike. I see lots of big northern pike. I see at least four fish that are over 10 pounds, probably over 20 or 25 pounds! As I near them on the wall they scatter into the weeds below. One of my friends is there. It may be Kevin Simpson. I yell for him to cast his fishing rod over towards where I point. He does. He has a sucker minnow on his line for bait. As the minnow sinks, I yell at him to twitch the rod to give the bait action. I can see the fish around the minnow. One fish grabs it. The fish jumps out of the water. It is huge! It is a dolphin, I think. Kevin's line breaks. We didn't have strong enough line.
