Last night I was having some pretty interesting dreams. First I dreamed that Mom and Dad, Uncle Carl, and maybe Aunt Joyce. We were all at Westportr's Church. And we, I didn't know that Mr. Dawson was the organist; I didn't know who the organist was. And for some reason we were sitting way in the back and I felt really bashful. You know how it is when the family only comes to church once a year. They were giving people like party favors as they were leaving, like a tape and a hat and a brochure, hoping they'd study it and come back. I was thinking to myself how the organ was in the same position as the sound booth at my high school auditorium. You not only had to go up to the balcony, but you had to go way up to the top. It was in a little extra room. Then, next thing I knew, it turned into Westportr's Cathedral, and the organist there was some lady that wasn't anyone in particular that I know. She was saying that I could come and practice and get to the organ, and I could come and listen to the services and see how they went. It was all empty and she was showing me around. She showed me that up in the chancel, behind the choir stalls and behind some heavy curtains, there was this boat horn like thing, like Uncle Larry (Aunt Janice's husband) had on his boat. She said, "This is really loud, if you touch this, it's going to BLARE!" But the light switch was right over there, so you had to go over there to turn on the lights in the chancel. We never did get to the organ because then there were some other people going by and saying, "Hi, nice to meet you." Somebody had a dog, and I was sitting on a couch. The dog jumped in my lap. And I was sitting and petting the dog. He was really sweet. He was a black dog, not real big, about the size of Bella I think. And that's all there was to it.
