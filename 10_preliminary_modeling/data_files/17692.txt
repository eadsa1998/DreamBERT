My boyfriend Jeremy and I were leaving my parents' house.  As we drove by the park, there was a man who looked familiar- it was my high school Japanese teacher.  I remembered that it was Memorial day, and they were probably having a picnic to celebrate.  There were quite a few kids running around wearing blue shirts.  We went back to the house and a bunch of the kids clamored inside through a shuttered window.  Inside, this was not my parents' house.  I had to go to the bathroom and found one in the corner of a girl's room.  Everything was mauve-pink, and there was an Oriental rug on the floor; I thought it was a strange combination.  There was something wicker, as well.  I sat on the toilet, which was slanted forward, and went to the bathroom.
