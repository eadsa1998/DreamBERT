Some girl was asking my girlfriend and I where and how, what kind of tests, this particular teacher I have just had this last semester, what kind of tests he gives, because she was very worried about how she would do on her final. While she was still asking, my girlfriend was telling me that we had to tell the girl exactly the right kind of test to take. I remember one scene with the professor standing up in front speaking of lettuce for some reason. We were sitting in a room kind of giving signals, the three of us, the girl, my girlfriend, and I, about what might be on the test.
