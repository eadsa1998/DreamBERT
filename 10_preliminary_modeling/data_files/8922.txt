The SAID sponsor committee. Some kind of document, or information, that most people don't see and something about the difficult things that need to stay hidden from most people. I either need to make sure I keep it to myself or we need to make sure it stays within a very small group of people. There was something about recognizing people close to us, like family members who support us during the difficult parts of being an SAID volunteer. Recognizing how important that support is, how much we value it. I said something about someone in my life. I don't recall identifying who that someone was. I have a sense that it wasn't Matthew, but it had to be him. I said something about him being my torch bearer. As soon as I said it I realized how accurate it was. It made me that much more aware of how important that person is and how much I value their mental and emotional support, especially with this part of my life. It was related to him even just listening and how valuable that is to me and wanting to recognize him for that, to make sure that he knows how valuable that is to me, how important it is to me.
