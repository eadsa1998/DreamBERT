["Respect in relationship."] Ginny is going to the coast with Ernie for a weekend to celebrate their anniversary. I am negotiating with a man similar to Perry of Uni House. We are beginning a relationship of love and we want to talk about what our priorities are. We agree that respect is the most important. Treating each other with respect at all times. We agree that love is also important. After that, we can't think of any more priorities. Respect is so important it over shadows the others. We are happy with each other.
