I was with a boy about my age and an old woman. We were in a flat field. A storm was coming up and I noticed that the clouds were beginning to swirl and twist. I thought the wind and clouds indicated a tornado was coming upon us. I knew we had to hurry to shelter. I asked the boy to help me get the woman to a shelter. We tried to help her but she could not move and we couldn't carry her. I knew we would have to go far to find a shelter and I didn't think we could reach a shelter before the storm hit, but I wasn't frightened. There was more, but I can't remember what it was.
