I needed to bring my birth certificate and some stuff to school for something. I told Dad about it. I got there and went to the 'gym'. I asked "is Mr Billings here?" and they said "no". I was then at home and something was on next that I said to Ezra I might watch. Something came on which had these nails but had a drip of fake blood on them. There was an insect that was huge and had this yellow and black end on it. I told Ezra it was a bee but he didn't care and I realized it couldn't be a bee. I can't remember it properly but some and others and I went into this dodgy place to save some friends. There were desks set up outside like a classroom. I had to crawl past and then there was like an entrance. There were kids guarding it. I grabbed a metal pole with a pentagon shape. They pretended to feel threatened and I hit them. This guy got an axe but I hit him with the pole. We got caught then I think. I was then in a room with this guy and a bad guy and lady. The guy said he didn't have to 'fix?' the room. They let us go. I said it was like Marlon Brando and he said he saw some guy and I said it was Marlon Brando (I don't remember it now, so I have no idea what I was talking about). I think I got out and went back with a girl. We crawled past the desks again and now there were old people. We got to the fence surrounding it and realized that we got caught and allowed to leave so that we would come back. My friend accidentally told this old lady and they realized we had escaped and so I said we had a girl on the inside. Someone was called William.
