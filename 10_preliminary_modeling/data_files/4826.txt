["Ginny and Charla."] I am visiting somewhere, maybe a motel or resort. Ginny and Charla are outside lying in the grass sunbathing. I am trying to pack up things. Then I see Ginny and several people standing inside another room. They are about to try some physical trick, like shooting something and hitting a target. I pretend I am some kind of observer. I am in a small life raft in a tiny pool of water. I am lying on the raft and smash up to the wall near them. Then I paddle back because they aren't doing anything yet. I smash up against the other wall and turn and approach them again. This keeps repeating. I say outloud I hope this doesn't change the test results. I feel like I'm spying and very obvious which will change the activity and therefore the results.
