Some people were helping us move.  I think they were colleagues from both universities in our former home town, but I don't remember anyone for sure except Sarah.  A moving van had pulled up outside our new apartment, and things were being unloaded pretty quickly because there were so many hands.  I was totally unprepared and was desperately looking around to determine where everything would go.  It was soon apparent that the place was much too small for all the stuff, and I was in a panic as to what to do with it. There was a lot of little junk, too, that, when I took a look at it, I immediately threw away.  I also thought I should get rid of all the audio cassettes, but just couldn't bring myself to do it.  The apartment seemed to have only two rooms.  There were several doors, but they all seemed to open into other people's quarters.  One opened into a ballet studio.  Another opened into a nursery, which was separated from our lodgings by a curved glass wall covered with a curtain.  I was depressed that not only would we not have enough space for our belongings, but we wouldn't have any privacy either.
