I was in a swimming pool and saw Tina Mayo there with one of her daughters.  The pool was on different levels.  She was almost ready to go back to work.  Maybe at the same swimming pool, there was a snake in the water-then I saw another one.  I got out and looked for something to hit them with.  I found a long tree limb.  Before I could get back to the pool, I encountered first one and then the other on land.  I hit them and killed them, cutting them in half and ensuring that the cut was close to their heads.  One of them was left with its mouth open wide, just like in a picture that was also in the dream.  There were lots more to kill, but when I started back to the pool, there was a door, and the door was over a slippery slope; I was afraid if I went through I would slide down and into the water.
