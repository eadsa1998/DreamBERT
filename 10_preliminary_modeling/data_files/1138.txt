Someone steals my wheelchair, the new neighborhood boys who live in apartment #9. They laugh at me. I feel angry. I run after them. I feel angry because I can't run well and they know it, so as I chase after them, I feel embarrassed, trapped, and manipulated. Then I notice I can run very well! I catch up with him and hop up in his lap. He laughs. I grab his glasses off his face and say, "Give me back my chair or I'll bend your glass frames until they break." At first, he laughs because he doesn't think I'll do it. As I start to do it, he believes me. I feel badly because I almost really break them. I take my chair back to my van. I notice someone's pushed very close to it. My brother Jake says, "See, if you move your van, then you have room."
