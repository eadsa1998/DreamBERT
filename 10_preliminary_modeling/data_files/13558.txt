I had gone on a dating show and had met this hot guy called Steven and he had chosen to go on the second date with me. We were in a car and Ezra was there too. We were talking but told Ezra to leave. Later, people kept playing this game out the front of the house across the road. People kept joining in and then leaving. A black girl was there. This car was coming past and people were drunk. I went back inside. Dad was there. I was then at this other house that I think was Mom's. I was getting rid of stuff on my bed by putting it under the blanket. Then I was Max (Roswell). He and his mother were getting stuff out of his drawers. There was a broken lightbulb and he held it and fixed it. Then I was me again and was wondering when Steven was coming. Simba was on my bed. I was watching some show and this guy and girl were in a shop and were going to have sex behind a curtain. Everyone was cheering. The girl took her shirt off and then the curtain opened. There was a photo of Braden somewhere and he looked like a cross between Charlton Heston and Peter Weller.
