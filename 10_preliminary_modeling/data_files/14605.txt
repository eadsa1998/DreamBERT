I think we were at Midvale shops and it was late at night. Mom and I were sitting in the car. She had a packet of drugs and kept sniffing it. She drove somewhere off road. This young black kid came up to the car and asked for something. We locked the doors and he called us racist. She kept driving and sniffing and I was worried we were going to crash.
