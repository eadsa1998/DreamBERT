My father and I are in a rowboat and the motor won't start. I see a big boat going by. My father is of the opinion we'll work it out and don't need the other boat. I feel we'd better get help while it's here or we'd get stranded. I call over. We hook up to them and they drag us to shore. On shore, I discover three tiny, funny creatures that are "new," no others like them in the world. I've "discovered" something special. One is white, one is black and one is crusty colored. I call them B's Buddies. My thought comes to me that if I find something small and cheap to reproduce and sell them, I could make a lot of money! Now I come to my house and I go in and walk from room to room, naming the rooms. On several occasions, I was not satisfied with the size or type of room as it appeared in my dream and I changed it to what I liked better. A living room, a dining room, a sitting room, a bedroom, a kitchen, the children's room, a play room. Now there are two kids, a boy and a girl. They are being noisy and naughty. I push them into their room and slam the door. They are talking about sneaking out. I listen in at the door. As they try to sneak out, I grab them and throw them back in. I slap them several times. The children are very angry at me. I am angry at them.
