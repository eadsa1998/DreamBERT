I'm doing dishes. I'm talking with someone. I go into the living room. It's all changed around. I feel disoriented. My mother sure has been industrious! Not only did she move the furniture, but she moved the windows and built in shelves and a fireplace too! I look closely at the windows and try to remember how it was before at grandma Mildred's house. I realize that it is just the furniture that is moved. I see pretty cloth being put up on the windows and new pink lacy curtains. My mother is so impressive, it must hurt her hands and she must get tired but she still keeps doing things to make the place nice. Now there's a meeting. I must take minutes. I write rapidly. Someone's talking to me. I turn to her and say, "Hey! Come on! I'm trying to take minutes here. Leave me alone for awhile." She then does. I'm laying on my tummy on the floor. Tom B is explaining how he's waiting for a teacher to get information to him before he finishes his project. Dickie challenges him and says, "It's your fault. You need to do something first, then the teacher can respond." I get confused on the issues and write it to the best of my abilities. Aunt Elaine comes in. A boy stands behind her. She says, "Are you hiding or are you just trying to keep me warm?" She's pleasant, maternal, and wears a revealing dress. Her daughter Patricia, my cousin, is more primly dressed and standoffish. I look past them at the door and wonder if my mother remodeled their bedroom too (It feels like the S City house there).
