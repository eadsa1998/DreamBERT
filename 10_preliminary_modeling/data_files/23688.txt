Next I am dreaming of Cher.  She is very buoyant, big personality.  She is talking about what she would want to be, professions.  She goes through each one, and acts each out, jumping, diving, in various costumes.  She goes through several, all action.  Then the last one, she says, "or I would be a lap-dog.  I had this lap-dog once, and he was so (wonderful?) or (cuddly?)."  To act it out, we go to see him at her house.  (Now, apparently she still has him.)  We walk to her house.  At the entrance, she opens the door, there is a staircase, white, stucco or rock or cement, smooth and clean, right there by the door.  She calls the dog and sits on a lower step.  Dog comes around the corner, down the stairs.  It is white, small, a kind I do not like.  She holds it and pets it.
