I was at the house with -- I can't remember how or why -- but I was watching "American Idol" and there was this girl in blue singing "Nights in White Satin" and she was like on the stage. And you know how they do -- the pick the singer up on a cable and they wing them around over the audience? Well, that's what they were doing, but they winged her, they lifted her all the way up to the mezzanine of this auditorium where there was this huge knight statue with big arms, and just let her hang in front of this knight for a while, and she was still singing. I can't imagine how somebody can sing being hung from a thing like that. They must have the words already and lip sync it because you just can't sing unless you're on your two feet. [laugh] And I remember Derek called during the show to say that he was close by and that they were all going to be in town. And I was a little irritated because they never get to watch this show really and here they're almost there, and there's the phone call. But it was okay, I guess, and then they all came and we went up in the tree house and we were climbing trees, and then I woke up.
