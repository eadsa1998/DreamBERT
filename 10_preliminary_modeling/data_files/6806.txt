At a meeting. 8 or 10 men in informal dress file and sing. So many more come in to hear that a man throws open the sliding doors into the church auditorium. Then the meeting is over and I wonder if they will play cards now. Go to talk to G.H. She says something about barley degrees. I ask her if I ever told her about my barley degree then realize it was some financial transaction of her husband's which she was speaking of, so explain that 'barley' degree as I use it was a common slang and proceed to tell her of my Yankton degree.
