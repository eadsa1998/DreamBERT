Father Andrew asks me to read a sermon from a book. I am not sure who the author of the book is. I show him the book, the front cover is torn off. He points to a page where I underlined some phrases: "That is great." I start to read, but there is much confusion. It is more like a market place than a Church. A woman throws some grains of BROWN RICE over us "new Christians." I continue to read, eating the sweet kernels of rice. + feeling upon awakening.
