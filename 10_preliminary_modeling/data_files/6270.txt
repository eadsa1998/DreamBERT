The other night I had a dream that I fell asleep while studying for an exam -- believe it or not it was my psychology exam. What happened was when I woke up my notes were on top of my head and I realized that I had not studied everything that I needed to. I was so scared and nervous, because I never fall asleep while studying. Usually I don't wait until the last minute to study, but for some reason in my dream I did. When it came time to go to school I was so afraid that I would fail that I crammed for the two hours I had before the test. Also, I would have to run to the bathroom and throwup because I was so nervous because I knew I had not studied enough. Sure enough I took the test and failed. But not only did I fail, but I also could not cope and dropped out of school because of it. The end result is that I ended up workiing at some kind of convenience store for the rest of my life as a cashier. The scariest thing about the dream was when I woke up. Sure enough I was dreaming this dream. I really did have a psychology test and I really did fall asleep while studying. In some way my unconscious was trying to tell me to wake up and to study because I knew I could never let myself fail. Thankfully I had a good understanding of the material, but I still could do better. I'm still in school and I didn't fail. It was scary, though, because it was like deja vu. I felt that everything [illegible] in the dream was going to really happen to me in reality.
