I was holding a "lobster" in my hand and knew that I wouldn't get hurt if I held its two long legs tightly in my grip. But the legs began to pry open and I couldn't hold them closed as they separated, the "lobster," which was now a snail-type bug within the shell, jumped out of the shell into my face. I put my hand up to protect my face and then began feeling my back under my shirt to see if it landed there. [afraid, unpleasant, no setting, no color]
