Next dream, I was trying out in A Chorus Line.  Same music and everything.  There was a lot of pressure, and I felt like I didn't really fit in.  I was trying to get the routines, the steps, asking others to clarify them.  I left and came back to an area, and overheard one of the girls telling the producer:  "Don't mind her, she's not very well-lightened."  Sort of like well- liked, but I knew she meant en-lightened, like I didn't know the steps, so it wasn't as much of a cut as not being well-liked.
