I went home but I fell asleep. Dad woke me up at either 1am or 11am (I can't read it). I called Mom and she was nearby so Dad took me to her and I went in the pickup. We went to McDonald's. Ezra and I were staying at Nana's. One of the geese was around and then it was a snake. There was a cake and sausages?
