I and my companion come to the house to try and kill a dragon who had been threatening me. I am worried because I don't know which way he's coming from. I can't protect front and back. We are at a window looking into this house. Now, later, inside the house, a group of people are also afraid of the dragon. They form a circle and each one alternating, facing front or back so all sides are protected. One smaller one isn't holding hands and it's looking up the chimney. I worry that he will wander away and leave us vulnerable. Now the dragon (like my stuffed dragon) flies down and looks in the window and says, "Come out or I'll kill you." I laugh, "No way!" The dragon says it won't do any good for us to resist because he'll just breathe in smoke into the house and we'll have to come out. I, he says, won't. "By the way, we'll get your brother too." I feel fearful that he's right, but I stay in the house. My brother (me) outside the house walks. He had my capacity to see in all directions.
