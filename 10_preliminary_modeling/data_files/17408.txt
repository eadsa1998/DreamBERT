I dreamt about my dormmate Tim, and talking about him with my father.  He said his name was actually Tim Bougeounjay, but thought his last name was better than it being English with an apostrophe.  Then he sort of became my high school friend Bryan.  He was a student from the other side of campus, and his cousin Sara was going to be a student, and he was going to help her out.  I was trying to find a gift for him, and saw little toys for making egg drop soup, and things like that, something about ducks.  Then with my boyfriend Jeremy and our friend Jake, I believe, we went to a movie.  They had odd bathroom machines, not toilets.
