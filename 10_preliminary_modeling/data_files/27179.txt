I dreamt that I was up in the mountains on vacation and that the cottage I was in was surrounded with beautiful pines and evergreens. We were all standing out in front - and there were lots of men cutting down every tree in sight - I remember screaming for them to stop - but the trees kept falling - then I woke up.
