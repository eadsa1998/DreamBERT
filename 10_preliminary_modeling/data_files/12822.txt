I was at school and there was a long row of chairs and Calvin and I were sitting next to each other. Calvin told Darius to move "over there" and Calvin pointed next to Evelyn. We kept looking over and laughing. Evelyn said that she liked "this guy". Calvin asked her if she thought Darius was hot. She was like "I don't know". Then she whispered "I think he's hot!".
