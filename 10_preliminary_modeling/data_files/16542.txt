I was attending this school put on by DVS, and there were three or four of the counselors that were there. And they each had their own little building, only in this little building there was a boys' bathroom and a girl's bathroom, and then there was the counselor's classroom. And they were giving like seminars all day about different things. And it was pretty hot. And I was walking around there in long pants and shoes and socks and I was walking around with this girl that was supposed to be like a buddy to me, but I couldn't figure out who she was or what she was doing. And so I'm walking around with her and I go back to Carolyn's classroom where I was supposed to be. And then I realized I'm in sandals and I'm walking around in sandals, and before you know it, I'm barefoot and I'm coming back to Carolyn's classroom and I'm kind of self-conscious about going into class barefoot, but it's kind of a thing where I know it's going to be kind of something people are going to notice, but I also had a tape recorder that they gave us for class, and they told everybody about be discriminative when you record because we only had a 90-minute tape and we were listening to lectures and blah, blah, bleah, going on and on and on for like six hours that day. So that was that.
