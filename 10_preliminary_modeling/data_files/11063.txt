I dreamt I was lying in bed and there was a snake underneath it. I was afraid to move in the bed or scream. I could hear him moving back and forth under the bed, making a funny noise as if he was ready to attack someone. All I could do was sit in one spot hoping he would crawl out and go away. This frightened me so much I woke up and looked under my bed to see if a snake actually was there.
