I was at home, but it was on Barlow Way and was different. I was at the end of the driveway and Mom had just left to walk Rover. I followed her up the street to the end of the neighbours and then started to walk back. There was a baby on the road and it grabbed my finger and I couldn't run and it kept doing it and I got angry and yelled. Oskar (our real next door neighbour, the creepy one) came out saying like 'you smacked my baby!' and I said that I didn't. He threw this rock which bounced over the wall out the front of the house across the street and hit the wall of the house (only a small whack). He sat down on this chair at the front of the wall in front of his house and said 'you left my baby on the road' and I was like "What the hell? You did, it's your baby, not mine". He just sat there calmly and not listening to me. I spoke calmly and said "she wrapped her finger around my thumb and it was like, if you were working and someone was knocking on your wall every few seconds it would drive you crazy". Suddenly, he was enlightened and apologized. I told Mom about it alter. We had basically become 'friends' now (ie, they wouldn't dob us in etc). It started raining and we hid out in my car. There was fog and I took a photo with my phone.
