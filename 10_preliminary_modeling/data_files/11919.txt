I was at some new town and there was a boy and a girl who were special. They met after a while, but at first the girl and her mother were chased out of their house. Also, I knew them. The boy had a spaceship thing. Then we were looking at a school for me. We found the only school in town and it was munted. But I went there anyway. At lunchtime some lady shot herself. It had happened there before. There were Christmas decorations up and there was a sleigh in front of one house which two girls and I got into. It flew in the air. Then it crashed.
