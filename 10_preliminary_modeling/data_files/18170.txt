I was over in the hospital. It seems as though I was working there and I was sick in some way. So I was sort of in the Employee's Health although it was run by a bunch of people I had known in the Biology Dept. when I worked there, especially the head technician. I was supposed to go down there for a couple of shots of flu vaccine. Whatever I had, although it was some sort of physical disease, it also seemed to be mental in some way. When I went down to Employee's Health, they were all real busy when I went in there at first. So I went out and had to come back again later. Somebody had given me this little pink pill to carry with me to show to whoever I found in charge there so they would know exactly what I wanted. And when I went back there, another person who I had known in the Biology Dept., she worked in the Pathology Dept., gave me a cup of water to take in with me. And I went in with my little pill and apparently I was going to have to dissolve this pill and drink it and then have these shots. Then somebody came over and noticed me. I told them what I wanted and it seems as though I was going to get the shots in a little while.
