[1997-05-29] There were a whole lot of children in my house. And it was afternoon and they were cute. They were about six or seven and I was going to go up and show them my computer and one of the vendors from a place that sells computers and reading machines was in my house too and this lady was with him and we all went upstairs and I had 2 dolls on my bed in my spare room and I was touching the lace on one of my dolls and I was showing it to them, one of the collectibles I have and they liked it and then I was showing them my computer. There was a funny connection on my computer, there was this funny big wire and there was another little wire which connected with it and it didn't feel right and Curt the vendor guy said, "we can't have it like that." I was kind of relieved to have him say that it wasn't safe like that and that he was going to fix it. And the kids were getting a kick out of the talking computer.
