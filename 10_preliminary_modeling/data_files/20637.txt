I was with my mother and sister driving on Jericho Turnpike. A man was talking flippantly about his abilities. We reflected that he would be late for his appointment if he did not stop fooling around. We came to our destination, and I took a test. My mother asked me if I had an eraser, and I said that I did. I had a bag of dishes. I was afraid they would fall out. My mother waited outside.
