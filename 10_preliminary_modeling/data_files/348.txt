I live with my family - we're not the classiest bunch, generally blue-collar, dark curly hair, Dad eats dinner in a T-shirt, etc. I'm in my room doing something, dinner's ready and Mom calls me but I don't care. There's a shower curtain across a bathtub on one side of the room, and there's something large that protrudes from it - maybe something I made, I think I'm an artist - but it's clumsy and not particularly good, ignorable. I'm working at a desk or table on the far side of the room, and my dad yells at me to get up and come to dinner anyway. I bitch and moan but I get up and see that the "thing" has been changed. Now it looks like a big penis, and not a nice clean pink one either. I'm disgusted and outraged. It has to have been my brother that did this. I'm gonna get him for it too. I stomp out to the table and announce that "somebody" has been screwing around in my room, telling my parents "You go look at it - just look at what he's done" - meaning my brother, of course, glaring at him. He laughs and I get madder. I go over and grab him, lifting him up and sinking my teeth into his arm, and I fling him back and forth as hard as I can. I'm fed up with this crap, I'm leaving. I'm gonna walk right out of here and never come back. I pick up my black leather jacket and stalk out.
