I was on some battleground somewhere. The enemy was supposed to charge. They were very near. I got some sort of job on a battleship. We took the ship to some various ports in the West Indies. A quick change of scenery and I again was on the battlefront. Everyone was preparing to charge and surprise the enemy. The enemy troops. however. surprised us, and we could see them pouring over a hill which was in front of us.
