A black man is attracted to me and me to him. I like his gentleness and loving attitude. I think he's sexy as well. But I hesitate because he's loud mouthed and uncouth and it is somewhat embarrassing to have him around my friends. He's testing me to see if I am honest and open. There is a parade and I join it, acting silly and joining in the march/dance. He likes that I'm willing to do that. He asks me questions about a man named Scott who stayed overnight. He stands very close to me and I feel like I want to melt into his arms, but resist. He wants to know if he stayed two nights and I tell him honestly it was only one night. He wants to know if I made l love to him and I tell him no. He won't believe me at first. I tell him openly it isn't that I'm virtuous; I was scared and can't relax to lovemaking when I'm scared. He respects that. He's painted small purple squares on my black floor. It makes a nice design. He has to go to the bathroom so he says, "I'll leave my money and my drugs here with you; guess I'll find out if I can trust you." He does. I then leave the room talking to someone, perhaps my husband. I see my 2-year-old son going into the room and follow and see that he's eaten one of the big, colorful pills. I reach my finger in his mouth to get it out and he won't cooperate. I dig around his narrow, clenched mouth and finally force it out. I wonder what kind of scary drug it is, maybe LSD. The man comes back and I tell him what happened. We are more openly in love with each other and can't resist one another. He is less uncouth and I begin to realize he's a talented artist and rich and had been playing a charade to see if I could l love him without the finery. I found out he was an artist because I bumped a book on a chair and a picture fell out and I picked it up. Tempted to open the book and look more, I resolutely don't as that would be an invasion of privacy. We hug and kiss. It is delightful, warm and loving.
