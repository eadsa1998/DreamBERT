There was a bridge or dock, like the pier at Lake Evergreen, but it had a sharp turn on a steep incline.  I wondered how cars kept from crashing through the rail and falling into the water.  A little girl was there, and her father kept telling her to go on home, but she wouldn't.  There was also a house, evidently beside this body of water.  There was a rope or vine hanging down to swing on.  I don't know how I did it, but I swung very high.  When I went above the top of the house, I saw that it was flat.  I thought I would let go and land on it, but I rose too high above it to let go.  I thought I would try it again next time.  On the way down, however, I decided to let go over the water.  I kept falling and falling-not slowly, but pretty fast, like going off a high diving board.  I wondered why I hadn't hit the water, but discovered I wasn't over the water at all.  I don't remember hitting the ground, but the next thing I realized was that I was inside the house kneeling beside a chair or divan with my head on it.  Daddy was occupied with something in the doorway of another room, but he was talking to me.  I wanted to try to make him think I was dead, but I would forget and open my eyes every once in a while.  I was afraid he had seen this, and so, since he kept asking me things, I figured I had better answer or he would get mad, so I did.
