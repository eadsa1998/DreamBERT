I was talking to Mom about Smallville and that sometimes it was more of a 'romance' and then it would go to 'science fiction' and back and forth. I said it was lame at the moment. Some story involved a teen black girl. The actress had recently said she was 35 and everyone was chucking a spaz saying she was too old.
