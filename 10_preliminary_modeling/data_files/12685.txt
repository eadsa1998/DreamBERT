I had to go to school. Calvin and Samantha were there. I had to hand in this job application. I decided to get a new one. Nana was around. This friend of mine morphed into a guy, but she wasn't really a guy. Her father came in and she couldn't morph back. I was then outside near this fence and there were dead animals. I was asking the guy behind the fence to let us in. He said that he wasn't allowed to let anyone in. I said "If someone was dying, would you let in a doctor?". He said that was different. I said that there were rotting animals nearby. Someone asked a nun for help. Her name was Sister Mary and we were then allowed in.
