I flew across the street, then I saw some fire started across the road. All I did was blow some air on my breath on or towards the fire and they went out. Later I heard Bill Kotnik for making the fire, but I found out Gus Menkie was the firebug. Julie Marlot told me I was needed in the St. Francis church for assistance. When I got there and asked her what I was to do, she said to sing in the choir. I said, "I can't sing." There were two bakers baking bakery at our house. The bakery looked delicious. I was playing a machine where you put in a quarter. I was getting bakery out of it and times my quarter came back out. There were two tramps who came to our house. I got the rifle and shot several times at their feet before they would make a move. One of them later turned out to be Bill, a fellow from White's who I see at the track once in a while. He resented my rifle, but I had to protect myself and family. I told him I didn't recognize him before, otherwise I would not have done that to him. I was out in the country picking up sticks and throwing them at the birds for food. I sold or bought a home and someone said, "How is someone going to buy your home if they don't have enough cash?" I said, "The bank sends an appraiser and he sets the loan amount for the buyer and the buyer must have a certain amount and the bank gives him a mortgage.
