Operation imminent. Dr. S. to operate. No breakfast. Time set for 11 p.m. While waiting walk to visit school. Too little time to remain. See some children though, room or seating. Speak to teacher. Return walking fast. Room in great disorder. Ask Dr. S. about operation table. She begins to remove my clothing for operation while I sit in her lap. (I wake up with pain in abdomen but sleep again and again. Dream of imminent operation but remember only that and saying to R " I can do what I wish this morning."
