This is the dream I was having when I was awakened. I was walking thru a big department store with my girlfriend. We were waiting for her to go back to school. We had just looked at a big clock. It was about 8:31, I think. I had just seen a friend of mine. We were walking thru the store and we were looking for presents and we just passed by the big window outside and I said, "Look at all the magic tricks." She didn't believe me, so that after she put down a bottle that she was holding in her hands, we were going to go look for magic tricks and I was going to show her that there really were magic tricks. She had doubted that. [Hall: He also saw an announcement that the meal would be presented compliments of two people, one of them a boy that he knew in high school, debated with in high school. Nietzsche was walking around with his girl in the dept. store, he was pointing out bottles of liquor and joking about them with her. It had something to do with her giving him a gift of these bottles of liquor, or something of that sort.]
