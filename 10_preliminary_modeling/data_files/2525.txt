I am with the three girls. I can see they are unhappy. I decide to take matters into my own hands and tell them they will be happier if they would seek counseling and get to work on their co-dependency issues. Dovre in particular is not thrilled. "Coda," she says in disgust. She has a young man with her and the three of us are waiting for our rental car. I see a man get in a car and I am upset. He's taking our car. I run over and we get in the backseat. "This is my car," I say. He disagrees, but finally gives up because I'm so adamant. I quickly get into the driver's seat and then I look around more closely. This car is very tacky, old and in ill repair. He was right. It wasn't mine at all. (He reminds me of Jared and the car of our red "scat wagon.") We get out and go to the rental shop. I ask for the manager because the clerk is no help. He says, "Sam's at the pool table." I say, "Which one is he?" The clerk says, "He's a she and she's the one wearing overalls." I go in and see all women around the pool table. I ask one if she is Sam. She says yes. I explain that I'm waiting for my rental car; it's late. She's uppity and of no help. She smirks. I somehow realize its a scam. I can't go to the police because she's paid them off. She gets a kickback from the insurance company. I decide to sneak into the back of the shop and steal it. Since its contracted to me, they can't do anything about it. I do so and now the driver is some alien male and I keep making him make love to me to wear him out, which will prove he's an alien.
