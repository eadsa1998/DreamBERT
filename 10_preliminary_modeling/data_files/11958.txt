I was with people from school and we were in this creepy house place. Someone told us to go through it all with one light, which I had. We were walking through and I can't remember what but something scary popped up. The place was arena like. Also there was some game where you had to kill this werewolf snake, except it didn't turn into a werewolf. We found it and we were killing it down to its last health, but we needed wolf bane so I got whoever was with me, to go and get it. Then we killed it.
