I'm in a budget supermarket. It's a strange one. Not many customers. Products are set out sparingly on small islands. Loads of staff stationed at different tills are dotted around the store. It is brightly colored, like the set of a children's' tv show. I'm there to buy provisions for some sort of project. The problem is, I already have a trolley load of stuff that I bought in another store. The stuff isn't food - rather various pieces of hardware. Bizarrely, at the checkout, when I explain I have a trolley mostly full of stuff i'd already paid for in another store, the checkout lady says she still has to put it through her till. The bar codes are still there, and apparently she is going to charge me for this stuff again. I suddenly occurs to me that I must be completely stupid, and I wake up.
