 I'm at home. My friend Kevin Simpson is talking with a woman I know that is our age. They joke and laugh, drawing faces on a board. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is washing dishes. Something seems wrong with her. I go up behind her, grab her waist affectionately, and ask what's wrong. I realize she is really drunk! She has consumed six beers: two before dinner, two at dinner, and two after dinner. I talk with my mom and others about Masters programs: how they take one or two years, I say. I say most people who have focused/concentrated before do two years. I talk about my friend Stephen Ramos' Masters program work. My friend Gretchen Warwick calls Kevin on the telephone. I stir pieces of not-well-cooked, slimy, lamb in a large frying pan.
