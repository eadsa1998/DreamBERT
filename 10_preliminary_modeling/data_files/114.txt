Lou Ann and June at the office - Judy and somebody have been to a program down the street somewhere on lunch hour and Lou Ann thinks she won't have time but wants to go. I encourage her. Place has a hallway, looks like a newspaper or somewhere you have drafting tables. Then I'm getting a job laying out and painting lines on a parking lot for a little old building - there are men around, I think the ones that hired me, they're not too informative. I meet a guy who invites me to a buffet lunch at a place like a country club. We chat at the table with some other people while they're setting things out. I'm a little confused about his interest in me, and this place, too - is it really something he's treating me for, or could I have come here myself? Can I really eat what I want, or do you snack? This might be a fashion show or something. While we're getting our food, Becky and Lisa show up, they're on their lunch hour from work. Now I know the place has some exclusive overtones at least or Becky wouldn't be here. We say hello and talk about the food. I get a paper plate from a stack - a 2nd choice - and find it's smaller than the other, so I get another one and remark on that. I like this guy I'm with. I hope I see more of him - not sure about his feelings for me though.
