There was some pipsqueak law officer that had been harassing me for some reason, and I had been losing my temper about it for some time.  Finally he came and arrested Grandma for "salacious advertising" --she had a sort of rooming house-and my wife Bonita and me too, because we were staying there.  I was furious.  We went out and got in a car to go (not his car-his was parked in front of us in Grandpa's driveway), and I noticed that his car had bumper stickers which were more salacious than Grandma's advertising.  I grabbed him and dragged him out of the car and shoved his face up against the bumper stickers and told him to smell the exhaust (why the car would have been running, I don't know).  I screamed at him, called him a slimy little worm, a despicable, gutless little bastard, etc.-really tried to demean him.  He seemed genuinely nonplussed by it all, and never said a word.  I felt a little guilty about it later, especially in the presence of Alberta, who, I knew, would have counseled calmness and forgiveness.  She gave us a package, and when we opened it, it contained a set of trays to match our oval tray.  I felt really ashamed of myself then.
