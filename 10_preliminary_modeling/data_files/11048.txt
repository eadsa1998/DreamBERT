I am headwaiter in some large hotel. A customer orders a poached egg which must be ordered specially. I go down to the kitchen to place the order. However, the cooks after much consultation, get together and came up with a more or less scrambled egg. I decide to let it go but later on the exact same situation occurs almost as if the dream were merely repeated. I call it to the cooks' attention, but they just shrug.
