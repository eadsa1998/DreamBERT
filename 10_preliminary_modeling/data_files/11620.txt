I dreamed I was in a strange city with a foreign appearance. The city resembled the antiquated city of Pompeii. I was eating dinner when all of a sudden a shout outdoors could be heard saying that we were being invaded by a nomadic infidel tribe. My reactions to this statement were those of fear and anger and quickly I sought to arm myself. Before I could accomplish this the enemy had entered the house. I among others were seized as prisoners. Next we were taken to a sort of jungle and told that our trial was coming up next. I looked out of the hut door and saw a person with a multitude of hideous sores tied to a stake. He screamed and I was told that an enemy was pouring cups of lemon juice over the open cuts. At this I woke up and after I awoke I could seem to continue to hear the screams.
