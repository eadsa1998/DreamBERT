 I'm with a group of people in a house that may be home. Some of us are going to smoke a hallucinogenic drug or mixture out of a pipe. I get a piece of wood about ten inches long from the garage. It's about an inch in diameter. I'm going to carve a pipe out of it. I have a red Swiss Army knife. I start to whittle the stick down. My brother Wally comes over and says that he wants to smoke too.
