Jack Nicholson and I are attracted to each other. He and I hold hands and another woman sees it and goes, "Ah ha! Look here!" He says, "I hunger after her. We have to be touching all the time. I can't be away from her." Then the woman explains several volunteer jobs at the fair I could do. I choose to do the woman of color one where I give pieces of pie and make up hints to women. As we leave to go to my table, we notice the guy is laying down for a nap and not following me. I wonder if it's OK to leave Ellie, but decide she'll be OK. I say, "We'll leave without him, he'll catch up." I pretend I don't care. I go to the table and replace a dark-skinned Egyptian woman. I hear some man say, "Here's our Indian." They want me to change money, but won't let me put up a sign letting people know this will cost money. I object. They insist. I don't want them to feel cheated, thinking it was for free and then getting charged.
