I go to a play rehearsal with a friend. A high school acquaintance Makes a speech introducing a girl who I also know, who in turn gives some sort of talk and I marvel at her Stage presence. There's a blank here. At the end of the rehearsal (I am not a participant at the rehearsal) I see a girl I know quite well, escorted by a fellow who I also know (and dislike) coming down the aisle of the auditorium. I do not greet them but I note with regret that they are identically dressed. My friend goes up to the girl and performs some minor act of intimacy of which I'm intensely jealous. As a matter of fact I did not realize he knew her so well.
