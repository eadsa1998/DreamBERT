I was in Russia with Bob. He was separated from me. I don't know how. I was walking thru a field near Stalingrad, a lady was walking with a dress on and a man in a shirt sleeves and I had a suit coat on and it was summer. I was worried about Bob, if I would find him ever and I had $40 which seemed to be enough money to get me home.
