I am sleeping in a hall on the floor, in a suit of some kind. I wake up to find Ernie standing over me, watching me. I am surprised. I fall asleep again and three times wake up to find him watching me. He's in a blue business suit. He has made a decision. He is going to have me for his second wife. He goes to his wife, and she says, "You've decided to move." He smiles and says, "Yes to Posner" (meaning a town where I live). This sort of is her way of saying she'll go along with his scene of having two wives. Now I am his wife and am about to meet the other woman who will be his other wife. She is a sophisticated woman. I feel shy and unsure about how all this will go. She smiles at me and looks over to where Ernie is standing off in the distance and says confidentially, "He sure dresses badly, doesn't he!" I giggle and say, "Oh yes," and she smiles and says "Well, we'll see about that." I say, "Oh, that's just the way he is. Won't do any good to try and change that." She feels confident that she has some tricks of the trade that will fix it. I feel unsure about all this and a bit like a failure because I didn't have any tricks of the trade like that.
