I am vacationing on Hawaii. I look forward to the beauty. but things keep going wrong: the wrong bus, we get stalled, we can't find the place. I discover it's just a tourist trap. Finally I leave and then decide to return, thinking I can find some small corner near the beach where I can enjoy the ocean and surf and beach. I know I made the wrong decision, but I do it anyway. I find a rundown neighborhood. The tourist fancy buildings are off on the horizon, but I can't find the ocean.
