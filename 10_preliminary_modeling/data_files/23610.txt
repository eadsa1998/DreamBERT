Congratulations, I got married last night! But the girl I had only been out with twice before we decided to get married. Right after the wedding, her father, as a wedding gift, gave me the keys to a new car. But I had just bought a new car, a "VW," for our honeymoon. This was a conflict. Either take his car or take mine. Things didn't quite work out. I got unmarried, I think, before I left the church.
