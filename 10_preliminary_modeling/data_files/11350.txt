My two roommates were in Cleveland over a Christmas holiday. I only saw one of them but I sensed that both of them were there. I was making a phone call to a girl I know to fix the second one up with her when I suddenly realized that he couldn't possibly be here since he had been killed. Then I felt like a fool.
