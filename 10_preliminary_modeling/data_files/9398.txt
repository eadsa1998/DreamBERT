Riding on a train with Edward, along the ocean, many bays and much snow. Danger and shooting. We go out and have to walk in deep snow and mud. Feeling of fear and uneasiness. Shift: I am driving in an open car to California. I get out on top of a hill. Need no coat or boots. Free feeling--sense warm air around my face and arms. Very very happy. Shift: With S. L. (musician, new acquaintance). He is explaining an obscure discrepancy of melody in a Beethoven piece. We get into bed although I protest a bit. I am cleaning away some leftover peas and carrots (green and orange); feeling of anticipation and some guilt.
