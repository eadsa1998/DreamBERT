 I'm in a bar with my friend Emily Zates and others. We have a gun. We're going to shoot brown beer bottles. People are after me. I'm scared. A radio announcer says my name, and says watch out, people are trying to kill you! There is a drive-by shooting planned for 6:00pm to shoot me. Some of the people after me are a gang called "Niggers With ATT's". I camp out at Hill Park between Josephine Zirbes' house and the apartments. A car drives by. I see its lights, and I fire a shot at it, though no one shot at me. Oak Valley police chief Dan Hellman and another police chief are looking after me. One of these two men is black. Bill and Tamara Thomas drive south on Park Avenue in Oak Valley. I see their car. It seems they care about me in a removed manner. I'm fleeing in my truck going north on Park Avenue. There is a smaller car going in front of me for protection. It's dark and I'm pulling a trailer. The car in front of me slows and stops. I need to hurry, so I drive around the protective car, between it and another car on the right side of the road. I put the accelerator to the floor and smash through the two cars. I'm going to try to outrun and fool everyone. I turn east on 2nd Street, go up a few blocks to Hill Avenue, and then backtrack, turning right and going south. I do this because I think no one will think I've stayed in the area, and will search for me elsewhere. I see a parade of lights up near 1st Street, going east, to look for me. I'm on a bicycle, with a trailer. I go on side streets and alleys, and lie low, quiet in the darkness.
