I am in a nice neighborhood and intend to walk home. As I walk, I notice I am headed toward some railroad tracks and trains and see I am now in a dangerous neighborhood with black people all around. I am alone and walking along a railroad raised area. The black people are running around like in a riot. I am blocked and trapped in this dangerous area.
