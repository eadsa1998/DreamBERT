Grandma Mildred made a dress for Millie and Bonnie to wear to a dance. I must wear it. I struggle. It's too tight. And the net gets caught on my shoe. I say to Ellie, "Is it unzipped all the way? I won't fit." She assures me it is. Then I ask her to look again. "Oh," she says, "It's still partly zipped." I get the dress on, but it's strapless and I have a regular bra on. Ellie says, "Go get your special thing." I take off my bra and go to get my strapless bra, only I pick up a pair of swim goggles and lay it across my breasts and laugh. I see my hair, which is now totally gray. My eyes are a faded, tired blue. I am appalled. I straighten the curls Grandma had fixed into the hairdo. I hope my aunts return soon to take their rightful place in the outfit.
