I was at the old house. I went out to the lounge room and Ezra was watching Ordinary People although it was made in 1986 and was about the cast of Firefly. Rover was lying on the floor next to the recliner. Adam Baldwin segment in the movie was played by a guy didn't look like him and was a bad actor. I complained about it and Ezra said 'well, I haven't seen the show so it doesn't matter' and I said 'yeah but you're getting a fake story'. From some angles he did look like him and I said "he looked like Jayne for a sec". Then I was driving a car and I had a tattoo on my hand. There was a snake cane thing then it was Alan Tudyk's segment.
