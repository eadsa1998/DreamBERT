Chelsea was getting really carried away with like pot and things, and she was like totally whacking out on me and totally not being my friend. I would have to be so careful when I would be in contact with her because I dreamt that because she would have like traces of it on her hands and she'd like shake my hand and try to get it on me, so that if she ever got searched and found that it would be proven that I was involved in it too. And get this -- this is really bizarre -- we were in this store, like a Marshall's or a Service Merchandise, and there was this box that was of a teddy bear and what she did was she stuffed the teddy bear with it, and she put the teddy bear in the box and she wrapped the box like a Christmas present, and she put it in my shopping cart. And I was like so afraid and wanting to get away from her so bad, but there were these various wrapped presents in my shopping cart and I didn't know which was the one. And oh, it was just totally bizarre. And that's all I can remember.
