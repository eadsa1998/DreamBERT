We, meaning the food's class, were in a dining room. It seems I was arranging a bowl of flowers. There were yellow roses, a red lily-like flower, and green foliage. After the flowers had all been arranged and the rest of the class went to get the instructor to show her the arrangement, I decided that the flowers were all crowded into one section and I began to try and rearrange them. It seems that all the flowers started to sink and go under. The red lily-like flower began to fall apart. The instructor came in and said not to bother, but I wanted to make the flowers look better. The dream ended with only the red lily-like flower being visible and rest of the flowers gone.
