I had a semi-scary dream. First of all I dreamt that I was reading this long epic poem, kind of like the, it was written in the style of the Odyssey, except it was only about an eighth of the length. It was the story in epic poem fashion, and it was about this lady who saw a monster in her swimming pool and it tried to drown her, and from then she was extremely scared of monsters, and what she did and all. And I think one of the lines went something like, "One time I had this," I mean, at one point I had this picture in my head of a lady sitting in the bathtub, leaning over the edge and doing some sewing. And the poem read for those lines, "And the monster of the water came up and bit off a piece of her head." And that was real weird, and she was like freaking out because she was so scared of this monster. And I can remember that I kind of like, they were talking about the monster of the water all through this poem, but the last line said something about the monster of Oof. That was weird. And I dreamt that I actually saw the monster in the swimming pool, and I jumped in the swimming pool, for whatever reason. And there was ice around the pool there and it was shallow for a swimming pool. And there was this big guy who was like running around and trying to drown me, but I'm a good, strong swimmer and I got away from him. And then I dreamt that I tried to get out of the bus without my cane and stuff, and I didn't know what the heck bus I was really on, and I didn't have my go card (?) and [laugh] it was just a bad deal. And then I woke up.
