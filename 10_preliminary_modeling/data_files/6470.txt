It's a gift shop or a toy store or something. I'm walking around in it with my mother -- we're buying gifts for someone. But -- it's more like a party than a gift store, and people are hanging out all over the place. I see Sarah (old lust from Middle School) sitting in the corner, and this really trips me out. I walk over to say hello. She says hello back. I tell her this is really wierd, because I'd just been dreaming about her. As I talk to Sarah and all these other past acquaintances I lose track of my mother. Well, good, I think, and latch onto a group of friends. Sarah tells me she's going to a party, will I come along? Well, even though it's the middle of Los Angeles and I don't know what hotel my parents are staying in, I say okay, because I want an adventure, not another damn number of days ruined by my family. So I go with Sarah to this party in an apartment building. I keep hearing this jazz music. We go into the room and it's Thelonius Monk playing the piano! He's got a lunatic eight or nine-string upright bass, and he's trying to play with this amateur bassist, to show him a few things. I think, if he'll put up with that guy, maybe he won't mind if I noodle around a little on his piano. So I walk over to the shiny black grand piano and play a little bluesy ditty -- immediately I hear shouts coming from inside the piano. I get up and distance myself from it. Two groggy, angry skinheads crawl out and collapse on the floor, bleeding. They nurse the wounds I accidentally gave them and I join Monk at the piano. He shows me a melody and I improvise, but it's clear he wants me to go away, so I drift into conversation. I begin talking to two middle-aged black men. One is very lanky and shirtless, and has this wierd yellow fungus growing all over him. Vaguely as we talk I wonder if it's contagious. He has a very 'gay' manner. <br/
