["Sleeping Underwater"]  I am on a vacation. I go down to the beach where a small cabin is right at the waters edge. I go in and look out the window. I am concerned because what if the tide comes up. I see the ocean rise and wash over the cabin totally submerging it. I realize I am supposed to sleep here like that, underwater. I feel a bit scared and nervous. I somehow know I will be all right, and the cabin won't get a leak, but it is hard to trust.
