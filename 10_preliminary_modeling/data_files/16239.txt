We were at Fort Washington and Mom was saying last time we were here we had a big fight. And I was swimming around and it was getting gray, and I came back to them and they said there is distressing news in the air, there is distressing news. And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that's probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce home. I ran in and we had this porch that wasn't screened in, and it was like one of those laundry room porch things that had all kinds of junk on it and I had the notion that my room was on this porch. My bed was there, a bunch of my stuff was there, I had a dresser there, and on top of that dresser the keyboard was still sitting on top of that dresser. And I had a mixer of the same design, with the same red faders, and kind of funky LED display and kind of funky design. I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser. And I knew that Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were going to come in, so I put a towel over them so they wouldn't see them. And I don't remember too much more. Let me think a minute. And, oh yeah, in my dream they both worked, but before Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce were supposed to come in, for some reason I ran in the house. The system was on to sound like people were home. I ran in the house and turned it up a little and then I came back outside to see Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce. And it was like you could hear it out there. It was like I ran in and turned it on. I don't know how meaningful that is, but it certainly is interesting. [laugh]
