I was in a car with Mom. Suresh (Heroes), Ezra and Emery were in a car on the opposite side of the island. We got their attention and Mom managed to text him to tell him to pull over. Eventually we all caught up. We were then at this place and James Spader was there. I think it was his house. He walked away from us and when I got spare time I joined him and said "What's up Jimmy?". He said that it was birthday and I said "Oh, June 23rd". I was thinking the date was the 24th. I was like "I can't believe I forgot your birthday, I'm not as good at remembering birthdays now". I was thinking of Michael Palin, and that I'll always remember his birthday.
