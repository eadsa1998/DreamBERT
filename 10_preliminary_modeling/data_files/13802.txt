I was at home. This black girl (who we knew) was talking to some guys in a car. She was going to steal some drugs and I was unlocking the door so she could run in. After unlocking it, I told her I didn't want to take them. Then I was at Mom's. We all got inside and I locked the doors. I went somewhere else for a while and when I came back she was talking to them through the fly screen. I went to lock it but the guy shot at the lock, so I closed the wood door and he shot through that. Then they came in. The guy told us that the drugs he had were stolen from a casino from these really bad guys. I explained that I didn't know about the drugs and that it was the black girl's idea. I had snuck off earlier and called the cops but they weren't working because it was mother's day. The lady I spoke to said she'd said send someone to check it out. She spelt 'Barlow' with two A's and then crossed it out. We were in the dining room at Mom's, but it was different. The guy said that if the bad guys found us we'd all be dead. Then the door busted open and this guy in leather was there and he looked mean. The guy that was with us looked at me and we grimaced (we knew it was the bad guy). The lady on the phone had come with them too. He took the main bad guy (the one who was doing all the talking) and did something to him and I think he died. He made this girl lick his feet, and I told her not to breathe. Then this lady cop came and someone told her to shoot the other guys and we were all arguing over who the bad guys were.
