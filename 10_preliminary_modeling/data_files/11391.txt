I was, living here in Cleveland in a fraternity house, but it was located in a downtown section. My fraternity brothers were fellows I used to know back home except one who I remember as being a fellow I know from Cleveland. I was upstairs cleaning up around. Then I came downstairs and found a lot of colored people there. Right away I noticed they had lipstick on, and this struck me as being peculiar. I couldn't help staring; once when I noticed that I was watching them, they attempted to hide their faces, some did at least. There were a bunch of dogs with them also. The dogs had fleas or something and were spreading an epidemic of disease in the neighborhood. I realized that I had to get serum to stop the epidemic. I didn't know where to get the serum. I had no transportation and went back to the fraternity house, but no one had any transportation. One fellow lent me his bicycle, so I started. I went about one block and saw a buddy of mine driving a bus, so I laid my bicycle down and asked him to take me. He said he couldn't, so I went back to get the bicycle and someone had stolen it. Finally another friend came by in a car and I got in. We started off.
