The next morning, no sleep. Raul, his woman, Bonnie and I go to a hotel room. I am very tired. I want to sleep, but first I want to go to the bathroom. I go into one of 3 small bathrooms. I can't get my pants down. I call Bonnie and she helps. First, we peel off the bathing suit bottom. It is tight and painful. Then the regular panties and then the pampers diapers. Raul comes by and I'm embarrassed. He'll see the diaper. It comes off. Again, I'm backed into a corner, my hand shielding the genital area. Raul goes into the next bathroom and sits on the toilet. I can see his long legs sassily crossed over from under the curtain. He lifts the curtain up and smiles at me. I see a bathtub with hot water waiting. I say, "Is that a hot bath?" He says, "Yes. Why don't you join me?" I sigh and say, "I just think I might." Bonnie warns me not to. I would love to just relax in the tub with Raul's arms around me. Then some men walk in, looking for me. I crouch down into my corner again. A man tells me they need my help. His friend had a shooting accident and is going blind, but he wants to be a race car driver. The man is embarrassed and hides. I see his glasses with a bullet hole through it. I tell him, "If that's what he wants, then go for it. Do it! Find a way to make it work!"
