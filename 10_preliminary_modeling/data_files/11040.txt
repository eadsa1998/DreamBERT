Our family had rented a summer suite in an apartment for summer but we were going to rent it the year round. Mother and I went there early one morning to have breakfast. In order to get to our apartment, we had to pass through another person's. She was a rich widow who was selling all her expensive antique furniture. I remember looking at the price tag on a mahogany table. We were going to rent her apartment when she moved out at the end of the summer. We were right on the lake and I couldn't wait to lie on the beach in the sun. But suddenly it got cloudy while my mother and I were drinking our orange juice. I lay on the sand a while but it got windy and cloudy and began to get chilly. Then suddenly, my older sister, who is 26, was there. She wanted to relax too, but it was too cloudy. I didn't like our apartment at all. It was freshly painted but too dark and the ceiling seemed so low that I had to stoop. I was very dissatisfied with it as living quarters.
