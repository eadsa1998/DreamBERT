My daughter has a baby in the town next to where I lived most of my life. We are driving in the mountains and have an accident at the top of the hill. We go off the pass. It is winter. The baby gets thrown from the car but isn't hurt. Everyone else is okay. The baby coughs. We just keep going. There are lots of ambulances around. The name Sarah Craver is part of the dream but I don't know anyone by that name.
