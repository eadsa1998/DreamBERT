Dad still lived at the old house. I was staying over. Ezra and Roland were there too, along with Stephen Merchant. We were out the front. Roland said he could hear a noise from the woodshed and said that 'someone was in there', but we ignored him. Then we were out the back sitting at a table. Stephen wrote on a bit of paper and signed it Stephen MerchanT -- the S and T being significantly bigger, especially the T, and I said 'the T's almost as tall as him'. He laughed. Then we were out the front again and Steve said he heard something in the woodshed. Dad went to check it out and came back with a bruise on his face, saying 'he hit me'. Apparently there was a family of around 20 Chinese people living in there. There was a hole in the laundry window that they came in through. I went to look and saw a lady using the sink in the laundry. I screamed. I went to the living room and another one came out and put her hands on my face. Someone said it was some ritual and so I stood there, stiff, and she made me kneel, then she bowed and I bowed back and I was thinking 'I thought that was a Japanese thing', but just went along with it.
