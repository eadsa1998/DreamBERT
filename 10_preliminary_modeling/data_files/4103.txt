["Tiger Man"]  I am watching as someone lays a band across the throat of a man who is lying on a table. We are in some room. The man transforms into a tiger. Then he returns to his original form. This is scary. It means this man is potentially very dangerous, when he is a tiger. I watch as someone lays the band on his throat again. I see the dark bruise mark from the first time. The man starts to resist, then just gives up and lies back, accepting the restriction. Somehow this all means that Charla is dangerous. I use this as an excuse to insist she return to her mother. I want her to go right away, not even finishing the night at my house. I know somehow that I am giving up too easily and it isn't really necessary to do. Turns out that Lydia is her mother. They aren't home when I call. The baby-sitter doesn't seem to be helpful. She doesn't understand what I'm saying and won't take the message for Lydia. I realize that Charla will be fine and I don't need to rush this.
