In this dream I was part of a group that owned Lovette's Furniture and there was a board meeting which I attended and in which everybody decided that it was best for some reason to send me to this place in Pennsylvania where their main store is. They thought it would be better if I was there. So I was telling them all the reasons why I didn't want to go up there. All the characters in this dream were male.
