I'm in the middle of a project and don't have much help. Can't find the schedule. Put lots of my own money into the computer and forgot to get receipts. Don't know how I'm going to get it back. A man with one eye (which changed to two eyes, one blind and ugly) said he just doesn't like disabled people (me). I say I don't like him. He works for an oil company.
