I am in a woman's house and yet I am also on stage. I am describing to the audience which is not in front of me but off to the right side, that my work with my dream program created yet another wonderful new experience. I have discovered that there are patterns that create beautiful music. I see in front of me a schematic drawing hovering mid air. I see algebraic type formula's with X's and Z's and minus signs all in a 3-d chess kind of setting. When these patterns are played beautiful music happens. I am passionate about it. A man in the audience is worried. He says but how are you going to do all this? You need help. I say I know and I feel sad. I do need help. I don't know if I can get it. Then I am getting ready to go to school. I feel tired and not prepared.
