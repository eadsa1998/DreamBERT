I am talking to a man and explaining to him (he is like Vern H) how I could tell from his body language that he felt OK about disability. He is gentle and sweet. I start to show him what I mean, and it turns into a swim lesson. The woman teacher says, "Now gently sink down and submerge yourself into the water, keeping your nose open (not holding it pinched shut) and keeping their eyes open as well." I manage to do it, but am aware of some tension and wanting to come back up. When I am underwater, I see the circle of other students with me. We look into each other's eyes so we can see we did this with eyes open. Now I am given a small clump of white sticks with gold ends on them. They are defensive weapons. I use them to hit out at an attacking man. I hit him at the eyes and at the groin. The multi dimensions of the sticks are supposed to make it easier to hit and cause pain with.
