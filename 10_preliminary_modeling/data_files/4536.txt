["Rocking out to sea."] I am being shown a special boat the loggers use on the river as they log. It's a rocker boat, a sort of raft with very high sides made of planks, like an old fashioned hay wagon. It is built to rock back and forth, sideways with the weight of all the logs they gather. I am on the boat and we are going out to sea. At first, we have a hard time getting across the beach to the ocean. I think it is odd we are on land and trying to move in a boat. I look up and see a huge cruise ship on the horizon of the land. Perhaps it is docked past the rise of the dunes. The scene is very dark, I can barely make out the shapes of the sand dunes and rocks. We finally struggle out to sea and cross the surf breakers. It is still very dark. I am seated to the right of and slightly behind a good looking man. I am trying to light a cigarette. Only all I have is a roll of money. I peal off a bill and light it. I puff away and then realize it is a 100 dollar bill. I blow it out and look for a one dollar bill to smoke. The man watches. He lays his arm around me, as he is attracted to me. I am attracted to him as well. I find a paper fake bill like a coupon and roll it up and light it. Suddenly a man behind us screams sharks. He is looking out behind us. I feel fear. A large shark roars up onto the raft with his mouth lunging at us. Then they are all around his. We turn and head back to shore. We are in danger and are running for our lives, only we are a slow moving boat. We dock and swerve to avoid being eaten. Finally we get back on shore, one shark still trying to follow us up onto the sand. I am afraid.
