       Later I'm in a department store at the perfume counter. I'm looking in particular at one scent, noticing the bottle I'm holding has an extra name on it (like they do so often now - a standard name is used with a "surname" as though it's a version of the original. When I look at the rest of the packages I see they all have surnames, as if there was no plain one. I wonder if they're just out of the plain one, or they're not making it anymore, or am I mistaken and they never did make a plain one?) The saleslady is still talking to the other customer. I put my purse down and look at some other things. In a minute, I see what I think is my purse up on a shelf behind the counter and I wonder how it got there - did the saleslady put it up there? There hasn't been time, has there? I go down and look, but it isn't my purse at all. For a second I'm disoriented, thinking I've forgotten where I left it - but it's down at the end of the counter, right where I was standing. <br/
