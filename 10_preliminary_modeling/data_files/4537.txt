["Robin Williams and me."] Robin Williams and I are walking together, outside somewhere. We walk ahead of other people. Suddenly, he kisses me and I am instantly sexually excited. We lie down on the grass and begin making wild love. I look around for a second to see if anyone is watching. But I don't really care. This feels good.
