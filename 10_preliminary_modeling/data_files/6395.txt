Alright. I'm in J City, but it's sometime way in the future, so the city is as big as Los Angeles. For some reason it's really warm and humid, and feels like San Antonio. The first few seconds of my dream are set in the daytime. I drive my car up to the top of this really big hill, and I come to an intersection where I can't make a right turn for some reason; it's a one way in the other direction or something... at any rate, the road is blocked off. So I park my car in this downtown section where all the buildings are sort of greenish. It reminds me of what I think of when I think "Jungle". The air is really, really humid. At any rate, I'm either looking around for a Chinese restaurant or my friend's house. I can't remember which but it may have been both. One way or another, I keep getting lost in this little tiny two-block area of huge green buildings, and this really attractive Italian woman comes around in front of me and says: "You're ----, aren't you?" She said some name, but it wasn't mine in real life. It was mine in the dream, though. So I said "Yes, I am." I probably would have agreed if she didn't say my name. She was absolutely gorgeous. <br/
