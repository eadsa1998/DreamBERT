I was watching a movie. It was like a documentary sometimes. This young guy (like 12) was at a shop. He ended p trying to help this teenage girl and her young brother from their father, who was violent. He went to their house and was now Heather Graham. I joked to the guy they should have sex on the 'squeaky couch'. The kids were like 'ew'. She was now the boy again. We went to leave and they got in the way. The daughter went to the father and then the kid realized it had been a set up so the father could rape him. I read the end of some book and asked someone if they had seen the movie yet and they said it wasn't out until next month. I was then at the cinema with Dawson (Dawson's Creek) and Pacey (Dawson's Creek) came.
