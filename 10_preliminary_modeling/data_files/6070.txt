My first dream since I received this sheet has consisted of some strangeness. To start off, I had a dream about my best friend (Patrina). She was working in a shoe store. I was in the store trying on shoes. Three girls came into the store who we did not get along with. They wanted Patrina to wait on them, but she didn't. (My girlfriend really works at a hospital, but she loves shoes.) Anyway, later on in the same store, my church had a fashion show. There was a lot of food. The dream just seemed to switch. I didn't even know about the fashion show. the next thing I knew I saw one of my old friends Andre. He said hello to me, then I woke up.
