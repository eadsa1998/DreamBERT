I was at home except it was different and it wasn't ours. This nice guy owned it and he looked like David Anders and had a Sark (Alias) accent. Two girls and I were staying there. He was in a meeting with these guys and was yelling at them. Later this guy, who was George Harrison, raped one of the girls who looked like Julie Benz. The other girl and I were hiding in my room. I ran into David's bedroom and told him I saw that "George Harrison was being gay". He got up and yelled at him and got rid of him. Some time later, he said we had to decide our relationship with him. We were randomly given two choices and mine were marry or lover. I liked him and he confessed to liking me and said he would've given me those two choices even if I hadn't gotten them. I was out the back and there were all these boxes. He said not to open them, but I did anyway. There were body parts in them (chopped and wrapped like in Dexter). I didn't let the other girls see it. I went inside and he was like "What are you going to choose now? You're not looking for a serial killer" and I was thinking 'Yeah, but Ted Bundy's pretty hot'. One of the girls didn't want to go out with him. There was a cute chicken. Sometime before, this guy died on a street. An old Asian dude went into, and took over, his body.
