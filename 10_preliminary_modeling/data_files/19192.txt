I was in a house. It was either my aunt's house or my uncle's house. I think it was my mother's house. We were having a Christmas party, and we were all sitting around drinking wine. There were several little bottles of wine around. Some of them had green tin foil on the ends and some had pink tin foil on the ends. I think they were Paul Masson, and the wines kind of ran out and nobody got high or anything. I guess you can't get high unless you really try. I went in the kitchen and my uncle was out in the kitchen. This is an uncle I'm very close to, and I was making some coffee, instant coffee. The coffee was already moist, and I put it in the cup and it wasn't mixing very well. There were little clumps of coffee that hadn't dissolved in hot water. Then I was stirring it, and he said, "Here, let me stir mine," and he was stirring his. That was when I woke up. Hall speaking: This Christmas party, which didn't have any Christmas decorations, but Sam felt it was Christmas. It was his mother and his uncle whom he has already mentioned, and his uncle's wife, that is, his aunt, and there were some other people too. They were some of his friends, but he doesn't remember who they were. They were drinking wine out of those little bottles. After the wine was gone, Sam went out into the kitchen to make some coffee.
