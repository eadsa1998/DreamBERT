I am slim and good-looking in a pretty dress. I am riding a bike. Men look at me in appreciation of how I look. I go to a cafe. The inside is crowded. I go to the old man who shows you where to sit. He smiles at me. I go there often. I say, "One." He looks around. There's only one place open, a school desk-like table right behind his. I sit there. Then I go up to get my food. I get a sandwich and a can of corn, but the can is flat. I go up to where the piano player is tuning up the piano and use the can opener. It opens it and I return to my table. I notice the can is still flat and mention it to the man who shows me the menu where for $3.00 more you can make the can round and actually get the food out. I am annoyed. What a ripoff. I decide to leave. Now the man is a spider and upset that I'm leaving. Now I'm creating a place to live, but the woman spider won't live there. She prefers to drown and throws herself in the water. The man/spider is very upset. I dive to try and rescue her (grandmother type woman). I search and search back and forth, feeling the sandy bottom. She's nowhere. I come up and see I'm at the edge of the room where the windows are. I see dustpans and say, "Oh, there they are." Now the man/spider goes into the next room following a single strand of silvery web. It is her. He asks her to please not die and leave him. She says, "I'll make a web and we'll both live in it." He agrees and I see two spiders together in one web. I feel repulsed by the spiders.
