Again I can't recall the entire dream; but it seems some men were trying to catch my horse (my ex-horse, I recently sold him). Jumping fence after fence, in what seemed to be the same paddock, my horse was frantically trying to escape these men. Finally the strange men must have given up for I heroically entered the paddock and easily captured him. I remember bridling him and then what happened I don't know for I seemed to be on some sort of a wooden contraption that bobbed up and down in an odd way. Some person was walking with me when I was on this wooden board-like affair. Everyone seemed to be in good humor, at least I don't recall any bad feelings among anyone.
