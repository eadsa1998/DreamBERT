I and a female friend went to a week long conference. We met two men. I met Russell Crowe and her I don't know who it was that she met. He and I both had other plans that were cancelled. As he came out of one room I didn't even introduce myself, just grabbed his hand, put it on my shoulder, turned around and said let's go get some coffee. He didn't even know who I was or anything. He just smiled and followed me into a dining area. Two or three people that he knew joined us right away. They started talking to him and didn't bother to introduce themselves to me. I didn't even get to say another word to him - to introduce myself to him or anything. Some people that I knew came in so I slipped away and sat at a booth with them, right behind the booth he was sitting at. I thought I would wait until he was done with his friends and then rejoin him. For some reason I decided to leave. When I came back he was sitting with Matthew, waiting for me. I thought that was so cool. I sat down. Matthew was much younger. Matthew walked away I think. We finally got to talk just a little before we got interrupted again. He kept really making an effort to spend some time getting to know me. There was something about chocolate cream pie. I think he kept trying to get a piece for me because he thought I would really like it, but someone else kept taking it. He was just being very persistent about getting this for me. The dream involved different events of the whole week, like he and I working on projects together.
