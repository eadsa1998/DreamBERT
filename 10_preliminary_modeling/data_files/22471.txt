I was in a field with lots of unknown people, looking at horses; there were many and very beautiful ones. I especially liked a white one. Suddenly I was at a horse race. There was a party and I didn't have anything to wear. Suddenly I was at the party in pajamas, a pink nightgown; there was noise. In a corner of the room there was a man standing; he was a movie star. Around him there were many girls with cigarettes in their mouths who were asking him to pay them. Suddenly I wanted his autograph and I approached him and tapped him on the back, but when he turned and looked at me, it was a beautiful girl with long hair who was there and told me to make a bet because her horse was going to win. In the dream there wasn't anybody I knew.
