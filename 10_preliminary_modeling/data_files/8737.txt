I lived in the same community as Julie Cr. It's a fairly new community with fairly updated looking buildings. I was walking outside when I saw her. I was quite surprised. We stopped and chatted a little. That's when she told me she was living there also. She gave me her address. It was a third or fourth floor apartment. She told me to come by for a visit. I went to see her one day. There is an upstairs outdoor hallway that is U-shaped. It has steel railings around both the inner and outer parts of the U. There are a lot of home accessories leaning against the railings. artwork, lamps, etc. It seems that it might have been stuff that Julie Cr was getting rid of or she was redecorating and had moved the stuff out there temporarily until she decided what would go back in and what she would get rid of. We were also talking about what she would do with the stuff she was going to get rid of.
