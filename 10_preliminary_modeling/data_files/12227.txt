I was on a bus with the school. I got off at a restaurant place and so did Dmitri. I went to see Nana and Dmitri went to a family reunion thing. It turned out that he was related to me, but we were cousins '50 million' times removed. Someone was wearing pajama shorts. His family's last name was Selfish (not his, but far up in his family tree).
