Dan Palmer was around and eating some weird food. Mom had some weird food from Granma like fish and eggs, that were strange colours like purple and pink. Dan put his bowl next to Mom's and they looked almost identical. We both took a picture of it. It was my birthday. We were at the old house. Granma called Mom and I told her to say I was out and she did. Mom was giving her my email as 'Izzy.conell@yahoo.com'. Then she pulled up in the driveway. I ran and told Mom that I had to go silent in my room for hours. There was a massive storm one night and Mom and Darren said they could see a hurricane. There was a movie with a leopard which attacked this girl after knocking on her door and when she went out he roared, but the girl got away. Something happened in the town 17 years ago and these kids survived but some stuff happened to them and the sheriff said they were 'strong' because of it.
