I was operating machines at White's. I was counting them. Pete Arendas came in. He was a doctor. When he came in, the women went around him and I had to look up and between the women to see who it was, and I saw Pete's face. We were in Gordon Park. I saw a big hawk fly down low. I said, "Look," to my friends, "how low the hawk comes when we don't have our guns." Then about three more hawks flew down with the other hawk. Mike Anthony was paying Bob for his work for him. He was counting the bills on three piles on Bob's lap. He counted $15. Bob said to me, "I'm glad I made that much." I had some new dream books. They were the size of this one, only about three times longer. I was looking at one and Kolesar had one of my books looking at the first page. I took it away from him and said, "Nobody reads these books, not even my wife." I was looking for a place to hide the books because we were going hunting. I was caressing a beautiful girl. I was going to kiss her, but she wouldn't let me. I looked at her sweet lips and wanted a kiss, but she moved away. I saw a big frame up of wood which was going to be pulled to a private lake. We were going to shop by Buy Rite and as we got near the store was a big long truck and trailer. It was moving away on the street. Ann bought some stuff that was left there she thought was a bargain. I walked down a hill to a river.
