I went up to our 3rd floor attic to get something that was stored there. I heard a noise and upon looking behind an old chair, I found our cat. She had had a kitten and was very proud of the fact. When I went downstairs she picked the kitten up by the nape of the neck and carried it tenderly and proudly between its teeth. When we got downstairs she took the kitten and deposited it very graciously in front of my mother.
