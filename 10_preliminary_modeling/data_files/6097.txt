This dream I had towards the end of the summer. It is about the guy I am now dating. We went out on our first date and he brought me two gifts -- a box of chocolate-covered raisins and a big chocolate chip cookie that said, "I love you." Our date consisted of a jazz festival-type fair with another couple. But on the way to the park we had to cross over a bridge that was very narrow and unsturdy. It felt like if we moved even the slightest bit, we'd fall. There were rocks below us. Oddly enough we were then buying cotton candy and watching clowns juggle in front of us. [The next thing I knew I was awake; it amazed me. The wierd thing about this dream is that I actually understand it and it makes sense to me. I don't know if I'm supposed to tell the significance of all this but since I know the background, I might as well. This guy and I have had the rockiest and most controversial relationship ever. Our getting together was what we saw as inevitable, but we have actually come far. I think that's where the narrow bridge and rocks down below come into my dreams. This was a big obstacle to overcome and if we overcame that we could actually survive. The odd part is the big cookie, which he never actually gave me in the dream, but when I was awake I knew what it was. I woke up before he gave me the box and I still knew what it said. I think this is due to all my friends saying how much he really cares about me.]
