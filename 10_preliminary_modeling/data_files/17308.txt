My boyfriend Jeremy and I rented a place for a night; it was to be our vacation.  It was a small place, with many doors that were not for us.  It was kind of reminiscent of a mobile home, with white, and fake green grass.  We watched a movie with our friend Jake and Celia, and then I found the pool.  I went back to change.  I put on my bathing suit, but it wasn't the blue and green one or the blue one with silver squares, like I'd expected.  It was sort of green, but didn't cover well.  Then there was a yellow-topped black one, and several others, but I couldn't find mine.
