I was at school and I was in a class taught by one of my high school English teachers. I was taking a shower out in the middle of class while everyone else was learning English lit. I was wearing all my clothes in the shower. For some reason even though I was washing with soap and standing right under the water I was not getting wet. I finally realized I had my clothes on. So I took them off and then the class was over. My ex-boyfriend and the teacher of class came into my shower like I wasn't even naked and started talking to me. I sat down on the bottom of the shower to shave my legs and there were little ants crawling up the side of a wood pole in my shower because the shower was made out of wood.
