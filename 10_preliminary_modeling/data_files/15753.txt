I looked outside and there were these weird dark grey clouds coming towards us. Tried to get the cats inside, but Gizmo and Sapphire were still outside somewhere. There were these moths and one grabbed Cuddles and lifted her up. I started whacking it and it died. They were a little larger than normal size moths, but they were strange.
