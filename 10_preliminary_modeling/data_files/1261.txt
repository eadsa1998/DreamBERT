Paulina and I are in some Arabic country. We want to cross the river but there is no bridge and the current is swift. We ask a woman how much a taxi would cost. She says, "$9.50." We snort, "Ha!," and say, "No way!" We walk away. She calls after us, "$6.00." It's still too high. Then Paulina lies down, crying out in pain. The woman comes to her. Paulina twists around so only I can see her face and she winks. She's putting it on. I lecture her. "Don't do that! It is wrong to get something by lying."
