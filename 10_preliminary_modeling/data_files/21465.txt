I was sitting on the front porch floor against the side of the house. The wind started to blow. It blew steady. It seemed like 100 per hour, stopped, then came again. John Mitchkash was sitting on a cart eating his lunch and all at once his cart started to move and he jumped off and let the cart go. The wind stopped and I went to the back yard, looked up at the sky and there was a sunrise decoration on the sky, not too beautiful. I said to one of the men working, "I talked to the wind. I said, Ã”Why don't you blow again?'" I saw a big cat walking along the street. It was sort of like a red color and was as big as a mountain lion. I yelled at the kid who was walking up to the cat to pet it. Ann said, "That is a domestic cat. It won't hurt you." It walked back towards us and up to me. It got up against me with its front paws and licked my face. I closed my eyes as it did so.
