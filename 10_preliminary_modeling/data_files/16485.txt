I was in the bedroom of this house, that was like our house, and I was with two of the other boys, and I was [laugh] putting together this really strange contraption. I had a black tube that was about three feet long, and it was about, it had two speakers attached to it kind of taped on with electrical tape at either end of the tube. And there were wires in the middle of the tube that connected them, and in the middle of this, that would come up from the tube vertically like a T, and on top of that I was going to put some kind of a -- like a control unit like type thing, like -- I don't know -- a crazy box. I don't know what it was supposed to do, but I wanted to rig it so that there was like a display that I wanted to rig on the outside of the tube, and I was soldering these wires all together so the thing would work. And I took the control box and I laid it face down on the bed, and I had this little bin of fasteners and I had this soldering iron that was about as heavy as a drill, and it was sort of, it had a wide, round tip that had a little boop in the center, and it had the solder within it instead of on a separate little thing. And what you would do is you would heat it up and you'd tip it upside down on the tip, and you would dab a little bit on and it would melt and you'd stick on whatever you wanted to stick on while it was still liquid. And I had these fasteners that were wires with little round tips at the end, so I was laying them in the thing, laying them in the blob of solder that I put on the terminals, and when I was done with this iron thing, I would like lay it on the bed. And worse yet, I would lay it on a newspaper on the bed. And when I woke up, I thought, "Oh, my gosh, why the heck would I do something like that?" And there were these two boys just watching what I was doing, and they were kind of jiggling and jury-rigging the wires inside this tube. And then I woke up.
