 I hear that my friend Jose Ramos has shot a four point buck with his bow. I'm outside a house talking with people about this. I ask if Jose saw other deer. I'm inside the house at a small gathering at a table. Many people suddenly arrive, including my friends Elise Rooks, Nate Nelling, and other old friends from High School. We all hug each other, talk, and drink beer. In the refrigerator are a small cake and some liquor that someone has brought for me, for my birthday. My family is staying the night in this place. It seems we're the guests of a couple, who are my mom's friends the Lapmans, but don't look like the Lapmans. I argue with George Lapman about dreams. I vehemently say he is wrong! We need to leave early the next morning to drive somewhere. We need to have left by 8:00am, and I know it will take 1.5 hours to get ready, so I set the alarm for 6:30am.
