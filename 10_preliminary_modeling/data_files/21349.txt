I was camping at night with the boys. We were sleeping and someone was pestering me. He got hold of my arm and I freed myself and I was going to beat him up, but he was just joking. I heard some kids crying. They were fighting. I went over to them and they were two Joe's. The one that was crying rolled his eyes back. I could see the white of his eyes only and they were big and blue and he said, "I love him anyway." He meant the boy that was fighting him. We were helping a spy to get to Canada in a car, but we didn't know he was a spy. A kid was trying to hide, conceal an object. It was a rosary under some apples, but when he put the rosary under the apples, they would stick up too high and his mother would notice that. I was back at work and there was nothing to do. There were vats that were full of grease in the bottom. We had lunch and I was going to do something. I was going to clean the vats. Later Ernie K and I had brooms and we were sweeping. We were sweeping the river or brook out. It was dry and some dirty water would come down. We finally got down to where there was some clean standing water. I looked in and saw a turtle. I put my broom under him and threw him on shore. I noticed I was barefooted. So I thought if there was another turtle in there, he might bite me by the toe. I saw something like a turtle's head. I pried it with the broom handle and it came loose. It was a muffler from a car.
