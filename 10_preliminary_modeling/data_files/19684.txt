Mamma and my brother are eating a meal on the south porch of our hometown house. I am in the kitchen (of 25 Mill Rd.) and notice a couple of pale colored insects run underneath the sort of wooden ledge just above the sink. On the underside of this ledge are a number of small, square compartments in each of which is a mounted specimen of a Lepidopteran. The 2 insects I saw prove to be good-sized moths, and I catch both in my fingers. While catching them I notice one of the "blues" (tiny blue butterfly) fanning its wings, but I do not try to catch it. Glancing into the dinette I notice someone's head appearing and disappearing at the window, and realize it is someone jumping up and down outside the house. I wonder if it is a thief, but someone in kitchen tells me it is Al Stone. I go outside to see him. He has a small spray gun, and he tries to tell me something about flies, but my hearing is so dull that I cannot understand, even after asking him to repeat until I am embarrassed. Suddenly it dawns on me that I should introduce him to my mother, but then I remember that they already have met each other. It is Aunt Cora's birthday and she comes into kitchen. There is a strange car, a sedan, parked by the front gate, and a black touring car parked in my driveway. I determine to go outside and find who is blocking the driveway, and if necessary call up the police and ask them to remove the car. I put on a bathrobe preparing to go out. Then someone tells me the car belongs to her brother (?Aunt Cora's brother). I then walk up to her, take her hand (there are tears in my eyes), and offer to take her home, saying that surely, on your birthday, there is no reason you shouldn't ride in my car.
