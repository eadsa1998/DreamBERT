 I'm in a restaurant. There is one person next to me, slightly behind me out of my view. We both have guns. There are two people, a man and a woman, at the other end of this long, narrow restaurant. They have guns. We shoot at each other. This seems scandalous, like a robbery involving ruthless drunk criminals with guns. I shoot the woman. My gun only fires once in a while, though I pull the trigger a lot. The man comes close to me. I cannot or do not fire, but I know I'll be okay. The person I'm with, next to me, has a gun. The man gets right in front of us. My partner shoots him in the chest. The man is awake and coherent, but is stunned. I beat him over the head with the butt of several different guns. He acts drunk, but he should be dead. There is a fat man lying in bed with the criminal woman. She hits or knees him. He gets up and runs to the bathroom to vomit. He doesn't make it. He stops, sits on the corner of the bed, and vomits on the floor. This has the feeling of a tragic criminal love drama story.
