I had an appointment to visit with Doctor C, just to stop and say hello. When I went to see him we were sitting and chatting. He was being a bit of a jerk, as he can sometimes be. During the course of our chat I started asking him about something and he was just being a jerk. I got upset and just decided to leave. I got up to leave and I gave him a hug and my eyes were tearing. He saw that and apologized. One of us said we would just try again sometime. Sara C was there and also gave me a hug. As I turned to walk away she said, give us a kiss. I kind of mouthed a kiss at them and turned and left. I don't know if I'm observing or if I'm talking to someone about him. They were told there was a change in the schedule. They had to change all of the people who were scheduled for a particular day to the following Saturday. The person who had to make these calls was very upset about it. I think it might have been me talking to this person. I finally asked this person if they would want to know how I would handle it. They said yes. I said I would just move everyone to the same time that they were scheduled but on Saturday. So the person who was scheduled for 9:30 on the day they have to change, call and tell them what has happened and that you are rescheduling everyone, that you've given them the same timeslot and ask them if that will work for them. If they say no, then work at finding another slot for them.
