["Helping the drunk man."] I am a waitress at a bar and cafe. My boss is grumpy and demanding. I go up to the first customer's table and he proceeds to complain angrily that I am doing everything wrong. I maintain my pleasant attitude, listen to him and then ask what he would like to order. I go to the next one and so on. Meanwhile a good looking man, sort of like Raoul, comes in. He works there too as a waiter. He is drunk. The boss threatens to fire him. He is angry. The waiter goes upstairs to the loft to take a break. I go up there also. He is very drunk. He is attracted to me and I feel great empathy and attraction for him. He goes downstairs and is unable to function. I take him aside to a couch and sit him down. I curl up around him and he finally relaxes enough to sleep. His male friends watch approvingly. The boss is still angry but doesn't interfere. Finally he sleeps. I feel content and happy to be helping him. Then I finally fall asleep. He awakes more refreshed and sober and curls up around me, loving me gently. Somehow we are going to survive.
