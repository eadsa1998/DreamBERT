I was camping somewhere. I got up and took my pills. I was talking with my mother and Dwight. I then decided to take my pills. I did so. Then I realized with panic that I had taken them twice. At first I thought, "Oh well. I'll be O.K.," but the panic rose and I got up to find a phone to call doctor A. My cousin Willie laughed at me and told my mother and Dwight that I was going to call the doctor. They laughed too. I was very angry and I yelled, "You can just fuck off." My mother said, "What did I say?" Willie or Dwight repeated it. Now I was embarrassed and angry at the same time. I tried to find a phone. I was on a street where there were lots of stores. I realized that I was in M City. I looked at people's faces hoping I might recognize people I went to high school with. I found a phone on the outside of a store. I noticed I was close to my cousin Terence's bicycle shop. I thought, "I guess I'll drop in and say hi after I call doctor A." I looked in my purse for my address book. It was a loose leaf and the pages had gotten loose. I was struggling trying to find doctor A's number. A line of people were standing behind me. I saw two couples that were going together in high school and seemed to be still happy together. I said, "I know you but I can't remember your names." One said, "XXX" and the other said, "XXX." The girls said her name. I took off my sun glasses and said, "I'm Barb Sanders." I took the glasses off again. I was aware of wrinkles around my eyes. They vaguely remembered me. As we were talking, I became aware that I was taking too long and so I offered the phone to the man waiting in line, if it were a quick call. He said, "No, it's O.K. I'll wait." A woman started to help me find doctor A's #. I looked at her and said, "Hey! Hi!" I was glad to see her. I pronounce her name oddly (she was not the one I thought she was).
