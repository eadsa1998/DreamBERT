I was living in an apartment in the city. I was setting up my computer in a chair. I was trying to kind of stack it so it would stay in place against the back of the chair and I was going to use it that way. I was trying to figure out a way to set it so I could easily access the A drive. I was also changing my clothes at the same time. I went out to go to a nearby store to get something related to the computer but I don't remember what. It was raining. I think the place that I went into was kind of like a mall but it was fairly narrow and it was as if I was walking through one store and then another to get to each store. When I got to the store, I was looking for I went to the counter and was discussing my needs with a young man there. An older man came out. I realized it was Mike M. I didn't acknowledge that it was him, nor did he acknowledge that it was I. He came up to the counter and joined in the discussion. I realized that my clothes were lying around and I quickly grabbed them up, embarrassed for him to see that, especially since my bra was lying there to. I embarrassingly said, Sorry, I was changing my clothes while I was working. I'm sure he knew it was me because he has seen a picture of me. I haven't seen a picture of him so I don't know how I knew it was him. We finished our discussion and I rushed out of the store, back through the other stores, and out into the rain.
