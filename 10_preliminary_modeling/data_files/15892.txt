I was with a friend on this underwater ship. I can't remember why or what we were doing on there. At some point we went outside briefly and I had a watermelon. The water started to go down and we were somehow informed that the ocean was losing all of its water briefly. Then we were on the ground with the ship. It just looked like a road, it was completely flat and was painted on. There were walls all around it. The sun was quite bright. There was a big storm coming [I woke up earlier to hear talk of a storm coming] and would replace all the water. We saw some big clouds forming in the sky, and a weird dark cloud low down. I went back into the ship, but then it showed that the weird cloud was actually a giant turtle on a section of Earth. It fell and landed on the ship, crushing half of it, then the turtle rolled off and the Earth rolled over to crush the other side of the ship. I was then outside and 'I' had gone in, but I was another version of me. I told my friend we couldn't go back to the ship and had to find somewhere to go before the storm started. We found a blow-up water toy thing which you could get inside, so we climbed into that (you had to lie down in it), but his side had a broken zip, so we rolled it up and held it. It started to rain and we realised this was no good. We were then somehow on the street and there were shops nearby. I suggested going to Kathmandu to get a boat [they don't sell boats]. It was raining quite hard outside and all these famous people and people I knew were around. My friend was then Nathan Fillion. I saw Mr Hoover walking down a road at some point.
