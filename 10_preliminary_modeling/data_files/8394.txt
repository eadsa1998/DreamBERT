I was with family but I don't know who's house we were at. Jim D called and then showed up. I was so thrilled to hear from him again and to see him. It was nothing physical. He was there visiting with me around the family. We had shared a couple of meals together. At one time he and someone else was hungry so I went to McDonald's for them. When I came back I was putting their food on plates. I noticed that the french fries were not done well. They were very soggy, not crispy. This is odd because I thought before that they said they wanted me to go the little Chinese place around the corner from my house. Jim D left and called me at work and left a message on my voice mail. Part of his message said that our voice greeting was too confusing or long or complicated. I went to tell Bill F and he got a little defensive and didn't like it. I said that Jim D had been in the voice mail business for many years and I just thought I would pass it along.
