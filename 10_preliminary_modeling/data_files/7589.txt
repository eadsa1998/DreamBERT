My mother was sick in the hospital and I was taking care of my father. I mean taking care of the house and everything. Finally one day my father put his arms around me and was going to hug me, but not in the same way he usually hugs me, more of a romantic way, like my own boyfriends do, and I didn't like it. I was highly insulted and he said to me, "Sally, you are so much like your mother." And I said I absolutely would not and he begged me and I absolutely wouldn't and I woke up struggling to get away from him.
