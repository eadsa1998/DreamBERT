I go through a huge store to the back room. I'm tired and lie down on a bed. Suddenly I wake up to discover John (a man I work with) has crawled into bed with me, and he's naked. I pull the covers up around me and say, "What are you doing?" He's shy but insistent. He wants to make love, to get closer to me. He tries to kiss me. I am annoyed. I certainly don't want to make love to this wimp; what nerve! I say, "No. We can't. I'm your supervisor and it isn't ethical." I then think he'll be hurt, so I say, "I admire your courage to get naked and come here asking, but I don't want this." Just then through an open window I see people leaning out of their windows in the hotel across the street yelling, "Happy New Year" and blowing horns. I look at the clock and, sure enough, it's a few minutes past 12. [BL]
