I could only remember blurred, confused parts of this dream. I know there was an old, self-service elevator &amp; and my friends operated all through the dream. We'd either stop too high or too low &amp; could never quite adjust to floor level. Something about a man &amp; we, I don't know what cause my friends to say it was his fault &amp; excuse me. I know he was in the dream. We embraced frequently &amp; in their presence. They said our positions were vulgar. I don't remember who he was, but I knew him. I was then in a store choosing oranges for my mother. I said none of them were Juicy enough. Then I was the clerk &amp; apologized for being dressed in a skirt &amp; sweater.
