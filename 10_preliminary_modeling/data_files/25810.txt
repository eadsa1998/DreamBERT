 I'm driving my truck in mud and gravel. My classmate Bethany Hurwitz is watching me. I am selling drugs to a man. I try to act cool because Bethany is watching. The man I am selling drugs to hires women because he runs a daytime strip club. I see one woman, who seems nice. The man is mean to the woman, and won't let her have the day off.
