I was with Ann at some friends of ours from the old neighborhood and I saw John Chipka and his wife coming. They were to meet us. I was offered food and drink by the people we were with. I was counting something. There seemed to be eight pieces like the number of horses I had on a list. I seemed to end at four, then I seemed to come back to one.
