While walking down a sidewalk beside Wistful Blvd. , I saw Anne Panelli walking toward the water in a bathing suit.   I thought it strange, since it wasn't very warm, and it had been raining.  Right after we said hello, I heard someone call me.  I turned around and saw Jean Brewer getting out of a car about a half-block back.  She said she had left something at the store (Winn-Dixie) and had to go back to get it.  She took my hand and started running up the street on the sidewalk.  I could hardly keep up.  A few times, with a great deal of effort, I succeeded in catching or passing her, but found it hard to keep the pace.
