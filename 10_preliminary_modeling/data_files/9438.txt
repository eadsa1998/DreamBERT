I see one of my close friends about to have a baby in a lobby under very primitive conditions. Hear her cry of pain as the baby is born. It looks like a rabbit. I say: "Let it flow. Allow the natural processes to expel the afterbirth." I put a receptacle under her to catch the blood. I notice that the baby has two left feet but after a day it looks OK.
