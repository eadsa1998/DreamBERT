There's this man who is teaching a night course in movie critiquing. He's in love with a woman who is an alien and she's in love with another man. She hires out as a butler in the creepy mansion of the bad man to check out and get evidence. I/the man who loves her, comes and disguises myself and comes in the house. I see the alien man, the mobster bad man, and follow as the butler girlfriend follows him and takes pictures. Now it is time to escape, they are on to us, so we find a corner of the lawn where a dirt slide is built into the embankment. We slide down one by one and get into something, maybe a back of a van or a room, I'm not sure. I am getting ready for bed. My parents are there, and my father is helping me get cozy. He puts a warm stocking hat nightcap on my head, mittens on my hands and little "booties" like stocking caps for my breasts. A warm robe is on after that and the blankets are tucked in and I'm saying, "Ok, it was a strange movie, there was this guy who was in love with an alien woman and she was in love with another man and then they were in the bad man's house and she was a butler, only they got suspicious because she looked alien to them." My mother interrupts, "Well, of course they would notice, how silly," and I go on telling the story of the movie and say the man in love with the woman is a movie critic who teaches a night class once a week.
