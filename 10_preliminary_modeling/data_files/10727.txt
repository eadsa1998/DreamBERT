I dreamed an elderly man, an old friend of mine, came to visit me at a house in which an aunt lived at one time. We were standing in the kitchen and he seemed to want me to read a letter. He held it in his hand, outstretched to me, but I was more concerned in looking into the other rooms to see if anyone was there to see him. I was rather anxious that he should not be seen and that he should leave at once.
