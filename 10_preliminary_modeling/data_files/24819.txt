I was in Nintendo 64's Mario Brothers gameland, and this big baracuda was chasing me around a sunken ship. I was swimming as fast as I could. It was really strange and fast. Setting: Nintendo 64, one of the levels I played that night. Characters: It was me and this big like 30--foot long red and black baracuda. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was really scared and frantic and nervous that I was going to get eaten. The weird thing is that night I had played the level I had my dream in.
