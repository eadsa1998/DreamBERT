This dream jumps around a lot, but I was in an alternate universe. I was given prescription medicine in pill form, which was opium, but they were smokes. Calvin was talking about Genevieve touching him and something about bandages. Mom straightened half of my hair. I was at school and realized about my hair. I saw Granma and she wouldn't call Mom. I started walking on the grassed area near senior school. Someone told me Dmitri liked me and wanted to go out with me. I said that I didn't and a bird pooped on my head. I saw Dmitri walking down the corridor. I was at home and then I called Mom. I went to this other universe. Then I was me and alternate me was with me. She would disappear in seven months. There was this big vacuum thing sucking everything. I couldn't get out of the way, but I managed to. These others and I were trapped in this box. We were getting out and there were these time capsules in there. We all got up except for Julian Sands, because if he went to get him we would fall in. He wrote his last dream down and gave it to me.
