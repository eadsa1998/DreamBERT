I am with a woman and we go up a flight of stairs. It is hard. I wonder why I keep trying to do it. We are in a hotel where there are no walls between rooms. The placement of the furniture tells you where a room is. There is communal dining, and a back stairs for the more privileged, richer guests. I see Chuck. He ignores me, won't look at me or talk to me. He's angry. I say to him, "Isn't it OK that I want to quit work?" He says, "No!" He doesn't approve. He has Carona disease and he didn't stop work. I say, "Isn't arthritis worse than that?" He says no. I feel upset.
