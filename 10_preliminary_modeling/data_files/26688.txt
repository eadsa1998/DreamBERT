 My sisters Heather and Ramona and another woman are in a beauty competition together. It's possible that all three could end up in the same competition, on the same day, at the same time, in the same place, etc.... This would be interesting and unique, and for them, maybe monumental. This possibility seems to be a big deal.. They all sit on a couch. Ramona is on the left, Heather in the middle, and the other woman on Heather's right. Family members sit in between each of them. I note their eyebrows. Ramona's eyebrows are connected, and form the shape of a sine wave. Heather's eyebrows are meticulously plucked and arched, very thinly. The third woman's eyebrows are also connected, but they are not smooth like Ramona's: there is a jagged patch of eyebrow above the bridge of her nose. I view them on the couch from about fifty feet away.
