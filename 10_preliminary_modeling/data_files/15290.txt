I had a job interview [in real life I had one this day]. It was almost time and I went to get changed and Mom hadn't taken my clothes out of the washing machine -- I had a pair of dress pants and a collared button shirt that had blue stripes. Ezra had a shirt but it was too big. I went and the interviewer was a young guy. There were two other girls there. There was a busy room in like a sports club. He said 'why not come back later today' and there were jobs on slips of paper. A girl took one -- it was something about someone called George looking for a character to play. The other girl took one that was to blow up this sports centre. Stellan Skarsgard was the father of something and a girl said she had finally gotten a team for the place. He called the girl and asked her to abort. She asked someone for something and they said no. It was night. Then I was there and it was day. There was a fire. There was a room with my DVD's, Wii etc and a bookdshelf of my diaries. The DVDs were all burnt and I was like 'not Monty Python and Red Dwarf!' and grabbed my Wii and this other thing. The fire burned out. I opened a door slowly and moved a curtain out the way and the fire got sucked out. I left. The guy from before was walking down the street and said I could have the job. I complained to Mom about losing my stuff, but was happy about the job. I went to Red Rooster and someone blocked out the 's' and they had a weather sign.
