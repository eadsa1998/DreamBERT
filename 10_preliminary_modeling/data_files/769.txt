I was giving a presentation at work. All the staff members were there. I finally was ready. People were getting their cafeteria lunches in next room. People were moving in and out. A few people were really listening. I was talking about disabled students at the community college. Halfway in the middle of the speech, people just got up and left. It was lunch time. They had things to do. I turned and a girl spoke to me. She was describing a terrible incident she had witnessed. I became a good counselor, drew her aside, noted that it was OK for her to cry and I listened well.
