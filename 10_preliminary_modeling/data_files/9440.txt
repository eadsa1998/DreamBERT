Back with Edward in an apartment overlooking the Bay area. It is cold and foggy. We both work in S.F. Happy for two days, but then one day I miss the train to S.F. I see the RR tracks but am told the train just pulled out. I have a sinking feeling. I have to turn in my tricket and go by bus which takes much longer. I get to whre we work and find out that Edward has to work long hours, evenings, and won't be home for supper. Very oppressive feeling.
