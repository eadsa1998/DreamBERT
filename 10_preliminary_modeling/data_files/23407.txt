I was at some place where I was supposed to give birth in a water tub and I was ready to give birth. When I get there, there was no water tub and whoever I was supposed to meet wasn't there, but there happened to be a pool of dolphins and a smaller pool where I could give birth. I jumped in the bigger pool to swim with the dolphins first. One of them came up to me and I wrapped my arms around it and we swam together. I then got in the smaller tub and gave birth to a girl. She was fully clothed, even shoes. She was smiling and immediately went for the bigger pool to jump in. She looked older than a newborn. I panicked because I didn't think I could swim to the edge with her being still attached. So one of the women (there were two) jumped in and held the baby and we swam together to the edge and set the baby on it. That's when I realized she was fully clothed.
