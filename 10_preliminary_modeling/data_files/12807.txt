We went to Little Britain again. Someone was talking about some bra. It was completely different. David Walliams was talking to some guy. He went on the stage and had to blow his nose and get rid of this thing. He was then talking about something boring and was taking forever. Dad complained and Ezra asked why it was taking so long.
