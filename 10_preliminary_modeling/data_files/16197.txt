I was at Grammy's house in Jackson and that we had stayed for about a week and that we were going home, and I hadn't gone upstairs yet, and I decided I wouldn't. And then all of a sudden I was at school and I was like going in during the summer time and getting something for somebody, and I didn't want to go up the hallway on the east side because it was like totally dark, so I went on the west side and went up to Mrs. Hollander's room, talked to her for a little bit and then came down. And then descended the stairwell, which was totally in the dark for some reason. And then I was in the living room decorating this fan, you know like the fan we have in the living room that is portable? Well, I was decorating it with like these sequins that were supposed to represent MP3 files in some way. And there were light bulbs inside the fan that lit up, and Mom was suggesting to me that there were light bulb sockets on the outside and that I should take them off and put them on the outside. And then there was this light-up frog. I couldn't tell if it was a frog or an owl, and Mom was talking to me about somebody who gave it to me, and I was holding it like from the bottom, and this fan-thing inside of it like turned on and made a wind. I threw it down and it went dark, and then I woke up. How bizarre! How bizarre! [laugh]
