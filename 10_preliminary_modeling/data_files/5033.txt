Two men love me, an old flame and a new one. I am awash with loving attention. They vie for my attention. I go outside with one of them who is now a woman friend. We go to sit on an embankment. Someone says, "This is where lovers sit." I feel uneasy. So I sit on other spots nearby, hoping no one is watching and getting the wrong idea. Then a barrier slides open and I get a beautiful view of the open sea. [BL]
