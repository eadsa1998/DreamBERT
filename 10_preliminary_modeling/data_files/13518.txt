I was at home. Mom and Darren were there. We thought someone was in the house and Darren saw some suspicious activity outside. These two guys came up to the house and then a car pulled up. There was a drug deal and they had heaps of drugs. This guy had weird hair that went out into a point. He went to the woodshed and was trying to get through the laundry door. He climbed in backwards and I kicked him in the bum. I told Dad and we laughed. The people threatened us and we had to all take drugs out to them. Then the main person, a lady, said she wanted 100, but would settle for 60. I told Mom then tried to go to 55. The police came and caught and arrested all of them. Someone came with a parrot and there was a message. It had blue bubbles. The guy with the hair came back another time. I heard someone in the woodshed. I was putting more stuff in the door so he couldn't open it, but it could still open enough.
