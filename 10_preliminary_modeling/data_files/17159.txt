Another violent dream.  At first it was just my brother Stuart and I shooting poison-filled straws from Jack in the Box at each other.  Then we got 'missions' from my old best friend Candy, along with old pictures.  It wasn't so much a game anymore.  There was a whole series of things.  We were trying to stop a bad guy.  I suppose in some ways it was like a video game; screw up on something you do the first time, start over.  Things like climbing on a barn roof.  Having just the perfect timing.  To release and close the electrified gates between the farmhouse buildings.  We chased the guy across the street and waited for him.  He was going to get more ammo or something.  I hid behind some sort of red rug that was up.   There were a lot of people around, like it was some sort of reenactment or something to watch.  There was about 3 feet between the red piece of fabric behind which I was hiding and a wooden building.  I don't know where my partner went.  Our target came back.  He ducked into the building behind me; we cornered him, and shot him down.  Even though our guns were just poison straws, which should probably take a while to take effect (one of the reasons the pursuit had been taking so long) blood bubbled up through holes in his shirt.   I wanted to do something to help...especially since he seemed to be repenting.
