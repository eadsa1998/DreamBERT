I am living in the house where I lived when I was first married. My husband is in some kind of trouble and has been arrested. His male cousin knows where there is peppermint growing among marijuana plants. He says it is there because people can pick it and the cops won't know it is marijuana. I need peppermint, so I go there to pick it. There is also something about the library at the high school I attended.
