I was dreaming that I was going to Savannah, Georgia, and about to go to see the Olympics with some of my close friends. We all walked in together and ate and it was nice and sunny but not like a normal day. We sat in bleachers that looked like the Metrodome seats. We also were up really high but could still see really well. My friends and I were about to leave when the Olympics finally started and when they did we got up and started to walk down the stairs but they kept on going.
