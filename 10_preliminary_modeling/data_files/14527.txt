I did a third course at the MUPC called House. It was run by House (House) and there weren't many people in the class. He told us what was in the exam, but didn't know when the exam was. He told us what books to study so I thought about going to the library to get them. Emma Watson was in the class and had taken a file thinking it would be helpful. They were building plans. His journal was on the desk. There were weird jokes written in it. He thought it was Calvin who had taken the file, but someone had noted that it was Emma. There was a note about me and my dream book, but he didn't know what it was. There was a photo of me when I was younger. There was another photo of Ezra and Ariana on a cow print chair. I was telling Mom about it later.
