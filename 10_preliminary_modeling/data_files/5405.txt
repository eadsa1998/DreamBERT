My first dream was that I was researching something in the library and it closed early, so I had to leave and go to lunch. The dining hall was huge --like the size of Grand Central. Gary was doing some sort of dance, and Sue was trying to talk to me while I got raspberry and mandarin orange flavored avocados. There was a live band there for some reason. Before I knew it, however, I was in New York babysitting this boy, Preston. He had myspace and 2 of his friends were coming over to play. But I couldn't find Preston. His friends arrived, a brown haired girl and a boy who looked much older than Preston. The boy was German and had an older brother my age. The brother was really cute and asked me to watch his brother for an hour or so. I gave up on Preston and watched the German boy instead. Finally the older brother came back after having coffee, and we all took the train back to my school's state. Then I went back to the city and was living in an apartment. Across the street Jennifer Garner taught 3rd grade. Ben Stiller was living with me and wanted to go to Jennifer's classroom. They met on the side of the street and she loved his poodle, Fluffy. They agreed to meet later for an ice cream. This train ran into my apartment and ruined everything. My mother and I were scrambling out. In the scuffle, we lost Fluffy, but we found Skye and Fritz, who were alive. We stepped onto the street and the cute German boy saw me. His mother thought I was Swedish. My brother was hanging around by the train wreck, and my father, my mother, and I all drove over to take him away. He wanted to show off in front of Francine and her friends, so he hopped in backwards through the window. Then I woke up.
