President Lyndon Johnson made a speech on TV and apparently I must have missed his talk. Someone has asked me to get a lot of copies. I ask a store and their price is $89 for 12 copies and I cannot calculate the per speech price and this annoys me. I wonder why they cannot arrange to have the fire bells or horns ring for a few minutes with some special signal that would alert the public to the fact that the Pres. is going on TV.
