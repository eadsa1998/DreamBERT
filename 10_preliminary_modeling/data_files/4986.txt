I am dancing with a man up a series of flights of stairs. It's very dramatic and faked. There are lots of hand and arm gestures. We are playing to an audience, but it's no where to be seen. Now I'm moving my files from one office to the other. Mabel has my pill box and I'm looking for her. I find it and take a white 5 mg pill thinking she forgot to give me it with the four pink ones this morning. A man comes into the office; it's Mitch. We are friendly. We look out the window and start kissing. [BL]
