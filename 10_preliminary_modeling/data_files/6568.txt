I start to do dishes. H. having got supper sits down to rest. I suggest L. She consents to do so until partly done. I start to heat water and light fire in stove. They decide to use gas and try to put out fire. An iron bar with blue flame runs lengthwise beside two sticks and paper. I blow out flame. Push out table and find it has drawers like a desk on sides towards wall. Finally find water and hunt for cup to dip it. After some time find it. Trying to spit up obstruction in throat and find I'm vomiting. (L. is a sister who up until the thirties  did not get along well with me and H. is my favorite sister who had married and left home some time before.)
