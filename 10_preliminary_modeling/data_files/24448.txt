I am in Africa again. There are abandoned metal objects on the ground. I seem to be with someone else; we are flying low over the ground, surveying the land. We decide to salvage a damaged plane. We pick the plane up in tow. It is unclear if I am flying the damaged plane or the one used for surveying. In any event I am at the controls and telling the other person with me that I have very little or no feeling of control. This other person, patient and willing, remains calm and gives me encouragement.
