I had a balloon tied to a party of my motor and the car rang. Ralph or Harold Schultz stole my pistol and was going to rob us, but I got the shotgun and shells and I and my family got near him. I pointed the shotgun at him and told him to surrender, but he wouldn't. He pointed the pistol at members of my family. I sneaked up closer till he got reckless and then I jumped him and took the gun away from him. I held him by one arm and he got tough with me. I punched him. When we arrived at his home, two policemen were waiting for him. They took him into custody. I was standing on a hill looking down about a half mile where my car was parked. The view was clear. I was chasing a ball. It fell into a creek and floated on top. I missed it as it came by, so I ran down the creek and caught it. The boss was looking for Lennie Delatt. I got my foot caught in a revolving sand paper belt and it cut thru my shoe. A lady came by and gave us some kind of candy that was attached to feathers.
