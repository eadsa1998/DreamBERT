I had a dream that I was at work and it was time to close the store. I went into the back room and shut all the lights. When I came back out there was a guy in the store who said he wanted to buy something. He was acting kind of strange. He went over to the register. The girl I was working with rang his sale up in the register. I started to walk into the back to turn the lights back on and he shot my coworker. I ran over to him and I was screaming for him to stop. He shot me too. Then I woke up!
