[1997-06-15] I was in my old office up on 6th avenue, where I worked about 5 years ago. I was with my old work mate, P, who I haven't talked to in about 10 years. I was back there using my computer and I was in Windows and all of a sudden I got a message through my speech synthesizer that said "fire inside computer" and I went over to P and I said "Hey P, you better take a look at this thing I think its on fire." She looked at it and she said "You're right, it is." But there was a computer program that had a little woman in there and she went and found the fire and put it out with a little fire extinguisher. A couple of minutes later I asked P if it was still on fire and she said "No, she put it out immediately. A couple of times it's flared up but as soon as I see it, the little woman also sees it and puts it out." And I just thought that's amazing! And I thought I wish that I'd backed up my data better because if this fire did a lot of damage in there then I'm going to lose all of that information.
