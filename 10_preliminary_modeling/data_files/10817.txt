I had been entrusted with the care of some small tadpoles, frogs, and other similar animals. At first they seemed cute, and I was pleased with them. Then they began to appear ugly and disgusting and I felt a little repelled. Suddenly, they started to grow smaller and smaller and to disintegrate. I frantically tried to keep them from coming apart, but it was no use. They finally became a slimy smelly mass of jelly. I was frustrated and frightened afraid I would be punished.
