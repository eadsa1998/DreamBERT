I dreamed of being in an unfamiliar and rather vague room with an elderly woman who at one time was my music teacher. She was seated at a table and was speaking to me of a piece of apparatus which seemed to be somehow connected with medicine. She asked if I wished to see it operated and to do so required some kind of air pressure. It was necessary for me to use a mouthpiece and exert as much force as possible.
