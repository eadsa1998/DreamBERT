 I'm in a conference room sitting at a table with other people. I know this is a baseball game. I have a small white ball like a golf or ping-pong ball. I throw it up and it bounces off the ceiling. I catch it. This is a home run. There is a sprinkler system in the building that I don't think is a good system. Something happens with the Armstrong High School principal. There are some army items there. People start to leave. I pick up a compound bow with arrows. I explain to two men who seem to be in charge that my brother Wally is an archer, and that this is his bow and arrows. I walk out of the room and the building. One of the men comes with me. I'm nervous that he comes with. I take a wrong turn and feel dumb. Outside the building I see my grade school classmate Eric Stoner and his mother near their vehicle. My college classmates Ryan Pug, Seth Voss, and others leave the parking lot in a van. Seth yells "Sluuu" as they drive away, and I yell back.
