["Odd quad."] I walk into a room where there are hundreds of knick knacks that used to be mine and the children's. I walk around the room looking closely at them. They are cute miniature toys and figurines. I see a pile of old black and white photos on a table and pick one up. It is a head and shoulders shot of both myself and Rochelle when we were younger, maybe in our 30's. As I look, the photo moves, my double chin flapping as I move and talk. I think to myself that I was much thinner then. There is distance between Rochelle and I. She is looking away from me so that we are both facing the same direction. I then sit down on a couch. A male quad wheels into the room. He comes over and parks on my right, at the end of the couch. We are introduced by a woman. He curves his very long arm out across the room and then back toward me to shake my hand. I am amazed at the long reach he has. I shake his hand but he doesn't remove it or stop shaking it. So We sit there holding hands in a shake hands position, rather raised in the air. We chat. The woman then helpfully leans forward, pushing our hands to gently break the clasp. I am relieved and we continue chatting. I need to go to the bathroom so I get up and walk down a hall. I ask one of my children if the room on the left is the bathroom. She says it is. I go in and try to secure the other door. It is ajar. I see through the crack and recognize a hall and many rooms off of it. I finally get the door to shut and sit on the toilet. I have a green colored BM. It is messy. I try to wipe clean, but it is sticky and I have trouble doing it.
