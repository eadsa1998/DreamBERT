We were having a party at the house in the front yard, and I was setting up the Peavey system and the keyboard. And I had brought the Peavey system around front and we had our yard decorated with the Christmas lights and everything, and Mom and Dad were kind of giving me trouble as to where I was going to put it. And I had it out there and I was trying to deal with a bunch of other things at the same time. And I was going to bring the keyboard out and I was going to play. And then there was something to do with the fact that I had the Peavey system out there and it started to rain, which that's not really surprising that this showed up because that's what happened at the Barrett's place. Thank goodness we had a tarp in the truck. And then I dreamt that I was at the fruit stand, of all places, and we were having like a class for kids and there were people on the floor that were coloring, and there were people that were dancing and playing instruments and things. And I had brought Big Bird and set him on top of one of the shelves up high where the fruits were. And I was thinking that I would show him to the kids if anybody seemed interested, but at the time they were all doing their own thing. And then some of the -- I don't know -- some of the kids said they had a monkey. Some of the kids said they had a dancing monkey or something, and that Tiro Price (?) was a company that made stuff like that still. And that was all I can remember and then I woke up.
