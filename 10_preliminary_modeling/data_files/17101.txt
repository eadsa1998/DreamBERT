My math teacher Mr. Johnson had his artwork displayed about the room.  Many pieces were taken from magazines and were connected to unfold with brads.  A hand would open to reveal singular fingers.  A poster with pictures of his parents.  Two of the works had music included; a paper record of piano music.  The most superb piece was a telling of the 3 Bears.  That one had received an award. Two of the projects had dedications.  The first said something to the effect of "Inspired by Melody."  Clearly and boldly written across the face of the second said "To Madeleine."  I was hurrying to look at all the works before they were taken down.  They were all about the room; I could not get to them all.  My best friend Emma saw the energy in my eyes and left almost wordlessly.  My friend Leon tried meagerly to persuade me to go but I confirmed that I would not yet be leaving, not until the last possible second.  It was a panic of joy and helplessness.
