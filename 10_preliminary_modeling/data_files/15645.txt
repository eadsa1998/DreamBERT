I was at some place that had a little deli/cafe place at the front. I went down one section and there was a bus sinking in water. In the main shop they had a bunch of green apples and they were in lots of 5, but only 1 was ok. I was with a guy and a girl and we used a knife to cut the apples into sections to check them. We found the right one. The guy came over to use the knife to do something. He then walked back and said something implying that a bum had been a murderer. He still had the knife so I suspected him and pointed it out. He came at me but I got a knife and stabbed him. Calvin was there and a girl who I hated and who hated me. Calvin went another way and there was a big open area with a window to the sea. I went on a balcony and looked down at the bottom floor. I could see a little bit of water lapping at the shore. The girl was annoying me so I grabbed her and slammed her against the wall and threw her to the floor. I ran before her other friends could do anything. There was a game with locked doors everywhere that were techy looking. People started coming so I grabbed a gun and hid in a cupboard. They came in and I shot and killed them all.
