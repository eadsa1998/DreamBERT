I can only remember walking down a street late at night, and coming to a department store which was built directly on the street and sidewalk, so that I had to pass through the store in order to continue on my way. The store was dark, but the doors were unlocked (they were large plate glass affairs) and I merely had to push them open in order to get through--there were three doors in a long corridor. Also there were people in the streets, but no one whom I knew.
