It was 9:00 in the evening, and my kitten was playing with a solution of some sort. Mom and I were going out that night so we just went and when we came back no lights were on, and my cat was invisible. Well, not really. She was just misty, and glow-in-the-dark. Then when we put her in her room, we found she was out again. But it was actually that she multiplied. So we gathered up all of the kittens and then put her in her room. Setting: Home. Characters: My mom, me, my cat. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I thought it was really weird 'cause normal cats don't multiply and glow in the dark.
