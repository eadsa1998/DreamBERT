I was at school and it was Year 11. My bag was full of stuff and I couldn't find my timetable. We were at our bench. Calvin was there. I left my GameBoy near a window, but found it again later. Evelyn was at the bench. We could buy these house things near different classes. Samantha was around. I was trying to find out about Classmate-M-24. I went into this room, which had a desk and 'waiting' chairs. I saw this kid who looked like him. I asked if his last name was Ellis and he said yes. Then I asked him if her father was called Classmate-M-24 and he said yes. Classmate-M-24 then came out and took him and I called out "Who's your mother?!" and he said Dorothy, which was a name that I had found earlier when looking for information.
