We went to this swamp with the school and there were bullies and crocodiles. They would run down hills and stuff. I was in a tree with some kid. I saw some crocodiles, but I was hallucinating. I needed to get over a fence. There was something about Marill. There was some guy in the tree. He saw a girl and he ate glass. But then it was Vicadin. But he was sure it was glass. Kaylee was leaving and looking for Doctor Tam (both Firefly). Later, I was in some vehicle. Dmitri was driving and I was telling him about the crocodiles and pointing them out in river. We ended up at this weird place. It was this rocky looking thing, and it had bridge type things over water. We went though this gap, and ended up in a shop. There was this girl there with her sister. The people at the rocky thing let two male lions through. People were running back and forwards. Then everyone was together. I found Firefly on DVD. People started throwing peaches at each other.
