["Not much of a vacation."] I had a mini vacation for the weekend and had been staying the one night at a hotel. It is the next morning and I want to pack and return home. I have lots of things to pack. A man and perhaps some other people are there, observing me as I pack. Apparently I am some famous person. I can't find my suitcase and remember I gave it to the bell hop or someone. I dig around under a vanity and find a bag. I am putting clothes in there from the floor. I put aside some old papers with pictures that have sentimental value related to my loved one who was famous. The man watches closely as I hold them aside carefully so they won't be harmed. I continue packing. I see a great many cut fruits that had fallen or put on the floor in a corner. Left overs, I guess. I need to clean up that mess and get the fruits into the wastebasket. Melon slices, strawberries and grapes. I start to scrape them up. Someone helps me. I then put my special papers into a pocket on the outside of the bag I'm packing in so they are protected. It is almost done. I realize I didn't really do anything special for my vacation. Just stayed over night at the hotel in anticipation of going out and having fun the next day. Now I'm not interested, I just want to go home.
