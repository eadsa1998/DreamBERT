There were goings-on at the Episcopal Church in Laurens. A cat was locked inside the church and she was afraid of people. She liked to sit on pianos and feel the vibrations. Don Ross and my art school sculpture teacher came in carrying a cat cage and a piano. But the cat had locked the doors behind itself. She wouldn't let them in. A crowd started forming outside the door, to minister to the cat, but she would NOT listen. She would hide under the piano or sit under a metal fold-up chair and look at the ceiling, which in her reality was the underside of the seat of the chair. There were 3 escaped convicts loose in the mall. They were trying to run a scam but one convict, who was suppose to be the lookout, just wanted to sit next to the radiator eating chicken legs. Back at the church, a crowd was forming around the door to see about the cat. They tried force and even the master key, but they couldn't get the door open. It turned out (that) Dora was in there comforting the cat and they were now friends. The church members began rioting because of their thwarted efforts toward good deeds. One guy and woman got in a fist fight in the corner and I tried to lure them out of the fight with snowballs, but I had no flavor juice. Just the snowball ice. Rudy said, "Merri, you need some Kool-Aid," but he had to catch a helicopter. The address he gave was the church's medieval garden. I said, "Rudy, is there enough room?" And he said, "...if there is on 34th Street. I'm just a little worried about the Math." Mr. Patterson kept saying, "If you get out of town tell the president our town sewer needs 53 turns to the right. The sewer is between the church and the bank. I said, "OK," but I had no intentions of concerning myself with the town sewer. Not after how Mr. Patterson had carried on. My mother had built a strange musical instrument the whole width of the Bobo Chapel, but the strings were so loose they laid around on the instrument. When you plunked them nothing happened.
