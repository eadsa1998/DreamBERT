There was a plane going to land by a mall.  My dad introduced me to two of his work friends.  At some point I was leading a large group into a confined area, like a bomb shelter.  I don't know who I was, if I was leading them there for protection or entrapment.  In the end, at least, I know I was trying to save them.  Like in Half-life, the automatic gun came out from the wall.  I had been, for the most part, evading it.  Then I was up against a wall, of which on the other side was a console.    The gun faced me from the right.  Aimed.  I was trembling and thought about trying to make a break for it, but I didn't.  I sat and waited.    I felt a weak pressure penetrate my chest.  I was kind of shocked; I knew they were powerful lasers, but the first shot did not kill me instantly as I'd expected.  I awaited the second shot, which did kill me.  I was not afraid of death, but the pain associated with it.
