I was the only person in the dream that I recognized. I was walking past an old brick building behind our house and for some reason I turned to look back at the building. The lower left part of the wall was gone and a room that had not existed was left bare. In a straight chair was seated a naked man, his left side facing me. A naked woman was bending over him; they were in the act of intercourse. Just the two figures were visible to me and the beauty of the pose and the symphony of body movements struck me speechless. Then suddenly the figures were gone and what appeared to be the neighborhood children filed out of the room looking furtively from side to side. I was again struck, but this time by a feeling of abhorrence at the thought of children picking up sex in a manner they know is wrong.
