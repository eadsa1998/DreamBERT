I was with a fellow who came by and wanted to see the doctor. He just lived in the chapel of the church. As we came near, he started to yell, "Hey, Son." He repeated "son" about 4 times, then the door opened in the chapel and, it being dark, we couldn't see who it was. But we hurried to the door and when we went in, a mass was being served. We went into the other room and there also was mass. We walked thru outside and there were what I think were ex-jockeys and gamblers and horse trainers. This man introduced me to these fellows. I got up and shook hands with a colored man who seemed to be a trainer or stable boy. Then I sat down again and over went the seats with us. We lay there for a while. Then I got up and went over to another seat and the man introduced me to another fellow. His first name was Steve. I said mine was John. I said I maybe would play Steve and he said no, the same jockeys are going to win next week also. Then this one I can't recall is now not winning will be on the winning streak. I came into the kitchen nude and Grandma and sister Margie were there. I didn't seem to be ashamed, but I thought Ann would give me hell when they left.
