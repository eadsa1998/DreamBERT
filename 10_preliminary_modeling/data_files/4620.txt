["Jim Carrey and me."] I am walking down a sidewalk. I am some book store clerk (and not myself.) Jim Carrey is filming a "schtick" and pulls me to him to be a part of it. I mimic his crazy faces. I am very agile and do physical comedy that works well. After the moment is over (one move is that I was pretending to wrap my legs around him and hang on to him and then my feet walk up a brick wall and defying gravity.) After the schtick is over, I walk on down the street, aware I am late for a meeting. I have to have info for. Jim is now intrigued by me and my impressive acting skills. He follows me. I go into the bookstore. I rush around to get the info. A male co worker says hurry. You're late. I hen see Jim buying boxes of books. Books on lots of different subjects. I remember seeing some on boats and sailing. He is trying to impress me. I hurry across the street to a coffee cafe where the meeting is being held. As I go in, I see Jim doing funny movements on the street. I enter the cafe chuckling at his antics. I see a number of long tables and every customer along the tables turned, staring out the window at Jim in curiosity. Then they pretend they aren't interested when they see me come in. I find my meeting group in a window corner area. I begin talking to a Mr.  , the boss who will be angry I am late. I say I've already written as book script for a movie (It's title is "Back To Win.") I work hard to convince the boss not to be angry at me and to make the book into a movie. Or I am pointing out it was a popular movie and I wrote it. I am very articulate and persuasive.
