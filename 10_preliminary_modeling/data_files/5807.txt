[1997-06-23] I was in my bedroom and with my old bed back in Quebec, and then I got up and there was a landing pad for airplanes in my hallway in the house, very strange, so I heard some people coming and low and behold! One of my ex-girlfriends came up and said that she didn't have anything to do so I brought her back into my bedroom and things had ensued and we did things and of course I woke up which is very frustrating!
