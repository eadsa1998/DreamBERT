I dreamt that I had killed somebody, but I don't remember whom I had killed, nor how nor why I had killed him or her. Anyway, the dead person appeared later, but it was in a small container in the kitchen. When my sister came into the kitchen, I put a piece of plastic or a dish towel over the container so that she would not see it. My desperate concern was that she shouldn't see it.
