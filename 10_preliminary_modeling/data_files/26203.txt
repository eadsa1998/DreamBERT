 I'm in the basement at home. People are watching a movie or television in the family room. I go into my brother Wally's old room, where there is a television and a VCR, and start putting in different movies. One of the movies is Pretty In Pink. In the movie, the scene is a large grocery store. There is a man and a woman, both in their 20's. They are both going to a party. They man gets large containers of jelly, peanut butter, and honey for the party. The man wants to have some type of interaction with another man there: maybe to meet him. I wonder if the man is gay. I'm at the deli in the store in the movie, waiting in line. When I am first in line, after waiting a bit, two people cut in front of me, one by one. I don't say anything. Then a third person, a woman, cuts in front of me. I tell her I was here first and I'm in a hurry. I ask the man behind the counter for _ pound of smoked turkey and _ pound of ham, and then change my order to be just the turkey. My classmate Yolanda Ginsburg walks by. We say our usually meek hello. The woman who cut in front of me gets mad. She threatens to talk to the manager. The deli man says something about a discount for her, clearly implying that he supports her. I'm annoyed because I know I'm right and this stupid wench-of-a-woman is wrong.
