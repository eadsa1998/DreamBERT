I was at a shop. Ezra got some Monopoly game. He wanted this other game originally, but he couldn't find it. I went to the games section and they had Super Mario. I then went to the chocolate section. I was on a high chair which you used to get to unreachable chocolates. I was lying in the clothes section watching a lady going through the clothes.
