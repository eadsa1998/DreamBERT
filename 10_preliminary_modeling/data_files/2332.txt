Charlton Heston and his son are captured. So am I. We are put in a zoo. We are in a pool swimming back and forth like the polar bears. I understand how the bears feel, bored, angry, hopeless. Then we escape and run through the forests. The bad guy that wants us dead owns a shop and we go in and look at the merchandize - black boxes, shiny enamel, huge puppet dolls, tiny miniatures. I'm interested in the minis. He's telling people he'll sell the big things at a discount, so he'll have room for more things. We realize he's after us and escape as we go up a hill. We see he has cannons bombing the village we left. People are dying because he's trying to kill us. We go to another village and steal a small child's chair and go under a table to hide. A woman is already there and is angry at us. She insists we leave. We do and now are in the tree tops swinging from one branch to another! He'll never find us, but we'll be on the run and alone forever. Charlton hands me a life saver. I say, "Do I have bad breath?" He says yes. A woman says, "He didn't think it would be so easy to tell you." Then she tells me to take a bath. "I really stink?" I ask. She says, "Yes. Terribly. I'd be inundated with waves of the smell, especially the hope, waves of hope. Disgusting."
