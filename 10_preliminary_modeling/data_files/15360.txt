Ezra, Dad and I were in Russia as part of a holiday. It went back and forth between a movie and real life. The movie was called Watch Out for the Automobile but was not the same movie. There was a guy who was an American actor but I couldn't remember where I'd seen him. Dad said it was Matt Damon and I said it wasn't. There was a nocturnal bird and a kitten? I told Dad to check in on Facebook. Then it got weird and only a certain number of people were allowed on this ship thing. A guy got two more spots for his girlfriend and some girl, but they ended up dying. Then it was a game and it started out good and then you go on a spaceship and it got weird and hard.
