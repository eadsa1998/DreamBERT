["Bathing with Ginny and Ernie."] I am in a bathtub, which is very big, maybe two bathtubs side by side. Ginny and I and another woman are in the one tub and Ernie is in the other. Ginny and I have our bras on but otherwise, we are naked. I think about taking off my bra so it won't get wet, but decide it would be too embarrassing. We splash around and talk. Then we get out. Now we are dry and dressed. I am looking for the right papers. Young people Charla's age are around. A 13 year old boy wants to dance with me. He keeps trying to distract me from my searching of the papers to get me to dance. I half heartedly do a few steps with him, but I am still concerned about finding the papers.
