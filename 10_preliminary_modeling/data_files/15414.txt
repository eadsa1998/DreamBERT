I met this guy and we started dating. He wasn't overly attractive and his name was Mac. There was a photo of him and Alexander Skarsgard in a magazine. I pointed to him and said something like 'I like that guy. But I'm going out with him so whatever' and Ezra looked at it, confused. His sister was mean and didn't want us to be together. Then it was a movie and the actor's name was Daniel Ekslay. It was a sequel and based on a real story. He dated this dark skinned girl with short hair. There was also a blind girl and her sister had to walk with them everywhere. Someone killed them. There were pictures in this book and one was hanging from the roof and the room was covered in blood and they had separated the girl's vagina into two holes. Another girl had her face beaten and there was a graphic close-up. Then Dad, Granny and I were watching a movie called 'Devil in the Dark' and I thought it was the same movie and I said I liked it and Dad said it was ok. Then I said I meant the sequel. Granny gave us an ice-cream on a stick which had chocolate bits on the side and mint and vanilla ice-cream. She kept falling asleep.
