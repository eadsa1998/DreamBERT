These people were in this 'Eden' place. If you got stung by the bees there you would live forever. The grandparents killed themselves because of it. There was a girl and her sister and an adult guy. I think I knew the guy. People were looking for rocks. It was going to rain and there was shelter next door. The girl let herself get stung and the guy picked the stinger out.
