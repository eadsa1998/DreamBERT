 I see my mom at some sort of a game or concert. We're up in the seats or bleachers. I hug her and we talk a little. I tell her I got a B in Biology. But, I haven't taken any Biology at Brimson. The last time I took Biology was in 10th grade at Armstrong. I am struggling to remember where I took this class, and what exactly it was. All I know is that I got a B in it, which is low grade for me.
