I was with some of my family at a carnival. It was raining and messy. We were talking about how every time we do something like that it rains. Saying yeah even the zoo and everything else. It always rains on us. I was there with members of my family. I remember Daddy specifically. Maybe Bob F and his family. They were not sitting with us, but sitting higher away from us. I was taking pictures but the battery on my camera went dead so the flash wasn't working. Daddy handed me another one to replace it. When I took the battery case off, the whole back came off and suddenly the camera was huge. There was someone else there helping me get the battery in, putting the battery cover back on, and then putting the back of the camera on. After I did that, it was a regular small camera again. I wanted to take a picture of these four people. They weren't family. It was two couples. I told them that they each needed to lean towards the middle so I could get them in one picture. I was still in the same place but it was as if I had two rolls of paper towels. I was asking someone about them or joking about them. I got up to leave and took one with me. I asked Bob F. He had his own roll of paper towels where he was sitting. I left one sit there and I took one with me.
