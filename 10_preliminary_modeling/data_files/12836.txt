A nuclear bomb was going to go off. I found this trapdoor and some people and I went down. The place ended up full of people. It was mostly closed off, but one side faced this field and the other walls had spaces at the top. Some people were trying to get in from outside. This helicopter was spraying water in for us. There was an envelope on this desk which had photos of kids with their fathers. There was something with James Spader and Nathan Page.
