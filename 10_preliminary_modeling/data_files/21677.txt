We were at a party. I see one man fall over. Bill Freedman got over him and he seemed to be dead. Bill held his eyes open with his fingers and he dipped his head under water. Then he would bring him up. He seemed dead. He was given up as dead. Bill's wife was yelling Uncle Craig. After he was given up as dead, all at once he came to life and he was surprisingly young. He came over and stuck his hand down on my sex organs and I was struggling to get away. I finally did. I was kicking a ball around with some men and kids. I was running after a fellow just in fun. I was watching a man pass a test. He did some very great feats to become a priest. I went to a different place to pass the test. A man asked for three copperhead snakes. He held them in front of me. I got hold of one's mouth and ripped him open. Then I got the other two and pulled off their heads and threw them into a water puddle. The man paid no attention to what I was doing. He thought it was my end, but he was surprised when he saw the beheaded snakes in the water. I did the same with rattlesnakes before the copperheads. I passed the test. The man met John Lasko (deceased) and showed John what I did to him when I met him before the test. I made a dare of gouging out his eyes or poking at them. I met Helen and June Lasko.
