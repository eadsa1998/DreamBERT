A tall young good-looking guy is teasing me. There's an older couple and a 2 year old baby boy. We're in an old-fashioned house. I buy a pair of underpants. The young man playfully puts his hand to feel the underpants. He exclaims, "Ooh, she has on 'seven's'," a name brand of a sexy pair of pants that has a funnel opening where the crotch is. I'm embarrassed and tell him to shush. He and the older man tease me. They say they are going to order some "patties," those are girls that come and help you in your old age. The older couple likes the room downstairs and they go to bed. I hear the baby crying upstairs. I think, "Oh, that's how it is in an old house." It sounds carry. I go upstairs. The young man follows me. To the left of the stairs is a bedroom. It's like an open landing with a bed on it. I lay down. He wants to make love to me. I say, "Why don't you call your pattie." He says, "No, that's for when we're old." I look up at the ceiling. There are rows and rows of beautiful, old-fashioned night tables. Some have kerosene lamps on them. Some have baskets on them. They are all different sizes. I exclaim, "How do they stay up there?!" Why would they (the older couple), have put them up there? It seems an odd sort of thing to put on their ceiling over the bed. The young man continues to pursue. I say, "Not here! The doors are open. If they decide to come up the stairs, we'd get caught!" Then he starts showing me many professional photographs of brides. There are beautiful dresses and veils. One catches my eye. It's an actress from maybe the 1930's or 1940's. She's trying on a dress and her eyes glisten with tears. The dress isn't right on her and she really likes it. It's black, lacy and sexy. The young man is getting annoyed with me. He's been very persistent and I'm not paying much attention to him. Nevertheless, there is some bond between us. We laugh and like each other.
