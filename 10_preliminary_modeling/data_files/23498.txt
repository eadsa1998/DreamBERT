In this dream, I was both an observer, like I was watching a movie, and a participant, where I was actually in the dream. It took place down in a subway underground. There was a channel with sludge flowing through it and a green hulk-like monster which lived in it. He tried to come out and get me sometimes. I was afraid of him. Also there was another unknown man chasing me. There were a lot of old women in the subway sitting on benches and hanging around. I never got on a train but there were several different rooms that I hid in throughout the station. At points I was in a room with these old women watching the dream happen on a movie screen.
