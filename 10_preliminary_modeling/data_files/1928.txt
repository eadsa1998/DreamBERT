I am a cripple and I sit down on the sidewalk in front of a store to wait for my friend. I have packages of popcorn the seam of the sack is burst and I'm spilling popcorn. The fat owner of the shop comes out and wants me to leave. We are in France and I can't remember any French. So I say, "Ich have ein Freund." But I couldn't remember enough German to say, "Who will meet me here?" So I switch to Spanish and say, "Punto aqui." A man walking by tries to help translate. Then I say, "Oh, here's my friend." I see her down the street. I gather up my packages and walk to meet her. Her name is Susan. Now I'm going to introduce her to this woman. I say, "This is Susan," and the woman says, "Oh! I know her." They had met before. [BL]
