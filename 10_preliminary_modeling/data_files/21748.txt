I was watching boys getting ready to play a night game of baseball. The light shined into the catcher's eyes and he threw the ball wild to3rd base. I walked away and was walking by trains or locomotives on a side track. There was a freight train and it had the shape of a train a stack on it the whole shape of a train. I had to walk between two trains that were parking on a side track. I saw big doughnuts that a lady was baking. A fellow was carrying a bag of papers and his hat fell off. I picked it up and I noticed another hat was on the ground. A fellow just walked by before, so I yelled to him if it was his, but he had a hat on. I seemed to have received a lot of money from someone. I was moving one of the chip trucks at White's and I knocked over a radio cabinet. It fell against a bench.
