I dreamt I saw the young man who sits next to me in my sociology class. I don't recall how, but somehow I knew he was unusually intelligent. He had received a 100 on an important exam, and yet I knew he hadn't taken a note since the beginning of the semester. Again somehow I explained it to myself so that it seemed logical.
