["Odd woman is hungry."] I live in a huge old country house with a gravel turn around driveway. I am tired. I suddenly remember that I hadn't locked the front door last night. I check. It is unlocked. I lock it. Commenting to a young Arvonne like woman who also lives in the house that I should be more careful. I am hungry and want to eat but lots of the dishes are dirty. Fry pans from cooking scrambled eggs and bacon and so on. I had been trying on clothes. Some summer dresses. A personal assistant like Sharon also lives in the house. I am a bit annoyed because there is work to do but they aren't too interested in helping me do it. So I walk toward the sink to wash dishes. As I pass near the door, I see a maroon station wagon drive into the driveway. A woman is in the car. Looks like she is turning around in our driveway. Then suddenly she walks into the house uninvited. I am surprised. She is chatting in a crazy way. She sees a bit of bacon stuck to a cloth on the counter and quickly grabs it as she is talking non stop and eats it. I realize she is homeless and hungry. I say oh well, why don't you stay for dinner. I have plates of pancakes, porkchops, and lots of other food on the table. She asks me who lives her. I point out the 2 women and say also my granddaughter, Charla. She sits and grabs up lots of food in a very hungry way and is scarfing the food down as she talks. Someone asks her how she's doing. She tells the story of owning a store and everything was fine until the male city council caught a fish and came home early and passed a law changing where the alley is, which wiped out her business. I say it will be dark soon. Shall we light candles or turn on the lights. Sharon says lets turn on the overhead lights. I say I was thinking of the light above the table, for pretty effect. Just then, a single line of maybe 30 or more girls about the age of 10 walk in and are filing around the edge of the room.
