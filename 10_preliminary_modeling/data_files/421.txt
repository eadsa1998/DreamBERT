I'm with some friends outside - maybe at a cafe patio table or something, happy, chatting - a gray day. A bum (or eccentric) comes by (panhandling?) and we exchange a word or two, he goes off. He has a contraption - something on wheels that he pushes along, it's meant to be some sort of vehicle but he's not in it but behind it, with a long "steering" handle-sort-of-thing. He's heading into water just next to us - he thinks the thing will float and he'll travel over it, but obviously it's just junk, and we watch him trundle up to the water (it's very gradual going down), and push the thing forward. Of course it goes further under the water because it's forward [of him], but under it goes. We're wondering if we should be stopping or helping him or what, but someone thinks we should just leave him alone, so we do. [Same place, I think] I'm by myself now, my friends are leaving. One of them is Peggy, who I've just learned is now operating a Metro Diner with James. This is different for them, but very enterprising, and I think I should come see it. I ask where it is, and she gives me some landmarks - it's in a part of town we don't go to much - and she seems just a hair short of welcoming. I have an impression of her and James thinking I'm a hypocrite for being interested in what they do. (It's just an impression.) She really looks good - her hair is longer and waved sort of 40's-50's, sexy, and her face is different, more sophisticated, great makeup, strong character.
