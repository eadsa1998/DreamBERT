I was going over to my boyfriend's house to borrow a book. When I got there he was in the kitchen with another friend of ours. The odd part was that they were both in their underwear. The only color in the dream was in the shorts of one of them which were mustard color. I remember they both wanted to go upstairs, but for some reason only one could go at a time, and they were debating who should go first. One of them finally left, and I woke up. All three guys who participated in the dream were of the same age (24).
