I was with B.J. at a concert in Music Hall and he fainted. I got him out, restored him and sympathized with him. I went to the station to take a train into the city. There was to be a bicycle parade and the crowd was a large one. Express trains with most beautiful cars all green and gold rolled by at short intervals and once five or six electrics passed. (I noticed a trolley wire stretched over the track.) None of these stopped at Newtonville and when a tallyho appeared with Mr. U. in charge, everyone swarmed upon it until it was black with people. I tried to climb to the top, but could not have gained it without the help good-naturedly proffered by those already there. I found a place to wedge myself and hung on for dear life.
