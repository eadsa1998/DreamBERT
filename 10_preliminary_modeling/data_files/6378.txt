There was this girl with long brown hair. She was pretty. She was dressed in these green sweatclothes. She was being a bitch because she was making fun of me and my friends and laughing at the same time. She had two friends with her. Finally I got tired of it, and I pulled out a strip of metal, a thick metal bar. I hit her with it gently but firmly three times on her sides, legs. Then I suddenly hit her on the back of the neck. It went halfway through and I pulled it out. There was no blood, just a dark line where it went in. Everybody but myself ran away from her. Then I woke up.
