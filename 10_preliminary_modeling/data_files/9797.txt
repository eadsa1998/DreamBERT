We live in the attic: Fr. James (older priest) lives with us in the basement. I am coming down from the attic: "missing plank" = big gap in stairs. I call to Frank, "I'm here, you must help me." I am carrying a baby, naked, with wet diapers, and newspaper. I am embarrassed; Fr. James says something about ambivalent problems. - I am painting a picture on the wall of the Church: with water colors, like El Greco. I get only half of face done; in the meanwhile, everyone is up at the altar: I see Wendy: acting like Mary (Theotokos) on a donkey, or pushing a baby carriage, going across the stage. Fr. James says "very nice" about my painting; - later I see Marissa and Inge Cisi speaking German. "I didn't know you speak German," I say to Marissa....
