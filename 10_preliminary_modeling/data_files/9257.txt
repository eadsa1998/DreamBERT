I was at a family event. Several people were trying to convince me to talk to BJ about what's been going on between us. I had no desire to do so. She approached me and wanted to talk. I was becoming angry because I felt I was being forced to do something that had no possibility of a good outcome, not to mention something I vehemently didn't want to do.
