I was at some weird place that was near water. Food and stuff was really hard to get, but the place that I was at had a little shop/shed thing with trolleys full of stuff and we could take them. Jayson, Ezra, Mom, Dad and Jayson' made up sister were there. Her name was Marie and she looked like Mary from Kingdom Hospital. She liked me a lot. Anyway, we went down to the shed and we got a trolley, which was ours and we had to climb to get it. When we walked out there were some people nearby and they were going to kill us, or at least damage us, but we ran away, this happened twice, and the third time there was this nice black guy who gave us our stuff and a diary of a girl who had died and disappeared. Then strange things started happening. As we were walking to this place, coming back from the shed, I was seeing everything in black and white, but everything behind me was in colour. We walked onto this platform and Marie started talking to me as her mother, and she told me that I had turned into her mother. This strange thing went away and when I was still like that I said "No, it's me Izzy" and she said "Oh, Jayson' girlfriend" and I said "Who's girlfriend? I'm not a girlfriend". She said something like "It seems like it". Jayson was in some place and he was skinny. Later on, I was on this jetty thing, and these guys were going to kill me and there was a 'magical' thing that happened and it happened now -- a bit of water rained from nowhere and I quickly ran to get away and a wave got the bad people. It also happened later, but this time I barely got away and it was a train that went past.
