There's a band meeting. It's kind of loose because only a handful of the band are present. The people present are friends Terry, Ralph, Saul, my brother and me. My friend Terry tries to persuade me to do another gig - a reunion gig. I'm not convinced - I don't want to do it. The others are also noncommittal. Ralph wants to do it though. There are a couple of band members not present. I say I'll only do it if they can convince all the others first (because I don't want to let everyone down), but I'm not interested.
