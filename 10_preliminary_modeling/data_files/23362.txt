This morning C. asked me if I would look at my watch. The request scarcely penetrated to my stupefied brain, but conscience for a moment stirred uneasily. I thought that I reached out to the chair on which my watch lies and picked up a five cent piece. I looked at the date. "Eighteen fifty five!" I said: "Oh, that is early," and consoled by the idea, I sank into a deeper sleep.
