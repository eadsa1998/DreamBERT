I was crossing a busy intersection and saw a little boy standing in the middle of the street. No one was paying any attention to him so I went over to him, asked him which way he was going, and carried him across the street in the direction he indicated. His parents were there. His mother took the boy and carried him. He was also leading a little girl by the hand. The father was impatient to get going and said something to the effect of "Come on, M--, we haven't got all day." Neither of them seemed concerned that their child had been in a dangerous situation.
