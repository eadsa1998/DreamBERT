I'm in my bed and sleeping. A big friendly dog comes in and curls up with me, his big face laying on my head. He almost purrs, he's so contented. I am half asleep, half awake. I stare at the floor and see things move or disappear and think I'm in that almost asleep dream state. The dog curls up near my belly. I am delighted it's there, but surprised I have a dog. Howard comes in to get something. I am surprised that I had to get rid of him twice. He had returned and asked to live with me here in E City for awhile and I'd let him. We slept together but no sex. He was hoping to wait me out and I'd come around, but it didn't work. Then I'm in grandma Mildred's house. I see the bedrooms are expansive and filled with people. They are like sitting rooms now. I step out on the porch and walk past the storage barn. I stop and think, "No, that's exactly what I need to look into." I back up and peek in, but decide it's not worth the trouble. Nothing of value is there. I pass the barn; same feeling. I turn and walk up the driveway and see a double door that I knew wasn't in reality there in the real house, but decide to use it as a shortcut. I go in. Someone hands me an egg. It's raw on the inside. I decide to recook it. I turn on a burner and try to pick out egg shells.
