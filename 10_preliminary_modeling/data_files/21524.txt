Bob and I went hunting. Bob said, "I bet I get one." We moved near the barn and up flew some quail. I pointed my gun at one, but didn't shoot. Bob shot and got one. We were inside the barn and he pointed his gun at something. I ran outside and looked and saw a robin come out. I pointed my gun at him, but didn't shoot. I looked at the time and it was 8 o'clock. I said, "You boys better stop shooting because it is only 8 o'clock and hunting starts at 9 a.m." I was at the foot of the mountains. I looked at them and said, "I'm not going to climb up those mountains to hunt. That's too much work." I was driving my car on different roads and through snow. I went to see John to see if he could come home at a certain time. He was piling up beer cases and said he would be working overtime because there was a lot of beer. Grandma put some steel stock on the rack. One bar was sticking out too far. I got hold of it and pulled on it because it was stuck under the rack. I pulled and loosened it. The bar was about 50 ft. long. Joe Hutter cut it shorter and put it in the rack.
