I was a subject in a sleep study, and just before being awakened was sitting at sort of a bar or lunch counter at a department store. It seemed as if it were late at night at that time, and my viewpoint from the lunch counter was looking out toward the street. It seemed that just a little while before the lights had been on out there and people could be seen. But now that the lights had been turned off, it was difficult to make out any figures, but a few people could be seen as they walked by the front of the store. Up near the door seemed to be a greeting card selection and someone, that I believe was Jewel, who is my sort of step aunt, was writing some sort of birthday or Christmas card. <br/
