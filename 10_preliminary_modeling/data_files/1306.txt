I have a ray gun and I'm told I have to use it on "the other side." I don't want to. The leader and I of "our side" go way up into the bleachers to watch the piano concerto of the red headed leader of "the other side." His eyes follow me and even though I'm a mere speck in a crowd of people. I experience intense eye contact from him. He plays beautifully. At intermission, the leader and I go down to congratulate him. We are disguised. He recognizes me and doesn't say anything. Later, I must use my ray gun on a group of 5 people who are the leaders of "the other side." It sort of melts them into a trance or kills them. One woman gets angry and is surrounded by the color purple. The rays don't work on her. I tell my friend, "Don't let her tell anyone else or we're in big trouble." I go the other man who is in a trance and tell him not to believe what JoAnne will tell him. I repeat it in the mike of his video equipment. He agrees.
