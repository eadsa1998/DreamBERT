I was walking back home (which was different) and I was in a public hall. I had a measuring tape on me. This oldish (30-40 year old) guy stopped me and asked to buy it from me. I said no and he offered a higher price and I said "I don't care if it's $17 million, it's not for sale". He got angry and tried to get it off me. I called out to Mom and she yelled back telling me to be quiet and that she was busy. I yelled out again and she was like 'I'm not listening to your stories'. I ran in and closed the door and locked it with a chain. Mom came and still didn't believe me (until a while later). We were then younger and Ezra was like 5. I stabbed the guy in the finger with a butter knife and then stabbed another finger. He left and went out the back of our house. We were all in the kitchen and we hid behind the counters. Mom said she had to see Slater and I said 'you can't leave me alone'. Our back door, which was fly wire, didn't lock so we locked the back wood door. We went out the front door and I first looked in the kitchen drawer for a knife but there was nothing sharp in there or nearby and I grabbed some fluffy thing. I said 'I don't think this will work' and then I heard the guy say 'it doesn't matter' and he was in the house. He came out to us and I threw cardboard pieces at him and tried to stab him. I don't know what happened then.
