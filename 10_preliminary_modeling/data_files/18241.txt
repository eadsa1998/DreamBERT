I was talking to my Modern French instructor and telling him I was unhappy that I was unable to pronounce French any better than I was. He said yes, it was too bad, and he started showing me what would happen if I ever went to France and the difficulties I was going to have making myself understood. As he told me this, I was sort of there. I was in this hotel and I had this personal maid who was helping me take my bags up to my room and everything. There was a fairly long sequence in the dream in which it was just getting us from the main floor of the hotel up to the floor that my room was on because it seemed as if we stopped at every floor and did something or other.
