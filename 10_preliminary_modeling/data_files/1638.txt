I am traveling in Moscow with a group. I dress up in a formal and lead the group in a guided fantasy. They are smiling and uncooperative. I tell them to imagine someone really nice being next to them. They giggle, so I say, "OK, it's obvious you aren't ready for this so we'll just stop." I am disappointed in them. I want to take the day off from all the activities. I go to rest and see a woman in a yellow French cut swimsuit. She is standing because she wants to relax and sun bathe but a man is there looking at her and it makes her feel uptight. Delta S. is near and I lay down on the floor to relax for a while.
