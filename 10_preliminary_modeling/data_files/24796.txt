Me, Irene and Anna were way up high on a boat mast and were about to parachute down. It was thousands of feet. Anna was looking over the edge and she fell all the way down into the water and died. We jumped after her but landed safely. Then we were all sad because Irene didn't have her best friend and we both liked Anna. Setting: It took place in the middle of a big body of water and on a tall boat. Characters: Anna, Irene, me. Anna and Irene go to my school. They're both 8th graders and both my friends. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad. I felt sad and very interested in the dream. But I also felt very very sad at the same time.
