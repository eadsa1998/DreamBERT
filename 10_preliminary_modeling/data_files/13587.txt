There was this road which I went down on a game -- some of it had no railings. There was a part where you had to jump across this gap. Then it was real and it was my birthday soon. I had made these party invitations to see what they looked like. A friend of mine (Asian from Juno) said she was "sorta my friend" and should be invited. I was like "I'm not having a party!". I asked some lady to get something.
