It was like a group trip to Great America.  I went with a small group of adults to get food while the boys from my 5th grade class like Daniel were off at the carnival games.  There were some people with hard hats around. I decided to go back out to the park while there was still some time, so I tried making my way through the building.  There was a lot of clutter and it was confusing, I didn't know which way to go.  I went into an added room with brown carpeting, with a patio type doorway with a step up into the next room.  Two women were talking in Japanese, and I responded to one of them.  I guess that brought attention to myself, and that I was in an area I wasn't supposed to be.  She got angry and shooed me away.
