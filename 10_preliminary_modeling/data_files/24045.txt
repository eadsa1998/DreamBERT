I was going to school and I was late. I was walking really fast cause I had to go to the office to get a re-admit pass. I was 30 minutes late. When I got to the office the secretary gave me a pass. I had lost the pink pass. It was dark. The teachers were asking for it. So they sent me back home. I was scared. The school didn't look the same. It looked evil. It looked really dark and scary. Then I saw this guy I liked. He didn't even say anything. It was like he didn't know me. I could feel he did know me, but just ignored me. It was an unpleasant dream. Then the sun came out and there was an eclipse. I looked at it and it had a face. It said that the world was coming to an end, that nothing was going to be left but sand and good people. Then a volcano started to erupt. It was killing people and animals. But it didn't kill me. No damage was done to me. I couldn't move. Then something touched me and I got in a house. I started running, but I just didn't move. I was so frustrated and scared. The walls moved. Then I saw my boyfriend. I tried to yell, but not a noise was coming out of my mouth. He didn't even pay attention to me. He was flirting with the girl I hate.
