I was going to just go ahead and type it out because it's really too complicated to be describing on this tape. But maybe not; maybe I'll do alright. I dreamt that I was having this vision that when Dad was a little boy he was afraid of the same sounds that I am, and that they affected him the same way. And I was having a vision that if a nice person were there to help him through it, it would have been a lot better for him. And the chords of C, E and G, the interval that would get me, is from G to E descending, or any chord for that matter from the top to the middle, top to the middle, top to the middle like, "Ding [higher], ding [lower], ding [higher], ding [lower]." And I guess in this dream I had a vision of somebody doing that on a keyboard and Jimmy's three years old crying, and that was weird. And then I kind of jumped over to another vision, that Mom had these candles. And they were candles, okay? Candles do not make sounds. [laugh] There were these candles and they had different sounds, but there were three of them and they were called C-E-G candles because when you would light them, they would produce the chord of C, E and G over the sound system, along with a bunch of other crazy sounds. And [laugh] this is bizarre. And Mom wanted to try them out with the sound system like at top volume. And it wasn't going to be a scary thing; it was just going to be a thing. And when she lit the candles, it was like -- you know how 1930s and 40's jazz was like, [musical sounds] -- well, it was kind of like that, it was like the funny jazz that we can't stand. And I guess that was the extent of it and then I woke up. I think the candles came in because Mom got some candles from Clark and Marilou. And they were just smelly candles; I can't imagine where I would get the thought that they would make sounds. Anyway, that's that.
