Dad, this girl, a guy and his girlfriend and I went out into space to the moon, I think, to find this 'star'. The girl didn't like me and I was worried that she was going to try to kill me. The guy and his girlfriend kept making out. The star was loud. The door of the vehicle we were in (it was just a room) didn't close properly and it was like a shed door. The girl said to close it on my side and I thought she was going to do something, so I moved to the other corner. It then showed her looking at ice on the floor and it was coming from the roof. I noticed ice in front of me and I showed Dad. I realized we were back at Earth and I said to let the girl out first (so she couldn't do anything to me). They put her down in a carton of milk. Her friends were excited and happy she was back but then ditched her and befriended this other girl. This other star went past and it was also loud. Someone said there was a "mini Australia" on the moon. We were then in a bar. People were dancing and I was trying to take a photo. This girl was doing a weird dance and she had red hair and green lipstick on and bright yellow eyes. I asked about her and they said she was weird. They had different characters there and she was one called 'Lisa Simpson'. Charlize Theron was there. The sky had these diamond shapes all in a row, so I took a photo.
