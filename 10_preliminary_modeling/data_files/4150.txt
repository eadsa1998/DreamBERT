I am a part of a class. Someone suggests some study tips and I write them down on a young woman student's notebook for her. I tell her I did that to help her. I feel interfering but it is for a good reason. Now, I am in an audience. A woman on stage asks a question. I walk quickly up the stairs to on stage to answer it. I answer it correctly. She gives me a look meaning What a jerk. Always has to be a know it all. I then walk backstage, having had the intention of leaving early and this is a good opportunity. She follows me and says you're going the wrong way. I say, no, I want to go downtown. I leave, opening the pretty glass door near the large window. (like it was a house, not a theater.) I walk downtown.
