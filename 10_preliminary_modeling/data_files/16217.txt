I was going to be singing in a chorus conducted by some guy, and well, get this -- I was laying down on the stage and I was kind of half awake and half asleep on the stage, and this guy who knew the teacher conductor was trying to fix up the sound system, and there were a couple of kids helping him. There was like a podium on each side of the stage with a speaker mounted in it, and on the back of the podium there was, where the person stands, there were the two binding post connections and they were like running wires all over the stage getting them back to the main unit. And then next thing I knew, I was still laying down on the stage while they were doing all this, they were putting "Planet Soul" on the CD player and they're playing it [laugh], and next thing I know we're all standing up and we're posing for a picture. And there's this little boy, and then when we were standing up posing up for the picture, I realized that we were in the Oceanside Elementary School cafeteria, and there's this little boy down at the floor level where the lunch tables are, and he said, "Smile for the picture. Thank the sound engineer." And then somebody flashed a camera and then I woke up.
