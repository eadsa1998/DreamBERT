I dreamt I was sitting on the couch in the living room with my online friend Kevin.  I was holding his left arm tightly.  He mentioned something about a kiss, so we went for it.  It was just a playful affectionate peck.  My mother was on the phone in the kitchen, but I caught a glare from her.  Kevin got up and closed the doors and sat back down to my left this time.  It was all very playful.  I leaned in towards him, and he mentioned tongue this time, and stuck his tongue out at me, just an inch.  I guess I licked his tongue.  It tasted like souring milk.
