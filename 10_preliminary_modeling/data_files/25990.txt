 I get my new driver's license in the mail. At first I think it doesn't really look like me. My photograph on it is off center. There is a second photograph that is a side view. I think they got the photographs mixed up and put the photograph of the woman who took my photograph on my license. After I look at the photographs I realize that it is I, and the second photograph is a side view. The license says, "Over 27" on it, instead of verifying that I'm 21, or it may be good until I'm 27.
