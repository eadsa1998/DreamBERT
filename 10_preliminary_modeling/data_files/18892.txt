In this dream I recall that there were some cars driving on an expressway. It seemed to be the north-south expressway. I remember that they were racing and that there were no other cars on the expressway except for those that were racing. I remember that a gray car won. I can't really remember seeing the other cars, but I realized that they were there. The last thing I remember, I saw the gray car pulling off the expressway into an exit.
