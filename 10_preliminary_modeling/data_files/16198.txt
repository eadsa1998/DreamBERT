I was going to some kind of a concert show thing at school and Melinda and I were in the auditorium with the sound person. And he was showing us this light-up light system where the lights light up, and they'd like turn blue and the theater floor would actually like tip back and forth and back and forth to the rhythm of whatever was going on. And then the strobe light part would turn on and it would just go all out of control, and hopefully nobody was up walking around at that time, because they'd just fall down. And then we went out of the auditorium and we each had rooms there that we were staying in -- it wasn't really a hotel, but it was a place where people could stay. And I was looking for the bathroom, and I found it and I went in, and it was like this real loud engine motor thing in there, kind of like when you go in a plane bathroom. And then I was in my room, which looked like my room here. Oh, I know why we were staying there. We were staying there because we were going to take the SAT. Dad said, "Call the office on the intercom and see if the SAT was ready to start any time soon." And so I looked around and didn't see a thingy. Then, I spotted one way at the top. So I got the stool out of my closet, and I climbed up there and buzzed the office, and there was no reply, and then I woke up.
