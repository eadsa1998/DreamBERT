We were in some building. This guy went into some woman's room and took a piece of paper. I saw him and I went to him. I had done the same thing earlier. We started up this group thing and this guy came to join. The guy I was with knew he was a scammer and told me not to let him in. There was a big group of people, including Elijah and Evelyn who wanted to join. It cost $18.95 a year. You had to give a word to join. Some of the words were "jar park" and "singing happy". I was looking at screen shots for some movie and Jerry O'Connell was in it.
