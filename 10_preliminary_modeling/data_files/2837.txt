I am in a house and I have 6 roommates, males and females. I look around and see four monkeys outside the window up on a patio shelf. I am amazed by them. I remember there are three monkeys and the fourth one is a bit ragged and we just found him. It is fun that they are out for a while. I see one monkey go into the house and then back out through a doggie door and I think I really like that feature of the house. I hadn't noticed it before. I see a blue comforter quilt on the wall and I like that too. I wonder why I had been thinking of moving when this house is so nice and suits me so. One of my women roommates is angry at Page. She won't look at a device that is a plastic child toy thing with a music treble staff sign in it. It twirls and has cute music and she won't look. I encourage her to relax and look at it. Finally she does. I say, "See, not so bad. Page is not so bad." Now I see a man, a roommate, and he wants his kit back that I've had in my purse for a long time. I feel some guilt and shame because it's broken in there and parts of it are lost in the bottom of the purse. The tube of antihistamine is lost. I look and look, finding lots of cortisone pills and complain the bottles always open up and dump pills in my purse. I do find the tube and am elated. "See," I say, "I did find it!" Now Charla is seated near another male roommate and she starts crying, "I hurt, ow, it hurts." "What hurts?" I ask. "My eyes," she says. I say, "Maybe it's time to get ready for bed. Come on, I'll get the bath going." We walk off and I am gentle and caring. I give her a nice bath and tuck her into bed.
