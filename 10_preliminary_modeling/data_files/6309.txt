My first dream started off at the carnival. I was on the ferris wheel with a girl when all of a sudden she was kidnapped by four thugs in a van. So I quickly jumped off, got in my car, and chased after them. When I finally did catch up, they pulled out machine guns and started shooting at me. I then pulled up next to them, grabbed the girl somehow and rescued her.
