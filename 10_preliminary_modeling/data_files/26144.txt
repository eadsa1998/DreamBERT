 I step out of a window onto the roof of Tea Hall at Brimson. I'm wearing only underwear or shorts. I hold a 1.75 liter bottle of rum for my neighbors. I walk across the roof to the room of my neighbor Erica Lange. I knock on the window. I want to say hi; to talk and flirt. The people inside won't let me in because I shoot squirrels and chipmunks. I wander down and go by my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, who is working at the front desk of what seems like Moat Hall. I go outside of the dorm and come back around the front of Tea Hall, which his facing south. I don't have my door key so I have to follow someone in. I follow my classmate Nellie Hammer and her father inside. We walk by a person on a couch. I see it is my brother Wally. He is sleeping with a blanket on his head. I eat pizza with a group of people. Wally and my friend Nat Miller are there. I say that I got invited to play ultimate Frisbee but they wouldn't let me play because I shoot squirrels and chipmunks. This is not the truth, and Nat challenges my statement. I know the real reason they won't let me play is that I didn't eat what I shot.
