I don't recall any clear episode, but there's a series of fragments which I think I can recall in the order in which I dreamed them. In the first fragment I was taking a group of several small boys, their ages probably running from 8 to 10, and probably being between 2 and 5 of them, on a hike. One of the boys is my brother-in-law who is about 10 years old. We were hiking through some mountains which seemed familiar to me in the dream, although I can't place the exact location now. We were hiking above what used to be a creek bed and I was explaining to the boys about how the lower stream bed and valleys had become filled in. I'm not sure what happened on this, whether rains had filled in the valleys with mud or whether some phenomena with glaciers had occurred, but anyway, up to a certain height all the stream beds and valleys were filled in, and I took the boys down this rather narrow little trail to show them this. This little trail had a concrete border along one edge and it was rather steep and I was giving them constant warnings to be careful as they walked along.
