["Healing foot."] Dr. Smythe is busy and I ask her to take a moment and look at my injured left foot. I stick it up so she can see. I see lots of loose skin like cooked chicken skin around the edges of a pink healing area and a small healing spot closing up. She says it looks pretty good and healthy now. I am concerned about the loose skin around the edges. It is on the left side of my foot, near the ankle.
