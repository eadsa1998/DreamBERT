I dreamt that I was in some Oriental country and that I was going to an Indian church. I had seemingly been to the church before and was rather scared as I had caused a disturbance and been beaten up. There were quite a few other church groups, but I chose this one. I was sure that I would get into trouble, but a friend of mine went along. He got along quite famously with the leader but I seemed to have trouble. There was quite a bit of feeling towards me. I finally left. I thought I would be in trouble, but my friend pacified the crowd. We went on our way.
