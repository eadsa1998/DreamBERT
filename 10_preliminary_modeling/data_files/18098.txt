I had a dream a few days ago and I'm recording it now. I was a slave and so was my mother and my father, and so we were all slaves in a place -- I don't know where the place was. So one day there was this slave and we were in this big lobby, and he was trying to get away, and so he ran up the steps - and they were really steep steps -- and out the door. And me and my friend, we ran after him so we can catch him, and then he got away and I couldn't get up the steps because they were too steep, so I went on the bus with all the others. And so my friend was in the front seat, so I went up there, but the bus driver, he hit me in the face because I was darker-skinned and she was white. And even though she was white, she was a slave. So we went to the back and I was next to a guy I didn't like, and then we went home and my mother and my father, they were already in the little hut we had. And we had a little dinner and we went to sleep.
