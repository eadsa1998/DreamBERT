My clothes were all bunched up under my sleeves. Clothes kept coming off and then the bag of groceries was on the floor and tomatoes were in a milk carton--a plastic see-through milk carton and half a loaf of bread and other stuff. Useless junk I didn't need or want. 3 pineapples were in the bag. These I did want. Fresh pineapples. We were in a fancy restaurant. My shorts were under my blue jeans. There was a dinner. My clothes kept floating off. There were Brussels sprouts and most people didn't like them. A girl was collecting, salvaging Brussels sprouts. At the deli, Rosy Lucille stabbed in the back. I asked for a quarter for my 2 dimes and 5 pennies but Macy's knew for used ??? I didn't know if I had already run the NY marathon. Rudy said, "don't forget about your run." I tried to call Lisa, but I reached Paula. Paula heard Lisa's voice on the recording.
