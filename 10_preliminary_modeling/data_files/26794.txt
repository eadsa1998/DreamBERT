 I'm downtown Wilmerton. My friend Tiny Combs is there. Something happens with a "baseball guy": a player or fan. There is a fight: I beat this baseball guy. I have a handgun. My old classmates Andy Jones and Carl Everson are there. We seem to be near Oak Avenue and 3rd Street in Oak Valley, in John Cantwell's back yard. I threaten Andy and Carl with the gun. I shoot the gun around Carl, not hitting him. The police come. There are no deaths, but I'm a killer. I'm near my neighbor Anna Gates' house. I see police cars coming down the road to get me. I run across Home Avenue, but run back and grab the murder weapon, which is the gun, which seems to be the kind of plastic case that a corsage is kept in. I run east on 1st Street. I get a ride from a man in a gray 4x4 vehicle, with floodlights that have "hella" or "heller" covers on them. It's as if I'm coercively hitchhiking. The man isn't happy about picking me up or letting me in the truck, but I'm assertive. This is one way for me to elude the police. We drive down the alley between Home and Next Avenue, from 1st Street towards Main Street. We're then driving north up our alley at home. I crouch down low to not be seen by anyone. I realize I'm dreaming. I'm not in the gray truck. I float up, flying. There are pine trees and hills around me distantly. I stop. I see my high school classmate Chris Yeller near the back garage door at home. Someone tells me to fly using me ears. I do, crossing my arms and legs, using what I think are my pointy, triangular ears to fly. I see my dead friend Mark Long as I scan the items in the dream. He is looking at me. I look at him and he smiles.
