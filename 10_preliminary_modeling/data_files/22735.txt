I dreamt I was walking on a place that was very smooth and lead-colored. I was talking a lot and discussing and suddenly I was in the university. I was talking with a friend whom I don't know personally (only through photographs). There were lots of people. I remember I was the main figure. It's the only thing I vaguely remember.
