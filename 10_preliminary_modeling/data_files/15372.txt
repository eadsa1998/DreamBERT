There were zombies. It was like a game and we had health and experience etc. We were running away outside. We tried to climb up on a roof which was the shape of a 'b', but there was a zombie there. I eventually ended up in this shop place. A guy ran out to help get something and instead went to lock the police out the front who were dropping people off. I put the lock back (in a book outside and it had a switch like they have for trains). I went inside and this leader guy told us to all go wait at the back of the store and I said 'no, you did that before and all the zombies went there'. Zombies came in and we were ripping their throats out. I cut the throat of an old lady zombie and then yanked out her throat. Eventually there were only a few left.
