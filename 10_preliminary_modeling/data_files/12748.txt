Mom and Darren picked me and Ezra up in Darren's car. We went to this big house. Darren went off into this dark part outside. I went to my room. The 217 lady (The Shining remake) was in my bed. I was trying to scream, but couldn't and she started getting up. I found Mom and she went to my room and nothing was there, but the sheets were messed up. I peeked in later and she was there again. I looked there again later and there was another girl in there and she had burnt legs. Mom saw her. She woke up eventually. Then I turned into her and I was naked. I ran to Mom and Ezra holding and hiding my genitalia. I was skinny, but had a little tummy and I was like 'It's nice being skinny'. This girl had been gone for 25 years. She had been anorexic but then had gotten fatter. I was then at school and I sat at the bench. I was wearing a shirt of Dad's. Ezra was putting stickers on it and I was saying "I always have dreams about the 217 lady".
