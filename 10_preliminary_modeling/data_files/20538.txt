I was sitting on a wooden box. I saw some tacks on the floor and I picked them up. Then I saw some pennies on the floor. As I was picking them up, an employee (Mr. Berger whom I knew at the hospital) said, "What are you doing, picking up pennies?" I nodded in the affirmative. I sat on the box again, but I was uncomfortable, so I tilted it against the wall of the cove.
