I was in Vacation State, or so I thought. I was told that this girl, who goes to my school, has a friend who calls herself Stalker Girl and "she hates the world." Anyway, I thought she sounded very rebellious. Then I met her. She was nothing like her friend, and she seemed extremely nice to me, different from anyone else I knew and for some reason I just had to follow her. I went outside with her. She had a friend out there, a nice guy with long hair. He told me his name but I couldn't understand what he was saying- sounded like Matthew or Mathais or something beginning with an M. She told me her name too, but I don't remember it. Then she was telling me how she hated this country and everything it consisted of. Then I told her, "Me too, I mean I hate the country, and the government, but I love the land, I mean the land itself; the actual land is beautiful." I think she agreed with me. Then we started running, really, really fast. All of a sudden I saw a sign. Since we were in Vacation State I expected it to say "Welcome to the South," but it said "Welcome to Ohio". We were running extremely fast, again, at hyper-speed. I thought I saw a "Welcome to Massachusetts" sign, and then I saw a sign that said "Welcome to Alaska" and I asked her where we were going. She said, "We're going to make a clone of you to live with us in Kansas, and you can go back home." My first thought was The Wizard of Oz. I thought we were in a vacation state, but I guess they thought it was Kansas. Then I said "But I don't want to go home. I want to stay with you; you don't need to clone me. I'd rather stay here with you guys." I did, I wanted to be a part of their fun. I wanted to go over my head in their philosophy. I wouldn't have minded living there forever, but I woke up.
