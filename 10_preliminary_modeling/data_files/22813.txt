Sharon and I left the movie "Don't Go Near the Water" and went to where I had parked the car (on Bottomore St.), it wasn't there.  I was scared to death.  I think Daddy came down to get us, and we went through the doors of a department store on the corner nearby.  In one part of the building was a parking lot.  There I found our car, terribly bashed in from the rear, and the motor in the floor of the front seat.  I went and got Sharon, but she could hardly bear to look at it.  Then Daddy more or less put the blame on me.  He decided it would cost more than it was worth to have it fixed, so he bought a new one-a Chevy, I believe.  We were looking at it on some kind of clay or sand flat when I saw a huge red, hairy elephant.  It must have been 50 feet tall, with huge long legs and a long trunk.  I remarked to Daddy, isn't that a huge elephant?  He said they were all that big.  Then the elephant started toward Daddy, who had some peanuts.  As it was about to get Daddy, he threw the peanuts to me.  The elephant came after me and soon was sucking my hand into his trunk.   (The peanuts were in the other hand.)  I would pull away and run, but the elephant could overtake my 20 steps in about one.  I saw I couldn't run away, and was afraid he would trample me, so I threw the peanuts at him and continued running.   Sometime later, Daddy and I and possibly Sharon were sitting in a garage.  Daddy said, in a nice way, "You still haven't admitted you're not a very good driver for what you let happen to the car."  I almost burst into tears.  (When we found the car wrecked, the windows were up and uncracked, and the doors were locked.  Daddy thought I forgot to lock it and the thief locked it after abandoning it.)  I tried to tell Sharon what I thought might have happened-someone hit the car where it was parked, and the police towed it to the place where we found it.
