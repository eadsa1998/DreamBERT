I'm making love with Nate. We roll off the bed onto the floor. He says, "Here, I'll make you feel good and then you can make me feel good." I hesitate because it would be nice to do it altogether, but I get caught up in feeling good. He makes love to me but doesn't enter me, just almost. 3 or 4 people come walking in. I am surprised and then annoyed. I had let one of them live in my house but now his family and friends have taken over. I say, "Hey, this is my home." I get up and ask them to go outside and then feel good that I was assertive.
