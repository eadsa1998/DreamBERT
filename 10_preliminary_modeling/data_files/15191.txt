I was at 'work'. I had a desk with a computer and post-it notes with TV shows written on them. There was a list of movies I'd watched while also doing something important. A girl looked at something and I'd written 'I &lt;3 Jeffrey Dean Morgan' and two others. I had a daughter called Kaylee and a granddaughter called Jessica. Eugene was the father. Someone kidnapped Kaylee and left notes, then they kidnapped Jessica as well. I went to Darren and Mom. I was in the car with Mom and it was raining. We pulled up on the side of the road and opened the door and a big dog came running up and managed to close the door, but the window was down and it stuck its head in. Then we were at a shop. Julia Gillard was there and I'd overheard her talking about gays and it sounded pro-gay. A girl asked her for advice and she helped her.
