I had a text with camel on cover and Arab-looking man standing beside it with brown belt of bullets and rifle and pistol ... in desert place beside rock and scraggly tree (-- palm, oak?). I looked at picture and suddenly was on the road and came to this place and talked to the man in it. I had the book with me and picture then was faded and sepia-reddish like. I asked if he were as cruel as he looked, and he laughed. "Pistol &amp; rifle used for target practice &amp; shooting at rocks. A posed picture for western (American) tourists!" and I also laughed.
