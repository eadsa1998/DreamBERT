 I'm in a car with my brother Wally and sister Heather. We come to the intersection of 2nd Street and Bauer Avenue in Oak Valley. We're on the south side of the intersection. The school lunch line running from Carter School to Jefferson School is very long. It blocks the road. We turn around and drop Heather off at home. Something happens with a green gun and a car mirror. Wally drives fast. Something happens with some sort of light. He drops me off at the Uptown Mall. Something happens with grocery carts. There are some uniquely designed old cars there. I'm inside the mall and my dad is there. He is very terse with me, giving me a $20 bill and an umbrella. I'm standing outside a video game store that is in the approximate location of Musicland. Inside the store boys are playing Pacman and skiing on a computer. People disperse, and I have my chance to play. I'm about to play, when I decide that I want my day at the mall to be productive, so I continue on. An employee from one of the mall stores walks up to another person or group near me. Someone gets man at the man approaching because he has been dripping soda in a trail behind him. I go into Smith's Sports through the entrance by Subway. I'm looking for #6 size fishing hooks with barbs. The hooks I see are flimsy: they're just prickly metal wires. I see my high school classmates Binky Ahmed and Nelson Eastman. We talk briefly. They, Nelson in particular, seem to be disapproving of what I'm doing. My mom and my sister Ramona enter the store. My mom has brought a box with a pair of shoes in it, which she has bought for me, so I can return them. Nelson leaves. I talk to a store employee. He is reluctant to accept my return of the shoes. I have ripped a shoe on top when on top of Mount Mary. I explain this to him.
