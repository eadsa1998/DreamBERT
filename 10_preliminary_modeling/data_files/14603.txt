I was in a car with Mom and Ezra. It was late at night and we stopped at the deli on Arkana road. She told us to lock the doors but she locked it with a key. I had to go to dads for a bit for some reason. She came back to the car then couldn't find her "migraine medicine" and said the guy who served her 'must've kept it in his hands' but then she found it. Some girls had asked for a donation and one of us said "I'm just here to get [something I can't read]" We went to dads and waited. He came home and got changed and was walking around in a towel. I asked why I was here (he had asked me) but he didn't clarify. It was 10.30 and I said I needed to go to bed because I had to get up early for university tomorrow. Mittens was on World of Warcraft and was a human warrior with the same professions as me. I then felt like playing. Then this girl had made this blue and green Sim for Sims 3 and I was trying to decide on colours for [something I can't read] outside and then I felt like playing Sims 3.
