I am a small child, girl. This Hitler kind of man puts a small chip like round lithium battery in my mouth and I swallow it. It has important info on it. I shit it out and he is looking for me to get his chip. War is starting and I have to leave; everyone is running around, trying to escape. I know that chip is important so I hang onto it, shit and all, and am swept by the crowd out of the house and onto a boat. As we are leaving, I want to call out to my Grandfather where I am and that I am safe and alive, but if I do, the Hitler man and a woman will hear. Then I worry if Grandfather is a part of them. I stay quiet. Now I am in some strange battle for my life. The chip transforms into some kinds of animals I can use as weapons. Three other girls use their weapons (animals) to fight me. I fight these biting animals off. It is hard. I steal their babies (stuffed little animals that are alive) and climb up a ladder to a high hidy hole. A huge male giant stands looking into my hidy hole, but I have pulled down a metal sheet that I can see through that apparently he can't see through. He stands there stupidly, not knowing what to do. The little captured animals want to get out and I must keep them with me so I can survive this fight to the death.
