I'm at Aunt Elaine's house. I am getting married to her son Terence. The problem is somehow we're alike. He has a rack of clothes just like mine, dresses, bra, etc. They are actually prettier than mine. I knock some off the rack as I walk by. I'm embarrassed and pick them up. He's at the table already. It's a party to celebrate our forthcoming marriage. I feel very unsure and keep saying, "You don't want to do this. Let's call it off." Terence assures me that he will be fine and care for me properly when we're married. I'm given a glass of milk. I see a crack in the glass. I fiddle with it and it breaks; the whole glass shatters into square pieces. The milk spills out and is soaked up into the table cloth. My "dad" seated on my left frowns. My "mom" seated across from me, next to Terence, looks surprised. I leave the table to get a replacement. I go to the kitchen with Aunt Elaine. I see her kitchen curtains. They are like mine, so I wonder if that's where I got them. I'm writing in my appointment book. Someone named KLU is written 3 times in the afternoon for lunch. She's coming from back east. Someone else wants to make an appointment at that time. I start to erase KLU. Someone says "No," and I write O.K. on another day. I feel uncomfortable marrying Terence, because somehow "we are the same" and I'm concerned that he doesn't care about me.
