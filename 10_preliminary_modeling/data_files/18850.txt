The setting of this dream was a pool hall that I couldn't recognize as one that I had ever been in before. I was shooting against some big guy whom I also didn't know. As I was shooting, my stick seemed extra heavy and the third finger of my left hand was missing. When I shot, the one ball bounded over the ball and hit a cushion and disintegrated. The big guy picked up a ball and threw it up in the air and tried to hit it with the cue stick. He hit it and it was coming straight at me. I tried to duck, but it followed me wherever I went. I woke up just before it hit me.
