I was watching some play, which I think was A Streetcar Named Desire. Marlon Brando was in it. Dad called out "Eugene!" and I was like "What the hell?". Then it was this movie and some girl said that Ava Gardner and Cary Grant were in it. Then she said that was wrong and it was Marlon Brando, Janet Leigh and some made-up guy called Chuck Morris.
