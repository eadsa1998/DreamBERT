A gangster is running berserk through the streets shooting everybody in sight, and getting a. great deal of pleasure out of it. Then suddenly the gangster merges into myself and I find myself running to avoid retaliation by the law. I am no longer berzerk but quite rational, and seemingly able to understand the full consequences of what I had done. I remember that one of the people I had shot with a sub machine gun was a fraternity brother of mine whom I disliked a good deal. I recalled that I had kept on shooting, but that he just wouldn't die. Finally he did. I had the feeling of relief. I did not want to be caught, so I tried to shoot myself, but that didn't work. Then I tried to take arsenic, and was conscious of a terrific pain in my side (presumably from the poison but I couldn't die. Then I began to think of how happy I had been in the last few days, and I didn't want to die. Somehow the police didn't know it was me who did the killing and I was going to bluff them out.
