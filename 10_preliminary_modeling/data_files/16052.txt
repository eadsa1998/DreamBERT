I was in a plane, and I was sitting down in the seat and we took off. And then there was an announcement that something went wrong and we had to land again. So we landed again and then we taxied for a while and then we took off again. And then there was an announcement that said we had to land again, so we landed again. And then, while we were taxiing, I went over to see who else was, and Ms. Hollander was on the plane. And I went over, I didn't have time to get back over to my seat before they were going to take off again, so I just sat down next to Ms. H____ in that seat, and we took off again. And then we had to land again, so we landed again. And I guess my subconscious said, "Okay, enough of that business," and then I woke up.
