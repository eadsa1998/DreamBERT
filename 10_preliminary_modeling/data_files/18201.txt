I was uptown in a sort of strange town that wasn't my university town, but something like my hometown, and I was in a dime store looking for some sort of cosmetic case. I looked at all different types of compacts that were there. They held a strange variety of things. Some of them had rouge and eye shadow, and some of them had cold cream and powder and various assortments of sort of wild things, but I didn't see anything that was exactly what I was looking for. It was sort of like afternoon and it seems that I had planned to stay up here all day. What exactly I was going to do here, I don't know. I was going to buy some strange odds and ends of things like thread and stuff. At any rate, nothing that would seem to justify my staying here most of the day and even part of the night, but it was getting close to supper time, so I thought I would go over to the lunch counter in the dime store and get something for lunch -- for supper, rather. I went over to it and all the lights in the store were off. The store had never been brightly lighted and now all the lights were off and the only light was coming in from the outside. And I went back to the counter where a couple of waitresses were and somebody else was there, and asked if they were open, and she said that they were. So I ordered some sort of a strange meal as I remember, a hamburger and about 4 or 5 different types of vegetables that came with it.
