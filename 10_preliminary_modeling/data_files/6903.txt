A man was showing me over his college which adjoined S.U.I. One building was partly his college's and partly S.U.I.'s. I remarked on how close the schools were. "I got my Ph.D. in 1925 in Psychology there." "My wife got hers last year in Psychology." "What was her name?" "Haviland." "I have heard of her." He made a remark about a child's neologism. I told him about the many languages used in Hawaii, of one child who used four in a single sentence and of the 'cut-hair shop'. He was a thickset, rather coarse-looking man.
