Ezra was staying at Mom's. First, I was at home I think (maybe not). I was on the computer looking for 'disturbing movies'. There was some Asian guy and a girl too and they were pretty fluent in English. She asked what 'film' was and I said "Same as movie". There was a site with a list of movies. There was a movie that was short and it said people pooped in other peoples butts and so I thought I'd look for it. I found Part 1 and 3 on Youtube. I watched part 1 and it was lame. I figured they must've taken the good stuff off. I was telling Dad about it and we downloaded some movies. Then, I was back at Mom's. I was going to bed and Ezra decided he wanted to watch TV loudly. I said I can't sleep with that on. I complained because I had to get up at 6am. He refused to turn it down. Mom was on the phone trying to help. Darren was trying to convince him too. Cuddles was sitting on their bed. He had to get up at 4am. In anger, I punched the wall between my room and Ezra's. I found a soft spot but it didn't break. Ezra said if Mom couldn't sleep through it, then he'd know it was too loud. I said "She sleeps through Darren's alarm every morning! It wakes me up all the time". Soon after, we settled the argument and all went to bed.
