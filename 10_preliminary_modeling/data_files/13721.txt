I was at Mom's old house. Fatima lived next door and we'd become friends. Her parents and Mom and Darren wanted a chat with us. They had recently got our reports and were disappointed. I had an A in Accounting and a score of 201/202 and the others were ok and one C. Fatima had one C and 2 D's and the rest were 0 (Accounting and something else). I said that I got a C in Biology because I didn't send off all the assignments in time. Darren asked something. We were outside, but under a sheltered bit. They went away and we tried to sneak past Mom to go back to my room but she saw and we all laughed. There was a ghost. Fatima was trying to sleep. There was a cat with xx eyes. Fatima's father was on the roof with the ghost and the ghost pushed him off. I was playing Runescape. Varrock had the best bank but to get in you had to go through this thing where you jump on these monster's heads. If you missed the head it took heaps of damage. I ended up going to Falador instead. I also got some teak planks at some point. I got an IM from Seamus on MSN. He sent me a message through some site though. He said I had changed heaps and I was emo because I had been listening to "Choirboys- Run to Paradise" and I was annoyed that there wasn't a space between Choirboys and the hyphen. I said I hadn't changed and that I'd liked that song for ages. I didn't really understand what he meant by what he said. We continued conversing and it was really funny. My music playlist on Windows Media Player kept going all stupid.
