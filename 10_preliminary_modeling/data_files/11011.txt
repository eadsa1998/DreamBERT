I was carrying suitcases up the steps at a huge gray stone building and Julia, a girlfriend from home who also goes to Mather, came running down the steps to meet me and said she was really glad to have come and she wanted to introduce me to all her friends. We walked down all sorts of corridors and up an elevator (the supposed dorm reminded me of a hospital. Everything was all white and shiny with silver gleaming doors.) We finally got to my room which was filled with laughing pajama'd girls; when we walked in they said Bill had called and would call back. I remember thinking how lucky I was to have a second chance to live the past several months.
