At Church: bulletin to be typed; I hear bad news: I am holding a black-white dove in my hands; - we all get on a bus and drive to Father Andrew's. I see Marissa Camden; she is expecting, but does not show; very flat; - in their bedroom: see old, bathing suits hanging on hooks; in their bathroom: she wears blue bathrobe, like Karina Palmer; Marissa says she is 13 days overdue (the baby that is).
