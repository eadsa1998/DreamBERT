I was getting radiation done for some reason, and I was so afraid that it wasn't going to enough, I mean, that it was going to be too much. And the radiation would come from a laser beam from the CD player, and the CD would spin around, and when the CD would be a certain point, they would complete the circuit and the radiation would happen. And next thing I knew I was going to a party at headquarters with Terri. Mrs. Dougherty was at the reception desk. In the back of the, when you get into the party it was like a store, and I was looking at all these different things -- stuffed animals and tree-top angels and things, things and then I started thinking about Brittany's reindeer and I woke up.
