I was away from home at college and my dad called me and said that he and I were going skiing for the weekend and told me to be ready by the time he comes to pick me up. I didn't want to go because I was busy and didn't have the time, but I didn't want to say no to my dad. After the conversation I find that I am walking in a crowd. I think I am at a food court in an amusement park and I see a teacher. I don't know who this person is, but I know that he is a teacher. I point at him and said that I know he is a vampire. It is daylight out so it is odd that a vampire would be out in daylight. I am suddenly in the bathroom of a house and the vampire jumps out at me. So I put him into an x-ray machine and go into the other room and turn it on so that the vampire would die. I thought the radiation would kill him. So I went back into the bathroom to see if the vampire was dead, but then he came out of the shower and grabs me. He is about to bite my neck and make me a vampire when I notice that this vampire is my boyfriend. I told him not to make me a vampire until I've graduated from college. He said OK. Then my father called me and said I shouldn't go skiing because the snow was too slushy and I wouldn't have fun. So I went to the beach and then I saw the vampire again and I signaled to him that I knew who he was and what he was up to. Then my father shows up to my room (a dormitory room) with one day left in the weekend, saying we should go skiing because it just snowed and it would be fun even if it was for just a few hours.
