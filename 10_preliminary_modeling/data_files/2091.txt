Hank is my assigned counselor by the community college. I am looking for him. I go down two flights of stairs to 206. I find his wife, who says he's still napping because they are heavy on sports on Sunday and he's resting. I'm a little annoyed because he's supposed to be there at this time. Then I look into a big room where counselors are meeting. I see Phyllis G. They leave and I see Hank. I say, "So you've come." He smiles suggestively and makes sexy jokes. I laugh, but only to appease him and slap my butt which is in a red pair of shorts with a broken seam-zipper at my asshole and say, "Lots of acreage!" We laugh.
