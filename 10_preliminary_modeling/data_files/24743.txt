First of all, I somehow turned into a bee. I don't know how, but I did. Someone else that I can't remember did too. We were at the zoo, and were flying around and landed on a bench, right in front of the gorillas. I wanted to fly around some more, but whoever was with me told me to watch out for the plastic balls that they were throwing around. The other bee flew around, once to show me, but did get hit by a ball. I flew over, and saw that it was close to being dead. It didn't really mind, though, and talked about how cool it was to have a huge stinger, and told me to get a toothpick. I didn't, so it told me the only way to get us back to normal people was to make the noises like the gorillas. I did, and it worked. We picked up frisbees at the souvenir shop going out of the zoo. When I got home this thing like in the arrival - one that spins around and creates a whirlpool - type-thing and then makes everything into nothing, was in my house, and started. For some reason I wasn't scared at all and just sat there. It didn't harm me at all, but I threw my frisbee in (I don't know why). Setting: At the zoo and my house. Characters: The other bee - I don't know as a person or a bee, unafraid. No one else, except for I saw the Arrival, not too long ago. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, excited, didn't care. Probably the strangest one ever, but it was cool that I saw from a bee's perspective. In science we watched a film on animal behavior including things on bees.
