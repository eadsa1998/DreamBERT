My dream started this way: I was with a group of friends at the university theatre, where we were going to be in a play. The play was "Othello" and I had the lead part, and a girl from my class was going to do the female lead. But this girl got sick and as they couldn't find a replacement, they dressed a boy from my class as a girl, but he was really too tall and obese. Well, in the performance, we started to act, when my "lady" appeared and I had to kiss her. The spectators were in stitches, even us, the actors, were laughing. At one point my lady fell on the floor. Then I could contain myself no longer and laughed scandalously. Then the boy got up and tried to strangle me. The audience, thinking it was part of the play, kept on laughing, but I could no longer breathe. Then I woke up.
