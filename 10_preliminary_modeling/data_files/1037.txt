A royal family. Something about a separation at a young age, many travels through different lands. Holland is represented by wooden shoe-shaped pick up beds that held tulips. I searched for the prince. I looked in a movie house. I saw him and hid behind a curtain. I thought I was the one they tried to kill. Then I crossed a border and found the two I'd been separated from since they were babies. Even though they were grown now, I held one and cooed it as if he were a baby. He was embarrassed but tolerated it.
