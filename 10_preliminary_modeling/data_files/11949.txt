I was at school and I was hanging around with Liliana and there were lots of fish and we kept looking at them. My science teacher was wandering around too. I was also at Nana's and this guy who was actually my math teacher Teacher-M-09, was trying to sell these cheap games, and Ezra and I kept running from door to door so he would go there, thinking someone was there and we also had a tunnel thing. He found out what we were doing and then tried to find us and he was evil.
