 My mom is teaching piano lessons. I'm going to teach a few of her students note reading between 6:00 and 7:30pm. There is a conflict with the time. The next day is May 15th, which is fishing opener. I'm planning on going fishing with my friends Matt Yams and Mark Long, who is dead. My dad arrives. I ask him about the opener. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is leaving tomorrow to go to the airport. She may be going to Germany. Grandpa and grandma Redding, my aunt Joanne Redding, my neighbor Alvin Broud, and others arrive. There is a big conflict with time: when I can teach piano, how much time I can spend teaching, who is going fishing on the opener and when, and what about Annie going to the airport?
