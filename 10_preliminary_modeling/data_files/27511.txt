A person who didn't seem to be me because the person was a man was combing his hair. It seemed as if a lot of dandruff was falling on his shoulders. This person combed and combed and still more dandruff fell. Another man suggested that he use a special comb devised to get rid of dandruff. The comb was hollow, and when dipped in some oil, it would retain the oil for several days, and a person's hair would never get dry if he used this comb. Dryness was the cause of dandruff. So this man, who seemed to be me and yet was not me, bought the comb and asked for a haircut. The barber said, however, that they didn't cut hair there. We ran out of the shop. I now seem to be myself and the man is someone else.
