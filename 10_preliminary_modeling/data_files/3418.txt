I am in a house. I decide I want everyone to help me clean up the mess and put their things away. I suggest we all pick up our own clothes and put them where they belong as a start. I specifically say to Jake, "Come on, you too." He groans and then they all start getting up and picking up their things and taking them to their rooms. I see a small girl holding two very heavy mirrors, with wood frames on them, maybe vanity mirrors. I say to Jake, "Why don't you give her a hand." He agrees and they go off together down the hall to a bedroom. I turn to supervise the rest and then see them returning down the hall. The little girl says that was a funny kiss and a really weird hug. I see Jake looks guilty and wants her to not talk about it and I realize with a sinking feeling that he sexually came on to her and I set that up by suggesting he help her. Somehow, I knew he'd do that, or I felt like I should have known. The damage is done. I feel bad. I go back to my room where I see Aunt Naomi has rearranged all my furniture and the bedroom is now like an alcove connected with the living room. My bed is now like a slide. I crawl up to the flat platform at the top and my water bottle goes sliding down. I am very uncomfortable as I'll slide off and down if I relax at all. I see large windows and a huge space which used to be crowded with furniture. I go into the living room part and see how some of my furniture is intermixed with the living room furniture.
