Wanda was having her carpet cleaned and had asked me to help with something if she wasn't there when the carpet cleaners arrived, which she wasn't. When the carpet cleaners arrived I knocked on the neighbor's door. I was talking to one of them and showing them my floor. The maintenance staff had someone drill many 2-inch round holes in my floor. I don't recall the purpose of the holes.
