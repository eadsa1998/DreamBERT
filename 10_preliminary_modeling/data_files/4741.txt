I am visiting Jennifer H.'s house. Lots of women friends of hers are there. Some are lesbians. I am tired and recovering from some illness. She and her friends are very busy. In a large room of her house she has a cannery and they are preserving and canning foods. She is also organizing things. Putting things in their proper places. I watch. Then I need to take a time out and recharge my batteries. Of my wheelchair. I go to another room and try and plug it in. I'm not sure if I've plugged it in right or pushed the switch the right way. Merle comes in and I ask him if I did it right. He changes where it's plugged in. I thank him.
