People were auctioning off number(s) at the Cow Palace and my numbers were 6/5/11, and one other number that I don't remember. And my friend had already won 5 times. And my/everybody's numbers were on refrigerators and it was like the lotto. Setting: Cow Palace. Characters: Katrina, friend at school. Lynne, friend at school. Me. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad. Very weird. I think that that would never happen in real life.
