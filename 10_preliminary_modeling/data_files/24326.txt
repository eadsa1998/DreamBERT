A stripper/lapdancer wrapped herself around me in a hug. She was divorcing her husband. She smelled the same as the lapdancer I had been with at a club that evening. This was happening as I was in the pr office tending to supposedly Jackson's (a friend who works at a magazine) injury -- he cut off his heel somehow and you could see the bone. I was going to treat it with antibacterial ointment and gauze before I got him to the hospital. I was made the right hand man of the agency. The other girls working there seemed to accept the decision even though I was new. It re-affirmed my view that in media situations, people look to me for advice. I was pleased that they trusted me. The head of the agency was gay, and I felt like I could bring a masculine swagger to the company's aura.
