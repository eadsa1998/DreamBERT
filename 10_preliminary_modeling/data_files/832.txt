I am in a movie theater eating popcorn. I find a coupon. I have won a prize. It's a big one. I get up to go to the candy counter. I realize that I left my purse at the seat, so I "conjure" it up. I ask the lady at the counter what my prize is. She shows me the picture on the coupon. It's a grill, lots of food. I ask her to repeat; she speaks but I can't understand the words. It's something about a scholarship to a college. I look up to see my Aunt Esther and Dora. I'm delighted to see them and I say, "Oh, How nice to see you. It's been a long time." We chat. Then I go outside. There is lots of water. I'm standing on a dock. I see 2 lines of relatives. Uncle Lionel has a white handkerchief over his face (lower half). He has an allergy. Some of my relatives get into a boat and drive away, across a wooden boundary between 2 bodies of water. Uncle Lionel is shocked. "I'd never be such a fool as to do that." Then my father gets into a small row boat and I get in. He slowly and carefully goes over the wooden boundary. The motor gets caught. My father says "Uh-oh." I say, "Don't tell me uh-oh, when we're in deep water." We then get over the thing. Then I'm in a canal. An Indian guide is behind me paddling. He is reciting the legends of our people. I feel like I'm going home.
