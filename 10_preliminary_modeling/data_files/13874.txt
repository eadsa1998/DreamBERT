We were at some place and when I left, I left with Eugene, Jeremiah and Darius. I was driving and they were all in the back. We went to McDonald's and I was thinking the passenger seat was empty because Bradley left. Eugene was behind the passenger, then Darius in the middle and Jeremiah behind me. We ordered heaps of food and a girl served us.
