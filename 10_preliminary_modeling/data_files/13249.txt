I was at home. I was at the garage door and it wouldn't close and lock. Mom was trying to close it. I found some old school photos (it was next year) and I was saving them. Ezra and Evelyn were in the school photos. Granny and Uncle Wilbur were in the family room. There were photos of them and Uncle Wilbur couldn't move properly. Granny said something happened somewhere and so I went to the laundry. Then it was just Mom and I in the house. There were two black guys and they had broken the metal pipe in the door. I was trying to keep the door closed. I was trying to call Mom and the police. Then they were people from school. Alejandro and Jeremiah were there. I ended up with a weapon and was hitting them. Alejandro had his leg through a piece of wood which had FancyFire on it. Someone was chopping something. I said "I'm surprised at you Alejandro! Why are you here?" and he was like "Huh? Why are you surprised at me?!". Jeremiah asked why too. I said "Both of you are so nice, I don't know why you're doing this!".
