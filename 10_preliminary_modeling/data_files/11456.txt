I was in a long magnificent looking convertible and driving past a row of mansions. I had on a tuxedo and looked very dapper. I stopped the car in front of the nicest looking house of all and rang the bell not quite knowing what to expect. The most gorgeous girl in the world answered the bell and threw herself in my arms. She was ravishingly beautiful. We got into the car and drove till we reached a large hotel and then we were dancing in a large ballroom. I felt as though we were dancing on clouds and all the people in the room looked at us with jealousy. Then the people disappeared and we were alone in my bedroom. We were both undressed and looked quite older. We were married and spending our first night together. I was extremely happy and the girl said she was happy too.
