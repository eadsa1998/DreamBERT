I'm running with a pack of people that all went to my high school and we're on a dirt road that is actually a section of highway in a nearby city. And we're all getting off on an exit. We're running on this dirt road when a kid I don't know says, "They're finally here." And he's holding a big duffel bag, and I think to myself, "He has all of this year's letterman jackets." A few people pounce on him and open up the bag. I get thrown a jacket, but it's not a letterman jacket. It's a Session brand wind-breaker/ snowboarding jacket. And I put it on and keep running. We end at the intersection where  there's a Wendy's and everyone stops because this black tarantula spider is jumping on people and it's jumping from person to person. It jumps on James's face and climbs from his chin to his forehead. He has a scared look on his face and shakes his head and the spider lands on the ground and he steps on it. And everyone, including me, all yell, "Ohhhh!" Then I wake up.
