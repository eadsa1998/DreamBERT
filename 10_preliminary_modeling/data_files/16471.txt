Samantha, Sandra and Derek and I were riding through town in our car and we were supposed to stop at this Catholic school that had a church attached to it, and it also had a store, and they were all red brick, and we had to do something there, but I don't remember what. So Mom and Dad went their way and Samantha, Sandra and I -- no, I think Mom and Samantha and Derek and I went through the school part and we were like going around peeking in these different windows, and when we would come to an exit door, it would have a little tiny sound coming from the exit like box. And some would be just a straight tone and some would be a crazy like up and down, but it was very soft, but each time I knew I could hear it. And I think we were going through the living areas and stuff, just peeking in windows. And for some reason when we came to like a, when we were just walking in a hallway, Derek handed me something, and he's like, "Here, I bought you this." And it was like an expensive mike to go with my mini disc recorder. [laugh] And I said, "I want to pay you for it; I don't want you to just do this by yourself." And then we were in the car coming home and I was like trying to record what they say. They're talking about going to school and stuff. And then I woke up.
