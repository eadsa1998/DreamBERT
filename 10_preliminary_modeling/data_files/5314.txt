I dreamed that I was 18 and I went to a college that was similar to my high school. We had an all school meeting on day to address the issue of diversity. I had been asleep that night when some boy came into my room and wrote his name, address, and phone number on my ceiling. Apparently he was initiating some important moment, but I didn't understand. We then talked about terrorist bombings in Rome and Angels and Demons. I also dreamed that there was a TV show about killing wild cats. And I was on it, except I had no weapons! Lastly, I dreamed that Ed was rifling through all my stuff, but I don't know why.
