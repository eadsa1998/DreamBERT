I was with a middle-aged man and a slim younger man. Mother and I put my sister in a box. It was attached to the bottom of a plane. The younger man was the pilot. He took off. But when he was about 30 feet above the ground, the box fell because one side had not been attached. My sister was not injured. The middle-aged man said he would send the plane up again, but I would have to pilot it, because the younger man was gone. I was apprehensive because I did not understand some of the dials. Later I was by a body of water and some small buildings. I was shining some objects. Some of them had to be done over.
