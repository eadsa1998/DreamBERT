I dreamt that my dad and I had gone to visit my grandparents to a little apartment which they had rented in the country. We took some toilet paper for my grandparents because they had not taken enough with them. There were three apartments which were side by side and were completely surrounded by a garden. In the back of the garden that belonged to my grandparents' apartment there was something (I don't remember what) hanging from I don't know where. A classmate from the university was in the next apartment with his parents, and in the other one there was a gentleman, who I suppose was with his wife, since there was a double bed (she never appeared in the dream). The garden where "that" was became filled with boys and girls (youths) and everyone was looking at it. Some were coming and some were leaving. After a while, the only ones still in the garden were a small group of people which included my university classmate (he, in reality, has the same last name that I have). I was the only girl there; all the others were boys. One of them brought down the "thing" and I believe (I don 't remember well) that he started to move from one side to another and then to destroy it. I remembered just now! At the beginning the thing that everyone came to admire was a strange flower, but the thing that the boy brought down was no longer the flower. At the end it destroyed itself and each person went his way in the most normal manner. Between apartments there were curtains instead of walls, so that I  could see my classmate sitting down at the table, taking a plate and serving some salad for himself. My grandparents and my dad asked me what had happened (they had seen everything from the apartment), but I don't remember what I answered them, and I woke up. The surroundings in which this dream took place were completely unfamiliar to me. It was a pleasant dream.
