I dreamt that I was married to the brother of a friend of mine but of whom I'm not necessarily fond. He is 20 years of age. It seems that he was very disagreeable and I felt discouraged that I had married him. One morning he was very nasty so I went out to some hill and took a pair of gloves from a dead man lying on the side of the hill. They were white gloves with small red rods printed on them that looked like disease germs. These gloves were capable of giving a fatal disease to anyone I touched with them but they dldn't harm me. I returned home and maliciously infected my husband while pretending to be klnd to him.
