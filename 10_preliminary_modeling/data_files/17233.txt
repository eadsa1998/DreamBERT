My mother was partaking in a Frisbee contest.  Lots of people standing around a mountain, and you have to throw the Frisbee into the fenced off area, stepping back every time.  A lot of people were involved.  For some reason I went to a child's recreational facility area, sort of below the pool.  I was having trouble getting into an area I needed to be in.  At some point I ran into Sylvia Roan, my old core teacher, and she gave me some stuff to help out.  She told me the history homework I hadn't done isn't necessary (From a previous set of dreams).  I don't really recall what was going on after that, but I guess I saw a bus rolling.  They'd forgotten to put on the parking brake.  I went in to try and set it.  My mother came back with me.  I ended up driving it a little ways and turned it around before parking it.  I teased my mother that if I did well with this I'd get my license without more practice, right?  She said yes, and I did fine.
