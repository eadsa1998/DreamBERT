I look out a window. My father is gathering up a group of young people. They gather up in a circle and start singing "Swing Low Sweet Chariot." I feel teary because it's my favorite song and I sing along even though I know it will hurt my throat and cause it to close up. I look at photographs of my Adam cousins. Millie comes into the house. She's all dolled up for a date and is waiting for him to arrive. It's near midnight. I am quite surprised because she's married. I sit next to her and put my hand on her arm. "Aren't you married?" I ask hesitantly. She looks upset and says, "Jim died." I say, "I'm sorry. I didn't know." I remember back. She's had five husbands, each one for just a few years; some died, some divorced. I go to the Dairy Queen. There is a turquoise Cadillac, 1955, there. I drive it around. There are two matching turquoise pistols on the hood. I have to take the car back. I try to turn left on a road full of bumper-to-bumper traffic. Finally I get to the D.Q. Others push the car as the engine isn't on. I pull in. The owner seems relieved as he didn't know what happened to the car. People are bringing books to a used book sale. A woman hands in a pile of books that are the best of the bunch. I see Science Fiction titles.
