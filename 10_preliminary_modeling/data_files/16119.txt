I had a dream last night that we were reliving a movie about World War II and that we were doing it at like this park like Adventure Island and stuff. And first Mom and Samantha and Sandra would go off these steps and I was yelling after them, "No, don't go that way!" And so then they came down and we were swimming in this pool, and the side of it had these slime plastic spike things that, if you would put your hand on them, you would sink into them and be engulfed in them, your hand would be, and you'd never know what would happen in the pool. And so finally we were out of there somehow and there were all these people and everything. And this people-mover thing, we found out that Derek was now an officer and we were on this people-mover thing and it went to this hotel room. And I was standing like up on a thing looking down at Terri who was in the water, and I had a feeling they were filming a movie or something.
