Note: Many times before I go to sleep, if I wish to dream, I think about something I want to dream about and I dream. Other times, when I have problems or when things happen to me which impress me one way or the other, it's almost certain that on that night when I fall asleep, I will dream about something that pleased me or disgusted me. Last night this happened to me. I thought about something I wanted to dream about and I dreamed: I was searching for someone among all the people I saw -- a woman who would help me in my life. I saw many women, all different, and I found one, and when I came close to her, she was another one. I started to look again - not searching, but just looking at all of them - and I kept finding the one before, but when I went over, she was another one. My whole dream consisted of that. I never stayed with any one of them, because as soon as I paid attention to one, it was another one. I don't know when I stopped dreaming.
