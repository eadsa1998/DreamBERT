I wore dentures and I couldn't keep them in my mouth. I was in this big, empty room and I kept trying to put my dentures in. One tooth kept falling out of the socket and another was a baby tooth that was brown and rotten. I took the dentures out and looked in the mirror. I didn't have any teeth at all.
