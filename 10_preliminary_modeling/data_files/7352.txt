I was putting one jigsaw puzzle into the box. The maid sitting at the cardtable by the other admired the Xmasy box. I told her I had used it for a gift but the donee had not cared for the box so I had it again. Then someone brought a visitor to my room and I recognized Mrs. Kibby, welcomed her and seated her in the rocker, apologized for my messy room, was just going to tidy it up, looked at the clock, saw it was 2:45. I asked after her husband and what year they were in Japan. "1928" "I thought you were there longer." Then I started to get out my stamp album.
