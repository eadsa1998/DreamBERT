I was with some others, including Ezra and a friend of his. It was night. I saw something weird happen, like a government cover-up. We were in a room with a laptop and the webcam was somewhere else and saw something else. People turned up and we shut the laptop off and quickly left. We hid under a ledge when someone was nearby. Some other people were going to hide out in some Native place, but we refused to go. There was a girl called Erin Poor who was about 6 years old and she had killed a girl with a syringe or something. She was there. I was then at the shop with Mom. I said to look for a "little Chinese man". Daryl and a guy were outside too.
