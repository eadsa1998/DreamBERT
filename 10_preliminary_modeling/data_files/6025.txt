I'm on a television talk show along with a big, black man who appears to be the host. He jokes around with me since he is bigger than I am. To show that I am to be taken seriously, I grab him by the arm and drag him along the stage. He is quite surprised. "Okay, that was something.", he says and we sit down on chairs for the chatting part of the show.
