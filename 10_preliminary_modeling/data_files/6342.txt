The dream that I had was that I won the megabucks. I had won 30 million dollars. At the beginning it was great but I ended up being miserable. People that I was close to started to say that I was snobbish and was always bragging about myself. I always thought prior to this dream that having an overabundance of money would be the best thing in the world. I found out in my dream that it was nothing but problems. It seems that every time I have strange dreams, I would have a conversation with somebody about certain topics such as money and the topic develops into a dream that night. I discovered in my dream that I had so much money that by being [illegible] I was trying to get rid of it but that was just as hard.
