Our family adopted a baby (nine months old, big blue eyes, blond hair, really cute). He's been in my dreams before. He told me I shouldn't come with him or I'd get into an accident. My Mom was in a department store and there was a strange tennis court across the street. So I went. The street was hard to cross because the cars went really fast. My friends were playing tennis across the street, so I went. Me and Polly wanted to leave, but we couldn't find the way out. Finally, after riding our bikes around a gigantic house/forest, I opened a closet which led to a door. I opened the door and the forest was there, so we went out. While I was crossing the street, a car came straight at me, so I jumped off. Cars kept going by until one finally stopped to help. I had to go because I was called for a camping trip. Tina was in the front seat, this guy Jack I had a crush on was right behind her, and I was right by him. We went up a steep hill and finally got there. I wondered if Jack was really Jack because he cut his hair and looked really ugly.
