I am at a large church (Unitarian?). I am holding a small girl (8 or 9?). We are standing and hugging. It feels sweet and tender as we rock back and forth. The church service is over. As I am walking out, with the crowd, I see a man named "Bill" smiling at me from a pew across the room. He seems to like me. I smile back, a little uncertain. He tells me, as I'm passing him, that he'd been in the economics lab (or electronics lab) across from my classroom and had been admiring me from afar. He seems like a nice guy, bearded. I go on, because I'm walking and can't do that for long. Now we are outside and Mabel passes me. I say to her, I'm B, thinking she wouldn't recognize me standing up. She turns and smiles. Her son Matt comes up behind me. He picks me up and carries me for awhile. He seems very slim and I am concerned he'll tire or hurt himself. I lean back carefully (leaning over backwards?) to try and be comfortable without causing him discomfort. He puts me down and says his shoulders are starting to hurt. I rub his back with my hand in a patting gesture and say, "We don't want you to get hurt. That wouldn't do." We walk on. I look up and see we are walking up a very steep hill covered with ice. I feel concern that I'll slip and fall. Somehow I manage. I see a mountain and realize we've walked over the Cascades and are in Central (state). I say, "I like the air better over here. It's clearer." Then I ask Matt, as I'm getting tired, "Is this the way to my parents?" He says no. I say, "Then why am I doing this?" (using energy), and he says, "It's the way to God." We continue walking up the icy path.
