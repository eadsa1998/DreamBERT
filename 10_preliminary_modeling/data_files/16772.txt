I remember having to rehearse for some play. Then, all of a sudden it's time for production, and I see that Mr. Dell and some girl I don't know are the stars (in this Shakespeare play I've never heard of). This was really very funny, although it didn't sound much like Shakespeare. Mr. Dell knew all his lines perfectly. He was very confident, like Laurence Olivier. He was good and he knew he was good. You could tell he was acting because nobody in real life puts so much enthusiasm into anything. Then came a scene where he was talking about Europe, and Hawaii, and travelling, and everything in a normal Dell voice and in a way that epitomized how a Mr. Dell should act, as if the part was created for him. I was laughing at this characterization of Mr. Dell, and my whole family was also laughing (although they really don't know him well enough to think something like that was funny). Next, I remember riding a small vehicle, maybe a golf cart, but more like a mix between a bicycle and an automobile. I think I'm in a school parking lot, and I have the gas down all the way (driving fast is so fun in dreams) and there are cars I almost hit, but manage to get around every time. I can't say how fun that was! Then I stop, in the doorway of the school, and at this point the vehicle looks just like a bicycle (that's why I was confused). Mrs. Saint is there.
