I remember being out on a date with another couple. I can't remember who my escort was or who the other girl was with. I know her rather casually, having once doubled with her several months back. She is about 20. We were sitting around a table at some restaurant or other. She asked me what type of man I wanted to marry. I proceeded to tell her and she asked me first of all what height I preferred in a man. I answered 5' 10 ". Then she asked about preferred hair coloring. I really had no preference but after she suggested dark hair I agreed that I too preferred men with dark hair. She intimated that she was tired of most of the men she knew, especially the tall, dark and handsome variety.
