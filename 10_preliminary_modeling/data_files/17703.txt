My boyfriend Jeremy and I were an in an interesting gym with an odd sort of game of tennis going on.  Some of the players were sitting.  There were goals on either side of the court on one side, but not the other.  They were using a ping-pong ball.  It wasn't limited to four players.  There were people sitting in the audience with a green outfit on that were also playing.  Because of where I was sitting near the back line, I was expected to play as well, although I didn't know that at first, until someone got after me for missing it when it came towards me.  There were two courts side by side, but in different rooms.  You could go upstairs and watch from above, too.  I think it was supposed to be my boyfriend Jeremy's old school.  We thought the sides should be even so if one has goals on the sides, the other should too; Jeremy went downstairs and started pulling one out.  A little later on we went down the stairs to leave, and met up with my godmother's family the Swensons.  We were with some other people as well.  I think my parents were there.  We passed through two halves of a fake mountain, and the older son Milt wanted to push them together.  His father told him that the people inside would suffocate.  There was more to do with Milt, but I can't remember it.
