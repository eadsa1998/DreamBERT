I dreamt I was a pilot on an aircraft carrier and was assigned to fly a new experimental jet plane. I took off and flew the plane, but when I started to land the plane my speed was too great, and I overshot the deck. The plane crashed into the sea. As the plane was about to crash, I was transposed to the deck of the carrier. The body was compressed into a jet tube. However I didn't recognize the body as my own. I was then told that as a result of my death as the pilot for some reason or other I was told that I'd have to become senior medical officer on the ship.
