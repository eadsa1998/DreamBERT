 A man gives me a handgun. I have to learn when to use it and when not to. We drive in his car to an abandoned building. My job is to get away from the building. He puts the gun in the pocket of my wind pants. I go down an alley with many strangers in it. I am wary of them, but none of them harm me. I go up stairs and down hallways. I am trying to get away from that area. I go out onto a roof. Storm troopers are there. I find a ladder down and start climbing down quickly. I realize for every word I speak I have to pay 25 cents. I have already spoken a lot and I think I'm running out of money in my checking account. I am near the house on the northwest corner of the intersection of Next Avenue and 1st Street in Oak Valley. Others are with me. We walk down the sidewalk on the block of 1st Street on the north side. I find many pennies.
