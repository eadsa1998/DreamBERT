My friend Wanda is looking at two tapestries in my house. I had had them my entire life. One has my mom, dad and brother on top and I am on the bottom next to a cup of coffee. I tell Wanda, "Isn't it funny that I am next to the coffee and I am proud of it." She then stares at the other tapestry which has a picture of a girl on it from a sticker I had when I was younger. It says, "Protestant," and other strange words on the bottom. She tells me that I have strange tapestries.
