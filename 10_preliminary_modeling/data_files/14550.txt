I can't remember properly but there was a machine in the walls of this place. Someone had to unplug this thing and plug in something else. There was a robot thing and he had to avoid people who worked there. He was at the last one and he (it was me now) got Cuddles to distract the robot and he threw this thing to make her go to it. It was in a hall. Then I was at this place and this lady had a house which was up high. I was on it and there was a section with an edge. There was a fridge and the house moved, and as I was trying to get around the fridge was moving too and I said "ah! This is too hard!". Dad came back to get me -- he had taken Ezra earlier. We went to a place with a rollercoaster and I thought it was a ghost train at first. The max weight was 50kg, and said 39-50. A lady explained why.
