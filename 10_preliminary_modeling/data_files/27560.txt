There was a rather large gathering of girls and boys, all college students in a living room. I didn't recognize the room at all and I didn't know all of the students. (I seemed to know the girls but very few boys.) We were all dressed in sports clothes or slacks, jeans &amp; shirts. There was a phonograph playing. The boys then announced they were going to pick a queen. It was like a "hot of the blue." No one was prepared for it - it was a complete surprise. Nevertheless each of the girls had to take a turn encircling the room. After this announcement some other girls arrived on the scene nicely dressed in their good clothes. All this time I was sitting on the couch watching the others and I woke up before it was my turn to get up. I know I felt very mad when the alarm clock went off and woke me up. I had a feeling that I wanted to go back and find out what would have happened.
