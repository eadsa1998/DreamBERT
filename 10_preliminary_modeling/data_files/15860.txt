I was at the Technical College (different) and in a class that was quite full. I was sitting with Tristan and Fletcher. The lecturer was trying to find a movie that none of us had seen to assign it to a project for us. We had a 10 minute break and I got up to look at the list of movies and wrote down all the ones I hadn't seen. When everyone got back from break, they'd moved seats slightly and it was all out of whack which annoyed me. Next door was a barn with horses and cows and they were making noises and we looked out and saw they were feeding. Later, there was some bad guy and some obstacles. The bad guy took off down this zipline but we'd been warned some of them were 'fake' and would disappear part way, I sent one off to see what would happen and it disappeared. A girl carefully used her fingers to slide across and another girl decided to copy her but she fell in halfway and died (there was like acid or something). Nearby was more acid and some pipes that you had to balance across. Tristan got on without shoes and I commented on it as he was making his way down and he said something like he'd be ok and then he toppled over and fell in.
