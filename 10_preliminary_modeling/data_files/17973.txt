I was at a restaurant with my family.  After looking at the menu, I asked my mother to order something for me and I went to the bathroom.  I think I was in the shower, yet also talking to my best friend Emma on the phone.  My mother came in and I reminded her of what I wanted to eat.  There had been some confusion over which menu, the full one or the lunch menu, and the item I wanted to couldn't be found.  I told her one thing on the menu, or if they could do it, another one without the tuna.  Then it was time to go and we walked outside.  My brother Stuart was still holding and munching on some fish sticks he had gotten.  They saved me some sort of breaded appetizer, but no meal.  I felt incredibly sad and unloved.  When we got home I sat down and I was sort of waiting for someone to ask what was wrong, to even notice that something was wrong.  No one had by the time I woke up, and I felt very lonely.
