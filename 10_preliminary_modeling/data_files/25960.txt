 I'm in a mall. My friend from Brimson Hank Anderson and my friends from high school Sam Kingsley and Janelle West are there. They may have eaten hallucinogenic mushrooms. My sister Heather walks by on her way to work. Some men are halfway walking/lumbering around the mall acting dumb and drawing attention to themselves.
