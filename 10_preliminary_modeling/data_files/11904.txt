I was out the back of Mom's and I went inside and saw Loren Dean (as Hicks from Enemy of the State) and the other bad guys from Enemy of the State going up the stairs. I followed Loren up and I don't know what happened but I was thinking he looked hot. Later, we were still at Mom's, but now Loren and I were getting shot at. I found a rune chainbody on the stairs. He tried to kill the police but messed up. We ran out the back and climbed some fences, but I got caught.
