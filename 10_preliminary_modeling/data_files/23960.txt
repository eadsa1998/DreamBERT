The baby sat up for the first time. How cute. Her chin drooped with lots of baby fat underneath. I hailed a cab. He had a motorcycle too and asked if I wanted to ride it and briefly explained how. No Way! The road that we were on was like a rollercoaster, tight along the coast with sharp cliffs. I kept thinking how if I took the motorcycle I would lose control and fly right off the cliffs and my child would be orphaned. I made it to Mom and Dad's house which was actually on a farm-like plot of land. I saw the overview of the area as if I was in a helicopter. There was our house with a rectangular plot of land behind it. In the backyard we were having lunch. I thought how I would love to have the time to cultivate the property and make it grow with vegetables and flowers. The neighbor had a tomato plant right on the border with 10-15 huge ripe red tomatoes. <br/
