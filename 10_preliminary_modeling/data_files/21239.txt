We had a wild tiger locked in our house. He ran around within roaring and trying to get out. I was going to St. Andrew's church with Ann. We met our old priest. I met a couple and the man introduced me to her and motioned to me she was a fruit. Then they told me they were booking and getting 14 cents on a dollar. I gave Carter and a couple of friends a look at a card I had from the couple. We were sitting in a pose to take pictures. I had a hat on, then I took it off and brushed my hair and did I have a nice head of hair.
