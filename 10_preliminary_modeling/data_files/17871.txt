I was in a very dark place.  I walked forward and found an old board game from a classroom.  It had a large cardboard building, some of which was falling apart.    I left and went to sit down.  My longtime classmate Ralph was sitting next to me, and we talked, surprisingly close like comfortable old friends.  It felt good.  I looked behind us and saw my best friend Emma was walking along a ridge.  I got up for something and talked to someone about Ralph.  They said they were going to befriend him, but then my old classmate Rico beat him to the punch, and they gave up.   I wanted to tell them it wasn't the Rico they thought it was, but decided to let it go, it didn't matter.  I walked over to the door to the garage and opened it.  My dad was there working on something, and I talked to him.  There was a spider on the step and I tried to kill it.
