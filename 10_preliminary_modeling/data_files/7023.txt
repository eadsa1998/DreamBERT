Reading a hymnbook from the back, half way through. Hear a man in priestly garb praying with a lady. He says something about her being ready for the Eucharist. I try ineffectively to see who the woman is. ... I am looking through a window of the side porch. Mrs. Sinclair comes near. I tell her I wasn't speaking to her. Just looking out the window.
