SCOTT THORPE and a friend go to live at a farm in Wisconsin; I arrange to travel with Reynaldo and Amy to visit him at the farm; on the way I see the GOLD dome of the Church vividly and tell someone that I am Greek Orthodox.-- shift: we are driving to visit "grandma" who lives at the end of the Lake but first we store our bikes and spare tires underneath the car; when we arrive we recognize the vista from a postcard she had sent us; as soon as we arrive, she asks us for a pair of SCISSORS that are decorated with flowers; I go back to the car and find only small manicure scissors, and remember that I gave away the decorated ones....vague ending.
