First I had a dream that for some reason Mom was, I was trying to show Mom the difference between non-compressed audio and MP3, and she had a CD with MP3's on it, and somehow some way it played in my CD player. And it sounded like a tape, it sounded like a cassette tape, and I was trying to tell her that, and I couldn't seem to figure out how to explain to her the density of each stream of audio difference of the quality.
