This dream took place on our farm. It concerned my brother, sister, father, and me. We had done something to antagonize my father and consequently, we were running away from him. It seemed to be in the fall because we were running through hayfields &amp; cornfields. The corn was taller than we so we thought it would hide us from our father. The three of us got separated &amp; I hid in a building, which was on a neighboring farm. My father followed me rather than my brother or sister. He saw me run into this building and I knew it; so I knew that sooner or later he would come in &amp; get me. For a while, he was running around the building pretending to look for me. This attracted the neighbors attention and soon there were three or four people standing around. My only consolation was that I thought my father wouldn't punish me very severely in front of the neighbors.
