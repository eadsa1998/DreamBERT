My birthday was fast approaching. I was at the fire station and they were making me this birthday cake. They like putting roses and stuff and sprinkles and I would go over and snitch some. And they were gearing up for a birthday party for me, but then I remembered that my birthday wasn't until March, and then what in the world were they doing, getting ready for a birthday for me? And as I was getting my stuff ready to go out the door, the parrot started singing, "Happy birthday," to me. [laugh] That was kind of weird. Then I dreamt that I was taking a music class in college, and that this kind of Spanish lady was teaching it. And we were going over some theory and stuff, and she was surprised at how much I knew. And she was saying how she's going to have to catch me up a little on what I missed. Then I dreamt that there was this battery charger thing that was supposed to absorb the acid if they corroded. It was like a traveling duffel bag, and it was for the keyboard. It was like put the batteries in all in series, and Mom said that it reminded her of cow poop, the way you put them in. And then they would gather (?) they would provide 9 volts and then you would plug it into the adapter. And [laugh] I don't know, somehow we had the notion that that would make it work. And I woke up before we could test it out.
