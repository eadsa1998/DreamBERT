While standing in doorway of my garage I note a squirrel has invaded the garden. Reach for my German slingshot and grab a pebble. The pebble seems more a stone, but I think it will probably just pass thru the uprights of the metal slingshot. I look for squirrel and it is now sitting in a bush. As I aim, one of the metal uprights slowly bends towards me. Astonished, I straighten it up with my right hand and again take aim. As I pull back the elastic, again the same metal bar slowly bends down. I look for the squirrel and he is gone.
