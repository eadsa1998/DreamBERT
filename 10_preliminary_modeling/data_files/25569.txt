 I'm fishing for carp with my friend Matt Yams and another woman. I catch a fish and I can't identify it. I let it go. It bites me in the leg somewhere and clings to me. I am wearing a life jacket. I'm in the water. I sink a little bit, and shake the fish off my leg. There is a residence or a workplace there. Someone is raising leeches in a wooden box. There is a chicken pox fish in with the leeches. It was a chicken pox fish that bit me. The area we were fishing is full of streams. There is an island between a braided stream area. We're in shallow muddy water. I may be using a jiggle stick with a parachute-like bobber that doesn't allow me to reel in because I'm fishing too deep.
