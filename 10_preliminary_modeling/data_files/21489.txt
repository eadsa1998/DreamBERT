I was flying around with speed, sort of gliding thru the air. I watched a new game being played. Bill Grove was playing the new game. I heard a fellow say, "He Comes" when I asked for a name of a horse that will win. I heard "taste." I was floating on the water on a boat, but all it was, was a piece of wood about 3 inches wide and about 2 _ feet long. I sat on it and floated around and still I was not in the water. I was shoveling coal on a pile. George from Whittington was at our house. Then he relaxed on a cot. I wanted to get an answer if Told You So would win his race. I was talking to a smart fellow who thought he knew his horses. So I asked him if he was so smart to give me a horse that will win today, and he said He Comes or it could be He Could. I'm almost positive it was He Comes. This I figured was the answer to told you so. Champ Sorter came to me as a winner.
