My mother and Aunt Linda were supposed to meet William at a restaurant for breakfast before church. The restaurant was on 41st St., in the 5 points part of Columbia. I wasn't sure if William was gonna be there because when I called the hotel, the clerk had no idea if he was there or not. I figured if he wasn't there, they'd end up taking me to church so I said, "I'll run and meet you there." I was wearing my camouflage army pants and Uncle Bob quoted a bible verse and my father yelled out, "FIRST THESSALONIANS!" I said, "Dad, I didn't know you knew any Bible verses." He just laughed and said, "Would you get me some army surplus pants at Macy's?" I looked around but I did not see any army surplus pants--there was one (pair of) Levi's rip-off, non-authentic army pants. While I was waiting 2 little kittens came and played. One was black and very little and young. The other was months older. The little kitten was making worms out of (blue) play-doh and eating them. Dora said he was trying to communicate that he needed to have some worm medicine. I could even see her watching the little kitten and could tell she was very concerned. She loved the kitty. The older kitten was a bit more reserved. I'd been wearing army pants for the archaeological dig--hieroglyphics on slabs of stone from Egyptian pyramids and tombs. The 5 inch slab of rock had hieroglyphics all over it and the scientist was scraping out dirt with a screwdriver. He'd scraping hard and fractured the Egyptian stone and said, "Well, we might as well go ahead and smash it. It's broken anyway." And he lifted it up and threw it down on the floor.
