I was in a shop. I don't know what happened at the start, but Dexter (Dexter) was there. We were friends and I knew he was a killer. Calvin and I found stuff that belonged to people at school, including stuff of Eugene's and Darius's. We were going through it. I was with Dexter and he killed this girl because she knew something. His hands were covered in blood. Darius liked this girl. I spent a while convincing her to go out with him and finally she did. They hugged. Dexter killed this other girl and as we were walking away I thought he was going to put his arms around me. Later, we were all sleeping the shop. I was listening to Mister Roboto. Ezra, Mom and Dad were there too. Then another time, Dexter and I were making out and they thought we were going to have sex and gave us condoms. Mom got her car back and it was full of smoke. I went with Dexter, who was then Austin and then Dexter again and he dropped me off home.
