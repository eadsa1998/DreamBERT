 I'm on a pogo stick wading through water, bounding, looking for a moose. I have seen four moose in the last day on this trip/car ride. My dad and friend Reed Maxwell are there. I'm trying to catch an eel. I am then deeper in the water, scuba diving, looking for a big eel to catch. Two divers come up from the bottom and say they saw a huge eel. We're at the surface. I'm mad I missed the eel, but I know it was the bait I was using that attracted it, so I'll just go back down with the bait. Another diver is with me-maybe Reed. I'm trying to catch the big eel on a rubber cord with a bit of food attached to the end of it. I dive back down. The eel eats the food. The eel is my study abroad coordinator Jessie Sanders. I wonder how I will catch her if there is no hook on the cord: if I pull on the cord it will just come out of the eel's mouth. She eats the food, partially swallowing the cord. I grab her body by the waist and hips and spin her around so the cord wraps tightly around her neck. She resists but is weak compared to my strength. I easily wrap the cord around her neck tightly a few times. The cord is like wire. She chokes.
