 I'm canoeing with my sister Ramona and uncle Rusty Redding. I am alone in a canoe, while they share one. I go ahead of them. There are people underwater, laying down in the shallows. They may be breathing through reeds. I go further into the bay. There are huge frying pans, 10-15 inches in diameter in trees. There are also canoes, gear, packs, and people, all tied up in trees. This is a portage area. It is crowded with people. It is then a sandy area, and a store is there. There are black people there. It is a tourist area.
