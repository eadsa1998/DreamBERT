Mother and I meet two nice Negro boys, Gordon and E.P. Furlong, both about 18, who live in the Live Oaks subdivision.  They drive Mother and me in their car part of the time.  Before we leave, I find out that Ginger Smythe, Sharon, and two boys are taking a trip to another state.  They are taking the same route as us, so I suggest that whichever one of us gets to the Pheasant Hotel in Mt. Pheasant first should leave a note for the others.  I don't remember if we do this, but we do get together in a house like our house.  Sharon is sleeping when I start to take a bath, so I decide to put on my pajamas and go kiss her, but I can't find a time when there is no one else in the bedroom.  I want very badly to kiss her.
