 I'm in a Target Store. My friend Nicole Peterson is working there, stocking deodorant. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. He says he didn't wear deodorant when he was younger. I say that I did; I have a good mom. I walk away with a tube of deodorant. I go to the freezer section with two spoons. I'm going to eat ice cream. There are a bunch of containers opened and spilled. A container of chocolate is liquid: one could drink it. There is a man with a dog in the aisle. I don't want to eat with him there, so I go around the corner. There is a man stealing and eating donuts there. I walk out of the Target, into a mall. I see classmates Jerome Michaels and Pete Lutz, and we talk. Jerome tells me that he is in his 10th day of basic training and it's being held at Wilmerton University. They are learning how to build rope bridges, and attend classes. He asks me if I know why we yell when running towards the enemy. I say because it will alarm or startle them. My buddy Matt Yams is there with me.
