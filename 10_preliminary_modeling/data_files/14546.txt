I was talking to Ezra about the new quest on Runescape. He commented on there being so many more people. He said he found stuff of Emery's and said "yay FRIEND". Since we saw Star Trek, he had been calling me "Sulu", who had been played by Simon Pegg. I said "it might be funny if I was a guy and bared some resemblance, but I don't look like Simon Pegg". Ezra made a 'uh heh' noise and said "yeah you do". I insisted I didn't and "it's more of a compliment than an insult" and he was like "Oh you think Simon Pegg's hot then" and I said "no but he is more attractive than ugly". Ezra said he couldn't stand him and I said "I love Simon Pegg; he's one of my favourite comedians". We had fish and chips and I grabbed a heap and asked if he was using the tomato sauce, which he wasn't, and went to eat at the table.
