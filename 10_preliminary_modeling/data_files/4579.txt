["Jeremy Taylor and acting out child."] I am at a convention. With me is a child, possibly a boy. He is angry and acting out. He is uncooperative, aggressive, He throws things around, messes things up, refuses to do as he is told and causing me lots of difficulties. I need help. I decide to talk with Jeremy Taylor. I find him at the convention. He is very busy schmoozing with the people, like a politician. I try to get his attention gently, but finally have to corner him and insist he walk with me so I can talk with him privately. As we walk around looking for a private place where it wont be obvious, so as to not cause gossip, women keep interrupting. The boy gets even more belligerent and difficult. Finally I say wait. I then walk with the boy to another house nearby. I leave them there, with the people in it. I come back to Jeremy and say Sometimes the only people that can properly deal with him are people who are themselves difficult and on the edge of society. He'll be safe there. Jeremy then turns and goes back into the convention center, signaling me to follow. He finds a caucus room and we go in. A way to be private and yet appear we are doing politics.
