Lucy is very upset and runs away crying. I want to help and the only thing I can think of to help is to get up and run after her, knowing it will be very painful and I'm not as fast and I'll go past my endurance very quickly. So I run after her. I reach the point where it's so painful I can't run any more and I stand, unable to move much. Lucy is now in an old rickety manual wheelchair (like my old one from Grandma Mildred). She sees my pain and comes back and let's me sit in the chair. She pushes me and we turn a corner and I yell, "You're going too far to the left. You're on gravel and missed the sidewalk." She's annoyed that I don't trust her driving. I said, "But Lucy, you're blind!" We're back on the sidewalk. I see a small thrift shop sidewalk sale. We stop and look. I hold up sweaters, lacy and soft and pretty, blue and white, dresses and so on. Lucy is looking at a baby bath thing. It has ice cubes under the top. Then she's bathing a baby. Some women are getting impatient, waiting for us to move.
