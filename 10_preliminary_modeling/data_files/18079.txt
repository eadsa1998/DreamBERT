I was at Abby's party and my dad and mom was there too. My dad decided there were free airplane driving, so my dad drove and I sat in the back. All of a sudden the plane broke down and it started to crumble into pieces and the back came off the plane and the front came off the plane. And then when we crash landed a lady who wasn't even a policeman, and she was actually my substitute teacher, and my dad said, "you're not even a policeman, why do we need some tickets?" She just said "because". Then we went back to the party and something was happening over there and I didn't know what. Everybody was screaming and then I decided to take a look, but something pulled me into the front garden. And there were big huge crabs and big polar bears. A mom decided to say to the crabs and the bears "get out" so they disappeared. But then all the other kids started to scream again. A truck dropped off a big pink bag and then a man came out with a gun. Then everybody ran and ran all over the city. I saw a little lady who was running into a hotel and I said "that's a good place to hide," but the man with the gun was right behind me.
