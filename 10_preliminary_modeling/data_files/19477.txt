Blackson thinks Dorothy and Beth came to work at Museum at same time, but I tell him that Beth came first. Cushman, smoking a cigarette, enters and I explain to him how I gathered data for my report on Dorothy. Next, I find I am talking to Chapin, instead of Hoffman or Blackson both of whom have vanished. I had examined 6 museum drawers which Dorothy had worked over (labeled, arranged, etc.). Reminded Chester that I was inclined to be hypercritical, and perhaps my report was too severe; also, told me I was now sure that some of Dorothy's mistakes were the result of our carelessness in giving her insufficient instructions. During this talk, some men were repairing, or at least tinkering with, a slender, upright, curved object -- possibly a light standard, or a pillar. It was make of marble.
