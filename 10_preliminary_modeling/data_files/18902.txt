I was in my house, that is the house in the dream that was mine. I never had seen this house before and someone, a man, was waiting for me outside with, I believe, someone else. I think it was a boy. I've never seen the man or boy before. I think this man was my father or stepfather in the dream, probably stepfather, although the relationship wasn't clear. He was telling me to hurry up to come out to the car. I was having some trouble because he was telling me how to close the door. This house was obviously a house in the future because you pressed one button and the door between the living room and the hall would close by itself, and then you supposedly pushed another button to close the front door. But I was rather confused and he was getting angry. He kept telling me something, but I couldn't hear him very clearly, how to close the door. So I was confused and finally it was as though the door was like a shower curtain on account of it came down, fell down. So I was rather perplexed at this. I knew he was extremely angry by now. He started coming in towards the house and I was thinking at the same time about if he wanted to start anything, any trouble, I wasn't afraid, not in the least, because he was a very small man, small, short, kind of not particularly masculine, no threat at all physically. I thought that perhaps I would just push him aside and ignore him. But as he was walking, I could see his face. He was really extremely angry. As he was walking towards me and getting very close, the face had such an expression of hate and anger that I was sure he was going to kill me or at least do me great physical harm. So I really began to get afraid because although he was very small, his face was so angry that I began to get almost a headache or ringing in my head. I was really afraid. It was obvious from his face that he was going to do something to me. The buzz of the headache increased so much that I woke up and it was morning.
