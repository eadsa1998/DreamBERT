Ginny and I and my three girls and their two boys are walking. We had just left a classroom where I'd looked out the window and saw the two boys sleeping outside in the rain in sleeping bags. They had started the night in the back yard and had moved to the front because some lights were shining through the front window, so they lay right where the light fell. Anyway, we are walking and I'm in front and we step up two steps only. Ginny trips and falls. I stop and help her up. She is very upset and says, "The baby. Take over and help me." I realize she is three months pregnant and is worried about a miscarriage. I then try to get her over to a place to lie down and am also telling the kids where they need to go and to behave. I leave the kids and take Ginny over to a bed and have her lie down. It's a "hospital," but it sure doesn't look like it. A woman nurse comes up, only dressed in regular clothes. I explain. She and several other nurses go to Ginny to "touch the lover," to feel the extended belly of the pregnant woman, but all they see is a concave, empty, flat belly since the fetus is only a small little bump. They are repulsed and a little afraid. I must leave Ginny there to go get the kids. I look for them and find them. I call them over but they won't listen. I am frustrated, especially with the two boys. I keep trying, but they are stubborn and angry. I realize it's a power struggle, so I blurt out, "Your mother is in the hospital and needs you to be there," to try and reach them. They still do not respond. I don't know what else to do, so I walk away hoping that by not forcing power, they will be forced to come. It helps some.
