I've got a lot of updating to do on this tape. First of all, a couple nights ago I had a dream that I was coming home from a trip and on the way home we stopped at school and it had kind of renovated, and first of all Mrs. Talmadge had left the library, and second of all, the lobby had been renovated and everything and the bathrooms had amazing turnstiles called "yoo hoo" turnstiles because you had to say, "Yoo hoo" when you went through them. And Mom and I were talking about eating lunch in the lobby, and then we continued on home and my house had been renovated. There was a bed in the dining room with a tape player just sitting on top of it, and where the monitor is there was a shelf full of books and I was thinking, "How strange is that!" And it was an old-fashioned antique bed and I called it the dench beds. [laugh] And last night I had a kind of a hodge podge dream. First I had a really kind of scary dream that I was with this girl, this other teenager, in this house and we were eating these candies, and first she gave me this one candy that was out of a pot of, you know, she just made it and she gave it to me. And it was so good. But then we went in this other room and there was a big accordion-shape candy, and just being near it made me short of breath, and I couldn't breathe very well. And she gave me a piece and I was almost ready to pass out and I ran out of the room. And then I woke up. Gee, I don't know. Oh, and then I had another little dream that night that Canada and Russia were going to war for some reason, and we were going to get inside of Canada. Dad was thinking about going over there and videotaping most of the whole thing. I know there was more, but I can't think of it now.
