Lately, Mom had been spending all her time in the dark. She never turned on the lights or went out in the day time. One night, she took me and Ezra for a drive. She left, but kept the car going slowly in a circle. I got in the driver's seat after a while and started driving. The seat was really low and I could barely see and then Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd (as the Back to the Future characters) flew past on those flying skateboards. Then I stopped and put the seat up. The steering wheel was really loose and it took a lot of effort to turn. I turned around and went back up the street. I tried to turn into the driveway at home and I thought Dad's car was in the driveway and stopped early, but it was just the garage door, and I was half on the grass and on an angle. Dad came out and then his van was in the driveway and he and some other guys were getting stuff out. I held the front door open for them, but they just stood there chatting and I said "Come on, hurry up and one of you get in so I can go". Dad said "What?" sort of angrily and confused and I said "So you hold the door for the next guy etc". I went to my room and 'I' was on my laptop with the fan right next to me (another me). I said "hi mama!" in that high pitched voice and then said it seemed weird asking myself what I was doing. But she just ignored me.
