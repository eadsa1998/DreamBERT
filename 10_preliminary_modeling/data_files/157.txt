There's a Training going on, I'm participating, and John has given us a sort of assignment to complete, which involves getting a load of underpants washed and stacked neatly in a time-period, plus some other details, I think. I go with another girl to her place - there's a rather dark sort of room, study-like, cluttered with things, old carpet on the floor. This is quite comfortable and companionable after the Training environment, but we remember we have a project to do and it's not "supposed" to be easy - we have to keep our business in mind. The laundry basket is on the bed and the panties are in it.
