I dreamed that I lived in my old house and that there was a party and that I saw that all my aunts were coming. And one of my aunts brought a baby which was my cousin and I carried him. And Richard, the guy who is my boyfriend, got angry because all I did was carry the baby and he left, and then I called after him and then I awoke.
