My fiance asked me if I minded going to the same restaurant again for dinner. I said it was all right with me. We went down a hilly business section of a small town and in the valley was the restaurant. It was called the "L--- F---" or something similar. On either side of the door were scenes from a desert showing cacti and Joshua trees. We went in &amp; sat down temporarily at a table with some strange people. They weren't very congenial, and we didn't like sitting with them, so as soon as an empty table was available, we moved. While we were attempting to order, three older people pushed in on us and sat down at the table too. My fiancee had to sit on the edge of his seat for the woman piled her belongings, especially a big round purse, on his chair. The people were very friendly, but we wanted to eat alone and were quite upset. After eating, we went through a door and walked up an incline inside a building. I waited on the crest of the incline while my fiance went into another room. Soon he &amp; a huge crowd of people swept out of the room. All were dressed as Hollanders and yet spoke Spanish. They were all happy and excited and eager to be on their way. My fiance spoke Spanish fluently with them, and I was perturbed because I could only speak a few words, although I understood them. They were going down to Mexico and were so happy. I remember trying to say in Spanish "I wish I could go." I kept saying "Quiero _______"--can't recall the second word. My fiance stood with me talking to them &amp; I kept saying "Quiero _______."
