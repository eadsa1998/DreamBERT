I was driving on the highway and cars were coming by very fast, high rate of speed. I thought of my car, a pile of junk might fall apart while I'm driving at a high rate of speed. I stopped and Fisher went into a store. When he came back as we started, we had to wait for a chance to get into the traffic. I saw a man walking across the street towards us. He looked like Joe Lasko (deceased), my brother-in-law. But when he got near, he was a close double of Joe. We stopped on the turn of the highway. I looked at the highway and it was all cracked up, broken pavement. I said, "That's the Ohio roads for you." This was a badly damaged road. We were looking for something and we came to an old frame building. The windows were boarded up and someone said, "What you are looking for is in the old building." We looked thru the barn door like into the building and it was like a barn. It was filthy with flies, bugs and germs. We walked in and Fisher was doing something on the bench. I was standing beside him. I picked up a wristwatch and gave it to him. I said, "You must have dropped it." He took it. I picked up another watch and it was mine, so I put it into my shirt pocket. Ann and I lived in a house where there was a door between Becky's apt. and ours. I found a cake a day old, so I put it in the oven and I left the door open to Becky's apt. She could walk into our rooms. I met mother and told her what I did, so I went home and the cake was meat floating in boiling water. I fished it out. Then I thought someone could have got into our rooms and hid somewhere. I planned when I got home I would get my gun and search the rooms and attic. I saw two boys fighting when it stopped one was nundy. I put my hand on the seat of his pants and he had a hole in his pants, so I touched his bare bottom. I met Ann and we looked at a garden where there were new stocks of green corn growing. I heard, "Put 2 on Nothing."
