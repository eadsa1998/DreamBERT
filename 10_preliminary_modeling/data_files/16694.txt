I don't remember all the parts really, but I dreamt that Aunt Janice still lived near my hometown and I dreamt that Mom was driving me up to see her, and she lived in the middle of North ______, something like that. And the main thing was, she wanted to see how I'm doing with my ____ Disease. And while I was up there with her, the rest of the family was getting together back at home or something. And the weird part was while I was up there, Aunt Janice was going to this Jehovah's Witnesses convention. Now I forget what the name of her tradition is, but her tradition doesn't like medical treatment for its individuals. They sort of shun that, which is kind of scary, but anyway, I know she's not a Jehovah's Witness. So the weird part of this whole thing was that there was this playground and I had the feeling like grown individuals, like middle-aged adults, were going to play on the playground and sing the "Wee Sing" song as part of the Jehovah's Witness convention. Now what's up with that, I don't know. And there was this boy -- probably about 10 or 11 -- kind of right near one of my students, and he was going to have me go down a tunnel slide, but I was looking at it and I realized how little it was compared to my size these days. And I thought, "Gee, this is going to be claustrophobic; I'd better not do this." And then he showed me that there was a bigger, open one, and he wanted me to go down after him. And I can't actually remember climbing up the slide, but I remember standing at the bottom and sort of kissing him as he came down. And then we were all kind of in a line, we were dancing around, singing, "Go 'round and 'round the village," the song from the "Wee Sing" ______ song. And there were others that we were going to do, and I wanted to record this thing that we were doing. It's funny, when I dream about the "Wee Sing" tape now, there's like no fear or anything. It's just nice and fun and pleasant, and I don't associate it with anything scary any more. And then it was the next day and I had to, I was going with her on Sunday morning to like a Kingdom Hall, and I realized as we were sitting down and getting ready to start that -- "Oh, my gosh, I'm supposed to be home on Sunday so that I don't miss Laurie and so I can do the anthem with them and so I can play the prelude." And then I was trying to call somebody, but I didn't know the number for Central Lutheran and I didn't have Laurie's number, but I knew Aunt _____'s number, of all things, so I thought if I called her, I could tell her, and she would somehow tell the others that I wasn't going to be there and that I'm sorry not to leave them hanging any more. And then I remember __________ these b_____ - I can't remember what they were called -- and then there was this really upbeat praise music that I kind of liked, but I wasn't crazy about having to be there. It was just like what they were doing and I had to kind of go along with it. And that was all I can remember.
