I'm with a bunch of other people, at least some are family. I see a child running around, kind of playing, with a small container holding several wafers of the Holy Eucharist. I'm upset that this is occurring. Someone tells me that Daddy gave this to the child. His intentions were good as he wanted the child to know about the Holy Eucharist, become familiar with it, and appreciate it as much as he does. The container was the same size in diameter as the wafers but it was three or four times deeper than the ones we use to take communion to the homebound. It was gold in color. It was still very upsetting to me that he had given this to a child because I thought the Eucharist in it was consecrated. I was talking to someone about this and they didn't think that it was. I was saying that, even so, I didn't think it was a good idea because it wasn't teaching the child proper respect for the Eucharist - and what if it was in fact consecrated. How can one be absolutely sure one way or the other? I was having a conversation with Daddy but I don't know if we talked about this at all. We did talk about his good intentions in how he talks to others about God and religion, especially when he sounds like he is lecturing, or telling others how to live. I wanted him to understand how it makes people feel, how it feels judgmental and how it sometimes just makes people feel very uncomfortable. I was trying to be gentle yet honest. I wanted to be careful what I said or how I said it because I didn't want to hurt him or cause him to become upset. I'm not sure he understood what I meant. He didn't seem to get very upset.
