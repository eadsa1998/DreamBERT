I was finding out stuff from when I was younger. Some teacher bloke pulled out this big sheet of paper. It had love hearts and Eugene written all over it and there was lots of sticky tape. I was like 'Oh my God, Eugene!'. I said that it wasn't mine, but a friend of mine's. I asked how he got it. I thought I'd done it in 2002, but it was made in 2001.
