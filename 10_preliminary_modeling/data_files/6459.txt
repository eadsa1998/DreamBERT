Crazy dream. To begin with, I'm working in the apartment. It's filthy and disgusting, and Carol from the library is helping me to clean it. I inspect the carpet and see that it's more dirt than carpet: the dirt is so thick that oxalis is flourishing, blooming like crazy, right in the middle of the room. Laura comes home, and she helps in the cleaning too. After a while we get hungry and want to leave for a restaurant. But Jimmy and I are laying on the floor talking! We're discussing 'principles'. I told him that ignoring principles altogether will soon bring him misery enough. I had just read this, in waking life, in a book by Bertrand Russell. What I thought Russell meant was that abstract ethical principles are derived from concrete experience: it has been shown that if you kill somebody his brother will be very angry with you and his brother will try to kill you. Today the surrogate big brother, the judicial system, will get its revenge. Thus you should follow the principle of not killing other people. Less extreme, if you eat too much cake, you'll get sick. You are ignoring the principle of moderation in eating. I was trying to get this across, but naturally, failed, because I had just read it and the meaning had not quite sunk in. What interrupted our conversation was a middle-aged asshole reading a Bill Cosby book. He shook his head very disapprovingly and disagrees with everything we say, it seems, on principle. Laura knows him; she hates him. She cleaned his house once: he performed medical experiments on humans. Apparently the guy was trying to say Well I ignore principles and I'm perfectly happy so nyeah! Heh. <br/
