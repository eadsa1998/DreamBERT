The Andersons of "Father Knows Best" invite me to have dinner with them.  It is in front of the store by grandpa's and grandma's house at night.  The only ones I can remember really well are Betty and Margaret.  At one time, Kenny Davis (Betty's boyfriend), goes by and I say "Hi, Kenny."  He says hi, and she says "Hi, Davis."  After dinner is over, I start to leave and am just walking around the corner of the fence and at the same time, as an afterthought, telling them how much I enjoyed it and thanking them, and then decided it would be nice if I would help wash dishes, so I go back and help Margaret carry them from the table.  She smiled but says nothing.  We put them in a large bathtub.  Either Margaret or Jim tells us to move it out (away from the front of the store), and Betty start to lift one end and I the other, but as we do, it crunches and the ends raise and the middle stays put, almost breaking.
