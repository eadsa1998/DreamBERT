My wife Anita and I were going somewhere on an interstate bus.  We were the only people on the bus.  The driver was a woman.  We passed some rock formations that were very attractive to me for climbing and hiking, and I asked the driver if she could stop.  It took some maneuvering for her to turn the bus around or back up-I don't remember which, but she went to a lot of trouble; I was surprised she would do it, because I thought it would throw her off schedule, but she didn't seem to mind.  She did leave us, and later on we had to decide whether to hitchhike or take another bus.  I think we actually found a bus station and found that there was no bus for the rest of the day, and we didn't know what we were going to do.  I'm not really sure about this.
