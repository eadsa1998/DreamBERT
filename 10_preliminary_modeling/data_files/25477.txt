 I walk in the south side door at Carter Church in Oak Valley. There are choir or music people on the left side of the altar. There are people sitting near the back of the church in the last five or six rows. I go to the balcony. There is a woman there. The balcony is a mini-church: the front of the mini-church being at the south end of the balcony. The woman seems to be silently playing the organ, which is at the rear of the mini-church. I sit. There are no pews in the church. My mom is there organizing or directing. My aunt Rachel Redding is there. She offers me some candy from a table, which I accept. One of my uncle Miles Redding's kids is having a wedding. My bike has been stolen. I look around for it. It is a black Trek Antelope mountain bike. There are a lot of other bikes around the back of the church, in the entrance, and in the balcony. My bike isn't there. I go outside. My brother Wally rides past on his bike going towards the flashing lights of the railroad crossing. I yell at him, and he stops. We don't find my bike. My bike has now been stolen twice.
