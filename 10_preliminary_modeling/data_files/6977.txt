Dr. B. had come to K.D. and after another call says to me, "You wanted to see me?" So I tell him about my slight cough. Realize I'm not talking to him but to a woman in a homoluu, flowered pattern, his nurse? I go on telling her about my nose. "It's stuffy, especially in the early morning and when I clear it out, it bleeds half the time. I think my ear and nose must be connected. Which medicine I'm taking might cause it? I get no answer and angrily complain.
