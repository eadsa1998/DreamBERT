I am given a yellow pill to swallow and it gets stuck in my throat. I can't get it to go up or down. I ask he woman doctor for a glass of water. She sits quietly, refusing to give me the water. She thinks I'm being hysterical and not trying hard enough. I am angry at her and ask again. Again, she says no. While a part of me agrees I don't try hard enough sometimes, I am aware I've done all I can here. I demand an official complaint sheet. She hands me a book of them. They are different colored squares. Each one has a specific name on it. The first one is Anastasia. I can't find the one for the Doctor.
