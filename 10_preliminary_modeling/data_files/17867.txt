My boyfriend Jeremy and I were at the grocery store as all the lights had gone off and we couldn't see the shelves, even though they were technically still open.  We ended up going home and I was in my room with my parents.  My mother said for the shopping you have to tell someone what you want and they'll turn on lights in that section of the store..I thought it horribly inconvenient.  I was planning on meeting my friend Ray at Fresh Choice for dinner in a nearby town, but my parents wouldn't let me go.  I thought this was rude, as Doug would be expecting me.  I wanted to call his cell, but kept having trouble dialing, or finding the zero for the area code, or other problems.  I told my parents it's just like in a dream, and then I woke up.
