It seems there was some sort of University rally at M--A. building. All the boys and girls were supposed to parade through the building. Before the rally got to the building, several other girls and I went up to the third floor of M-- to explore. It seems we weren't supposed to go up there, according to the rules. We were very surprised to find that the teachers had their offices there. The hall was lined with shelves of books, something on the order of the arrangement of the second floor of the wing. I took several books off a table to put them on the shelf I knew belonged to this particular teacher. (Each teacher had a section where she kept her books.) Just as I was putting the books on the shelf, I noticed that a door at the end of the corridor was ajar and Miss K-- was sitting at her desk, looking at me. "Those aren't her books. They're mine!" she said crossly. I quickly put the books back down, and thought I better get away from there before she realized I was there against the rules, and I got into trouble.
