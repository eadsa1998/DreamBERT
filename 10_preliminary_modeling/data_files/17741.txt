My boyfriend Jeremy and I were laying in bed.  The phone rang, and neither of us wanted to answer it.  My mother brought us the phone.  She said it was her 'long lost firstborn son'...whom she had before she was married to my father.  I answered the phone and although he would be older than me, he sounded very young, maybe seven years old.  I talked to him for a little bit and I was surprised to find myself deciding to go visit him in Sweden.  I guess I figured it would be okay since he apparently spoke English.  So I arrived in Sweden and greeted the family there with hugs.
