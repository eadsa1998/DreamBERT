 I'm at Mud Lake with my friend Kevin. His boss John is there, as well as John's kids. The family is on the fishing pier. Kevin and I are going fishing. Our boat in heading out from shore by the pier. Kevin and John are talking about wages. Kevin is using his characteristic cautiousness. John says something about the wage of $6.00/hour. John isn't looking at me, because he knows $6.00/hour is a poor wage and I will tell him so. I say that if I'm able to get a better paying job working less hours I'm going to have to take it. Kevin says something jokingly about getting paid $12.00/hour. We head out fishing. There are two boats: Kevin in one and I in the other. But we are not in the boats, or, at least, Kevin is not in a boat. John tells Kevin to roll the boat, for some reason having to do with what will happen to the contents of it. I am impatient to start fishing, and am annoyed with Kevin pondering whether to roll the boat and risk losing our fishing gear. I ask Kevin if there is a battery in the boat. He says yes. I say then lets go! Kevin flips the boat over. I think the contents will sink, but they float back up. They are a snowboard and another flat object. I sit on them in the water, keeping them submerged, to show that whatever Kevin and John were doing wouldn't work, though in fact it did. I stand up and throw the objects, admitting they were right. <br/
