 I'm at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's old farm. Grandpa has a fishing bow and arrow. The arrow has huge barbs on the end of it. He tries it out in the basement, shooting things. I am fishing. I'm in a boat with one or two other people. We're dragging an anchor, and a line with a submerged bobber. At some point I jump in the water, and am underwater for a little while.
