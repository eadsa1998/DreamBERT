I was visiting home. Mom and Dad had a huge old white house, sort of like ours now except it was on a large field with a forest in the distance. I was supposed to be flying home that day. I noticed that the sky was getting a little dark and the wind was picking up. I wondered what this might do to an airplane in the sky. The wind was getting stronger and stronger - almost viscious. I looked to the trees as indication. They weren't even swaying, they were being blown and bent. The trees were bent half the way over. I couldn't believe how strong this wind was. <br/
