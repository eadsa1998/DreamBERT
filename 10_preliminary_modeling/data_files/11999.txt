I knew Johnny Knoxville and he, his other mates and I went to some shop and they were going to steal a bottle of water. They did and then ran off laughing. Then I was at school, and there was going to be a song or play thing. I was first in so I got to sit in the front row. We had to sit on the floor though. Mom, Dad and Ezra were sitting next to the stage. I also knew Graham Chapman, who was appearing in this play. I don't know what they did, but at the end they were singing 'Every Sperm is Sacred' and I was the only one in the audience who knew the words. After, I went to see Mom who was talking to a sports teacher. She said "You're the only kid I've met who likes Monty Python". I was chatting to her and Mom and then the sports teacher said she liked the way I talk. Then in sport, she said she thought it would be best for me if I taught myself. Later, Johnny Knoxville and I went to a shop and stole another bottle of water and also we had ordered a cows brain and had eaten a little bit of it as a joke.
