I was standing on a bank watching workmen at work below and when I stood on the ground so long the earth would give away, break loose and down it would go. I got on a solid piece where there were two small trees and thought that it would hold because the roots would hold it together, but after standing on it so long, it finally gave way and one of the trees went with it. I put my tools into my toolbox and locked it. I was planning on taking a trip down into Alabama and Mississippi. I was going to have my car checked to make sure it would not give me the trouble. We were talking of dreams and I said in one of my dreams I won a hundred thousand dollars, but when I awoke, I had it not. We had a little baby. It was wise. It could talk very good. I played with it. I was on the back porch and I just had on my long underwear. I was hugging my wife.
