I drive a car up a very steep hill, it crashes but I walk away UNHURT. I look for a telephone booth and have to walk to mud and slush. I find two telephone cords, dangling, one green and one white. I call Frank and he is very angry with me. "How can you be so stupid?" Then he agrees to forgive and come home.
