Ed Hemway has 2 shotguns, one of which he is loaning or giving me. The one turned over to me is complete and ready to shoot, whereas the one he keeps for himself is minus a stock. Every says he always prefers to fit his own stocks. I wonder if the "drop" can be changed, once the metal part of fun is finished, as it would seem that the angle of the metal arms or lugs, to which the wooden stock is fastened, would determine the "drop." <br/
