A dream about a surreal parachute jump. There was not much wind or noise - as if there was no air. I was jumping with my eldest daughter I think - but she was older than in real life - a teenager perhaps. There was a moment when I suddenly realised wed been falling and chatting for quite a while - I had forgotten about the time passing. I looked down - the ground seemed a long way off. I could see a network of suburban gardens. In any case, I told my daughter it was time to release the chutes. I then panicked, because I didn't know how the chutes worked. I had no memory of any training. There was a chord to pull and two orange plastic handles - the type you use to fly a kite. Was that it? I told my daughter to copy me I think. Anyway, the chutes went up and we had to hold onto the orange handles with our hands. It lasted either seconds or minutes - but it seemed to go quickly. It was a terrifying experience. I had no idea how fast we were going or when we would hit the ground. Now there was wind and noise, which was strange. We eventually touched down gently into a warm bath or pool.
