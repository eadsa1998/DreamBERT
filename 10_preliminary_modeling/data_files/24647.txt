Lydia (my friend), Bob (a jerk) and I were at an ice cream shop sitting at a table. None of us had any ice cream. Then Lydia's Auntie Ruth came into the store. She was deaf. I know sign language and so does Lydia, so we were talking to her. This is the second dream I had in this night that I can remember. The other one I don't remember anything except that I had it. Setting: An Ice Cream Shoppe. Characters: Lydia, my friend; her Auntie Ruth (who I don't know); Bob (a jerk at my school), and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Carefree. I don't know.
