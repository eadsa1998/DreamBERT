I was standing outside of the house of my old best friend/worst enemy. I have known her throughout elementary, middle and high school. To say the least, she made my childhood a living hell. Anyway, I walked into her house and started looking around at the furniture. I saw nine place settings at the dining room table (that's how many brothers and sisters she has), but no one was around. I waited for a few minutes and then called out, "Hello. Is anyone here? Hello." Suddenly, an elderly, white woman appeared from the kitchen. She was drying off a dish. I didn't know who she was. I thought it weird that she was there because this family is Lebanese, not white. I asked her where Christina and her family were. She said that they were all out and they wouldn't be home for a little while. She asked why I was there. I had a plate of big chocolate chip cookies in my hands. I told her I was delivering these cookies to the family. I noticed that one of the cookies was half-eaten, so I took another cookie and covered over the half-eaten one. As I did this I thought to myself, "She'll (Christina) never see this half-eaten cookie." I left a short message with the cookies. It read, "My mother thought you'd like some cookies," and I didn't leave my name. Then I walked out of the house with a smile on my face. Then I woke up.
