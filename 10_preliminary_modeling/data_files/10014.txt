A party in a loft with friends, Frank and Wendy; Sunlight streaming in by the windows; near the water: see huge boats, steamers - a busy harbor. I remain behind with a friend to do the dishes but most of them have already been done;--One of Wendy's friends is asleep in bed; I give her a glass of water and she sits up.
