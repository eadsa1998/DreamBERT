I looked at the price that was paid for Christmas trees in the shop and it was marked $25. I watched a procession. I was guard of a school class which was to go on strike. I was to keep the children from going home. I commanded them to stay in when they wanted to go out. I commanded all doors be closed. I was helped with the doors by my brother Steve. I pinched my fingers on two of the doors. I had to pull them out. This was an affair which I didn't understand, nor did I like it.
