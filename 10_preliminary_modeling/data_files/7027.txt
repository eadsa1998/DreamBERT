She was passing candy in the dining room. Started at table behind me. While they were slow deciding, I took two pieces from the tray. But she skipped our table. After she had completed the circuit, I called to her and when she came I got one more candy and a thin dark cooky. ... I was looking for my old blue dress. Turn trunk out and take a dress box I find two red dresses and lay them on bed. Then while I was gone for a bit, someone threw them on floor. Returning I ask why. She said that was John's bed. I said I was going to remove them to mine when done hunting.
