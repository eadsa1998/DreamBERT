I dreamed that I solved one problem after another for my Analysis course, sitting at my desk. At a given moment I was able to solve a very difficult problem with which I was satisfied and from there on I don't remember any more until the time when I was taking my test surrounded by my classmates, among which I could clearly see three of them. Then I awoke.
