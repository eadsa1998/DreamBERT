I am among a small group of people (none recognized) who seem to have just returned from some sort of a party or masquerade where one person was dressed to represent Abraham Lincoln. We are in my attic, putting away Lincoln's big stove-pipe hat. The hat looks very dusty and I brush it, but find that the appearance of dustiness was caused by the reddish polka-dot band -- also similar polka-dot cloth on much of rest of hat surface. The hat is to be stored in my old trunk but, before putting it away, the thought comes to me that this article really shouldn't be kept, as it is just one more thing to care for.
