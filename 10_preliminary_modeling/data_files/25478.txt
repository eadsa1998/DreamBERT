 I'm going through a park on a motorized cart with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. The park feels like it is in Washington D.C. Annie points out that the "gook" is smaller than the other statues of white soldiers. There is some sort of gathering: a family reunion. Many of the people are dressed in red and white. There is a lady there that impedes our way when we are driving. She is a leader of the gathering. Annie tells the lady we're not interested in the cause of the gathering. The lady doesn't respond to Annie's statement. I accelerate the cart by pushing a button on the right handle bar, and we drive by the lady. There is a man that says something, and my name, to me. I say he must have met me before. Either Annie or I have a deflated rubber kick ball. One of us rides on the cart. The other walks. One of us is then on a bicycle. The other walks. I ride the bicycle. <br/
