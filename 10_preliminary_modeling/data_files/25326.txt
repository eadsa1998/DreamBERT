 I'm selling girl scout cookies with my friend Tiny Combs. There is a house near some road construction with a long driveway that we go up to. We have four boxes of cookies left. A person buys three boxes, and I give them the fourth box because I don't want to have just one box left. It starts to rain really hard. I am in a car in the driveway with Tiny. The windows are foggy. My friend Simon Naver is there in his car.
