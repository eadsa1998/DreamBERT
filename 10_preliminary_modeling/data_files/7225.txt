We should start for the church supper. It is almost six. They didn't want to leave the other affair. Finally J. started with me. As we walked along the dirt road, Misses Weeks and Cun. in a car passed us. J left me half way. I started in the side door of the parish house then to the front. There were very few at the tables. Trays of food were being brought in. I got a glass filled with water to take to my place. Glasses were on a cart. A passing child grabbed a glass and sipped from it. I told her she shouldn't take from the cart. The water was mine.
