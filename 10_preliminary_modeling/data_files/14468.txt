I was watching a movie like Scary Movie. The guy with the mask was on the phone to a girl at the start and mentioned killing a "skirt" and then told her to "look out the window" and her boyfriend was tied to a chair wearing girls' clothes. The next day at school, he was actually gay and acting very flamboyant and snapping his fingers. He was Indian-ish. He had become friends with this guy and he went up to his friends and put his arm around them, and snapped his fingers and left. His friends were all confused about it.
