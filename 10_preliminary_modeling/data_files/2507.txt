I am at home trying to get everything straightened out. I'm moving the furniture so there's more room and its not so crowded. Someone comes to the door. I suddenly realized I'd forgotten rehearsal and the four cast members are at the door. I apologize and ask them in. We'll do a read through here at home. I see a small square card table but it has no legs. I see a round dining table and we go there.
