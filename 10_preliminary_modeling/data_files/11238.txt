I was working. In this particular case I dreamed that I was assisting Drs. Beck and Kinley with a carotid-jugular anastomosis. During the operation the surgeon, Dr. Beck became very irritated because the stomach became hemolized, and the anastomosis was clotted. Then Dr. Beck's assistants also became irritated, and everything seemed to go wrong. But finally after the injection of a certain drug, the clot was dissolved and everything was fine again. After the operation Dr. Beck thanked everyone in the operating room for having patience with him during this trying operation on this specific patient. Dr. Beck is a man of about 55 years of age and professor of neurosurgery at University Hospitals, and his assistants were men in their late 20's who are serving their residencies at University Hospitals,
