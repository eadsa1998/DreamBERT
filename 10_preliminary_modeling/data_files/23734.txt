Dreamed I went to a big ranch.  Everyone who worked there was Texan - big, hatted, slow moving.  People (tourists) were buying Indian rugs all over.  Lots of rugs.  Like they were being scammed by the ranch, selling them so many rugs.  I wanted to swim in the creek but they told me I couldn't because it was too polluted.  Then Dad said, "I'll show you where to swim."  And we got on a boat with other people, and went down a river.  One guy looked out and said, "We're coming up on the 30 mile an hour part!  It's too fast."  I looked out and the river was narrower and going pretty fast.  We drove that boat right up a bank.  Turned around, and came back up the river.  It was now a power boat.
