The first part of the dream I was with a bunch of friends and we felt like doing something stupid and rebellious, but we figured we'd better have my other friend Sally along. Since nobody else knew the way to her house, I drove. Eventually we just sat around talking, eating cookies, and making scrap-books in the middle of the night, up in Sally's loft. I had some mini-dream about being in a computer game. Me and my family and family friends went to this Club Med, and they were all a part of the Club Med circus team, and they wanted me to do the trapeze. I'm an acrophobic, so they couldn't get me to do it. Right at the end of my dreams, Whitney Houston sang "I will always love you." Setting: In a car along some fairly busy road; Sally's house/loft; in some sort of computer game; at a Club Med with a 50-foot flying trapeze. Characters: A bunch of friends, though I distinctly remember Jon, Sally and Brian; nobody in the computer dream; my brother and mom I don't quite remember, but my dad and his friend Joel, and his two daughters were definitely there, and the trapeze guy, and Whitney Houston. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, terrified. I know the trapeze thing must have come from when I asked my dad last night what "fear of heights" was and he said acrophobia. I think my brother was playing computer games like that. And I was listening to the radio last night so Whitney Houston probably came from there.
