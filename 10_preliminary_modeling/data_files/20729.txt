I slept in a dormitory with men and women. In the morning I decided to get dressed. Later I went into the corridor of the building. A man whom I once knew named Rivers was there. His hair was read and it was in curlers. He was talking to someone. He had just been transferred to that ward. Later I went back to the dormitory. Men's and women's clothing had been thrown under the beds. I saw my pajamas rolled inside my mattress. Later I was talking to a man who resembled Andrew Reynolds, but he looked younger. We were lying on our bellies. I told him that I saw a man fondling some woman's underclothing. He said that that is sadistic.
