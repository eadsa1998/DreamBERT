I had gone over to Sayer's apartment with Mrs. McBride to try word building game. (Trying to see how many words can be built out a language, a frequent amusement of mine.) The Sayer's had left their apartment for some time. Mrs. McBride and I each took four of the telephone directories to suggest words. I thought of 'considerate' but didn't think it fair to use a word I had used so recently. So I discarded other words. I said, " why not try central union", our church but she didn't think it respectful. Then I suggested 'congregational'. Again she didn't think that respectful. I assured her congregational didn't always mean the church. I asked her to please hurry with her choice of words since I must leave by 3. P.M. to take 3:30 date. She said that the directory didn't suggest any words to her. I suggested 'handkerchief.' At least she agreed. I tore out a page from an old directory, hoping they would not use it and discover its loss and began to rearrange 'handkerchief' in alphabetical order. It was hard to read on the printed page what I wrote. I dotted letters in the word as I used each. I missed 'I' and printed it in.
