I was working in a building with the summer camp I work at. I was watching the kids play hockey. I got bored and left to go outside. When I was outside there was a fresh water pond where other kids were swimming. I saw a shark fin in it and we told everyone to leave the water. As I looked around I saw there was a kid hiding in the woods controlling the fin by an electronic machine.
