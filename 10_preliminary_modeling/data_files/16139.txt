I was dreaming up a storm last night. First of all I had a dream that I was at the pool and I was kind of swimming with some people. And then I went up on the deck and was ready to dry off. And Mom was trying to convince me to listen to a personal player, but I was too chicken. Then I convinced Mom to go in the car and get our lunch and we sat in the car and listened to the radio and ate our lunch. And then I dreamt that we were staying at this hotel, Mom and me, and I think Mom and me and Dad was supposed to come later with Sandra and Uncle Charlie. And Mom and I had this room. I'm trying to think. Oh, we went out to dinner at the little restaurant that they had there, and I can't remember, this was something scary in the room. I don't remember exactly, but I dreamt that when Dad and Sandra got there, I gave Sandra this purple rose which was called a la la loo flower [laugh] and I wanted to sing "La La Loo" on a CD along with a harp playing it, which we really don't have a rendition with no words, but I dreamt that we did.
