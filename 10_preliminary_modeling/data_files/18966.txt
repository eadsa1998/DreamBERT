I had two very short dreams last night. The first one I dreamt that Dr. Hall was taking the tape from my eye, the tape that covers my eye, and when he had taken it off my left eye, I didn't have any eyebrows on that eye. They had gone. The second dream was very vague. All I can remember is I was piloting a big DC-8 jet liner, big passenger jet, and I was flying around snow at the time and there was, if I remember right, an avalanche that was coming down. I was flying underneath a mountain that an avalanche was coming down. I believe in the dream that I flew out of the avalanche just in time, though. I don't remember any other persons being in the second dream. That's all.
