I went to school and I was in my old English classroom. Ms Eckert was teaching us and Evelyn was there. I realized that it was impossible to have English, as it was Monday, so I said "Screw this, this is a dream" and proved it by doing a reality check. I was going to kiss Eugene as I was leaving, but I didn't. I then lost lucidity and Mom picked me and Ezra up. I went to the toilet and there were no toilet rolls. I had to get lunch for school, but we forgot. Mom went to this phone place. Santiago was there. I decided not to go back to school because it was 2pm. I said "I had bio last" but I was going to do it when I got home.
