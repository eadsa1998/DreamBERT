I was being chased by giant gorillas in the ___ zoo with my mom and family members. We were visiting the zoo when giant gorillas escaped from their cages and chased us. I ran down a waterfall in an innertube and was lost from my family. I then went back for my house and no one was to be found. The Gorillas were there in my house and the only way I was safe was if I was under the dining room table. I also had a bag of magic dirt that if I threw it on myself I would become whatever I wished to escape from the gorillas. It then ended there with me under the dining room table. I wasn't scared, just stunned at how gorillas got that big and how they learned to speak English.
