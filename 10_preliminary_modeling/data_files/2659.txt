I'm in a space ship flying a helicopter inside the halls, which is dangerous but necessary because if we can't open a door to get out, the whole thing will explode. We'll use the helicopter to smash the door open. Several of us open a window and that is necessary so the explosion won't harm us. As I look down, I say, "Why don't we just jump out and run?" Someone says, "We might break a leg, it's so far down." I say, "We could make it." No one responds, so I shrug and assume people think it's too risky. We go back and force the door open and run, waiting for the explosion. I notice I stand close to the ship and hope I don't get hurt with the flying glass.
