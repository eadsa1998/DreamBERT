I am sitting at a long table outdoors with some other people, waiting for pizza to be delivered.   About 200 yards in front of me, down the street perpendicular to where we are sitting, I can see a huge white cake of some sort, about the size of a house.  It looks like it might be a cheesecake or a block of brie.  Someone down there by it is signaling to me to ask me if I want a piece.  I think it doesn't make much sense to have cake before the main meal; nevertheless, I signal to him that I will have a very small piece, by holding up my hand and putting my thumb and forefinger tightly together.  From somewhere I hear music playing a kind of parody to the tune of "Spinning Wheel," by Blood, Sweat, and Tears:  "What comes down must go up; take a ride on the Ferris wheel."  I turn and look to my left and see that there is indeed a fair nearby with a Ferris wheel.
