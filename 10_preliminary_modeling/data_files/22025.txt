The dream I had yesterday went like this: I was in front of the university with a friend who studies with me, and we were looking at one of the side walls of the building and saying that any time there was an earthquake, it would fall down, because next to it there was an old house before and when it was torn down, its straw and adobe had stayed in the real side wall which was made out of bricks and cement. We continued this heated discussion and were upset because any day there could be a tremor and we would fall, desks and all. We were saying that engineers were really stupid to build places out of straw and adobe. We decided to go and ask the Dean to switch our classroom. We waited until midnight without being able to get an appointment. When we didn't achieve anything, we went to the classroom and made a lot of noise and everybody supported us once we had told them of our problem. We had everyone sign a petition, which was necessary, and when we looked out the window, the rain was pouring. We said goodbye to everybody and shook hands to the point where my fingers hurt. When we went down, we looked at the wall, thinking it would collapse, but to our surprise, we saw that the rain had washed the wall of the straw and adobe and one could see the good wall clearly. We laughed and laughed and tore up the petition.
