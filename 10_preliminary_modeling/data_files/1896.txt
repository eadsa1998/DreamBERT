I go into the house to change my clothes because Tim, a young man, wants a ride to the airport. I want to be around him so I agree to drive him there. He and another man follow me in and watch as I try on different clothes. I notice I've lost a lot of weight and my belly bulge is gone. I say I have three daughters' wardrobes to choose from and I can't find anything. I ask Paulina if I can wear some of her pants. She doesn't want me to. I plead.
