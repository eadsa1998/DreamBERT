I was at school. We were watching An American Werewolf in London. I wasn't facing the TV but then turned around so I could watch it. This lady asked us what we rated it and I said "10 out of 10" and she was like "10 out of 10?!" and I said 'Yeah I loved it the first time I saw it'. Elijah had cupcakes and he gave one to Ezra. Samantha was also at the desk. They were really nice cupcakes. I felt full and stopped eating them. We were going to be picked up early. Then I was watching Supernatural and something happened to Bobby, whose name was actually his real name, Jim Beaver. He had bones in his desk. He was actually dead and Sam said "he tricked us" and then someone slammed Sam and Dean's heads together. I was going through my most listened to music on my computer and the most listened to song was Don't Fear the Reaper.
