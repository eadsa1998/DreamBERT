I was in a shopping center parking lot in my boyfriend Jeremy's hometown; I could tell because of the yellow streetlights.  I was trying to find my car.  I ran into another guy who was also looking for his car.  His car was black he said, and we looked together.  In a store he kept pulling shaped clothes out of a bin matching the car's color and was trying to give them to me.  He was a nice guy, but he started coming on to me.  Once I found my car he still wanted help looking for his.  Finally found it.  His car wasn't black but red, and the red just wiped off.  Finally I left and was in the car with my friends Jake and Celia.  We were waiting for Jeremy, I think.  He was upset about the guy who had hit on me, so was out with a pretty girl.  I went to get my mother.  There was a guy hitting on her.
