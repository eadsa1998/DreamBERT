I was at a shop. Mom was in a little on there and I went to a big one, like Big W. Reiner was following me and asked if I had money and I said no. He said he wanted to do some deal but they wanted to see money. He kept following me so I brought him to Mom. She sent him away. She was eating princess cake and saved some for me. We went to leave and went to the carpark. We walked down this slope, but it was the wrong platform, so we walked back up and around to the right one. The car was in the corner with a smashed car just near it. It had a hole in the back window and a dead cat shoved in it. Mom's car also had a dead cat in it. She said it was probably from some teenagers who I'd had a disagreement with. I said I wanted to get out of here. The eyes of the car were in the roof and we couldn't get it out. Then I was watching Grey's Anatomy. George looked different. This girl started waking up in different places and speaking with a Southern accent. Then I was watching South Park and Kyle saw this pregnant woman and decided he wanted an abortion. He took a tablet (which was how you had an abortion) and then there was a preview for the next episode of Heroes. Sylar was making funny jokes. I said he was cool in season 1, but was lame now. He woke up in a different time and saw a younger version of himself on a swing.
