Dovre and I are at the movies. Tyler hands me a letter he wrote me. It is long and sweet, emotional. He starts by describing our first day together at work. "We were on a tall hill and looked over the scene," he began. I was touched and felt close to him. A woman is giving frothy lemon meringue pie pieces out to starving poor people. I think she is harming them, giving them something for nothing, teaching them to beg, and it's not nutritious. She's upset with me for not giving pies out. We talk back and forth. Then she mumbles, "Some people aren't very giving." "Some women in particular," Dylan smiles because he sees I've got the hint and I'm filling with righteous anger and am about to tell her what for. I sit up and say, "What did you say? Could you repeat that?" She does. I say, "I understand what you're really saying and I want you to know some people give in different ways. Some people answer the telephone at 3:00 a.m. and listen to the other person's fears and pain." I guess I told her!
