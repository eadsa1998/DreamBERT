The high school campus was at Six Flags, and Melinda and I were thinking of skipping out of Geometry and going to ride the Montoo (sp?) and I told her that it was anchored right off of the back edge of the Media Center. So we decided that we would go in the back gate, and go up the back elevator, which was just like the one that we don't like. But then we decided we didn't have to go up there because it wasn't up there. But and then we went into the Warrior Vision Studio where a bunch of people were, and I was singing in front of the sound board in there, and I leaned my watch up against the ledge and it made a funny beep and a male voice said, "Hi, Chalise, we have to get out of here." And something about the humidity is way too high and the fumes are way too high. And I thought, "That is really weird." It was a male voice, so I told Melinda, "Come on, let's get out of here before anything else happens." And we started, we crossed, I was holding her hand tight like I do Mom's, but I was holding her hand tight for some reason, and we were crossing several streets and then we were walking through a garden. And two spare tires were laying kind of by the side there, and there was a crate like there is out in the garage and a couple of pots and we had to get through this thorny plant. We had to step up on this ledge. And then I woke up.
