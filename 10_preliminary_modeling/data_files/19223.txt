It seemed like four dreams combined into one. One was I was driving someone's car to somewhere and I never got there. It took forever so I think I was going to go to sleep. Then the next one was I was at a concert and I remember some strange guy in a mask and buying souvenirs from him later (I can't remember much of that one). Next I was at my house but it wasn't mine, it was someone else's but we were living there and I was with someone but I can't remember. Next I was at work and when I got done the same person from the last part was driving my mom's car and my mom was in the passenger's seat. They don't know each other, I remembered, so I'm not sure why they were together.
