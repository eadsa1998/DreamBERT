Home dream remembered Friday morning (21st) between 6:30 and 7:00 a.m. I was conversing with my stepfather. He was asking me how I could be indifferent and relaxed while he was completely unconnected and wasteful in his actions. Then I left and arrived at a motorcycle shop on my motorcycle. Only it wasn't exactly a motorcycle shop--it had a red brick floor and in the middle of the floor was a machine (appeared to be an engine block). It had a stirrer stuck in it which was mechanically linked to other stirrers in engine blocks along the wall so that it wouldn't rust. (This also stirred the other blocks.) I was sitting on my motorcycle in this "motorcycle" shop when a bearded man drove by on a yellow 3-wheeled vehicle that seemed to have two smaller wheels in back and drove across some railroad tracks and then came back. He drove into the shop and got off his machine. He was a dwarf with normal trunk and head, but with short, bowed legs. He came up to me and said I could never make it on my type of machine (Triumph). At this point I heard a ringing, which was the alarm going off.
