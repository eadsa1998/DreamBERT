I was on a very large ranch with some friends. The ranch was on flat land and very big. The ranch house had all the comforts, with all the rooms properly separated from the others. It had a fabulous game room with everything. It had chess, billiards, a casino table, etc. On the ranch there were horses to choose from. Well, my friends were all boys (I don't remember if they coincide with my real friends). During the morning, the four of us (all the boys there) went horseback riding all over the ranch. At one point we started to gallop quickly and we let go of the reins and the horses started to run like crazy and we couldn't stop them because the reins had fallen completely. Anyway, in desperation to hold on, we grabbed the horses by their necks, almost hugging them, until we came to a bunch of cows, some of which were being milked. The horses stopped when they saw the other animals and we were able to get off. The people who were milking were laughing hard when they saw us get off the horses with panicky looks. We asked these girls to give us some of the milk and they did it gladly, commenting that perhaps we wouldn't want to ride any more. Due to these comments, we were obliged to go back to the ranch house on horses, to show that we weren't scared (although deep inside we didn't want to ride any more). When we got to the house (this time we didn't drop the reins), we felt safe. When we arrived, we found that the owners of the house had invited more boys and girls for a luncheon. During the luncheon we told our experience with the horses, which made everybody laugh. I don't remember more.
