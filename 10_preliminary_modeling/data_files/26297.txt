 I'm with or near a man who is applying for the Cognitive Psychologist position at Brimson. I see my friend Nat Miller. He goes and shakes this man's hand. I go, then, too, and say my name is Kenneth, and shake hands. I'm in a hotel room where this man is staying. He rolls out an orange-red one-person dome tent structure onto one of the two double beds in the room. He is going to sleep in this tent. Other people are in the room with he and I. The tent is such that you crawl in at the foot of the bed and lay down. There isn't much room to move. At one point I'm in it and I feel claustrophobic because my head is so far from the opening at the foot of the bed. People start to do dumbbell curls with some dumbbells that are in the room. I grab some light dumbbells and move to heavier ones after I'm done with the light ones. I feel the blood pumping into my arms. I feel strong. We curl metal plates that are used for barbells. I'm outside in front of my house on the lawn. There are two older people there: a man and a woman. I do curls with barbell plates. My left hand is weaker and is spotted by my right hand. My friend Niles Zelling is there.
