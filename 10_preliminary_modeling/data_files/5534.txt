[1997-05-04] I was walking out of some hospital because I had to have some kind of short, out patient procedure and there was a door that I was able to walk through, and I felt really good, but then it was like adjacent to my own office building and so I ended up having to be at work, about a 30 second walk from work, like in a different direction was work, in a different building. I walked into the work area and asked if someone could give me a ride because I didn't think that it was all right for me to walk home even though I felt pretty good, I didn't think that it was a good idea and they said, a lady, I think it was one of my drivers, she said "well we don't know if we can do that, we have to get approval first from somebody else". The dream seemed to end there.
