 I'm with my dad. We're driving, and then walking, along a wide path that seems like it would be near the Main River. I tell him how faults can be lubricated to prevent earthquakes. We climb a rock cliff that is not too high. There are a few holes for footing and grasping. There is a videotape that we have and I'm careful to keep it safe. Dad boosts me up onto the top of the rocks. Natives with spears soon surround me and take us captive. We are marched down into the Native Indian's residence. There are busts and heads mounted on platters and slabs. A movie is being filmed. I'm a co-star. I think my dad is the star. I have priority over another actor even though I lack some things.
