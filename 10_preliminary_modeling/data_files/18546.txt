It was in Ireland hundreds of years ago. There was a couple. They loved each other very much. He had very light brown reddish hair that was very curly. She had curly hair too. They were shepherds and made their living by making cloth from the wool they wove from the sheep. They dyed it in huge pots over flames. They wove it into cloth. They sold the cloth. It was beautiful. The girl even wove some cloth while it was still on the sheep's back. It was a very special sheep. It would stay very warm in winter because the new fur wool would grow under the woven wool that had been woven tight, tight against his skin in the summer. Then the rich people ran them off the land and amputated the man's legs to show them they meant business. I was in court to ratify an amendment which we decided by a majority vote. I was surprised how easy it was to pass an amendment. And it was heartwarming that congress met in am empty Sunday School room, with mismatched and broken chairs, on the 2nd floor of a church, on Tuesday evenings. Marianna opened a new gallery and was painting it orange and black. I wasn't crazy about the colors but Marianna had a master plan in mind. Community Access cashed in at an opportune moment by buying an UGLY horoscope calendar--6 feet long X 18 inches wide at K-Mart and insisting it be hung with the art. It was so tacky. I cut out to go to the zoo. I was watching the penguins. Ice was slushy on top of their lake. They were skating around having such a good time. They had their individual penguin huts that fit over them like a toaster cover but were solid. I didn't know how they got in there.
