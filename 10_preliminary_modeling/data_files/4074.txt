["Seth And The Kitten"]  I am walking through a long old building that is a series of rooms like in a museum. Each room has a special book collection from different countries and from ancient ages. I enter the Tibetan Book Of The Dead room and am very excited to see this exhibit. I see a Japanese room and look at the book covers which look like an old dream journal book of mine. I also see some books with a purple swirl pattern. I am now in a large room with some other women. A man comes to the door, from the prince. I am invited somewhere. I can't find my kitten and am sad. I am called outside where I see some kittens, including the cute fuzzy gray one that is mine. I am told to call to it. Someone is calling "Here Kitty, here kitty." I say to the cat, "Pasele" I explain it is important to just let the kitty come as it wishes, giving it encouragement, not demands. It comes to me and I pick it up, cuddling it happily. Now I am in another room with Seth, Mary Ann and Katrina and several other women. Seth is very antsy and keeps hitting my chair and annoying me. He bumps me so hard I hit my knee on a corner, hurting myself. I automatically turn around and slap him on his head. Then I hold his head, rubbing the hurt place and trying to explain to him how much he hurt me. Mary Ann is very upset with me. I feel ashamed and guilty. I wish I hadn't lashed out so automatically.
