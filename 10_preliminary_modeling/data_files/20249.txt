I was working on washing machines. I had to get a bundle of clothing to a place at a certain time. Later I was riding on a street car. When I noticed a strange street, I realized I was on the wrong street car. I went under a street car track that was elevated and I asked a lady selling cupcakes the price of them, but they were too expensive, so I turned to leave. But I was caught between the counter and the rail. I finally freed myself. I wondered how many people could fit in there.
