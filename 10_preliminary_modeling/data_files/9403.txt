With Zoe (old friend) and her mother at their house in Vienna; I leave and return on skis, after skiing over rocks with cracks on rough terrain. I arrive safely and enter through the back door. Edward is there too. Awakens and then they all serve me tea. I embrace Zoe and Edward threatens to call police because of rumors that they used female corpses (for what purpose? not clear in dream).
