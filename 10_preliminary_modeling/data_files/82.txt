I have trapped a guy who means to do me some harm in a tiny room and slugged him unconscious - first I sprayed or waved something in his face. This room is odd, and nearly circular, and seems to be independent. It may stand by itself in a house; I don't think it's outside. He and a partner have accosted me and someone else, and he brought me inside to look for something he wants. Now that I've stopped him, I'm thinking of how to get his companion... While I've got a moment, I'm dabbing on some perfume from a little dressing table and looking around. The room is stuffed full of clothes and stuff, old furnishings, but it's tiny... Maybe I should tie him up instead - might come to, then I'd be back where I started. I find a tie and tie his hands. While I'm doing this he starts to come around so I slug him again. I'm enjoying that. I haven't tied anyone up before, so I'm not doing a very efficient job. Especially, I tie his feet and mean to tie his hands to them but they ought to be in back. He's a bit conscious now, and I ask him how flexible he is, can he put his feet through his hands and come up that way? He doesn't think so. There are people around by this time, we seem to have relocated to a street corner or somewhere. I'm conscious that they may thinking I'm the bad guy here and they ought to do something about me.
