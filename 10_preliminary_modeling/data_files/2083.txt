I have two husbands and I live in a run-down, spacious old house. I'm hiding the passport of one of my husbands. It's a small blue square tied to a red candle (like I got at the 2nd healing ceremony). A dog goes in search of him and walks through a room entirely filled with crystal glasses, vases, and dishes. The dog is large and knocks over a beautiful kerosene lamp of blue glass. I regret its breakage and want the dog to be more careful.
