I am at a party and my youngest daughter shows up. She is crying and saying she is always causing trouble for me. She got into an accident in a red Bronco type vehicle with a boy. The boy, who is the son of my friend, was the driver of the other car. No one was hurt. My daughter is with a boyfriend who is wearing blue clothes.
