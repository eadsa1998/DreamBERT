I was walking through a jail when I came to a room where everybody was wearing bikinis. One weirdo said that soon the whole world would be wearing bikinis. The I left and went though a thin hallway that had barred windows in it, with people's hands reaching out and touching me. Then I came to a room filled with weird people. I even saw a rat person come out from under the table. The owner of the place took him away. Then I became friends with the owner and he told me that some people were coming to look at the prison soon. He asked me my opinion of the place. I suggested that he doesn't let them go through the hallway with the hands. So we built another hallway with nothing in it. Setting: A room with cages against the wall and then the hallway and then a smoke filled room with neon lights. Characters: The prisoners were mostly insane, but the owner seemed sort of okay. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. Scared of the prisoners in the hallway and in the room.
