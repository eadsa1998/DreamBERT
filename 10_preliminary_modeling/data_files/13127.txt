Some kid was on the radio. He had wrapped a cylinder of textas in glad wrap and I was thinking that they would contact him again in ten years. Then, that had happened fifteen years ago or something and they brought him back. Mom and I went to the beach, then I decided I didn't want to. We had an exercise ball with us. She wanted to stay. She said something about Ezra. I saw Darius on the beach. We were walking near these buildings. Then I was someone else and my parents were dead. I saw Calvin. I said that I must've been adopted. These radio people met with me. There was a guy and a girl and a guy my age. The radio guy signed the guy's letter, and the girl signed mine. I was talking with them on the radio and we were sitting on opposite sides of this booth thing. There were lots of buttons. I was talking about Robbie Williams who I was friends with. I was saying how everyone says he's a "sex God". I was saying that we don't hang out much because I liked being alone, but we would watch movies together sometimes. There were lots of rows of CD's. There was a laptop.
