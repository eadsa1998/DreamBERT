I was at a theme park and I think it was supposed to be Disneyland. I remember being extremely excited to be there. I was with my sister and couldn't wait to go on the rides. My sister dragged me to what was a huge slide. I thought that it was boring for a ride at Disneyland. I asked, "Why are we waiting in line to go on something so boring?" All the time I was in line for the slide, I was looking at all the other more exciting rides we could have been going on.
