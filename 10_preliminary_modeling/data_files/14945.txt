I went to this jail thing. I think I was in another country. People were sent to death and had their heads dipped in lava/hot stuff to kill them. Their heads melted off except for some bits and I thought it was a weird way to kill them. I think I saved someone and then they came looking for me so I ran. This young kid was helping me. We ran through people's yards, etc. One had long thin grass. He ran back and said they were coming and we hid in the grass. The guy after us was Christoph Waltz and the kid pushed him into a pond. He heard the kid giggling so was looking for us. We got over some more fences but I think he had seen us. I managed to get something which looked like a sheep. This girl was there and I was sort of friends with her. She gave someone $8200 to get a ticket for me. I got on a train and saw Christoph and ran from him. He was looking for me. The train was moving but I jumped off and he didn't see. Someone told him I was in a field in London, but he knew it wasn't true. Mom was telling me that people who had been brought back to life couldn't use certain areas or "smoke in private". There was a new window at the old house and it made everything outside look pixelated. It was raining.
