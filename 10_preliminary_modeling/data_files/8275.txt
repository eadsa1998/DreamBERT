This dream seemed to be about redecorating two rooms in two separate houses belonging to twins in their early twenties. They both owned a dog that came from the same litter. They wanted the rooms done exactly the same because of the dogs being so much the same. I don't know if these can be twins. There was some problem that they kept running into or that the decorator kept running into over and over. There was a man that looked like this man named "Ziggy" that was on a decorating show that I saw in waking life. He came and made some kind of large donation to a charitable organization. Someone else did the same. There was also something about two or three flowers stands like I have on my front porch in waking life. I think this was going on in or around the garage.
