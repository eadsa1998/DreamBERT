A tall good-looking man enters. He has come with a bus load of kids. They have all been saving their food and money to afford this escape to where I am. They have heard of how well I did and want to do the same. I quietly stand in front of him, facing him. It feels good and calm. I like him. He likes me. He is different from the others. (He looks like the conductor I met at the coast, Tony Amour.) The welfare people need my report and because I was honest, they have to take away a couch in my parent's home. I have a small girl with me.
