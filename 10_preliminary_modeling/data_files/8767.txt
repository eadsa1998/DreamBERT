I was living on Lakeland with Darren. I had gone into the garage for something and I saw what appeared to be a dead animal. As I got closer I realized that it was a huge, black rat. It was the size of an adult cat. Close by it I saw a very tiny mouse sitting in place and quickly realized that it was dead. I thought it was very odd that it died sitting upright and it's body stayed in that position. Moments later I hurried back into the house and didn't want to go back to the garage until someone got rid of them. I went out to the front porch through the front door and saw more of the huge, black, dead rats. They were hanging from the house, lying in the flower bed and other places. I think I saw more mice as well. I hurried back into the house and went into the kitchen where I saw more. They seemed to be everywhere. There are few things that bother me as much as rodents. I was feeling extremely anxious and panicked and not even wanting to put my feet on the floor for fear of stepping on one. Yet, no place in the house felt safe. Someone came to get rid of them, either instead of Darren or to help Darren.
