 I'm looking at a rack of t-shirts with a man. There are a lot of white shirts with different colored Nike logos on them. The shirts cost $10, which I think is too much. There is a red shirt with Michael Jordan and Spike Lee on it, and a wife beater with a huge amount of space around the collar. The man I'm with, who is a friend, tells me I should get a shirt like this, and he holds up a Goldfish (tiny crackers) shirt that is clear/whitish plastic, like a rain coat. I tell him I've already got one.
