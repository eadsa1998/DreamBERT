I don't know where we were, but Raquel and I were far away (like a few hours drive). The train only came every 1-2 hours. There was one coming in a few minutes but she decided to catch a ride back instead. There was a big truck thing and a fat dude was driving. We asked if he was going into town and he asked where we were going and we replied "Centerville". We had to sit in the back. Raquel jumped out after about one minute. I told him to stop and I tried to go after her but I had to run through some sand and it was hard to run. She pulled up with a Ute and I got in. We then tried to get on the freeway, but ended up at a factory place. There was lots of smoke and we had to drive through it, so we wound up the windows. It started coming through the aircon (which didn't work). I said that I got lost here once with Mom. I was then out of the car hanging around outside the factory. There was a box of kittens and they were really cute. Someone called my name and it was Ezra and he was moving sand?
