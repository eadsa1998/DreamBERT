I am on a train with my husband and son who is a baby in the dream. There are bunks and my son is jumping on the top bunk. There are also horses and sometimes the horses can get at him. I often have to call my husband to help me get my son out of the way of the horses. Sometimes I hand my son down to my husband. Sometimes my husband reaches up and helps him down. At one point my husband says, "don't you ever say thank you?" I realize I hadn't. I just expected him to help.
