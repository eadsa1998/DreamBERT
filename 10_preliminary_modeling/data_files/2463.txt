A white man is accused of killing a Native American elder. The crowds go crazy. They grab him and take him off, a lynch mob. I follow to try and stop them. He is now standing on a platform surrounded by the elders. I go up there and announce that they must listen to me. They won't, so I announce that I am on my moon. They are shocked and move away. I begin my arguments to them now that I have their attention. I tell them I sympathize. They have been brutally treated by the whites. But this man is innocent. It would only be an act of revenge to hang him. I plead for his life. They mellow out some.
