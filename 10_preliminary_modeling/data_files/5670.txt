[1997-06-14] This is an embarrassing dream. I had this dream that something was coming out of me vaginally and I gathered it up in a plastic zip lock bag type thing. It was like the substance of cooked spaghetti. I put it in this bag and walked toward the kitchen as if I was walking out my kitchen door to throw it out and in my dream I said to my husband "If you still love me and are still watching me, just elevate my pillow and I'll know that you're in a better place." But then as I awoke, I told him to go back to heaven where its a better place and not to follow my request.
