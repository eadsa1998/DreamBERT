I was somewhere and there was a sport thing on. I was watching netball. Ms Nesbitt kept asking me to play, I refused, but I did play once. It started raining and someone walked these midget waitresses home and they got in trouble. Dmitri came to the sport thing and I was wondering why he wasn't at the soccer one. A while later I was talking to an alien friend of mine for advice because Dmitri had asked me out. He ended up talking about how he always wanted to write a story but couldn't because of his tentacles. I suggested he use a voice recorder.
