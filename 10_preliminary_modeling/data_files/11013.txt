I was at typing class which was being held outside our high school building. There were lighted Xmas trees in a semi-circle around us (supposedly to keep out the wind). The teacher was unknown and definitely unfamiliar to me. She gave us a long lecture on how to type and I was very cold and not paying attention. Then she gave us a speed drill and I got all confused and behind and forgot the margins on the side of my paper. I asked a middle-aged woman sitting beside me what the place was. At the bottom of my page I wrote down I never had typing before, thinking I would bet a better grade by doing so. When she passed the papers back, I got a C. I felt conscience-stricken and told her I had lied and amazingly, she changed the grade to an A-. Then Mac, a boy I'm dating now, came in and took my hand trying to get me to cheer up. I began typing again and was doing much better and feeling very happy. Mac was still holding my hand, however.
