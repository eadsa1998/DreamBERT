Am waiting on tables in a large dining room where I seem to be only waiter. People are mostly all waiting for service, few eating; few with any dinnerware in front of them. I go to kitchen and no one is there and don't seem to see any dinnerware around. A couple enters dining room and I seat them and ask for their order. Couple is familiar to me, but can't recall their names. The man asks for a "gasket" for breakfast and says it is a sort of melon. This puzzles me. I return to kitchen and look for plates and cups for water. Finally see kitchen has an immense variety of shelves of all sizes, containing all kinds of dinnerware in disarray. I determine place needs organization and cleaning up. I prepare a tray with some cups of water for the couple and take to them. In placing down some spills and realize this is a fine way to start the service. Am also aware that people all around are getting impatient for service and that most of them arrived before the couple I am serving.
