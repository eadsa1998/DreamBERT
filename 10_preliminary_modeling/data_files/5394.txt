First, I dreamed that I was really numb all of a sudden. I was reading and then sort of seized up. Then I remember that I had had two shots of vodka, two Ibuprofens, and my mother's meds, and I had my period. So in really slow motion, I tried to get to bed to go to sleep. Next I dreamed that I was at the last boys' hockey game, and I had to say good-bye to all my friends. So first I said good-bye to Judith. And Mabel was there, but then she wasn't. Next I said good-bye to Mason, and he was sitting between Vanessa and Beth, both his girlfriends, so I apologized for embarrassing him in front of them. Then I said good-bye to Leo, Ida, Hazel, and Etta, and Wong, who tried to push me off the bleachers. Finally I said good-bye to Arthur, Bud, and Jayden. I looked on the ice and saw Lou, playing defense, and he accidentally let the puck by and spluttered, "It...it wasn't my fault." I felt bad for him and thought, There's so much I want to say right now that can't be said in a letter. Then, very sad, I looked at the rink one last time and left. At home, my father and I had to go get my brother from his hockey game. My father wanted me to drive to get used driving conditions. But before we left my computer malfunctioned and I had about 12 copies of every program on my desktop, which was really annoying. Then I woke up.
