The feeling is that I've been home in New Brunswick a long time and had just remembered that Betty, my first wife, has been divorced for a long time. I go over to her mother's house, more or less on the chance of something happening. As I look in the back kitchen window, I catch the eyes of both she and her mother. Her mother quietly nods a kind of accepted recognition. Betty comes outside with tears in her eyes and with both joy and kind of recriminations, "You knew I was here; why didn't you come sooner?" I awake with fright.
