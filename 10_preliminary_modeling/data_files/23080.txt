Norman was in Moscow on some kind of tour.  I was watching him on TV as he came out of a bookstore (the university bookstore where I went to college, I think).  He was one of the last of the group to come out, and he was carrying a briefcase.  I spoke to him and he stopped, looked around and saw me, and shook hands with me.  I couldn't get over how he could be thousands of miles away and still be able to shake hands with me.  Later on, I told about it in some large meeting in an auditorium.  At first I used the figure 2000 miles for our distance from Moscow, but I knew it was farther than that.  Someone suggested 30,000 miles, but I knew it wasn't that far, because the circumference of the earth is only 24,000.  I think I finally realized, at that meeting, that the whole thing had been a dream.
