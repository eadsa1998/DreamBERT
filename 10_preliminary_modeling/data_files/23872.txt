I was staying in Scott's house, it was empty.  He had left, and I was staying there.  I knew someone had come in, there were sounds.  This frightened me.  I looked out the window, close up to the glass.  It was dark night out.  The next night, a guy came in the window.  Then more came in.  They were going to be squatters in this abandoned house.  I told them to get out, they just smiled.  The guys were like Lynn's drug friends, they looked scrungy.  Risk was there.  I petted her a certain way, she really liked it, she sank down slowly into my lap.  I held her there in my lap, petting her.  Her face looked different, much smaller, whiter, grey hairs.  I kept looking more and more at her face.  I wondered if it was really Risk my dog or some imposter.
