I awoke with a feeling of anguish, after having dreamed the following: I was in my daily French class and the professor told me that in order to keep attending them, I had to ask permission at the Embassy because it wasn't his decision. Starting right then, I became impatient (I was in the laboratory) and I didn't know what to do and I thought that at the Embassy they were going to say no to me. My present situation is such that they haven't answered me yet about the university and whether I have been accepted (and time is running short). To make things worse, yesterday the teacher said that those with scholarships should have their passports and vaccination certificates ready and that is probably what made me upset.
