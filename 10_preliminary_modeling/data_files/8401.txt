I went into a store that sold fabric and carpet. I don't know if they sold anything else. I was looking specifically for some blue denim. I have no idea why. The displays, or where they had the fabrics stocked, were all very tall, taller than 6 feet. They were cube shaped with each side of the cube was open where the fabric would slide into it. Where the carpet was displayed, each side of the cube just had little squares of the carpet samples. They seemed to be on the kind of rack that stores use to display posters, where it's kind of like turning pages in a hanging book. When I was walking around this store I saw Dick W. He was a decorator. I think, when I saw him, I was____. Now I'm not sure. I noticed him and was thinking something about the fact that he was in there shopping. He was talking to an employee about the project he was working on, getting ideas, or explaining what he was looking for, not sure. There was also something about DDSI. There was a very tall metal cart. Taller than me. Yet it's other dimensions were that of a typical metal cart on wheels, rectangular shaped. It was outside on pavement on a slope. I pushed it down the slope. I can't remember if I rode down the slope on the cart of if I just pushed it down the slope and just let it go on it's own. I have more a sense that it was the latter.
