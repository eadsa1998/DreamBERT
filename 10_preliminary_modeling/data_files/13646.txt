Ezra and I had an assignment to do. There were two lots of people and we used to have a train to get to work and stuff but in the US, they now had to walk instead. Here, though, we still had the trains. I was watching 24. David Palmer was in a room and he was hiding behind a shelf. Aaron was behind another. They were calling out to each other and they had guns. Then Aaron caught David and it was actually a simulation. David was laughing because it was the only night they did something different or something. Tony had short hair and was now the bad guy. I asked Michelle to do something for Curtis and she got annoyed and lowered his rank thing. He went to go ask someone. Someone was saying that when Michelle was a baby she 'stung' her.
