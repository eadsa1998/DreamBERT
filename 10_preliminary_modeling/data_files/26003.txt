 I'm in a store that I think is Big Red's Liquor store in Oak Valley. My friends Kevin Simpson and Bubba Hacker are there returning cases of empty beer bottles. I have returned a bottle for which I received a small credit. There is a small difference in price between what I want to buy and my credit. I pick up coins that are scattered on a workbench with other junk. I can get enough money from the coins to pay. An employee talks to me. He says Jeremy Taylor was here a few weeks ago. I say "No way! He's one of my favorite authors!" I realize he's actually not one of my favorite authors but still is someone I would have liked to meet. It seems like the place is a bookstore. I walk towards the back of the store. I'm looking for a room. I may have something that needs to be put in the room. There is a sexual connotation for this room. I go near one room, which I realize to be too extreme and perverted for my sexual taste, so I keep walking. I get to another room, which is too extreme as well, involving kinky fetish purposes. I'm looking for the tamest of all the rooms, with maybe just pornography or something. A dog goes by me. At first I'm happy to see it. It is a pretty light tan colored dog with short hair and a long tail that it wags. Then I see the dog is on a small platform that moves by itself. The dog is permanently attached to the platform by its feet. The butt and rear end of the dog is brownish, and I know humans have repeatedly raped the dog, which is why it's attached to the platform. The platform moves in a set path around the place. I think it's usually in one of the perverted rooms.
