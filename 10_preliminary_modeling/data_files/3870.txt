["Tickling Ernie's Feet."] I am seated in an overstuffed easy chair and Ernie is teasing me. He stands up on the back of the chair just above my shoulders and then sits, draping his ;egs down over my shoulders. I tickle the bottom of his bare feet. He laughs and we giggle, having fun. Later, I am walking down a hall. I see Howard in another room and he comes out toward me. I am a bit surprised because he is dead. His face is white and quite round. I smile and say I've been meaning to ask you a question. He waits. I say, Was it the National Merit scholarship or the Rhodes scholarship you got? Or both? He says both. I say well, they realized just how smart you were. But then maybe they took the Rhodes one back, because no one can have both. He is very pleased that I acknowledged how smart he was. I say good bye, realizing I was luckily to catch him and ask this question, since he is dead, but just not all the way gone yet.
