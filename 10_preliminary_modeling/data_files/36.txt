I'm in a small house with my family - at least my brother and Mom, don't remember Dad -my brother's mad - it has something to do with jealousy - he says I did or got something I wasn't supposed to. He's not correct but I don't want him attacking me so I don't say anything but I start to pack up and leave - I don't have much, I think this is like a rented vacation house and I came here last. Mom says no, I don't have to leave and I stop, but Marcy gets madder and he leaves. He's so mad we look out the window after him to be sure he isn't going to sneak back and jump us, through the roof or the back door. Next I think a blond young man comes to the house but if so I don't know what he does.
