I see DANA riding a tricycle (she is somewhat older) --I agree to take a young girl to the Y downtown and to lend her a towel. Frank decides to drive us, so we get into the car, but when we get near the University, he says he first wants to look over the campus. I tell him there is a class at 9 AM and it is already 10 minutes to 9. I want to get there NOW. We have a big ARGUMENT -- it shifts to a kitchen scene where I take a cup of soup (not too hot) and threaten to throw it at Frank, if he does not take us to the Y right away!
