I was washing. Jo was helping sort clothes. There was a tennis net which has to be detached from a rope and iron snaps. I started on it with him at the other end doing so well that I let him finish. I was sorting out fragile things to go in the washer by themselves. Pick up a blue silk padded card table cover and decide to put it in with them.
