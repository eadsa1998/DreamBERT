I'm in a huge building - a work place. Like an office block from the novel Nineteen Eighty-four - but smarter architecture. We are salesmen. I work a night shift. There are many colleagues in the office, mainly women. I'm sent out to the neighborhood to sell a fast car. An arrogant colleague wants to show me how to sell it. He says he can anything to anyone. The first guy he tries to sell it to just says "no" to the test drive. I step in and try a softer approach. It works and I persuade him to do the test drive. The other sales guy is humiliated. It's nighttime.
