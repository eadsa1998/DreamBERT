Susan Sanders and I are at some kind of catacomb or castle at night.  I believe Ajay Cronin took us there.  There is a long fenced-in pathway leading from the place.  After we have been there a while, I see a person or thing chasing Susan down this pathway.  I run to the fence and start to climb over, and he, or it, runs back.  I climb over and give chase.  When I catch him, it is Doug Dryer.  I decide not to tell Susan.  Later we are on some high places like ledges, climbing around.  It is pretty scary.  I fall a few times, quite a distance, but land unharmed each time.  Finally she climbs up on some sort of semicircular ledge.  I start to follow, but it is too great a gap to bridge.  I want to kiss her, but she says she will have Ajay unlock the place and we can go exploring some more.  It was dark down there.  On the way back, someone informed me that Ajay had died from the acne condition on his face.
