["The world blows up."] I am a part of a submarine crew of huge black nuclear submarines. Something horrible is happening and the destruction of the entire world is in progress. I am crawling around on the wreak, trying to piece together what happened. I follow a ladder and then see the action of a crew member being blamed for the whole accident incident. His chest is exposed. Captain Picard is climbing up to him to kill him off and the sailor as a last desperate measure bites the nose off the captain. He screams and falls back into the innards of the sub. The sailor escapes and some others do as well. They are swimming for shore but they all know they as well as the whole world is doomed.. But the survival instinct is strong. They get to shore maybe Australia and find rotten wing spans from airplanes with the guts rotted away. One old plane is barely flyable. One pilot knows how to fly out. They bravely help him get it flying across the sea. When the doomsday bomb goes off, one sailor says we'll all be blown to bits and end up part of the primordial soup. That's how we win and survive. The world will survive. But us individual people will all become a mix of molecules and start the world all over fresh. Apparently the terrible accident was the one nuclear sub armed and went after another one. I see the lights of the distant explosion happening as we all swim in the sea..
