I shot someone in the back to get his beer garden from him. I didn't kill him, but he had me in a nervous condition. I would get hammered every time I met him. Ray Kucera was my sympathizer. We were always drinking whiskey. Then I flew up and got away from my torturer. We stopped and I had a couple of wines. I heard Audrey yelling. I ran to see what was going on and Barbara was doing something to Audrey. I yelled at Barbara to stop it and she didn't heed me. I opened a locked gate and ran to her.
