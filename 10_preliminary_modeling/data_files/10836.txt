I was playing ping pong at a church I remembered as being way out in Sacramento, California. The setting was so realistic, it was like I was there yesterday. As we were playing (my opponent I cannot place) a man suddenly came in and asked for some money. He looked like a beggar or a tramp. I found a nickel in my purse and gave it to him. Apparently this was not what he had come for. He started to come toward us and while screaming, we ran out the back way and up the stairs where I used to live. He followed and I called to my mother who came out and the tramp just ran as fast as he could. I woke up so suddenly terrified by this dream. The participants other than myself were this man about 50, a complete stranger, the girl I was playing with I cannot recall.
