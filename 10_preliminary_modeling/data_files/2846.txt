I am in a house, presumably my parents house. There is a flood which messes up things on the ground floor but doesn't get so high it reaches much more than the floor. It's a mess. Now there are looters running around and grabbing at anything they want. It's sort of like a store with products on shelves. I don't want to do that. It's wrong, but then I see everybody doing it and I see some pads of paper, so I change my mind and grab a bunch of pads of paper (writing lined paper). It's a mess there and it's sad to waste so much with destruction. I see a black fuzzy kitten flying around the room and I want to catch it. I try and try and finally get it. It has a feather and a note on paper tied to its collar. I try to read the note, handwritten in pencil. Now I hold the kitten, but it is flat like a piece of paper and I am disappointed, not nearly as much fun as a real kitten. I have my coat and I'm looking for a place to hang it. The usual living room closet for coats is not there anymore and I see across the room a series of hangers on the wall and I hang the coat up there. Now I decide to run away with my little girl (like Charla). We get into a red convertible car and I am driving and the little girl is crawling from the front to the back and up by the door and she's making me nervous because that could be dangerous. So I find a place to pull over, kind of muddy and gravel-like, but it will do, and I sit the girl in the driver's seat and say in a lecturing tone, "Look, this is really dangerous and I don't want you to get hurt, so let's do up your seat belt." I convince her, but she's not too happy. I'm in the passenger side and am trying to drive and realize that this won't work, so I explain to her and we trade seats. I try to fasten my seat belt, but there are only too outies clasps and then I see there are only two innie clasps and then I see there are two seat belts and I find an innie and an outie and clasp them together.
