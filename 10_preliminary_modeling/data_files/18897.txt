Well, I will try to put down this complicated dream. I was visiting at the house of two friends of mine, a married couple, both of whom go to the University of Miami. I was relaxing in their living room when another couple who lives behind this couple walked in. Of the second couple, the wife is very attractive and has a magnificent figure. I was thinking on this occasion as I have in real life, whether the husband was very adequate to the wife. The wife said she might like to go out and take a walk. It was raining slightly, so I said something to the effect that it was only drizzling very slightly and it might be nice to take a walk out there in the rain. So she walked out, started walking down the block, and then I came out to follow her. The neighborhood wasn't exactly like any neighborhood I've ever seen. It was somewhat similar to the terrain in San Francisco. The houses were up on sloping hills and she walked down to a house on the corner and sat on the grass on one of these slopes. I ran on the top of the slope and then ran down the slope and sat beside her. At this point when I reached her, she was no longer the wife of this guy. She was no longer the same girl, but she was Oriental. She had an Oriental face, which didn't surprise me somehow. She began talking in that inscrutable way of Orientals, with a little proverb, something about the fact that I would go very far in life, because I was good at business deals. For example, if I wanted to make a good deal on my brother's car (by the way, I have no brother and in the dream at the time I realized I didn't have a brother, yet it wasn't completely shocking to me). I sort of knew that this was an example, that she didn't really think I had a brother, but anyway if I sold my brother's car, I could sell half-interest in it for $200 plus ten dollars for title fee, and thus I would make an amazing profit. Somehow at the time I understood. That's the end of that dream.
