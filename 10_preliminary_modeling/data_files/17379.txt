I was going to put my boyfriend Jeremy's bike away, so I was gliding on both his bike and mine  Back and forth around the corner.  My mother asked me a question near the trunk of the car.  Something about 'the rules'.  I continued them, singing the Grasshopper Takeover song "Forever Young", not aware the song was what she was talking about, only that I recognized what she meant and the words I'd heard before were from the song.
