The town had become this strange peat bog, all hemmed in by mist. At one end was 1st and 2nd street, and right after that came Miramar Avenue, on which was Will's house. I was being chased and I found refuge in Will's house. I kept going into the wrong rooms, though, which were all full of his family members, all sound asleep. Finally I found the right room, with Will and all his friends watching a horror/sci-fi movie. Apparently Will was throwing a publication party: Will had had some long school project to do, and so he had farmed sections of it out to each of his friends, and we all wrote a bit of it. The final thing ended up being like 300 pages. The teacher had thought it was so good he had it published as an anthology! I found my bit in it and read it over. The whole thing was printed in a really cool font, with unique margin illustrations on each page. But the odd thing was, this whole innocuous-sounding dream had a very strong atmosphere of foreboding.
