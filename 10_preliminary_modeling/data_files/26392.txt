 My friends Tim and Niles Zelling and I are about to make our trip to Vail. I talk to my friend Nat Miller on the phone and he wants us to try to make it to Iowa to watch the New York Knicks game with him. I talk to my brother Wally on the phone and tell him I'll bring a five-liter box of wine when we come, and that I can bring some Black Velvet whiskey and/or some Menthol 100 if he wants. He says he may pick up a case of beer.
