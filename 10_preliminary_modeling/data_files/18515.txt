We were waiting for Dora to come back. I was looking in the supply catalog for surprises and so many pages of guns were in there. I went to the back porch and opened the freezer. I was looking for surprises. Instead I found a mixed up frozen clump of turnip greens and peas; I was suppose to cook them for supper in the electric frying pan. My mother said, "I told you to cut up some cabbage for supper." I said, "OK," and tried to hide the turnip greens. I saw a headline in Helvetica, "Kill or be killed," and it was talking about the attitude of the bear. He was 9 feet tall and spit was dripping out of his mouth and he picked me up and held me high in the air. I thought about the headline and I was trying to whack him on the head but my attempts were futile. I needed to get things ready for Dora to come back. She would be back soon. I wanted to see her smile.
