There was a spaceship and it reminded me of Battlestar Galactica. Something happened and the first 13 floors got flooded. I was on the 13th floor and this girl and guy told me that they were teleporting away to a planet and would come back for us. The timer had already started and they disappeared. I went to tell others.
