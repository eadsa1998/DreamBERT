I went to the campus bookstore to get an ice cream cone with friends.  Elmo became Christian and was upset that couldn't hang out with Telly anymore because Telly wasn't Christian.  I was given a mission by some bus drivers.  Government workers were doing something destructive.  I headed down the hill.  In our kitchen they were recruiting a pretty girl.  As I had refused the job, and she had not previously worked with them, they didn't tell her everything.  I beckoned her and whispered the truth.  She unconvincingly agreed with me.  I told her we/she should try to stop it, for some reason thinking the recruiters wouldn't guess what I was telling her.  Down the street at night I was with Bunsen and Beaker.  I took a wire and touched both ends to a thing on a phone pole.  It blew out the power down the street, but I wondered why not all the power was lost, and I tried again.  This time a huge gust of wind came at us.  Flecks of bug bits, regurgitated food came flying, surrounding us and stinging.  Facing the other direction I couldn't keep it out of my mouth.  It was the termites' response to our 'contacting' them.  They were 'with us' in the fight.  I went back to the bookstore for the ice cream.  My 3rd/4th grade teacher Mrs. Drager was there down and aisle.  Our provost had been in the egg aisle during the 'upset'.  I went down the aisle.  Few cartons remained, with broken half-eggs inside.
