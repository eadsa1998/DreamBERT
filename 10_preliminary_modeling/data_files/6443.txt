I was standing before three large spaghetti sauce jars, all of which seemed crusty and old. Just as well, because two of them contained spiders. The jars were stacked vertically. The middle one had the most spiders -- seven or eight little brown things with mre or less spherical abdomens. The jar was also filled with little green strings. Each of these strings had a ball at the end. They had emanated from the spiders somehow. The lower jar had only two or three spiders in it, and these were more common-looking: largish legs, small, flat bodies. All of a sudden I notice I'm holding a book. I look down and open it to the proper page. I read: "The spiders in the middle jar are offensive little things. They're not good for anything, and they emanate a little green thread that many people wonder at. Do not be decieved! These little green threads are solid farts! Many times in my presence small unruly children have lit them on fire for a joke. I much prefer the spiders in the lower jar. They are not so offensive and, what's more, they make great tahini sauce!" Repulsed by the idea of making anything to eat out of a spider, I shut the book.
