I was flying in a military airplane, some sort of small bomber. The pilot was not recognized. We were flying in heavy clouds. It was rough flying. The pilot was going to try and break through the clouds underneath, but instead started going up. He broke through the clouds and I saw a large bomber and two helicopters (army type). This was weird because helicopters don't fly that high. Oh, a voice told him not to go down because there were enemy ships below. The next thing we were flying towards a corner like in a room, and this guy (a James Bond type character) asked us to let him off there. He asked me if he could stand on my knee to get a boost. The next thing he asked for the pilot's gun. He gave it to him. Next we were on a couch. I reached under a cushion and found a German Lueger and gave it to the pilot who now looked like a German. The James Bond guy now reached into a ceiling and also brought out a Lueger. Then I awoke. [anxious, surprised, neither pleasant or unpleasant, no color]
