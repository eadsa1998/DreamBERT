I have a job in a french restaurant in a rural part of France. Apparently I've worked there 1 day already, but I had turned up in scruffy clothes instead of smart clothes. This time I've turned up late for work. I'm unshaved and scruffy again.The boss greets me and seems not to mind.The busy part of the evening has started. He says "au revoir" which in my dream means 'hello', and I reply "excuse me" in german.I then realize I can't speak french, and I apologize in english. I dawns on me that I am going to have major language problems when trying to serve french customers.
