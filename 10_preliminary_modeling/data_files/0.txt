The one at the Meads's house, where it's bigger inside than out; there's a European village just inside, with a cobblestone street and a Pied-Piper sort of man with curly hair, he can do things like juggle - I go up the back stairs [there aren't any in the real house] and then down the other side [since there's a second set, immediately] then down a short empty hallway that turns a corner, where I find a tiny room...a young woman with shoulder-length blonde hair in a pageboy is there, cooking at a stove that almost fills the room...she's nice to me. Now outside, I'm waiting for my aunt to pick me up - she arrives in a little round convertible and we go for a drive, not very far - we cross a little bridge over a creek, then double back and she drops me off at the house again. Inside (?) I sit with a couple of people, playing with a string of blue balloons.
