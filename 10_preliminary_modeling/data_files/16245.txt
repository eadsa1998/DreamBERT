The only thing I really remember about my dream last night is that we were at this festival thing where we were getting ready to see this concert show. These girls were going to come out on a big stage and start singing. It was like in a big open space; there were no seats or anything. And so Dad and I were getting ready to get a really good spot. And he takes me and he puts me up on the stage where I can talk to the girls, and they're like sitting there setting up their instruments. They're like high school age. And I talked to them like, "Hey, how you doing?" and stuff. And then we come back to this boardwalk and we were standing out on the boardwalk just looking at stars and stuff, and that's all I remember.
