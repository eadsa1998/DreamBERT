 I'm at a Simon and Garfunkel concert with my friend Terry Foss. There are many middle-aged men there. Terry and I go back to our seats, which are folding chairs. There are people crowding around our seats. The people move a little bit when they realize the seats are ours. My classmate Jackie Hunter is there. I don't recognize her at first. She says something about going up to the crowd by the stage. I realize it is she, and run towards the stage, past her. Simon and Garfunkel are about 30 years old, which I think is old. They are pale with dark hair. They sing old covers of popular songs. I am then with Jackie in a bed. We may be near a highway. We lie there and talk. It is dark.
