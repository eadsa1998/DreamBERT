I was on this raft thing and it was put together well and had seats on one side. Jeremiah, Eugene, Autumn and I were on it. There was an explosion and then there was a big banner thing saying "Happy Mynew Year!". Then there were other people on the raft and someone decided to take a photo. We were sitting around. Eugene and I were at the back next to each other, kneeling. He put his hand on mine and squeezed it. We then both moved. The raft was sinking and we had to hang on to the 'tail'.
