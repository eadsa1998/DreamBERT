I was getting ready for school and for some reason I was diddling and dawdling and diddling and dawdling and I didn't get out of the house until like 8:30. And then next thing I know it was the weekend and Mom and I were studying math here in the bedroom, and I had shelves on both sides of my room. And she got up to go use the bathroom or go do something and I was just kind of sitting there, kind of laying there waiting for her. And this is the really strange part. I had the digital clock radio like I have, and I also had an animal clock that sat on top of some kind of machine and the talking parrot would see the bird that talks back to you also had some kind of receiver. And it was really strange. I never knew which was which. And then I woke up.
