I dreamed I was in a small town in New Hampshire, but some of the buildings and all of the people were foreign to that area. I seemed to feel the town was located in Cleveland, and I wanted to fly to New Hampshire. The ticket girl wouldn't sell me a ticket at first because she thought I just wanted to get on the plane to see some movie star who was making the same trip. I finally got the ticket and while I was sitting on the plane, my roommate (at college) came and told me the fellow I was going to New Hampshire to see had come to Cleveland for the weekend on a bicycle and was waiting at the dorm for me. I had to argue with the ticket girl again to sell back my ticket for she was determined I'd bought it just to see the movie star whom I never did see. I awakened before I got to see my friend from N.H.
