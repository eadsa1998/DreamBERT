There are a brainless baby and a man called Spiritgarden, who is Burt Lancaster. I hug him and he has a very soft, out-of-shape body. I like him. A fat boy/man in a wheelchair demands my attention. I dance vigorously with him, trying to wear him out or disinterest him in me so I can go on and dance with the man I like.
