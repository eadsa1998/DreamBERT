I was on an exchange in the UK or US. I was hanging out with some people, including Calvin and Tiana. A bunch of us went to this place to vote for stuff. We got poster for what we voted for and waited outside. A plane was going to fly above saying what got accepted. All the things we voted for were accepted. Calvin, Tiana and I went to this cafe place. He ordered a vanilla and chocolate thickshake. My water bottle was almost empty. I sat with Tiana who was upset and he brought the drinks. I was then at home, but it was the old house. I was watching Entourage and Vince had a Swedish girlfriend called "Kiri" and he was lying in bed and she was going down on him. She was going fast and it was very graphic. He told her to stop and she said "it looks so real". I thought she meant his genitals, but then she said 'who is it?' and I think she was referring to an affair he was having. Dad commented on it later. Eric had a tumour or something and Sloane was upset/angry with him. He was driving and helped some family get to and from hospital. He pulled out on a busy road and a car nipped him. He continued driving and a huge pile-up started happening. There were flashes as he drove towards it. Then it showed him in hospital and his face and ears were messed up. I wondered if that was the end of the show.
