I was riding Ann and Mary Palidan in my car. I had a picture on my dash. Ann P. had dirty, sticky fingers and she picked up the picture and I said, "Please don't dirty the picture." I was holding Audrey in my arms. She was small and I had an electric socket in my hand. She was touching the inside of the socket and I said, "You will get shocked," and she did.
