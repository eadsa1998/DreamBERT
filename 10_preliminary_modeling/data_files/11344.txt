I woke up in bed and had to go to the bathroom. The house was different than my house. It had rnodern furnishings as are in some movies and magazines. The bathroom door was ajar after I was ~.n it and I could see my brother through the door coming out of his room (14). When I closed the door the remaining two inches, it became solid instead of transparent. I could hear my parents talking to my brother, telling him to hurry up and clean the walks before the snow melted. When I went to my room there were many people in it including a radical standing on my bed making a speech. Someone chased the radical (young man) away.
