I had a dream about trying to prove a hypothesis. The hypothesis was that subjects in ESP experiments would fall into three types: those who would show positive results, those who wouldn't show positive results, and a third type which I can't recall what it was at the moment. Anyway, I was back in what physically seemed to be the high school I went to, but in terms of the people there, it seemed to be the grade school I went to. I was talking to one teacher, a red-headed woman, whose name I think was Miss Reed, about using her class to do this. She told me to please wait a few minutes while she finished the lesson she was giving and then when it was time for the experiment, I could use the children for the experiment. So I waited a few minutes and then came back into the room. I opened the door to see if she was thru teaching and she was. Some of the students were out in the hall. The room was a chemistry room, very similar to the one I was taught chemistry in, in high school. I went up beside her to tell her I was ready to start, and I was thinking of two aspects of the experiment, one that involved setting up a movie screen, the second getting out some chemical apparatus for everybody. This is all I recall about the dream. I can't recall exactly what the experiment was, or what this 3rd type of subject was. The dream was inspired in part by a discussion I had with someone I had last night about three types of Poltergeist experiences or a phenomenon.
