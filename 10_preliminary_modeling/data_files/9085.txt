Bob F's boys, Stephen F and Daniel F, were supposed to be doing some job related to Christmas. They were barely doing anything and what they were doing they were doing very slowly because they didn't think it had anything to do with Christmas. Bob F and I started helping them and either showing them or telling them while we worked how it was for Christmas. They saw what we meant almost immediately and either began helping more or took over and doing it the way we had hoped they would.
