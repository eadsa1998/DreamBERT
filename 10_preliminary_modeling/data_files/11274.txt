Charlene and I were married at St. Coleman's Catholic church. I watched as Florence and Louise, two of the bride's girlfriends came down the aisle. They were bridesmaids and were dressed in pink. Then I saw Dolores, who actually had gotten married that day, come down the aisle in a dress of blue. I saw the ushers -- Sam, Bill, and Frank -- leave me at the side entrance of the church to go to meet their bridesmaids in front of the altar. Now I saw Charlene come down the aisle, with her Dad helping her. I started going to meet her, thinking why did I do it? We went directly to the altar without genuflecting, were married, received communion, and started leaving the church. I thought I heard a fire engine and started running out of the church, but I finally realized it was my alarm clock and woke up.
