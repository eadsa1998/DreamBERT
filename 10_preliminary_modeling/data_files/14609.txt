I met this girl and we were sort of friends. We were in some fancy area. We went to this place and these two girls were there. When my friend left they asked why we were friends because "you're not very pretty". I said "neither are you" and proceeded to make a very well-spoken speech about how "looks aren't going to inhibit me from whatever I want to do, unless I wanted to be a model" and that in the future when I was making lots of money, they would be working in a checkout.
