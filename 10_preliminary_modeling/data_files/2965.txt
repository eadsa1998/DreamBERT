I belong to some club and we are hanging out and talking and Ralph comes in with a scathing letter. He doesn't like the way we waste time playing with tools or knitting or letting Clarisa talk and play. We think he's being rude and uncaring. He doesn't like the maps on the wall. Then there is some kind of space travel and Sheila J is old and ill and reads poetry.
