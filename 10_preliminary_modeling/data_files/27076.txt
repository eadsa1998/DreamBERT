In this dream I was working on two huge size pieces of paper. They were so large that I couldn't reach across them put I had to walk around them. They were both mapped out in various squares. It seemed as if I was trying to make an assignment of patients and I kept placing numbers in the squares, but then would erase it and place it in another place. Others around seemed to be giving me advise where I should assign various people. I began to get discouraged, I had holes in the paper from erasing so much, and it seemed as if I couldn't make the assignment complete in time it should be.
