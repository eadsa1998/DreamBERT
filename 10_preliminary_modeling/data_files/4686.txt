["Fixing the klieg light."] I am a crew member of a production. I see a huge bright colored klieg light has fallen down from the top center stage. It is oddly shaped like a set of airplane wings like you'd wear on a pin. Bright red and yellow colors. I ask the boss if he needs this light. He says yes. I turn it on and it is blindingly bright. Very powerful. I turn it off and call for a very very tall ladder. I climb carefully up. I am a bit scared of the height and cling tightly to anything I can to keep secure. I see a tiny nail where the light had been. No wonder it fell. I now tack it up with large brackets. It is there very solid. I turn it on and the light is again blinding. I ask the director in the control booth if he can control it. He grins and says yes. Then he asks me to come up there. I climb down the ladder and walk up the stairs to the lighting control booth. I go in. It is clear the director is interested in teaching me how to direct and use the lighting booth. I am pleased.
