I was half asleep and wanted to have a lucid dream about 'Jayne Cobb [Firefly]'. So I kept thinking about him. But then I just got an image of him and it disappeared. I went inside somewhere and there were fish ponds with dog poo in them and I had to get it out. On Twitter, some girl had been talking to Ron Glass and said "I'm Inara [Firefly]". Another girl replied to her saying "I love Inara!".
