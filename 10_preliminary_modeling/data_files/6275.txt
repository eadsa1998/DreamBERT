I was on the phone with my girlfriend and we got into a huge argument. She was in her kitchen talking on the phone, where her father and mother were. She was crying on the phone, in front of her parents because of the argument. Her parents asked her what was wrong and if she were all right. She said she was fine; nothing was wrong. When I went over to her house the next night, she stepped out of the room for a minute and her father came in to talk to me for a minute. He said if I ever get into another argument and get her upset again, like she was before, he would never let me see her again because of all the stress I would be causing her.
