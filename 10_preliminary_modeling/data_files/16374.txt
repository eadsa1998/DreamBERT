Linda was wanting to come over for 4th of July and go down to the street dance type thing with us on the weekend and enjoy the dance and things at midnight. She wanted to be sitting down in my studio remembering all of our people overseas. And then I realized that it was something like July 10th or 11th and that 4th of July was last weekend. And then I kind of found out that Linda and her family had kind of hired the downtown, the band and everybody to have another 4th of July party and act like it was 4th of July. And so I was there with her, and I don't remember too much. But we were walking around and listening to the band. I dreamt that it was a beefed up version of my Peavey system and I hired somebody to work the board so I could walk around with her. And what else? I also dreamt that I was going into -- I had this teddy bear that was like a s_____ teddy bear, and he had a lavalier microphone attached to a long wire, and it was kind of like, kind of attached in some way. And I wanted to replace it, and I also, I can't remember what else, but I went in and I took care, I wanted an adaptor, so I ran and I took care of that. Then I realized I didn't have my purse or anything with me, so I ran back out to the truck, and, of course, running is like barely even walking in a dream. And then I woke up before I could do anything.
