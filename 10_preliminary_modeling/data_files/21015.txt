I met a Brazen Brother. He gave me a petition and said, "Sign one, fill it out." It was $58 for him. I said, "Is it taxes?" He said no. He showed me a picture of landscaping. I said, "I don't need that. I will use fertilizer." I showed him where the house was before it was moved. You could see the lawn was in bad shape. Then I had a dream I won. They came in. Air Commander paid $19. I looked at the paper for results and I just saw this one. It was marked 13.9 that I was to come and collect.
