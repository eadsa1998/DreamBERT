I am seated on a couch. Ellie comes in and is upset. She sits on the other end of the couch facing me. We talk. My mother comes in and sits in a chair beside Ellie, also facing me. She asks questions of Ellie, and I interrupt and say, "Ellie has had a rough time. She needs quiet or support." My mother looks at me and says something like, "That comment was meant for me, wasn't it?" I lie and say,"No, I was talking about Ellie's situation." I feel embarrassed, caught and vulnerable.
