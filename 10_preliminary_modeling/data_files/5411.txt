Last night I dreamed I was holding Fluffy and she had all sorts of things inside her, like a stuffed mouse that I had to keep track of. It was my high school graduation again but everyone was running around somewhere, like a street in Spain. Then there were these huge...pods, or something in the sky where we had to sleep, like out of The Matrix or something. I went up to one with a guy Martin, who looked like someone from The O.C. We were up there trying to sleep and it started raining. Martin wanted to have sex, but I didn't, but I was afraid to say no. I left the pod, but he followed me, and I became really afraid. But then he left and I woke up.
