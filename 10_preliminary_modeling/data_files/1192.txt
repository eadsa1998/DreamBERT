I am in Mexico. Dovre and I are in a sort of shower stall. She's hanging onto a bar or rail, like a metal chin bar. She says she can't move it. I get up there and help her bend it. It's like a competition of strength. It's friendly. I am still stronger (and wiser). We laugh. I get down and step outside. I simultaneously realize that I am naked and that there are three mean men out there that see me. I go inside quickly. They come to the door. I get it locked but it's so flimsy. I send Dovre to get help. I am afraid. Holes keep appearing in the door. Their fingers can curl over the top of the door. They have razors. I hold a razor blade in a handle. I timidly try to defend myself by cutting them. Every time I hurt them and draw blood, I stop, because I am afraid that if I hurt them, they'll hurt me more and I don't like to hurt them. A man's penis sneaks in and gets into my vagina. I am frozen with disgust. I start to cut it off with the razor and draw blood, and then stop because of the aforementioned reason. They are horrible men full of anger and don't care about me at all. The police siren is heard and the men run away. There is just outside the door, a sort of hot tub pool of "clean water" and near it, to the right, the sea water (in Spanish, the mar), that comes in and out and splashes over into the clear water. I don't want them to be mixed (I decided the answer is that I am afraid some one would rape me if I get into a relationship).
