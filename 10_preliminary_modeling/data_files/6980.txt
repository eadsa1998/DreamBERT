We were being served from a long table at the right. I got a large piece of chicken and potatoes and was told to help myself to green vegetables. I took 3 small spoonfuls as to get the browned part and took my plate to my table near center. A well-built man of some prominence took his to small table at the left. I see him bending over it before sitting down. I start to eat the vegetable, which is now spinach and which leaves an uncomfortable feel, and little taste in my mouth.
