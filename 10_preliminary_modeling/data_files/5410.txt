I had a dream that I was a senior at my high school again. Newsom, Ben, Lee, Sue, everyone was there. It was the last few days before we were about to graduate. Lou, Adam, and Julian showed up. I think Pauline was there too and we all had lunch. Before that I had a dream that I had missed all my math classes and also didn't have the textbook, so I couldn't even catch up. I went to the dance studio, where there was a soundproof room, so I could blast whatever music I wanted. I wanted it as loud as it went. I started listening to AC/DC and pretended to play the air guitar. And then I got an email from Aaron, in my dream, which I thought I had gotten in real life.
