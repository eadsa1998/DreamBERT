My former co-workers from the University of X. and I are standing outside on a grassy field with our (male) boss Y. Y. points his finger towards a building in the distance and says, "We have to get the equipment in that building." We suddenly find ourselves rummaging through the contents of a very large room. As we sort through dusty laboratory equipment, my mother, who has apparently joined our group, announces, "Here is his old clarinet!" She hands me the gray carrying case for the musical instrument and tells me, "Why don't you play it for us?" I open the case and assemble the clarinet. I play some notes, faking a melody as I go along. After thinking to myself, "I wonder if I can still do the upper register", I press the upper register shift key with my index finger and blow hard. A high-pitched note comes out clearly, and I continue inventing a melody.
