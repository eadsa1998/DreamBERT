My boyfriend Jeremy and I were out on a late night drive- on vacation, I think.  We stopped at a small restaurant early in the morning, maybe 5 am.   We had coupons for a free meal there.  We went in and asked if it was too early to use the coupons.  The waiter went off to check and as we sat at the table, I was listening in to the conversation at a different table.  A man was speaking in French.  I could understand some of what he was saying, but he was speaking quickly, and some of the words I didn't catch immediately I had to stop and decide whether they were pronouns and that was why I didn't know it, or if I just couldn't make them out.  It was a quaint little restaurant but somewhat fancy, serving champagne with the brunch.  We felt out of place.
