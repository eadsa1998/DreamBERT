I'm sitting in my mother's living room with her, her boyfriend, my husband, and my mother's lawyer. We're talking about money. My husband and I are really broke right now and could she lend us some. She gets up and walks to the couch where there are two large overstuffed cushions with Japanese printed covers. She reluctantly takes a knife and cuts a hole in one cushion. I'm surprised it isn't stuffed with cash. Instead it's full of bright pieces of fabric, small pieces in reds and greens and blues. In all of this, there is a $100,000 bill and a $5,000 bill. I'm sad that after all these years of looking at those cushions, my mother cut them open. I seemed to know there was something special about them and I'm thinking of how my dad must have hidden the cash there. My mother never says she'll lend us the money or even part of it. My husband and I are just sitting there looking at it.
