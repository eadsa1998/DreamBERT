I was watching an episode of some show. This guy had like hundreds of clones of himself, at all different ages. He was about 40 years old. He was a professor and extremely smart. His younger ones were also really smart. This guy thought that he was dodgy and quit his job at a school. The principal, who was black, gave the other guy a job and then this girl found out. She was then Joey (Dawson's Creek). She brought kids over to this house to catch him out. He blew up his house. There was a fountain nearby and this blue guy had a hide-out underneath it. The guy was going to send off some clones to breed to see if the intelligence was passed on.
