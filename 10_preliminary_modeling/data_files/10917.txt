I dreamt that I was at a swimming pool. However, it seemed to be a combination of a swimming pool and an open body of water. Although there were sides to it, waves were continually washing in. I stood looking at it, trying to get up enough courage to go in. Other people stood about and wanted me to go, telling me that it was safe. However, jut as I was getting up my courage, a boat race started past the place and it became impossible for me to enter the water.
