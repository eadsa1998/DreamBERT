I have a gun for self defense. It's a pistol. There's a switch on the side. If I flip it up, it becomes a light, a flashlight. So I can see through the darkness. If I flip it down, it becomes a weapon. I'm travelling through the Schwarzwald and I hear a noise. Quickly I shut off the light and shoot in the direction of the noise. I hear a howling: it was a cat. I flip the light back on: my sister's cat. I've grazed the left side of her face, which is now a raw bloody spot. But her eyes are fine and she's not seriously injured in any way, only frightened and in pain. I try to catch her, which is hard in the dark, but I eventually do and somehow manage to contain the struggling, howling, scratching, biting, hissing, screaming cat until I can take care of her. Meantime I must watch out for the Germans.
