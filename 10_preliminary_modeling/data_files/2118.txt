I am with a group of people, some of them disabled. I am concerned because some of them aren't being considerate of the others. We need to take care of each other. I get up on stage where the band is performing and talk to the crowd about helping each other. One band member keeps looking at my body appreciatively. I try to get off stage but it's too high, so a male friend comes over and puts his arms out to catch me. I hop and land on his shoulders and we precariously balance until I get safely on the ground again. We dance. Then my guy, who had been jealously watching, comes over and we dance.
