I was driving home from work and I could see something in the road. I thought it was just trash or something. When I got up closer I realized it was four teenage boys who were just shot in the middle of the street and were bleeding everywhere. They looked like fresh animals that were just killed. I was curious because there were no ambulances or police there or even on the way. But the only thing I could think about was how thankful I was that there was a long line at the bank that I had just been at. If there had not been, it might have been me who was shot because I would have been there at that time.
