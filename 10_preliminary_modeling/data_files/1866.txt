I am seated in a manual wheelchair, like a high chair. My mother asks me if I need something. She obviously thinks I need help. I say, "No, I'm okay." She then says, "Yes! You are. I shouldn't be asking you to do things for me." I then get into the next chair on my left. It's the power chair. I can't get it out of the closet-like room I'm in. I ask her for help, but she doesn't hear. I walk out and see my father and Hank lying on the floor playing a game like Monopoly. They ignore me.
