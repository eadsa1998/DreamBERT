I was sitting in a car with a school mate, Hazel. I looked at her, then took her into my arms and loved her up. We were ready to go when a lady came up, a woman who I sold a sewing machine to. She came up to me and came near my face and whispered into my ear, that she got a notice to pay for her machine, if she could make payments on it, but I said, "I don't think so." Then she said, "They will take my machine away from me or my husband will go to jail." I said, "Yes, they can do that." So she gave me some money to pay it. I counted the money, a twenty, and I couldn't make out the other bills. They were in plastic bags. One bag was empty.
