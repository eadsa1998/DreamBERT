An experiment of atomic energy was being made. My father was conducting the test and I was watching. My aunt was to be a victim, along with a young man. They were sent downstairs into 8 dungeon and sealed in. Upstairs, Father threw some switches and an explosion sounded. They were supposed to receive a shock downstairs. A couple of men went down to see how the experiment came out. They brought the victims upstairs. They were still alive, but my aunt's hair had turned gray and she was haggard looking. I was afraid to look at her.
