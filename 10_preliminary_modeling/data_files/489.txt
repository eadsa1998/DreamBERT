My mother is not feeling well. I am at her house for breakfast. My father and brother tell her a white horse they see in the distance is hers. I go outside to see it and it comes slowly on its own. She is upset. She knows it was her horse and says "they tried to tell me it wasn't." She says a female friend of mine, her boss, and I knew that it was her horse.
