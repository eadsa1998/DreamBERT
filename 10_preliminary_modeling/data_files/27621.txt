Our family was giving a party: an afternoon tea and dance. Mother and I were busy bustling around making a last minute check to see that everything was in order. There were a lot of people there and some seemed to be going through the house just as if they were looking it over to buy it. For a while I danced, but soon I became bored so I went outside end decided to take a walk.
