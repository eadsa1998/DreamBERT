I am tired and want to take a nap for lunch. Old Ethan is there and he is very ill. I see him on the train. There is no medicine for him. A woman in the train will help. I want sweets, can't find any. Want marzipan. Then in a Swiss konditorfi (bakery) near the Springhouse stop (where I had my first analytical practice). Woman is young and shows me the goods. Then I go on to give a lecture. A very interesting man in a wheelchair comes up to me to ask me about things. There are other people coming up all the time and I can't get to him. Finally I have a chance. I cross the hall to go to him. It is a light hall (like the one where I had attended a lecture by Laurence van der Post for the yearly lung memorial, when I told everyone I was not going to stay in Switzerland but would move to the United States). As I walk up to him, one of the loves of my youth comes in. I'm very happy to see her, but I also want to get to the man. She faints and finally dances me out the door. I am sorry that I don't get to see the man.
