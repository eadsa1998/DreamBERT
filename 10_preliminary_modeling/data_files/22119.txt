I found a girlfriend I hadn't seen for years at home. I looked at her with amazement and suddenly I was very attracted to her and I kissed her and started remembering the old times with her. And I felt that I loved her and I swore my undying love to her and we continued together until suddenly she disappeared from my house as though by magic.
