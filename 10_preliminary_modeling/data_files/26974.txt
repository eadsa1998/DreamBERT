I was at a party given by a club of boys who are good friends of mine. Their parties are quite famous, and so are they personally, as definitely extra-special. I met them almost two years ago, about four months before I broke up with my "steady", and after that, I began to be considered as part of the club's gang of boys and girls. All the boys were at the party in my dream, and all their regular girls whom I know so well. I was having a wonderful time, and felt so happy as to be almost floating on air. All of a sudden, in a very natural way as though it weren't unusual, in walked my "ex". I was so happy to see him that I almost ran up to him and threw my arms around him. But I didn't. I greeted him and felt gratified that he was very friendly and held no grudge. (This would be very unlike him in real life, I'm afraid.) We sat down together on a davenport in the middle of the long, smoke-dimmed room. Just before he ("Ex) came in, the boy who brought me to the party left with his best friend, also a member of the club and a good friend of mine. They were going out to buy more supplies for the party. The fact that my date would come back and find me with this strange man didn't seem to worry me at all. All I could think about was how happy I was that he had come to the party. I was just dying to introduce him to all of the people there. I said, "I'm so glad you've come back, because now you can meet all my wonderful new friends, and I can share them and these good times with you." Then I thought I'd better ask him how he happened to come there. He held my hand and looked seriously into my eyes and said simply, "I came back because I still love you." I was so thrilled and so completely happy that I woke up.
