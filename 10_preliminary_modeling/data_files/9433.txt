Bus ride into the mountains beyond the city limits. I have no money and we are on the wrong bus. The bus driver says he will pay for me if I let him kiss me. I agree. Shift: Frank and I in a hotel room. I am dancing on tip toe. See an elderly man carrying a bag (Dr. Smith?) and he says he will give me money if I let him sleep with me. I agree. He then gives me $15. I am very happy. Frank understands and we laugh.
