My cousin Claire had a party in a large space which was reminiscent of my place of work, but more comfortable, more futuristic. Before the party, she was engaged in choosing a present for herself. She settled on a large sound-sensitive plant, that sat in a container on the back wall. The plant was more like a creature. It was a bit like a giant squid with long pale grey tentacles (or tendrils) that extended apparently indefinitely and grew almost instantaneously to touch any person if they made and verbal noise. It was very frightening to be around it. People began turning up to the party and admiring this thing, passing compliments to Claire. my friend Trisha was there along with lots of friends I used to go to school with, and people from the past. The party went on late. I got drunk. The plant thing kept going for me. Later on my friend Tim turned up and his company made the evening less sinister - avoiding the plant thing became very funny. Even later still I found myself alone with Trisha. There was sexual attraction, but I can't remember if anything happened physically.
