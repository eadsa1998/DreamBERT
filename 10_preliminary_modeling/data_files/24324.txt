I got inside and it turns into a movie theater; my high school sweetheart Cindy is there with her fianc√©e. She looks different. She stands next to me and puts my leg between hers. We talk as she stands like this and her boyfriend looks on. We left. He was trying to be nice, but overtones of asshole were there. We walked into the lobby. I saw my longtime friend Chris. We chest-bumped, but he fell down. Maxine (a girl who lived next door during high school) was there. She had bought my old jeep for $200. They were all on my side, turning against the new guy. We went to the parking lot to see the car.
