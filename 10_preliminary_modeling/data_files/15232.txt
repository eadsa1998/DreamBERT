Dad, Ezra and I were in a 'new' area. It was night. We heard someone cry for help and Dad went to go check it out. I heard growling "like a dog" so I went the other way. It started chasing us. Dad told us to hide and we all went with him. It attacked us and we went behind a fence. We heard water and it started to flood up to the trees. It was a thing for University students to get money. I had another week of work experience at a vet. There were lots of people there. I was in a room with my bag on a chair. They told me to leave it and this guy made me a new sandwich. There was a meeting for everyone which was about 15 people. Some of them were called "the Down's syndrome's". Some sat on chairs and some had to sit on the floor; I sat on the floor. There was a chair stacked with sandwiches. I got mine and it was gross, it had cucumber and lettuce. They discussed Dr Horrible, saying that Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion could sing but Felicia Day could not. Someone said she "started off good then Izzy'd". I asked what they meant and the receptionist was called Izzy. Later I went to tell them that my shift was over while they were operating. It was a male vet and they had a dog under anaesthesia on the table. The top layer of his skin was off. On Facebook someone said they were going "to meet Bella". I think it was Aliyah. Some kid was angry about a Dolly magazine.
