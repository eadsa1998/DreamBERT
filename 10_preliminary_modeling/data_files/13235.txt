I was at school. I was walking and Evelyn was with me. We were near a fence near where we get dropped off. Some kids were making fun of Evelyn and then me. I turned to them and one said something and he had an accent (like in The Green Mile) and I was mocking him. Elijah was there and he thought it was funny. I asked Elijah if he was writing a book and if he had a plan. My book had to have Yvonne (Jessica Stevenson) in it. At lunch, Eugene was nearby. There was a video of Alejandro and he said "I'm Alejandro, Nigee, Nejee, Nijiee".
