I am walking up a curvy road, on the side shoulder where there's gravel and leaves. A man steps wrong and twists his ankle. I go to help him. He tells me he is a writer. I tell him so am I. I have a newsletter for beginning writers. I also tell him I live in N City (on the opposite coast from him) and it is incredibly beautiful there. [BL]
