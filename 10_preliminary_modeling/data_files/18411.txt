Bits of three different dreams. In the first one, someone else and I, who later seems to turn into a turtle, are involved in robbing a bank. We drive up to the bank, go inside, and knock out the teller by hitting him over the head. We apparently had thought the teller was the only person in the bank, but now we find that there is a guard also, although he didn't see us knock the teller out. So we carry the teller to the guard, and pretend that the teller has had some kind of a stroke or something, and we're trying to help him. And so the guard lets us into the little room where he stays with the teller while we try and do something to him. And while we're in there, I say to the guard, "Isn't it kind of dangerous to let us in here with you? Suppose we were trying to rob the bank?" And he tells us that since we were trying to help the teller, obviously we couldn't be bank robbers. Then we knock the guard out, and I go down into the vaults thru a trap door in the floor of the guard's room. And we have to hurry because we know the alarm has been set off by now. And there are all sorts of boxes, kind of like shoe boxes and file boxes, and I'm going thru them rapidly trying to find money. And I don't find much money, but a few boxes I do find money in, I hand up to my partner, who now definitely looks like a turtle. And then we rush out of the back of the bank, and run over some fields. And my memory becomes rather hazy at this point.
