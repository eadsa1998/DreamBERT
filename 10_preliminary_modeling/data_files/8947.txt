I was with my parents and some of my siblings. BJ is the only one I can identify as being there for sure. We were at someone's home but I don't know whose. It is Saturday evening and they are all getting ready to go somewhere. I think they are going to attend a local wedding reception. I wasn't going to go. But at the last minute I changed my mind and asked if they minded if I go too. They said that it was fine but they wanted to leave right away so I needed to hurry. I told them I just wanted to do a quick change of clothes and then I would be ready to go. BJ was standing near the staircase so she immediately started to go upstairs. She was going to help me change so it wouldn't take me as long. As she was going up I told her what I wanted to wear. I mentioned a specific pair of pants because I wanted to be able to wear a high-wedge shoe since they make me look taller and thinner.
