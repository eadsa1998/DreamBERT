There was an electrocution being set up for at my job. I worked in the back as a type reader but really I was making use of all their great equipment: Macs, chromatics. The electrocution was going to happen in a big, glassed in booth so the witnesses could watch. 40 witnesses would be allowed. The elevator bank was filling up fast with news reporters. Mikes and cameras and people fighting each other for the best view. I had 20 pages to output, proof and correct, but I didn't know if this was the appropriate time, with this man's life ending live from death row. I sneaked out the front door (they told reporters to use the back door). It was the first time they'd worried about people sneaking IN, not OUT. I went out the front door to a blackout. I was skating up 8th Avenue when I got off--I was 6 blocks off course and the entire city went black dark. No building lights, street lights, or anything. I could not see anything. I was still skating fast and a bicycle rider crashed into me and knocked me down. He came back and helped me up. He said, "Merri, they come ??? Chuck had come. Whether to live ??? my Chuck's knowledge and wisdom. We heard laughter and the place was under the water and the fake ocean had undercurrents. The waitress said 2 drink minimum and ??? Marianna and I didn't think that ??? ??? were trying to outbid each other ??? particularly if I was facing north ??? I said, "No." because I could not get in touch with the swimmer.
