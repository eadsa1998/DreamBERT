I was somewhere, and then I was home. This police guy got killed. Me, and possibly others, were looking for people and everywhere was dark. I realized that it was a dream and then the lights were working, but there were still no people. I was then in the lounge room and I woke up [I was dreaming within the dream] and started watching TV. There was some show with Ryan Cartwright on. Ezra was there too. There was some other show about a bunny and the father got killed in a fire and the baby bunny recovered.
