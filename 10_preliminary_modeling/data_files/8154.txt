I was on a campus but I'm not sure which one. Matthew and Chris H were both there. It seems that there were a number of different things going on. I was going for a run. There was a young girl in front of me. She had long blonde hair pulled up into a ponytail. It was bouncing and swishing around and hitting her in the face. I realized that I had my hair in a ponytail. I didn't think mine was swinging around as much but mine wasn't as long either. She was very clumsy and not moving very quickly. There wasn't room for me to get around her and I was getting frustrated. I wanted her to get out of the way so I could really start running. I was in the backseat with Matthew and Chris H. Three of their friends were in the front seat. I was feeling very sleepy so I leaned over and rested against Matthew. I don't know if I really slept or if I was just half-asleep. I had some kind of interaction with Chris H. I was thinking about the fact that he is such a nice man. I was more comfortable talking with him than I expected to be or than unusual. Maybe I had become more comfortable talking with.
