I was with Dad, Ezra and Will Arnett. We were lost near a forest somewhere and we were walking. I think it was Will's fault we were there. My legs were really hairy and I said "I look like a bear!". We hadn't had a shower for a week or something. We finally found civilization. We went into this shop. Will went off to find us somewhere to stay. This person asked me to design a website for them and they had a cool look already. Then we were somewhere else near a toilet. I went to the toilet and there was a head on the door and I was thinking of High Tension. Will was back and I sat next to him. We were eating cereal. Then he was across from me. There was a skull symbol on the cereal box. I was humming The Final Countdown. Then Jason Bateman was there too. I was reading the cereal box and it had killed a bunch of babies.
