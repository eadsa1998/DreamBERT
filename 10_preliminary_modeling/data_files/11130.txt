It was a dark, stormy night and I had been out walking. I walked and walked all over town, then came back to my street. I couldn't find my home at all. It wasn't where it should have been. I hunted up and down the street and all over the block and still couldn't find it. I asked the people who were home (neighbors) if they had seen my house. They looked for it too, but they couldn't find it. I went to my grandmother's place and she took me in for a week until I could find the house. I woke up when I was looking for my house again.
