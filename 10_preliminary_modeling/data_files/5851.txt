I arrive home and note that I am driving a jeep, but it is the wrong jeep and so I drive back to a church and there a priest is standing next to my own jeep. (Priest a stranger). He says that he knew I had the wrong one, but that the owner of my jeep had already departed. He said that I was to bring both jeeps with me. I look for warm clothing since the jeep is open and it is now nighttime. I look in a garage and also see the priest there fastening rear and front bumpers of the two jeeps together, and I wonder how this is going to work.
