 I am in a play with my high school classmate Melissa Cod and a group of others. We return to my home and go upstairs to my room and my sister's room. I say something about getting fellatio twice from the same women for $5 or $10. My high school classmates Binky Ahmed and Nate Nelling take hallucinogenic mushrooms. They ingest green pills with yellow liquid. One of them spits it into the mouth of the other. Melissa and I engage in one short kiss. Everyone leaves when she goes to the bottom of the stairs. I ask her what she is doing tonight. She comes back up the stairs and says that I really didn't kiss her before: it was not a good, hard, engaging kiss. I am in my underwear. She is crying very hard. I hold and hug her as we lay on my bed. She stands and takes off her shirt. I push her up against a wall and kiss her, hard. I kneel while she stands. She starts to give me fellatio, and I lay down. She puts my hand on my erection, to have me stroke it as she sucks. I say my penis probably tastes bad, from the sweat from the play. She says it doesn't. I lose my erection. I gently stroke her vagina with my fingers. She shudders, I think in pleasure. She says, "Please don't hurt me." My penis becomes erect again. I flip her over onto her back, put her legs up, and penetrate her. I move her on the bed and keep thrusting. I thrust deeper and deeper each time. She is on her back on the edge of the bed and I am kneeling on the floor. It is uncomfortable for her. I am close to ejaculating. She is in pain. I pull my erection out, and tell her to give me fellatio because I'm about to come. She is in pain, and doesn't do this. I ejaculate weakly on her, on my sleeping bag, and on an open beer bottle.
