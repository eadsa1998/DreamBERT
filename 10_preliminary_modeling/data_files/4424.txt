["Can't read the feedback."] Judy P. sends me a big envelope. I open it to find she has after all these years returned scripts I had given her to critique. I am excited. I see she has written lots on the front covers. I try to read them. I can't make it out. I think it's too dark in the room, or my eyes are going bad from old age. I see some spots of sunlight on the bed and move the script there so it would be brighter. That doesn't work either. I see one script is called "Hughley's" and another one is about penguins. I see she has tried to illustrate the penguin story. I see penguins with pink crayon on them. the word "Cold" is there. It is winter and it is cold. So she decided to illustrate the penguins in pink to indicate spring and warmth.
