I'm at a house, though it seems like I'm just observing. It's where Joey and Chandler live. Monica and Rachel are also there. It's the first time that they've met. I think Ross had fixed up Monica and Chandler, but it might have been someone else. There are all standing and talking. He walks away to look for something. Monica and Rachel pick up a magazine that is lying on his coffee table. It's an entertainment magazine. They become suspicious that he is gay. The magazine belongs to Joey since he is an actor, but for some reason Chandler doesn't want to tell them about Joey. Then they find a couple of little things that are props for one of Joey's roles. Because of what they are they become even more suspicious. I can see Chandler in the background. He clearly knows what they're thinking and he's getting upset and frustrated that he can't say anything. Monica and Rachel leave. They sneak out without him realizing it. He must have went into another room for a minute because when he comes out they are gone and they've left the front door open behind them. Just as he enters the room two much younger girls step inside the door and they're bent over giggling. Monica and Rachel had sent them up there for some reason.
