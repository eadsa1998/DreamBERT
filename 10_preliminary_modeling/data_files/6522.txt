I was laying stretched on the bed in an Aculpulco hotel, staring through a golden light. Suddenly an amazing rainbow colored cat, made out of light, appears. I recognize it as a dream, and it shrieked. Somehow I managed to keep dreaming, and changed the cat into the pretty chambermaid who I'd been looking at for days. We made love, but she kept trying to turn into the cat in a very irritating way. I had to keep concentrating to keep the figure I was making love to focused as the chambermaid.
