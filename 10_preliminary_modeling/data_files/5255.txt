I dreamed that I was playing soccer down on the fields. There was going to be a pep rally later, so I hurried to the athletic center to shower and change. In the locker room I bumped into Lou. He was wearing red boxers and he had a white towel in front of him. He was laughing, so then I began laughing and woke up.
