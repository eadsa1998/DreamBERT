I wake and it's past 8 a.m. I cab not have heard the nurse clock. I'll be late but perhaps I can get something to eat if I hurry. Start dressing. Now where's my dress? Why I have it on and also my blue and green apron? Take that off. In dining room only one person. The Chinese waiter will please bring me toast and papaya. I go after him to ask for two pieces of toast. I go to the other guest in the dining room. She has a baking tin of three rolls before her. I ask for the crusty piece on the edge. She let me have it and I eat it. Some time during this episode, I realize that breakfast is earlier then 8, and decide nurse did not knock at my door because I had gone to sleep in an empty room across the hall, wonder if I'll be scolded (we often were for trivialities) for doing so. We'll pay for laundering the sheets.
