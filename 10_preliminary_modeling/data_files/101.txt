I'm in a house - I don't think it's mine - the others are out somewhere and there's a map here that's very important - belongs to someone who's out. 2 or 3 people, including a young blonde girl, come to the house - they're not visitors, exactly, maybe they present themselves as having business, but they steal the map - the others come back and find them outside nearby and challenge them on it. They're defiant, claiming they didn't steal it they had this one all along. [Mostly I'm feeling girlish and helpless through all of this and the last dream, too.]
