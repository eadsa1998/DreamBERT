I dreamed that I was with my old college roommate in the kitchen of my apartment and we were making lunch. I asked her to hand me a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese and she handed me instead, a foil pouch. I said to her "That's not macaroni and cheese that's noodles and sauce" and then I put it back in the cupboard.
