 I go into the Carter School gymnasium. It is dark. I have the flashlight that my dad gave me for Christmas. There are some men being hidden under the stage through the doors on the front of the stage. There is another man near the lunchroom with a flashlight. He approaches the group of hiding men. I go with this man and approach the hiding men. My flashlight isn't put together or working yet, so I use the light from the other man's flashlight. We get closing to the men. It is like the men are hiding from Nazis. I see that one of the men is balding. This man has some kind of a slug or leach-like creature on his head. He then realizes it is there, but isn't extremely alarmed by it.
