[1997-07-20] I found a plate of partially eaten food. I found it on the floor of a room where we normally wouldn't eat. I believe it was my son's little toy room. There was the plate with the food, I knew it was left over, and I simply picked it up walked to the wastebasket in the kitchen and scraped the plate.
