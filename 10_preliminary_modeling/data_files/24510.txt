It is the present day. In a large, flat field I watch as prisoners are beaten senseless by members of the Central Intelligence Agency. The victims are dragged off and thrown into piles, condemned to be shot. The bloodied, half-conscious men plead for their lives. The cruel agents ignore them. Then it is my turn. I get not to be killed, but the process begins.
