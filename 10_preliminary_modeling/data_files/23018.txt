My wife Bonita and I were driving somewhere-on a short errand of some kind which was distinctly unimportant.  Therefore I was most dismayed when I missed a turn onto a freeway.  Instead of making a U-turn and going back, I tried to proceed to the next interchange, but found myself instead in a dark industrial area like that under the free near where I work.  I got progressively more upset that so simple a trip could have ended up with such complications, but I persisted in my stubbornness for some time before finally making a U-turn.
