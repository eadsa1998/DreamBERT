Laura, Jimmy and I were in Germany. Jimmy and I were in a bookstore which was underground. All the people spoke in these wierd voices that sounded amplified, tinny, and distorted. Naturally they were saying things in German. I remember one large man saying to another: "Bitte! Ich moechte mich unterhalten!" (Please! I'd like to enjoy myself!) At one point Laura came flying down the stairs with three ostriches. She was riding one of them. "I got these for twelve bucks!" she said. "No, you didn't!" Jimmy corrected her, examining the price tags. "You paid twelve pounds each! That's like 90 dollars!" We all got on the ostriches and blasted down the stairs through the bookstore, startling all the Bavarians. Suddenly we were in a river, an underground river. At one point I recall floating a fat person around on the water. We eventually got washed to Vienna. So now we're in a hotel in Vienna. A fat man and his wife, the same fat man we'd been floating in the river, tells us they're looking for their daughter, and shows us a picture of her.
