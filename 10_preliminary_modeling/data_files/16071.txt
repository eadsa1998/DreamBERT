Melinda was having trouble with her female parts and that she needed surgery, and she was driving me home in our car for some reason. And she had to stop at the store and get this tube thing. It was like a hose with a funnel at one end and a little bag at the other end. [laugh] And in order to do the surgery, they needed parts from my portable CD player, and for some reason I found it in the bathroom with a cane attached to the handle leading into the toilet. And I was like, "Oh, my gosh." I turned it on to see if it would still work and it was dark in the bathroom, and the LEDs, the liquid crystal display doesn't usually light up, but this time it lit up like LEDs. And it sounded like real surround sound, when it was just this little thing. I can't remember what else happened.
