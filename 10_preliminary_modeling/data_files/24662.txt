We were going to the beach with some of my relatives that lived in California. My mom was driving the car. It took us an hour and a half to get to the beach in Half Moon Bay. When we got there me and my cousins decided to run away from the waves. The second time we ran, I tripped over a log of wood in the sand. The wave came up and dragged me out to sea or the ocean or the bay. Setting: In the car, in Half Moon Bay, on the beach with the wave crashing against the shore. Characters: My mom; my grandma; my cousins John, Karen, Anne and Nick; my uncles Hank and Chris; my aunts Cathy and Leslie. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, bored. In the car everybody was really bored and when the wave took me out to the body of it I was scared what would happen to me.
