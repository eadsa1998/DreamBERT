I was at a school doing some observations on ______ and stuff. I was supposed to call someone by a certain time and a certain day to see if I could get a ________ation. Mariah Carey was coming to town and she was going to sing at some little restaurant somewhere. And they needed somebody to do what I thought was to run a teleprompter with the song words so that she wouldn't forget them. And I was thinking that I would be able to, I wasn't really sure if I would be able to do that, but I was thinking I might. And so I was at this school and it was kind of like Oceanside. And I was going around to the beautiful classrooms and the teachers were showing me what materials were needed, and I intended to call this person on my lunch hour. But as it turned out, I was busy all day long [?] and I was supposed to call them at 3:00 and it's closing to be almost 5:00, so I was pretty bummed out that I missed that. But then next thing I knew, I was looking at the AGO website and it said if you still want to do this, contract so and so, but as it turned out, it was going to be, she was going to perform at this person's church. And the choir was going to sing back-up for her. And they wanted more than someone just to run the teleprompter. They wanted somebody to transcribe the stuff in the recordings, like I didn't know if she wanted just the back-up vocal parts transcribed, or if she wanted the whole thing, like all the instrumental parts __________, so I was ready to ask that and then I woke up.
