I ate a mouse. I cooked it or something, put it with something else like a pasta sauce. I cut the head and tail off, cut the rest of it up and ate it. I hated doing it but knew I needed to. There were other parts that I picked out that were long, bony pieces. I picked out some bones that looked like hipbones still connected to each other. It was making me gag. I told some people later that I had done this. Julien D was one of those people. There was snow outside. Someone had made a magnificent snow sculpture. It was lit with strategically placed lights and it also was kind of like a waterfall. Two pieces of the sculpture were lion's heads. My waking somatic response was horrible. I felt nauseous, my blood was tingling, and I was shaking.
