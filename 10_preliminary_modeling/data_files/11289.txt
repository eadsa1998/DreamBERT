I was in front of a large colonial mansion type home. It was raining very hard. I was intensely thirsty, and I stood there with a small kettle trying to catch enough water for a drink. Just as I was lifting the receptacle to my lips to drain it, someone ran up to me, struck my arm, and knocked the receptacle to the ground. This person (not clearly defined) said that the water was contaminated and impure. I laughed and remarked that rain water is pure, but the person called my attention to the fact that all the water which I had collected came down a drain from the roof and had run over the dirty downspouts.
