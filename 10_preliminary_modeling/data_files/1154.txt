I am at the beach with my girls. They are distant form me. I see Ellie has on revealing clothes. I call to her to get her to change. She ignores me. Paulina refuses to cooperate and help clean a room. I'm picking up rocks, crystals, and gold and eating some of the gold ones. A plane (bi-plane WWI) flies over, very low, and does barnstorming tricks. It dives very low and then at the last second, it pulls up and narrowly misses the trees. On the second try, it can't go high enough fast enough. I have been enjoying watching but I knew he'd not make it that time. He was too daring. He flew the plane into the ocean, he keeps going even though he's under water. I want to see; I am thrilled and fascinated. I get in my van ( and I'm in my wheelchair), and drive to a little beach to see him. A man says I can't see him there. I'm a tourist. A woman in a wheelchair sits at my left. She thinks I'm part of the "family" and she says she's part of the "Jan" set. The man goes to her and is suspicious. He says he didn't recognize her in the chair. I go on my way, walking. I wonder if they're surprised that I walk. I go to class. It's on the beach at sunrise. I watch a class start in the ocean but it's too cold for them. I think it's funny. I think my teacher is egocentric and has an elevated opinion of himself. I see a list of books on classes. I'm not sure what class I'm in but I get impatient for it to start. I say, "When does class start?" I wake up with the phrase "Summer school is about to begin!"
