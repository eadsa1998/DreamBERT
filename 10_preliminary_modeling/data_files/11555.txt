Was courting an exgirlfriend (23) but the time seemed at that time. I popped the question to her one night and we got married the next week, no pomp, no big ceremony. But here is where her father stepped into the picture. He declared the marriage null and void and through connections, got the marriage annulled. I was amazed at the simplicity of all the procedure and I was relieved that this was so. I was confronted by friends later and they could hardly believe it had happened. Yet I seemed unconcerned and rather relieved that obligations had been severed. The dream faded at that point.
