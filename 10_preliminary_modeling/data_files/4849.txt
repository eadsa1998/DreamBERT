["Boxing the invisible ghost."] I sense an old ghost in a room. It pushes down a green cat figurine off a shelf and it breaks. I get angry and tell him not to do that again. He comes at me and I begin to box with him, punching him out. It I realize, looks strange to others as the ghost is invisible. I feel good that I knocked him about so well.
