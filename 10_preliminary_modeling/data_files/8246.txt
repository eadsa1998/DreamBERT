I was working at a function for separated and divorced people. It was some kind of a dance. It seems that there may be several activities going on at once and I was working at the entrance to the dance hall. Later I was in a different part of the building. A couple of people got up to leave an activity and somebody else that was working there asked them why they were leaving. They said because it was time to dance. It was 9:00. So they wanted to be there as soon as the dance started. I was thinking something about them acting just like they would if it were a high school dance. I was also eating chocolate cake. It was almost like it was packaged - kind of like Hostess cupcakes would be packaged. And the shape was more like that of a Suzie-Q. Those things are so messy to eat as this was. I was getting crumbs all over. Raina D was in the dream towards the end. Her, me and someone else were sitting and talking. She asked us if we had fun.
