 I'm in a room with Stephen Ramos. We're playing a slot machine and it's on a television, like a Nintendo is hooked up or something. We win a little bit, and Jake goes out of the room. I spin again. All the spaces are filled up with red and blue X's. The machine starts making payout noises. I win a lot of coins. The total is $28,000. We also have the $1,000 that Stephen and I won earlier. Stephen comes back, and so does another woman. I tell them nonchalantly that we won $28,000. It's no big deal for me.
