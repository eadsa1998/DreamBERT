A woman, unknown to me, wants to get married in the Congregational Church in order to give her small son, age 2-4, a home. He is considered a brat, but I take pity on her and say I will marry her! Frank does not approve, but is willing to go along. I ask someone to try on a ring size and it fits me -- shift: a carnival with many balloons and I see a trap door in the ceiling through which people some down making somesaults... then I suddenly "come to myself" and realize that I am Greek Orthodox and therefore cannot get married in the Congregational Church. So I go back and tell them "NO I can't go through with it." The minister who has appeared, then tears up the certificate and she cries a bit but I am very relieved.
