I was in London and my flight was tonight. I was at the airport but hadn't checked in yet. I couldn't remember what time my flight was and I thought maybe 9.30pm or 11.30pm. I had almost 20 jobs for the next week and also realized I wouldn't be back for Good Advice. It was nearly 9.30 and I'd lost track of time so I tried to check the flight time as I ran through the airport. I was trying to check in online as well but I was having trouble finding the page. I ran past a plane about to close and somehow realised it was mine and I said 'please wait 10 mins' and the lady said 'you have 15 mins until we close the doors'. I ran to front of airport to check in but knew I wouldn't make it in time.
