I see Father Andrew after the Church service, very tired looking, carrying a heavy bucket with ashes going down to the basement. I offer to help him and carry them down. Later I help him in the library upstairs. While Frank plays with the children, Father Andrew changed into a black tunic. Very friendly. We walk arm in arm down the corridor.
