I am at a party and want to go with some guy I know. The party is at my house. I am going to wear a certain blue dress. I am going to go but my husband comes home. I clean up from the party and am washing clothes and hanging them on the line when the guy comes back. I shake my head no. (He is driving a pickup truck). My husband says he sees the guy go around the block in the truck and is suspicious. I don't see the guy in the pickup again and continue washing clothes and I think it would be a better idea to wash clothes at night and hang them so they will be dry in the morning. It is summer in the dream and I do not know who the guy in the pickup is.
