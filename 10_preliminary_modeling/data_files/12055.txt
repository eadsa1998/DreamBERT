I was at school and I was getting changed in the toilet. I put pants on top of my pants. There were chocolates -- Bounty, Snickers and some made-up one called Floaters. They were all wet. I got Dad to write me a note for sport. I bought The Game of Life at this shop. I couldn't open it until I was out of the shop. Nana had cows.
