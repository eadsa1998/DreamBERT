 I walk into a room where my mom is with our family friend Helen Lorenz, one of the Lorenz girls, and an infant baby daughter of the Lorenz family are. My mom is holding the baby. The baby is then four of five years old. She sprays me in the face with something that causes me to see all red or all black. I can't see well at all, and this fades when go away from there.
