I was playing Super Mario. There were new levels and places in the game before that went nowhere that did now. This programmer guy had programmed Mario's fingers to climb up this tower in a certain way because that's what he did when he 'kissed a cute girl'. There was a place with lava monsters. Some guy who helped make Sims 3 had added a train in it after some guy gave him a map, which had like Australia on top of Canada and everything was all close together. It took 37 seconds to travel around the whole thing. I was then at a shop and there was a huge row of computers. They had Sims 3 on them and there were a lot of computers (thousands). Mine was the second computer. I hadn't been there for ages and there were lots more people. Thuy had the first computer. My Sim was called Ruby Harper. Thuy's was called Cane Nathan (first name and second name, can't remember the last name). The guys next to me were Arab and wanted me to swap seats with some guy to make it less squishy. Thuy said "I want to sit next to one person!" and laughed.
