 I'm in a group of people, including Blinky Ahmed, Gino Teavor, Mike Brimms, Melissa Cod, and Sarah Person, all of whom I know from high school. The older people are getting the younger ones to sign up for some sort of recycling drive. We are in or around Carter School. There are Asian, black, and white people. We're sitting in a circle or a triangle. It is organized, a group effort. A deep voice, which may be my neighbor Mr. Dinks , is singing. The words include, "You've got to...beg...follow...through the night."
