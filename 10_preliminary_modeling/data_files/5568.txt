[1997-05-21] I was at work and I have a ball that looks like Betty's Lacrosse ball and I have a whole lot of string and for some reason, it was like a game and we were walking along from the third floor down to the basement but I was making this string, this ball of yarn, that I had on my fingers, unroll as I walked down and I wanted to see how far it went and then I was going to try to roll it back up, but in the middle somehow, I lost the ball, I lost the end of the string and I thought, "I wont be able to play, everybody else is playing and they had their own, but then B, my driver, came and he said "oh no, here's your ball and here's the end of your string and you can start back up again and real it back up like, you have to follow it back up." So B made everything good so that I could still be in the game.
