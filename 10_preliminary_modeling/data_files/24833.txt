I was at Great America and I was on the Drop Zone and the breaks failed. We all went into the ground. I separated from my body and watched myself get taken to the hospital. I woke up with a headache and was wondering where my room went. My cat baked cookies for me. They had pot in them so I got high. The nurse found me stoned, wandering around the kitchen eating kumquats. Setting: Great America, a hospital, and my kitchen. Characters: Nurse: she is my brother's first girlfriend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, worried. I was kind of in control so I really liked it.
