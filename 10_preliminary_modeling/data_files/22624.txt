This time I am sure that I dreamt, and quite a bit, but I am not sure what it was about. I had put on some sports clothes and a shoulder bag, which in real life I had seen on a friend of mine. It was a big purse, with fringes, made out of brown suede, and with a big and sporty handle. I remember the purse perfectly, but nothing else.
