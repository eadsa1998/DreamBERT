I was traveling with Mccinnis. We were in PA somewhere. We went in to eat and Mccinnis moved twice with his plate, then walked out without paying. He had his sweater on, then came in all dressed in a suit. I walked out with a gang going out without paying. I went out, then seemed to be a fugitive. A fellow tried to catch me, but I flew up into the air and got away. I was near a high stairway and jumped, then glided down and got away from another man. I walked thru a big furniture store. They tried to sell me furniture. Then one man brought out a tray of diamond rings. I had two on my hand. I said I would be in Thursday, so they let me out.
