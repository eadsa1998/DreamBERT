We were shopping for a tricycle for Judy. She was riding one in the store and I said it was too small. She was standing and riding it. I heard a lady say they were at the track and couldn't pick a winner because it was a nice sunny day. She liked it when it was a sloppy day. I seemed to have not a winner yesterday.
