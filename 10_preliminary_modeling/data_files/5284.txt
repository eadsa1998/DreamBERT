I dreamed that we had a holiday, so everyone was in the main building. It was really boring, however, and no one was doing anything. Everyone, including the boys, was wearing pants and a bra. It was weird. So then Kim and Sue went to Sue's house. I remember seeing Kevin and Nicholas and Hannah in Bundy. A girl on the first floor was trying to go to sleep and told me to go to bed too. But I couldn't think about sleep. But then when I concentrated really hard, it sort of worked. Then I was talking online and Sue and Kim were soaked because it was raining. I was asking Aidan if I could sleep in his room, since I couldn't here. He laughed and said yes. Then I woke up.
