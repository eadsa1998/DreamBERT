I am at work and this fat cook is pissed off at me. He says that I broke his Rolex watch with a hockey stick, but I have no recollection of even having a hockey stick or ever breaking any watch. We are speaking in a foreign language and I am able to communicate with him and I tell him hat I did not break his watch. He is not satisfied and I realize that talking to him (rationalizing the situation) is not going to work. Instead I go out to my car and grab about a gram of pot. I go back inside and give the buds to the cook. He is obviously stoked and this ends the argument as fast as it started. Now he is stoked on me and I feel like we are friends.
