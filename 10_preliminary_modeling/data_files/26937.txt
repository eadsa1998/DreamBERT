 I'm attending an Armstrong boys basketball game. I enter the gymnasium and shake my old coach Jackson Shooter's hand. I'm with my dad. We go to sit in the stands. There is a paper or book where I see that this year's team has a 6-1 record in conference play, which is really good! Also, the paper notes the record of my class in 1995 being 9-0 in conference play.
