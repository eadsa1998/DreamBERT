I was at 'home'. It was around 9pm and it was creepy and I was worried that someone was going to come in. I was sitting on a lounge watching TV and I called Mom. I told her I was feeling nervous and she asked if I wanted to go back to her place and I said that Dad was going to be home soon. Then the front door opened and was banging.
