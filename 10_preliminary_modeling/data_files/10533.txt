Swimming in a pool; I see a woman whom I recognize as my doctor, but she doesn't recognize me in my bathing suit, even when she comes up to me to ask me what time it is. She is think with brown hair, looks like Joan Calott from church. Vivid part, remembered after bath: Frank is holding Willie as a baby and he is watching the news when the baby cries, and he throws it to his right and the baby hits the window with a loud bang. but the window does not break. The baby cries loudly and I hug him and comfort him and am very angry at Frank for perhaps causing permanent damage to the baby.
