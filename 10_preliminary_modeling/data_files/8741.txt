Bill C told me he had enough of his bad marriage. He was taking steps to end the marriage so he could be with me. He was already taking steps to do things specifically for me. He talked about where we might live. I was wondering if we might find some happy medium between his current lifestyle and my current lifestyle. I thought that was probably one of the reasons he was unhappy in his marriage, the financial pressures he lives with trying to keep Jane C happy. He told me he was going to buy me a new car, one that had no previous owner. He was talking about a BMW, but I wasn't sure if I wanted to own a foreign car. I was thinking about the mental debate I have had in the past about such a purchase. Buying a foreign car supports people who may not make much or may not have a job at all if not for those car factories. On the other hand, some believe it takes jobs and money from the American economy. More importantly, I wasn't sure about having that kind of a relationship with him. He seemed to want to get married right away and I certainly didn't want to do that. At the most I would be willing to live together for a while until we figure out if marriage is really a good idea. I also wasn't sure how I felt about marrying someone who had been married twice before.
