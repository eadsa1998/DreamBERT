I was at school and I was going to form. To get to mine you had to walk through this glass. Eugene was in my form. He got to the other side of the glass. His group didn't know how to get through. I said "just walk through to the magic land" and Eugene said the same thing and laughed. Some game for the DS was shown on this computer screen. I was making an account. I made my username FancyFire. Elijah was waiting. There was a quiz to see how gay you were. There was a cave in the game and it would open at 5:30-6:30pm for contact. These animals on the walls of the cave would come to life.
