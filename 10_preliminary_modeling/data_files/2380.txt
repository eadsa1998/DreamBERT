The wife sees me and begs me to get caught again for her husband's sake and I refuse and run. I see the man and remember that I could call the police. I dial 911, shaking in fear. I say, "Help, this man will hurt me." The police at first refuse to help, pointing out to me that he's my father. I say firmly, "You will help me anyway. He hurts me." They agree and take him away.
