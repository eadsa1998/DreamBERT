 There is an empty brick enclosure with no top. Inside it is a fierce fire-breathing dragon. It kills everything. It is total destruction. There is a window or opening in the walls. There is one man outside the enclosure with a radio, monitoring the dragon. Then the dragon goes over to the wall where the window is and smashes the wall with his tail. The walls all start to crumble. As they do, the falling bricks from the collapsing walls form an igloo. The man outside is now a little dragon, and he escapes through the igloo.
