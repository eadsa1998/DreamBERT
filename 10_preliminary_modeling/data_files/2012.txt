I'm on a stage in a play. I do a bit and the audience applauds. I go off stage and change into my "Beaula" costume. I put white, drippy paint on my hair and beads that clatter down the center of my head and down the back of my head. Co-worker Juliet is there. I want to do a good "Beaula" for her. I think she's lesbian. I go on stage and the audience roars with laughter. I love it. Three other characters are on stage talking about my character. One man is homosexual and makes a joke. Someone asks if he does OK with his girls. He smiles and says, "Oh yes, I do well enough with 'my girls.'" It means he's got a double meaning there. I come back on stage and do this great wheelchair dance, first in duo with someone in a manual and then a wheelie popping solo. The audience loves it and applauds. Then I go for an encore bow with a Rose (a commercial product) and the audience is nonresponsive. I walk out on a stairway that is closed. The audience is blocked to me by a wall and I know they are there but I can't see them. I work hard to get them to respond. They finally do.
