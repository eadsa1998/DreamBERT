["An Angel intercedes and lovers meet."] Steve Martin is walking down a path. He is going to the military complex. A narrator is talking about how a path is taken or not taken and life changing effects take place. I see an angel, I recognize as a comedian but his face looks like Odo's of Deep Space Nine. He flies right at the oblivious Steve Martin which deflects him from his path to a side path that goes past a small university. There is snow on the ground. As he walks up the path, a woman walks toward him and as they are passing she says to him, I am a student nurse. Can I practice on you? Do you have a sprained ankle? Next, he is lying on the ground in some sort of metal casing around his chest and she is taking tests. She says she will bring him the results tomorrow. She leaves but Steve wants to see her again, as love is developing. So he follows her and finds a huge military room where troops are resting. She is seated with one of the troops. He wants to be alone with her, so he fakes a huge voice calling out orders for a parade practice. The troops groan, as they are tired, but they get up and in groups come marching past Steve waving their huge platoon placards. Each one is a shape of a mascot animal. Nearly all of them are out and Steve is wearing an odd parachute with hoses like tenticals all around himself and he is sneaking up to kiss the woman when the woman's father comes in. He is a high ranking official and demands to know what is going on. Steve tries to hide himself in a sort of rubber raft kind of thing, covering himself with those hoses and stuff. I am now looking out from that space as the officer searches all around me.
