A young man brings us a flyer for a sculpture show opening--it is very cold outside - below zero; He starts walking with his little red wagon filled with flyers; I too am going somewhere, but it is too cold to walk, so I decide to take the car. I tell him I will give him a ride, but first we come into the house where a party is going on; I see Willie relaxed, leaning backward, with others talking. Ronald Sholes, Frank and others are there; the couch has been moved forward and the house looks different. I leave with the young man. plus feeling.
