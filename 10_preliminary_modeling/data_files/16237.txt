Dad and I were Bringing Music for some reason and we were walking around and actually, I was there by myself at first, and I was going towards the back. And they said, "Is there anybody here to accompany you?" because I still looked like a little kid running around. And I said, "They'll be here shortly." And we were working and then I found Dad in the back somewhere and we were looking around, and we came to the back where this, it was kind of in this little booth on this little platform, but we were sitting at the edge of it. This lady had a cello and she was showing it to us. And I can't remember why, but something came up about a G, and I was, I immediately sang a G, thinking that I knew it, and I was like, "This is a G; let's see if I'm right." And then she played a G on her cello and it was like two or three steps below, and she was, "Sorry, but you weren't right." And I was like, "Well, I guess I wasn't." And I can't remember anything more. I wish I could though.
