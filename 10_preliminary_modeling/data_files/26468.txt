 I'm with my cousin Grace Redding and another person, who may be one of her siblings. We're driving near what seems to be Wilmerton University. I see a wallaby and some kangaroos, and excitedly point them out. It is dusk. I see and point out other animals, including a gorilla. I have a drawing of a gorilla in my stack of drawings, which I flip through. I'm in an elevator with Grace. We seem to be on a floor where there is a bad man who wants to capture Grace. He thinks that I'm on his side: that since I'm with Grace that I've captured her. He asks me if I want to bring her back and take care of her, or if he should. I tell him I will, knowing that he has no idea I've duped him and have no intentions of capturing her. I try to catch the man off guard and kick him, to injure, kill, or disable him. My kick is short, and I try to change it into a smoother, more controlled motion so he'll think I'm just joking. I then attack him with all my strength. He has a can of some spray that does serious damage to a person, and a gun. I flight with him, avoiding the spray and kicking the gun out of his hand. Then I'm in an elevator as it closes. This is a terrible position to be in because Grace is outside with the man. He knows I'm in the elevator, and can corner me when I try to get out. There is a big tent in a white bag in the elevator. I dump it out and grab a long aluminum tent pole, which is bent, to use as a weapon. I emerge from the elevator on the same floor as the man, and he attacks. I fight him off. I'm fighting my classmate at Brimson, Arnold, and another short, thin blond haired man. I smash their heads together and smash them on the marble floor of what seems to be a church.
