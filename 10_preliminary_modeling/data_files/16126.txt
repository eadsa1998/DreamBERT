We were in the hotel that was being evacuated, being moved out, and we had a room on the second floor. And Dad was off doing something, and Mom and I -- I'm cold, hold on. It's October the 28th and winter's setting in. Okay, but anyway, Dad was off doing something and it was Mom and I, and we were coming down in an orderly fashion out of the hotel and standing in the parking lot without a bag or anything. And we saw a separate building with an elevator in it next door, and we thought about going up the elevator to get all the way to the top, to the sixth floor, but we never did. And oh yeah, now the first dream came to me all of a sudden. I dreamt that we were coming home in Melinda's Mustang, her and I, and I was sitting in the back with my book bag because on the bus I sit right behind the driver, so I sat with my book bag in the back. And I don't remember her having the sound system or anything on, but she said she wanted me to sit in the back because I was so heavy. I don't remember; I'm sure there was more to it, but I can't remember. [laugh]
