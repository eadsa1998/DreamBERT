I was sitting at a table in a food court with Malika.  One of her children was with her.  She said, "You know we never did anything together after our class was over."  I was taken by surprise and kind of stammered, "Well...we could have lunch together...or see a movie."  So apparently that was the plan for that day.  Then I ran into a Korean-American woman I know on the street outside.  I wanted to invite her too, but didn't know how Malika would feel about that.  We actually ended up going to a "tai qi" movie with several other classmates.  Several of them wanted to go to a vendor next to the theater to get something to eat, but it was time for the movie to start, and there was still a long line, so I went and got in line.  Nevertheless, when I got in the theater, somehow, the students were all there, though it was so dark I couldn't see them clearly, and I hoped that someone would see me and wave.  I found my Korean-American friend, but a friend of hers was sitting next to her.  I didn't see Malika.  Later, someone said that the friend had just left her seat temporarily to come and talk to her for a minute.  I felt badly for not keeping my promise to Malika.
