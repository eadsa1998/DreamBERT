At the beach like Cherry Grove, but up north. Stephen was trying to get in and I was trying not to listen. He followed me into a department store and made crazy accusations. I went to look at little girls bathing suits. He followed me. His voice was going on and on and I couldn't hit stop so I started humming to cover it up in my head. William was there and we were reminiscing about Ackerman. He wasn't here anymore. We gently dropped his photographs (one each) in the ocean and watched the waves take them away.
