I dreamed that I was touring Ed for accepted students day, but he already went here. Also we were in English class, but it wasn't my English class. Then Gianna and I were working out, but I had practice. I couldn't find any of my stuff. Pauline tried to help me, but I had 4 bags and couldn't carry them all. I felt so ridiculous. Then I woke up.
