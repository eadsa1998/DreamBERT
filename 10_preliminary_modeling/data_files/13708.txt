Eugene was telling me about some speech he was doing. I was at Nana's. Then I was at 'school' and Mr Reilly was early and it had something to do with his wife. Then we were at this place and something had fallen into this water in front of this restaurant (it was like a long, square shaped pool, but it had a bridge over it and you didn't swim in it). Then Mr Reilly or I jumped in to get it. Some people helped us. It had something to do with his wife again.
