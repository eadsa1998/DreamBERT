There were two humans, a man and a woman, who were dressed like cavemen. The were running down a very steep ridge with pink fire coming out of their mouths, eyes, and hands. Then two aliens came along dressed in long robes and pointy hats. The took the power from the humans, and were soon spitting fire too. They were also male and female, though I saw the female most. Then two different humans came along who seemed to be Adam and Eve. Then the two aliens started acting like God and his wife to the humans. All I remember for the rest of the night is being in a big room with all my classmates, male and female, having a slumber party. Setting: First next to a steep ridge in a forest, then in a big room with sleeping bags all over. Characters: First the two humans and the aliens, and then Adam and Eve. I was also with all my classmates. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I was first scared because the aliens were manipulating Adam &amp; Eve. I was happy at the party because I was having fun.
