Michael (The Office) was dating people in the office and when they would break up, he would mark them as 'having bad relations' and could make them do something so he could go up a level, which gave him a lot of benefits. Jim and Dwight were outside and Jim played a joke on him, sending him around with 'threats'. There was a playground. Creed was standing around and Dwight warned Jim about something he was getting worried about.
