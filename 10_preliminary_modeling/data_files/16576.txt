I was back in the Media Lab at Modern Media College and I was taking my test out, just like I did the day before, except there was this man there that was like a cross between Stuart and Alec. He was like the course director who was giving the lab test, instead of the lab guys. And what we had to do for test, instead of being able to navigate through the software and know what to do to make what goes ding-a-ling or whatever, we had to actually, we had to play competently into the sequencer and make a coherent musical sequence and know what notes were and stuff. And if you couldn't do that, then our test was like "pffffffff." And around -- this room was like really big, there were like forty lab stations in it, and it looked different than the one that we have. Instead of being kind of angled back like ours is, this one was straight up, like everything was pretty much straight on top of each other, and the monitor was like, the base of it was at my forehead level. And so I sat down and I started doing what I could do, and I couldn't get any notes to come out of the thing. It was like it was some kind of synthesizer was on this patch that had like crazy sound effect noises like police sirens and frizzy "aaaaash" sounds and trash cans opening and dumb things like that. And around me taking the test were little kids, like 5 and 6-year-olds and they knew what they were doing right away and everything. And they seemed to really enjoy it. And I think there was something else in this dream that touched a chord with me, but I don't remember what it was now. That's kind of a bummer.
