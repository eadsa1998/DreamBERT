I am playing basketball in a gym.  The basket I want to shoot at is loose from the rim on one side.  I can barely reach it by standing on my tiptoes, and I am not able to reattach the clip that holds it to the rim, so I get a stepladder.  Then there are a couple of other guys-kids, really, at that same level, and two of them jump to the floor from the top of the stepladder.  It frightens me, because I thought they will hurt themselves, but they don't.
