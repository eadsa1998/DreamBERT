I am watching a spooky movie and there is a scary man at the "Holaway Hotel" . I leave to go home and get caught in a snowstorm and when I can't go any further, which seems to be near the Central School, the grade school in my hometown, I get out and find myself at the "Holaway Hotel". I am asking a man who he is and then I wake up.
