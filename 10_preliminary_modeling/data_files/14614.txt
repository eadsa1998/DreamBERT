I was talking to some girl about music and movies (etc). They mentioned a song by someone and they pointed to a picture of them, but then it was weird they like, kissed me, but it was the picture. I was like 'what the hell?!'. The picture was of Sam Rockwell. They said to check out a song called "Touch Light" or something. I said "I like him as an actor, so I'll check it out".
