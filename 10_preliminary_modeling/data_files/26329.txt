 I'm with my housemate Norman Noman, his girlfriend Sunny Pile, and my dad. We seem to be near Golden Acres or Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley. My dad gives us four of five pages of white paper to write on for a half hour while he is gone. I'm excited to do this. Norman has taken a lot of coins from my green ceramic change jar to buy alcohol. Something happens with Sunny and her friend. I may do something with them. I don't use the time for writing, but I have a good time.
