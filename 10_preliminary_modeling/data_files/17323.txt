We were in a room with my father's coworker Cary and his wife, who looked like my badminton coach's wife.  She looked pretty clueless.  We were confined to the one room.  We were up against two other families/opponent teams.  We were trying to hinder them and strategize our own way out.  Something happened- like a meal called, and we were 'moving out'.  We zigzagged on the road to avoid possible hidden thumbtacks, and moved gingerly over and around concrete barricades.  We had trouble, almost going over the edge of a bridge.  We pushed the Volvo to the side of freedom.  It had six wheels- several flat, but we were still going to try and make it.  The stakes were high- not just a game, but an escape.
