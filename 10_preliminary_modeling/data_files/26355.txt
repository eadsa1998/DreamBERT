 I'm at home at a birthday party for myself and two other people. I go outside where other people are. I'm really looking to see if my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there. I don't see her. I participate in the party, and am served cake. Then I see Annie. She is with several other people in the front driveway on the north side of the lilac bushes. She's wearing a swimsuit, and may have dark hair. She and the others, who are both men and women, seem to be sun tanning. She doesn't speak to me or give me more than a nonchalant glance: she snubs me. I don't approach her.
