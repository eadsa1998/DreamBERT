My dream began when my friend Pam called because she needed a ride to the store. I went to pick her up even though she has a car. (In my dream she didn't have one.) We were on our way into the store and we had to stop at the ATM. When we were standing there the person in front of us was having problems. When he left the money slot had money sticking out of it. So, we started taking the money out. It kept coming. We got about $175. Then we left. She was on her bike and I followed her. We were behind a building counting the money, but one of the tellers from the bank caught us. She took the money back. She said she needed it, and then my dream ended.
