I was on a bike near a small concrete bridge. Someone else was with me. It might have been my fiancee, but I cannot be sure. A group of bicycle riders went past me. I got on my bike and began riding at the end of the group. We rode across the bridge and up a narrow path which wound around a small conical shaped mountain. As we rode I noticed the water which had been in the river was rising upward as we rose higher and had changed into an ocean surrounding the mountain or pinnacle. No fears or emotions seemed to accompany this strange phenomena.
