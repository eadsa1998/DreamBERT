I'm with my friend Ron and a couple of others - one is a contact of Ron's, and another is a friend of his, who is russian or from some eastern block country. This man is introduced as a fairly important politician or businessman in his country. I'm given the impression that he is a 'good guy' who is fighting for survival in a corrupt country. Apparently he has been left bankrupt by his government and has fled to Britain to recoup.  Ron's contact has pledged to invest some money in this russian guy. The russian guy is approaching me for the rest - a substantial amount like $30,000. I couldn't afford to give a stranger anything like this amount of money, however I'm charmed into thinking it would be the right thing to do to invest in him. The contact is talking him up as a good person to invest in. Ron stays out of it and remains neutral. We are having a meeting in a late-night bar which is almost empty. The streets are dark outside. The men turn up the pressure to get my money. I falter. He says he'd pay me back and has to go suddenly. I come to my senses when I realize I'm not investing - just lending. Later, I go outside to get by bike, which I had locked up. But some young guys in hoods have taken the wheel off and locked both parts with their own locks. They are still hanging around, so I confront them, with Ron behind me. I try to verbally threaten them but they are not intimidated and just laugh and start to walk away. One of them tries to get into a cab. I pull him back and fight them to the ground one by one. I get the guy who has the key to his locks and squeeze his thrombi until he submits and releases his grip on the key. I return to my bike, unlock it, put it back together and head off down the street with Ron. After a few streets we stop so Ron can call his sister from a phonebook, to ask her to pick us up. Sudden;y some more hoodlums appear from the shadows and try to take my mike. I have to confront them too...
