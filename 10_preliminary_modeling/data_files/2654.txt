I am visiting a family. I like the father. I have a room of my own. Others share rooms. I go into the bathroom and pee on the floor next to the toilet. It keeps coming out and a huge puddle builds. Then I see a bedpan thing and sit on it to have a bowel movement. Then I rinse it into the toilet and use lots of paper towels to clean up the urine on the floor. A lot of unnecessary work! Now I go out to see the family. Lots of Mexican relatives come by to visit. I am a guest of honor. One man is dressed up in drag. I tease him about his "lovely" makeup and wig. The father gives me copies of all the snapshots we'd taken with the family. I move in some of them. One, I run up to join everyone and my skirts are too high and I pull them down and then I'm out of focus. Another one I'm in a group in the back, seated in my wheelchair. The photos are all on a huge piece of paper with dotted lines all around them, so you can undo them and separate them. There is also a box of papers and things. I peek in and decide to deal with it later. The father stands beside me and we put our arms around each other's waist as we stand side by side. I feel unsure if this is a proper thing to do. We release and go on. I see a baby boy playing in the tank top of the toilet and I am concerned he can't breathe. I go look and see he's all tangled up in the wires. I grab his feet and try to pull him out. I know I'm hurting him.
