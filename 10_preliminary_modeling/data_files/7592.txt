I was over at this house and it looked like Mary B's house, only you and K. were living there. That is, you were the people there, yet it was their house. They have a real big house. I was sitting in the middle and you and K. were beside me. We were all in rocking chairs, but then you and K. faded and it was Mary and A. And I was over there, I think, for lunch and their grandmother came into the room and said, "Here, I would like to give you this." In my right hand I had a stylus and just before she gave me these things, it changed into a cigarette, and I had an ashtray in my hand too. I had to lay them down to receive these things. In my left hand she gave me the most gorgeous orchid I have ever seen. It was mounted on a great big, huge cellophane thing like a doily; it had a twisted stem and the top was all fluted, and placed in the center of this was this big orchid. In my right hand she gave me a thing like a floor lamp, only there was no base, but it had the pole, and underneath the shade instead of a lamp bulb, it was all flowers. I smelled both of these and I was very disappointed because they didn't smell (of course, orchids don't). And then I got ready to leave. I was going to some house on Melbourne. I started out by myself and I was going down the street carrying both of these, the orchid in my left hand and the thing in my right hand. The sidewalk was very rough. I didn't know quite where the house was, and I was kind of concerned about it. I came to Phillips and stopped to wait for the cars to stop. All of a sudden, Carol said, "Oh, here you are. I have been waiting for you." And I said, "I was going to your house." And she said, "Well, good. I had to take some things to the laundry and I am going back now, so we will go together." And I said, "Well, good." So we went back together.
