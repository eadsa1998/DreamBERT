 My friend Tim Zelling and I are talking on the phone. I called him. He tells me the dates of their Big Resort Area trip. They are leaving Thursday or Friday and staying for three days. The dates work well for me. I ask who is going. He isn't sure. Our friend Hank Anderson is doubtful to go. I say I am going. The total number comes to 10 people, if everyone goes.
