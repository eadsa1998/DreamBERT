I am walking down a sidewalk. I am looking down the street to see if there is a grocery store down that way. I think maybe there is one, even though that direction is toward the fancy government and museum buildings. A man calls out to me to come on down that way. I abruptly turn and walk the opposite way. They laugh at me for being afraid. I think they are ruffians who will lure me there and hurt me. Now I am walking toward a theater building. Really good performers that I respect are there. They want me to join them. I struggle up a steep ramp to get to the top of the roof of the building. Sparky and others are there and want me to act in this Shakespearean play. And also direct them in it. I agree to do so. But now I am naked and crawling on my belly because I am paralyzed from the waist down. There are two people in wheelchairs that are acting in this play. I am proud of that (one of them is me.) But I am embarrassed to find myself naked and crawling on the ground as I go about my duties of creating an excellent play.
