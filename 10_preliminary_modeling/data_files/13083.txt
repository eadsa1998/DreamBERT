I was in the UK on an oval. I was saying how awesome it was. I was sometimes in Year 12, but mostly it was this year. I went to this school for a day and I had to wear a skirt. I had sport there one day and Evelyn was there and this red-haired girl with freckles. Later, I was talking to Silas and he wrote some stuff down. One was that "Dmitri had a crush on you from 1999-1966" because he saw me making azaleas. He looked at what he wrote and was confused and then he crossed the reason out and changed the date to 2006-2007. I was thinking 'No way!'. I found a book of mine and it had lots of my stuff in it and I had done an assignment on Loren Dean and I got excited. Silas had done an assignment on Dylan Moran. Later, I was talking to Eugene. We were going out and he didn't want me to move to England. I was friends with the whole cast of some show. Paul Whitehouse was there, so I'm presuming it was The Fast Show. This car was 'on fire' for some effects thing.
