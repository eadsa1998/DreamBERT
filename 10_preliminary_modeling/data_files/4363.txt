["Dwight overworked."] I am cleaning up stuff, organizing the outside of my house. There is a large pile of firewood in the front of this house. I decide to ask Dwight to help me move the firewood to the side or back of the house. I also want to buy some steel pipes and have Dwight stack them as well. Dwight complains to me that I am expecting him to work and do these things for me without even asking. He feels used. I had never even thought of that as a problem.
