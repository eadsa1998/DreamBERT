I was on the street and the wind started to blow very hard. I hid behind some store buildings and it seemed as though it was going to blow the windows thru. Then I went on the corner of one building and looked down a side street and there about 500 ft. away I saw the cone of a tornado moving across the street, touching it like a giant elephant trunk. I was riding by one of my daughter's who was holding a baby boy in her arms. I passed. I yelled, "Hello there, you little redhead."
