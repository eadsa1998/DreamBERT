The nurse said she likes to walk around - the campus alone at night - I thought "she wants a man, but that's not the best way" - She said she got $65. a month - and as for that being enough, she said, "I may do it." I jokingly said, "You may, but can you?" No one laughed. (Pardon me - I don't know where the audience came from either). Instead of laughing, my roommate said "You have no appreciation of other people's problems." I didn't answer, but instead explained the joke to P. who was kind and encouraging.
