I was on a country road and I was worried about my father seeing my tattoos and bellyring. Although part of me wanted him to see it and I was wearing a shirt that didn't conceal either. I was walking down a long country dirt road. It had many rocks. Someone was threatening to let Ringo (my cat) out of a window and I was really worried that he may get run over.
