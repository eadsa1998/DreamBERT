I am driving the wrong way, against traffic. I see four lanes of busy traffic coming at me and dodge the cars crossing the lanes to get to the right side of the road. Then I am angry at Ellie because she has decided to move out of my house and I don't think she's ready yet. I tell her that she should wait until she's got her full head up out of the "waves," not just her eyes, meaning she takes too much risk and needs to slow down and take care of herself.
