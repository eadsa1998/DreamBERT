Driving to mountains with Edward; we go ahead while mother-in-law and my father follow. Father is in a hearse, dragged along the ground by a truck. He said he liked it that way. W. and I have a regal meal but W. forgets to give some to father. I insist even though I realize that he really is dead already. (Reality: he died 1949). Shift: I meet K. (old lover); we drive together and then walk down the mountain. We find a spot that was 'only waiting to be painted by Cezanne (very vivid impression). It is a Doge-like palace in yellow and greens in Cezanne's style. A house by the sea. K. and I swim in this warm water standing on a sand bar and gradually pushes us back against the house; also see my brother somewhere in the background of the house. Shift: I invite K. to stay at our place in L. City telling him that no one will be there, but when we arrive Mrs. L. (our renter) is asleep and father is in my brother's bedroom. Therefore K. is 'forced' to stay with me in my bed. Remember only a few kisses. In the morning father worrying about Mrs. L.'s political views.
