I was at school and I had a car. Calvin was around. I was then at home and the people from across the road and Classmate-M-23 were outside the front door, playing. I kept telling them to go away, but they didn't. I went out and kicked one of them in the balls. I did it again to another person too. I came out later, and the guys mother and father came in a Toyota. The mother was telling me off and I was yelling back. The father came inside looking for something. I asked who she was and I realized he was going to steal stuff, so I put him outside. The LAN cord wasn't connected.
