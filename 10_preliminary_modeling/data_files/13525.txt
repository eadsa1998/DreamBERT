I was at Nana's. There were kids there and they kept jumping on me and following me around. I was there with this guy called Adam (who I think was my boyfriend) and he was Kiefer Sutherland's son. He didn't look anything like him and had black hair. I was playing some game which was Mario like. I was swimming through water and there were lava and normal platforms. The water started falling and I had to jump from platform to platform.
