I dreamed that I was transferring from B.W. to some school n New York City. It was a one-building school and had no dormitories, so I didn't know where I was going to sleep as I didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel. There was another girl with me, but I don't know who she was. Somehow there was a huge grocery store in the school and I was going around picking out food that would last a long time so I wouldn't starve. The superintendent was following me around giving me all sorts of tests for entrance to the school. Suddenly I decided not to go there and I found myself in the little town I used to live in in New York State enrolling in some kind of a college that was connected with the high school. They also gave me a lot of tests and I wrote down the subjects that I wanted to take. I said that I wanted one of my Medina, Ohio high school teachers to teach me all the subjects. The rest of the dream is hazy.
