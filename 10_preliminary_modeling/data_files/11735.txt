Me, Ramona, Tiana and some other people were at a toy shop. I went to the back aisle and Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street) was there. I was teasing him and I did three times, then he tried to shoot me with lasers from his eyes. I ran out with Ramona and the rest following. I got out and Terrence got a hose ready and Freddy was still inside trying to shoot me. I got sick of dodging the lasers, so I screamed out in pain, and he stopped, thinking I was dead. Terrence got the hose on him and he melted, which I thought was strange since his weakness is fire.
