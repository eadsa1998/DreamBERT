 I am camping. My friend from grade school Jerry Kasper is there. My friend from Brimson Jill Banks is there. The campsite is really nice, and is on a big trail. There are four moose in a lake that we see in the distance. I have been waiting to see moose; I want to get a photograph. We hurry down to the lake in some kind of vehicle. Jerry throws me my camera. When we get there, the moose are gone.
