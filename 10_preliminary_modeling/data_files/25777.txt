 I'm fishing at Carter School. My old classmate Gino Teavor and others are playing a World Series baseball game. When there is a break in the game the team goes off the field, by me. Gino thanks me for coming to the game. I catch a nice three-pound smallmouth bass in a lily pad pond on a jitterbug. I get my rod, tackle box, fish on a stringer, and leave. I go on a red bicycle. I had a pile of stuff, including a pair of new hiking boots that I haven't worn yet. My schoolmate Laurel Kipp and a girl are talking about their mothers, who are there. They are saying how they are like their mothers. My brother Wally is there. I fish in a tiny pond. A bass follows my lure. It inhales my lure, and I jerk the rod. The lure comes right out of the fish's mouth. I try to hook the fish, and can't. On the back side of the school near the kitchen is an aquarium. I try repeatedly to hook a bass there. I hook a tropical fish. I take the fish out of the aquarium. It is strange and puffy looking. The cleaning man from Mason Cafeteria at Brimson is there. I put the fish back in the water because it wouldn't be good to eat.
