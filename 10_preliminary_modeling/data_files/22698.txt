I was strolling with my father and I found a square with many trees, English style, trimmed in such a way that they had a semicircular shape. On the sidewalk where we were, I saw little trees that moved as though walking from one place to another. When the park ended, that is, when we finished  crossing the park's sidewalk, I saw that the little tree that walked was a chicken. I saw a rooster and three chickens. Across from the park I found a grocery and I asked the grocer for something which he did not have, and I started to play with his crayons and I had to buy the one I had broken. He gave me the money back with a coin which was very rare and old. Then I started to dream about rare coins. I and a girl, I think it was my cousin Bertha, and a boyfriend (I don't know who) started to look at them and classify them, although I told them I classified them in my head. My cousin asked me about a coin we had kept because of its rarity (I think I dreamt about this in another dream). I looked for it and found it where I vaguely remembered I had kept it. We were sitting on a bed with a red light.
