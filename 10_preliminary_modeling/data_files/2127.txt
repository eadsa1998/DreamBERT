James Mason and I are in the back seat of a car. I'm like Lolita. He's very sexually attracted to me and tells me to change my clothes. He kisses me and pinches my left nipple. I'm sexually excited. I say, "But people can see." An older woman is standing outside the car. He insists. I put on a pretty, brief pleated skirt with see-through lace seams and a turquoise velour top. He leans back in the car and says in a whisper in my ear, "Take off your panties." I feel sexually excited. I do so. I get out of the car, noticing I can see flashes of my legs through the lace. He is possessive and demanding and I love it.
