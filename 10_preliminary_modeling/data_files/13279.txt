I was at school and I was on the oval playing golf. Some Asian kid gave me a snake. I had decided to be a magician. I was talking to Mom, saying how a character in Arrested Development was a magician, and was thinking about Gob with the pennies. She was on a computer. I was watching something and The Final Countdown started playing and I said that it plays when Gob does a trick.
