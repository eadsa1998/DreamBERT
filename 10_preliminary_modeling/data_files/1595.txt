I am walking through a bar. I come to a door that is closed. I think, "Ah. I know the way," and go around a corner to an open door. I am in a bar/lounge. People look at me, interested in me sexually. I feel pleased that I am considered attractive and am not afraid. I also don't stop and take anyone up on the offer. I go outside and see an empty swimming pool. Across the pool is a glass enclosed area. I see lots of children playing.
