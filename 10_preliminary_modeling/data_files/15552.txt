There was this obstacle course thing at this theme park. Ezra said it was good exercise, but it was expensive and not open all the time. Then there was a game where you had a maze and could delete parts of it. I didn't know what to do and realised you had to delete things and then draw a path through it. Then I was in the game with Ezra and there were rooms with puzzles. The first two were easy. One was super dark and I had to use the light from my phone but it didn't really help. We wanted to give up, but no-one listened to us and we fell asleep. In the morning it was light again. We worked out what to do and Ezra left. There was milk and cookies on the table with a card for Santa. The next room had some David Lynch thing which was from a movie I had watched the day before. Aidan Gillen was gay and was with his boyfriend and another guy. They said we should have sex first and I asked if he was serious. I followed Aidan Gillen to a room. He got undressed and put a SARS mask on his face and a condom around his body because his boyfriend had AIDS. I was a 'mole'. I took my pants off and the rest of my clothes and lay on the bed. He got on top of me and kissed me, then we had sex.
