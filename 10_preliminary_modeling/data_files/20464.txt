I wanted to get into a building. There was a derrick about 10 stories high. I climbed to the top, and as it swung against the building, I grabbed the wall and clung to it. The building was about 40 stories high. I crawled up the wall until I came to a window. I then climbed inside. I had to crawl down the side of the inside wall to get to the floor. Later I was outside the building again where I met my mother and sister in a small building, and I told them of the difficulty I had entering the building.
