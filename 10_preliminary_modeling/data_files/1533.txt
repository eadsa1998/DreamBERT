Jennifer H and I are in a living room. She points and says, "Oh look." I look and see a man has walked in and sat on our couch, without permission. I can tell he's a "stray kitten." I walk over to him and say, "I wish you would leave. This is our house and you weren't invited." He pleads, laying on a guilt trip. I don't pay any attention. I assist him up and walk him to the door and say goodbye firmly.
