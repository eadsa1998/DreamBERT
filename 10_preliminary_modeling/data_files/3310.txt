I am in a play about disability that Jock wrote. At first I am sort of a volunteer from the audience. I get up backstage, in the side wings, and sit in a chair. I realize I'll be the first one called on stage. I change my chair so I'll come later. Unfortunately, I end up being the last one and they don't have time for me. I am disappointed and wish I'd had the courage to be first. I go back into the audience and later I am in my wheelchair and I'm going back on stage to be an actress. I back up and the chair tips over and I gracefully roll out of it, unhurt. The audience is upset and concerned and I show them how this is normal to reassure them. It is also part of the play. Now it is later and Jock has returned with a rewrite of the play. I am reading it and seeing the images like a movie. He has completely changed the script and it is science fiction now. I ask him if I'm still in it because it's so changed. He laughs and says, "Oh, yes." I see from the perspective of the enemy aliens who have laser beam guns and they try to shoot my ships out of the sky. We have protective shields and the enemy is in awe because to them it looks like a ship within an invisible ship. The beams bounce off. Now they narrate how they will follow the ship, but unfortunately there are huge seas and oceans on this planet and it is infested with mean and dangerous sea lions. Every dock where they can launch from has hundreds of these huge beasts near it. I see them. We are skimming over the surface of the ocean like in a low flying glider and looking for a place to launch from that isn't covered with sea lions. We have to go far out to do that. Now we are in a room talking, and Jock's wife Melinda is there. I say to Jock how much his writing has improved. I am impressed and a bit jealous.
