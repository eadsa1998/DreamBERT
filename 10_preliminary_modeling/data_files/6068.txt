My friend Steph and I were driving to the mall to meet her roommate and do a little shopping. Steph was driving my car which happens to be a standard. When we pulled in the front of the mall, Steph put the car into neutral. I got out of the car and walked to the front doors and started talking to her roommate who was already there waiting for us. I saw Steph get out of the car and walk towards us. As she was walking towards us I saw my car moving. I ran out and started yelling at Steph. I was saying, "Didn't you put the emergency brake on?" She said, "No." I couldn't believe it. I then saw my car going towards a cliff. I started yelling for Steph to go get my car or it was going to go off the cliff. Just then she started to run as fast as she could after my car. Just before it was going to go over the cliff, she got in and slammed up the emergency brake. She backed it up and drove it back to the front of the mall. I was so [illegible].
