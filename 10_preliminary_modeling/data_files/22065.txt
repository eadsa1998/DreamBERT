I dreamt about a party. It looked like a movie, very elegant, dinner jackets, and the girls with long gowns. Everyone danced and shouted. I was dancing with a very pretty girl and felt like holding her closer to me, but I couldn't because I was ashamed. I danced with her the whole night. I was happy; that's all I remember.
