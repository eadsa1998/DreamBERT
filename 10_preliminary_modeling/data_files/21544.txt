Ann was fixing light switches. I tried them and I flipped them back and forth and the lights would go on just dim. It was dark in the house. I took one switch apart and the wires were not on tight. They were loose. I tried the switch a few times and one of the wires started to burn. When I put it together, the lights went on. I was walking on a ridge and the height was high where I had to go around the edge of the rocks. Then I jumped off the road. I drove my car and the lights were on bright, then dim from Ann fixing the switch. It was night and dark.
