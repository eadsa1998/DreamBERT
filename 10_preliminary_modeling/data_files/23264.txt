I am returning to a place I have come from not long before, in the snow.  I encounter a woman who is all bundled up.  I can't see her face, but she is short, and for some reason I suspect it is my former department chair, though whoever it is can see who I am, and she is quite friendly.  In fact she even praises me for being able to walk through the snow with no heavy clothing and no shoes..  We are headed for the same place, the entrance to which is like that of a storm cellar.  It seems to be part of the university, either a classroom or an office.  I am surprised that she is letting me return, and I try to think of something I can do to get revenge against her, at least to show her disrespect.  I consider opening the door and going in before her rather than holding the door open for her, but that doesn't seem powerful enough.  She continues talking, and I am sure it is her, even though her voice doesn't sound exactly the same, and I never see her face because of the hood she wears.
