 I'm in a gathering with what seems to be a family. There are two cute young women in the family. One of them says something to me about having her sandals. I'm surprised. I have a pair of sandals that I found somewhere, but I didn't think they belonged to her or anyone. I make a comment that asserts that she must be mistaken because I don't have her sandals, though now I know that I do have them. She backs off thinking she must be mistaken. I am called to get my plate of food.
