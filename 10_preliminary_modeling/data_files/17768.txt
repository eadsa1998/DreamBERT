I was in the town of my university in a class for the blind.  We were supposed to practice cutting pears.  There was popcorn, and the class was singing a 60's song.  I left the classroom and some of us had to help save Ancient Egypt from being destroyed.  I went through a courtyard with a fantastic fountain.  I walked down a hallway.  Then I was at my maternal Grandma Jane's house and my teeth fell out.
