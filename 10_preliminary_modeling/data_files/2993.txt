I am sort of at Grandma Mildred's house. I am changing clothes and putting on the old outfit I wore many years ago, the reddish jeans, tight and sexy, and a reddish turtleneck. I have a long, flowing lacey slip on and have some trouble keeping it out of the jeans. I take the slip off. Jake is in the other room and is wearing a bright blue shirt and is looking much better, happier. I realize that he and Valerie are getting back together. I go on to the dining room and Valerie is there and she is pregnant. Her breasts are large and fulsome and she is dressed very pretty in a brightly colored peach dress. I am glad they are back together and wonder if it will work. Probably it will because she is pregnant again.
