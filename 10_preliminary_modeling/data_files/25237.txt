 I'm on the top floor of a three story building at Brimson. A pretty young woman in red is there. On the second floor, as I go down, is a middle-aged white haired lady who says hi to me. I greet people as I go down. I feel like people know and respect me. They are warm and friendly people. As I am descending the stairs, the lady in red comes and asks me if I will go with her to a gathering of some sort at 4:00. The building is nicely carpeted and furnished on the top two floors, but on the bottom floor it isn't so nice. On the bottom floor is a video game. I try to play the video game; there was a credit left on the machine. Two ladies tell me the game is out of order. I feel like I've been reprimanded. The button on the game is a small one that protrudes from a rising half-sphere. There is no joystick. I feel like I'm in college. I have things going on; I feel involved. I'm in another stairwell, similar to the one at Middle Mall in Wilmerton. I am sitting on the stairs in a semi-lucid state. I realize that what is happening isn't real. I dream I am masturbating, and people are going by. Then I awaken and walk away. I'm dressed in overalls without a shirt. I leave the building, which is the same as the one I was originally in at Brimson. I'm going to my apartment. Many of the doors are locked from the inside. Children getting their faces painted block the other doors. I slip through one of these doorways. I later learn that the young woman in red has an identical twin. I see them both.
