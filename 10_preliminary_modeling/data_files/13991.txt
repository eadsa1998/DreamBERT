There were cats in the bathroom, hiding. I heard a noise and I followed it. It was coming from under Dad's bed. Ezra said there was a cat under there. Cuddles was under there. I went to my room and put her on my bed. I saw a dark green/black snake like thing slithering under my stuff on the floor. Poppa and Dad were out the back and I asked them how to kill it. I described it and they freaked out. Poppa, in which I think was an attempt to get me to leave the house, asked if I wanted food and I said "No, Mom's getting it for me". I thought it was Sunday and that Mom had to do my hair, but remembered it was Friday. There were some people filming a music video on a beach and the snake was around.
