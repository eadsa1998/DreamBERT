I had this dream 2 or 3 nights ago that I was going to New Zealand, and we stopped off in China, I say 'we' but I have no idea who was with me, but we stopped in China and we found a McDonalds and I lost my luggage and the tickets we needed to go to New Zealand. The sites in China, or maybe Japan, it was one of the oriental countries and the sites that we saw were very typical of the sites that I've seen in magazines or on TV and stuff, I can't remember any explicit scenes.
