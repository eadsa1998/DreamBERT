 I am going fishing with my friend Tiny Combs at the lake by the Terrace Green supper club near Wilmerton. We drive over the bridge and one of us motions to the spot where we are going to meet later. I realize it's getting dark and that I don't have lights for my boat. Tiny says he has some lights. I tell him we need different colored lights: one red, one white, and one blue. He says he has something that will work. We put the boat in. Once it's in I'm having major trouble steering. I want to go backwards, but I can't control the motor. The boat keeps going in circles, and I get frustrated. The motor is still running, and I pick it up off the back of the boat. The prop is tilted so to propel the boat downwards. I go underwater. My clothes are heavy. I am wearing flippers, and still holding the motor. Something tells me to kick my feet and I will go the surface. I do, but I don't see the surface. I want to turn the motor to propel me up. I don't feel any panic. I may realize I'm dreaming, but nothing becomes of it.
