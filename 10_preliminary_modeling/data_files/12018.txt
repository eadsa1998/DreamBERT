I was at a freaky place with these weird boats and people could float around in them. Greg Mathew was there with me and we went around the back (to leave the boat, and it was all dark and spooky). There was a dance and some girl was being a bitch and complaining because someone was wearing the same clothes as her. Also there was a new law, and I can't remember what it was, but it was gay.
