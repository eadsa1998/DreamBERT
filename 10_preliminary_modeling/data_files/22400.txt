I dreamed about an unknown person who had a snake and that another person and I stole it. My father realized this and made us give it back, scolding us, but she didn't get upset. Then we went over to a place where they sold Coca-Cola and she ordered one and told me that she wanted to take the straws because where she lived they didn't have any. So we opened a box and put many straws in for her to take. All of this took place in the school I attended until I was 11, but it was in the recreation room of the older girls.
