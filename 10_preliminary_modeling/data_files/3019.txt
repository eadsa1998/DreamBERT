I am trying to get a hotel room and being demanding. I'm not getting my way. Now I see a scrooge with alien-like eyes and he's really self-centered. Derwood Kirby lost his job at the factory and Scrooge says, "Well then, you can choose any thing you want from my things." Derwood is touched and chooses his favorite. Scrooge says, "Good, I'll be happy to give it to you at 1 percent off the normal price." Derwood leaves in disgust at the insensitivity of Scrooge. Later, I see me on an English cable TV show. I am wearing my half glasses and doing Evangeline faces. I have fat wrinkles under my chin. I look old. I keep swiveling my head back and forth like I'm on a couch between two people and trying to give eye contact with them both as I brightly talk on in my interview. Then I do a Evangeline shtick and am funny.
