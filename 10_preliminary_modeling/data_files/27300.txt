I was attending a dance and I have no recollection of having known my date, yet I know I arrived at the dance with one. The impression I remember is my being the center of attraction of all the dancing couples, standing in the middle of floor drinking bottle after bottle of soda pop. The dream had the aspect of a Hollywood operetta with lavish surroundings.
