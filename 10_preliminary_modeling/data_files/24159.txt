It occurred an unfamiliar waterfront which size seemed huge, yet was small. It was around evening time and involved myself and three friends (20-22). (There were other people but they were unimportant and unfamiliar.) At one point a friend of mine seemed to be in trouble with the law and took off in a boat (again size was both on a large/small scale) and crashed or it blew up somehow. At that point, it was strange because a good friend just died and it was almost as if I and my other friend were emotionless. I was trying to get everyone to be concerned as well as bring some emotions and make sense of it to myself. The funeral was in Chicago (don't know why). And as I was trying to make sense of the whole deal, why it happened and how I felt, I woke up.
