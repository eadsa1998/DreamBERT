I saw a lot of airplanes in a port and they had propellers under the wings and one under the tail. These propellers acted as a helicopter. They would take off straight up and then land, settle down like a helicopter. I looked out and saw a big plane moving. I said, "That plane will have no space to take off," but Ann said, "It has the whole airstrip to start on." She was right. I looked out to the distance to see if the plane took off and way off at a distance I saw a plane bouncing on the ground. Ann was picking out a horse. She pointed and said, "Bold Some," and another one I can't recall.
