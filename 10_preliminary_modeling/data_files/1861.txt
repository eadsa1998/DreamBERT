A disabled man stands on the edge of a small swim pool on a stage. He says to the audience, "The legs are going out," and he falls into the water. The audience laughs. I notice he nearly hits/smashes his head on the opposite side wall of the pool. He does this several times. Ellie and I come in to be part of the act. I get in the pool and shoo Ellie (or dismiss her) off the stage. I'm going to do an act where I order food and the boy plays the clerk who has thousands of selections, like the deli skit I did. Ellie rolls in a refrig. I ask for milk. The guy doesn't know what to do. I cue him. "Say whole milk or 2%," I whisper. He does. I keep feeding him lines.
