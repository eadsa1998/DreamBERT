It started when I ended up with a silver colored jacket. I was very excited to have it. Somehow this man that looked like he was in his late 30s or early 40s handed me a bottle of fluorescent orange hair dye. He said, "Here you go, have fun." I took it and walked down the remote street that was ahead of me. It was foggy out and looked like it was going to rain, but it didn't. I came to this girl's house that I really hate, but in the dream she seemed to be my friend. I walked into her house and it was kind of small. It did not look familiar at all. At the end I was leaning over her bathtub and she was helping me dye my hair.
