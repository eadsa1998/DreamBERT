Ann and I were in a cafe. She got up and was in the washroom. When she came back, she sat near a drunk and he was putting his arms around her waist. But I said, "Hey, none of that stuff," and Ann came over by me. I bawled her out for sitting there. She said she thought she was beside me. We walked along a river bank. I got on the other side and walked. I saw Ann on the other side. She had on a blue dress and looked beautiful. I looked for a place to cross where it was shallow. I was right across from Ann. She went into the water and went under. I stood ready to go after her if she didn't come up, but she came up and had on that blue dress. I finally crossed and we walked together. Then we were going for the ocean. We came to a creek that was dry. We walked on the bottom. There was a boat on dry land and then it got muddy. We walked a little way and there was another boat and water enough to float on. I did a little repair on the boat and we were going to go to town on the boat. Audrey, Bob and Barb's son were with us. He was always under the water, he liked it so. We were in a place where there was an alligator. The little boy was with us and the alligator was after the boy. I held him. Ann gave the alligator something to eat. As he did so, I said, "Put the glass between his jaws," and I pulled away the boy. Then she put the glass between his jaws again and we got away. He had his jaws open and we had to do this to keep him from swallowing the boy.
