My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in Walgreen's.  There was a large display rack of cheap CDs.  When we went to pay for our purchases, the woman working the counter talked to me; she convinced me she was psychic.  She asked me what the meaning of Disneyland was.  I told her I didn't know, that the last time I was there was when I was 18, etc.  It could have been a reference to Jeremy somehow.  We went and sat on a crappy little bungalow, a very expensive hotel rental, she said.  Somehow she convinced me to give her my bank account numbers, that she was going to use her powers to make us more money.  She left, and later I figured out I'd been swindled and was broke.  It may have been then that we went back to Walgreen's, and perhaps being upset was why I stole the large rack of cheap CDs.  They had been sitting for a while at the bungalow and I decided to go through and pick only a couple to keep.  I chose two that were only 99 cents anyway.  One was Natalie Imbruglia.  My mother came and talked to me and I realized that now I wasn't just broke, I was also a thief, sure to be caught by the store cameras.  I was depressed and anxious.
