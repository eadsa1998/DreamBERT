I was at school and we were hanging in a classroom. Calvin left and I went to look for him. I found him and he said something about "Logan". I asked him and he said that the Logan twins were in the gym. I told Mom and she came and lined up. I went to my bag, got a few pieces of paper, gave it her and got down to the Logan's. I got the wrong bit of paper. I ran back. Somehow inside, Harlan had sticky tape. He and his friends tied me up on this bed. I got out of it and I went back to the gym. The lady waiting started writing on my leg "Dear Izzy, something (I don't remember) ice cool and red hot". Greg was with her. Dave came over and they both signed the bit of paper.
