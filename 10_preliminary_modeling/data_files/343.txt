I'm with a bunch of people somewhere out of the country, maybe England, I figure we're doing a LT, and we're staying in this place that's old and large, with lots of rooms. We've sort of bunked where we could, girls here, boys there, and most of our luggage (or at least where my clothes are) is in this big long room rather like an attic, with various wood roof supports, trunks, hanging-racks, old furniture, the odd cobweb, dust. My friend and I are going back here to collect our stuff so we can pack, it's time to go home, and I'm filled with thoughts about travelling, planes and such. As I'm picking things up I realize that they're pretty scattered around, as if in our coming and going we'd been pretty casual, hanging things here and there, setting things down in different places, and I'll have to collect them. But somehow the racks and things look emptier than I expected, and now others of us are coming in, bustling around. They're not packing up right now, just my girlfriend and I, and frankly they're in the way, particularly the guys. I'm moving from place to place looking and I have to keep dodging people. Now I come to the conclusion the stuff is just not here. How can that be? I'm quite confused.
