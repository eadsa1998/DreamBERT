I am at the OPERA: it is intermission and I have to go to the bathroom; there are lots of people streaming by; I put down my purse with my car keys and then can't find my panties. I look for them and also can't find my purse; sinking feeling. How will I get home? I go out and see a police car and open the door and ask for help. He says: "What if they have been found?" I am SO GRATEFUL, I kiss his hand. He glues me a small coin purse with my car keys, and also my flimsy panties. I put them on and go back for the second part of the opera; at the end I look for a phone, and call Frank, but realize that I do not need to ask for ride, as I now have my key back. Feel greatly relieved and happy! VIVID dream.
