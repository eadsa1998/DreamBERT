At Church: in a small liturgy: take Communion. When I get the antideron (bread), Father Andrew gives me a few select ones; extra rolls for each member of their family and leans over and most tenderly kisses them. He is wearing white and gold robes. He comes over to me and gives me a plate of rolls, one for each child and in the middle one for Frank and then he leans over and with closed lips, most tenderly kisses me for the longest time. Sublime feeling of tenderness and the heavenly love of Christ.
