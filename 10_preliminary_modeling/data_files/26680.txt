 I'm fishing with my dad on some sort of a platform. I cast a buzzbait and reel it in. A fish follows it: the dorsal fin cutting through the surface. The fish bites the lure close to the platform, and then dives. It dives hard, and pulls me in the water! I splash in the water, and try to keep the line tight as I tread water. I give the rod to my dad, who is on the platform. I climb back up. He gives the rod to me. The rod has broken down near the handle. I pull the rod up slowly; it is a big fish. A woman in a bikini comes up from the water! She looks a bit like my sister Heather, when Heather was younger, in that she has a full face, but it isn't Heather. I kneel down on the platform edge and kiss the woman. Water gets in our mouths. I get in the water and swim with her. She is a mermaid. The water isn't cold. It seems to be saltwater: a hazy turquoise color. She has one orifice in place of a vagina and anus. We're going to have sex. We frolic all day in the warm saline water. I'm wearing many thick layers of clothes on my upper body: sweaters, sweatshirts, and flannel shirts. My dad is there, or he isn't, but will be back by 5:00. We need to be back by 5:00. We seem to be near the Redding Farm. My step mom Lisa Lawson is there.
