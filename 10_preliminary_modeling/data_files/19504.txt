[Several dreams, but only one incident of one of them remembered:] Farber had some plan or scheme whereby he expected to get certain returns or advantages from Fisher for undertaking to mount and label a lot of Buprestidae for Fisher. Fisher was suspicious and came to me in my office to explain how he planned to refuse Farber's offer. Fisher invited me to accompany him when he went in to tell Farber "nothing doing," but I declined.
