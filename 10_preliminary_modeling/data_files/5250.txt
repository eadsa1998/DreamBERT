I dreamed that I was in the main building and I was wearing my angel costume. Lou started chasing me because he wanted to take my wings. He finally caught up with me and took them. Then I began to chase him through the hallways. He ran upstairs to the little quad of chairs outside of the history wing. I cornered him and he collapsed onto one of the couches. I began to tickle him to get my wings back. He was very ticklish and was squirming uncontrollably. Eventually, he dropped my wings. When I bent over to pick them up, he grabbed me and pushed me onto the chair. He then began to tickle me. I was breathing so hard. I begged him to stop, and he finally did. Then he leaned down to kiss me. All of a sudden it was a new dream. The science building was attached to the main building through a long, tall staircase right near the yearbook room. I remember having to go to the yearbook room to layout some more pages. Then I woke up.
