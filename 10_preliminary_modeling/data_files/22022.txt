This is the dream I had today, short and confused. I try to see and remember some familiar faces, without recognizing them. I lived on the second floor of an old house, and I myself was wondering why we were there. I went down the wooden stairs which made a noise like the one old shoes make, when suddenly I met a friend who had studied with me in an academy in preparation for the university entrance exam. We hugged each other with joy and mutual phrases. He said to me, "You've gained so much weight! You look like a dame!" And we laughed hard until tears came out from the laughter. Then I was walking with him by the gate of the academy at which we studied and we saw some boys and girls standing at the windows, the same we used to do at the periods in between classes. He told me, pointing at them, "There they are; there are Elsie, Walter, George, don't you see them?" And I said, "Where?" "There, can't you see them?" and I said, "Yes, but it's not them." He told me, "You're really blind." Suddenly we were next to them. I told him it was not them. But when they saw us, they greeted us and smiled at us, my friend did too. But inside myself I thought that even though they were wearing their characteristic clothes - Elsie's boots, necklace, hair, Walter's long jacket - it wasn't them. Then we were in a poolroom, playing, smoking so much that it hurt our eyes. Before playing, everyone smoked so much that we decided to leave the place. Then we walked until we reached May Square. We had the sticks in our hands. He asked me where I was going to put that stick and I told him that I would sell it because I had no money. We said goodbye and agreed to meet the following Sunday and I told him I would bring our friends, but the real ones. My dream ended here.
