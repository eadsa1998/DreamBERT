There are two swimming pools side by side.  CYF is supposed to go to one, but it costs about 50 cents or $1.  I see Deanna Valesquez there.  I think we go swimming together [but am not sure].  Anyway, we are having a friendly conversation.  Then we go into one or the other establishments adjacent to the pools and they are playing Bingo.  It looks like Big Grotto in my hometown.
