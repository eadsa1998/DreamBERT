["Man resists me."] I am swimming in a swim pool. It is a laps contest. I am doing the back stroke and doing it well. I feel the enjoyment of cleaving through the water and being well coordinated. I am powerful and graceful. I pass them all. I go back and forth quickly. Now I am out of the pool. I am attracted to a military officer who is attracted to me. It is all very non verbal. He is resisting me. I don't know why. I am wearing jeans and a shirt. I put on a slinky white dress with a back slit. Over this outfit. It is tight and I struggle to get it on. I am now walking toward his area. Perhaps a tent. I feel a bit silly, because the jeans show under the hem of the dress. I walk in and he sees me. He wants to spend time with me, but he fights the urge. Now I go up to him very close and ask him what's wrong? Is he married? Why does he ignore me? He is abrupt and walks away from me. I guess I'll never know.
