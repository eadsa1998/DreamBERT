["Ladies Social Group"]  I am sitting in the first row of chairs at a women's group meeting. The woman on my left is dishing out pot roast dinner. I see she hands it to the row behind us. I point out I didn't get any. She says the other woman asked first. I wait, hoping as it passes by, I can get some. Then I am distracted by some project we are doing, involving wrapping a yarn around a stick and covering it loop by loop. I am wrapping the stick and listening to the woman speaker at the front of the room. I manage to make a mess. Then I notice I'm not doing it right. I had started it one way and now I'm doing it another way. I lay it down on the floor. The meeting is over and I get up to go. I leave the stuff on the floor and see the other woman cleaning up after me. I feel bad, but I don't do anything about it.
