It is 35 minutes until quitting time. Farber enters my office and offers to give me enough alcohol (his private supply) to fill several small vials in which to collect insects over the week end. He seems darker complected than usual. He purses his lips in characteristic Farberian fashion. I thank him but explain that I intend to use official alcohol, and show him the bottle in which my supply is kept. I say, furthermore, that I have often used privately purchased supplies or equipment in the interests of my official work, and that I feel perfectly free to use official alcohol for collecting purposes.
