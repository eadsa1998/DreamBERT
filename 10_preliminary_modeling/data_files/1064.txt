I am weaving. I'm in the woods. One pattern is a plaid. Lots of white yarn, lots of green yarn and a few red strings of yarn are drawn through. The second pattern is more swirling and moves quickly. There's lots of green. I weave a beautiful dress. I am a witch that lives in this distant forest. A man, a prince, comes to me. I see that he is wounded. He wears a bandage around his left upper thigh. Something about the man reminds me of Howard. I give him something to drink and say, "Here, let me look to that wound." He doesn't want me to help him. I start taking the bandage off. I unwind it many times. I find a square gauze patch on the back of his leg. Then I see transparent tape running down his leg to his knee. I say, "Here, I'll take this tape off." He says, "Can't you leave me any pride?" I smile at his stubbornness.
