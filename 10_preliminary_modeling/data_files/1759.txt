Money questions, how silly. I work for the Forest Service and am in a bed on a high platform. As I try to get up, I realize that there is a huge drop off if I take that first step and I could fall down for miles into the trees. I try to place my foot carefully, but then notice if I get out on the other side of the bed, the platform floor is there and it is safe. So I hop over to the safe side and get out. The new recruits are here and are asking a lot of questions about money. I laugh at their myopic concern about money when it isn't even the issue and someone says or I think "You did that too when you first started." Then I go get some clothes that are in a pile. I take off my nylons and a garter belt and start to put on a dress. I exclaim, "Yes! I am a woman," like I'd somehow forgotten that. I put on some ugly, conservative pants (polyester) and rethink if I want to wear that.
