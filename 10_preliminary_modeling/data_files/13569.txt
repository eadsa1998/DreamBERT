Someone jumped over a sand pile and they fell and hurt something. Liz (Roswell) was hiding out with someone and their fathers. There was a CD and a phone on the floor. She had to prove something and went to give them the CD but it was gone. She went into a bedroom with a bunk bed to have a shower (she thought the shower was under the top bunk, but it wasn't). She found something that said "only Jason Lee!". It was from some colourful video game. Then Liz was in a car at a shop. She was trying to put L plates on while she was parked in the car park. She saw these two girls and she thought they were going to steal the plates so she locked the doors and took them off. She had to go inside and took the car with her (it was small and she was holding it in her arms). This lady gave her car stuff. She went down these escalators that had been stopped and was in the main part of the shop, which was a clothes shop. Someone thought that she was with "Tess, not Tuck". Tuck was Tess' father. Isobel and Michael (Roswell) were there trying to get the car and kill her. She whacked Isobel with something and she passed out. Eugene went after her and he got hit too. Max (Roswell) appeared and Liz had short blonde hair. Max said "Liz? You're behind 'Runaway'?". They ran out and this black guard stopped Eugene from following them. Liz was saying that the keys were in the car and it was locked.
