Blake and I are in a counseling session. He's invited me there because he's trying to work through all his issues and I was once important in his life. The counselor asks questions and then the door opens and in walks his family, mom, sisters, cousins and so on. It's a family counseling session. I have a conversation with his mom. She says, "I'm his mom," and then she tells me she makes all her xmas presents. I say, "What a coincidence, so did I, knitting and crocheting."
