I am put into the starvation ward. We all lie together in a tangled heap. The one next to me has a horrible cold voice. He asks to kiss me. I turn my face to avoid it but still try to talk to him politely. Then suddenly, he is on top of me and has stuck his fangs into my jugular vein (the left side of my neck), and is sucking my blood. I feel paralyzed and sick.
