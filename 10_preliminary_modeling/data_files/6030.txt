I was at my cottage down the cape with my whole family (cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.). We were having a cookout on the deck, buffet style. But when I took a plate and walked along the table, the food consisted of turkey, cranberry sauce, mashed potatoes, etc. There was no regular "cookout food." I also remember getting ready for the cookout and looking in the mirror. I was about 30 pounds heavier and my hairstyle was awful. I was ugly and fat.
