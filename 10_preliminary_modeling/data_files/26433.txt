 I'm at a store with others. I look at pants. I seem to have a pair of pants in this particular style. I may be looking at a different color pair of pants. They have some camouflage hunting clothes. I look at a pair of overalls. With a little coaxing from my friend Stephen Ramos, I buy them. The waist is really large: about 40 inches. I buy an arrow too.
