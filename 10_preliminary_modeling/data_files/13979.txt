I looked out of my window to see the moon like two squished ovals on top of each other (see diagram). I was on the phone to Mom and she was watching it. It went white and then close but then it flew back and I got off the phone and it turned fuzzy and red around the edge and then filled in and looked like the sun. I told Dad and Ezra that they should look. It got closer. Dad said he would look when he got something (he was on his laptop). I said "We're going to die". I was then thinking that I had to see Eugene. Then there were aliens in the sky and the Earth was shooting back at them. I decided that they were after Ezra. They shot back at us and my door got shot to pieces and it had metal framing which was hanging off. They came to the house. Some of them were squeaky and looked like mice. They were also really fast and I couldn't catch them. I managed to get a few and was hitting them with one of those cake server things but they would just squish a little and not get hurt, so I started flinging them into the air. I gave some other aliens, which were more human-like some cake, which was really nice. I gave them popcorn too. They were joking around with us and I was trying to tell them that Ezra wasn't here. There was a friendly mouse thing called "Chit". Ezra and I were later watching TV. Robert Pattinson was on there and I said "he's in that stupid movie I have to see". Ezra misunderstood what I said and said "he's the reason why you want to see it?".
