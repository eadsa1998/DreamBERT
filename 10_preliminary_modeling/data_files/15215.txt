This guy who looked like Christian Kane (although he was sometimes hot) and I were out at this club thing which was in the shape of a ship. When I showed the bouncer my ID he put his face right up to the card. It was night by the way. I don't know what happened but we were then outside in the carpark. I saw a Camry and got an idea to blow up all Camry's. We got to this car and I signalled him and then he came. I pretended to be drunk. This lady came over to it, and she was the owner of the car. He put a plastic bag over her head and killed her. We looked to the car for stuff, leaving personal belongings. Then we went to the next car which was a red, sports like, two-door car. He broke into it. Some others came and he killed them. Then a group of people came over and asked if we had seen anyone dodgy around. They opened the boot of a car nearby and saw two dead people sitting in the front seats and they freaked out. I pretended to be shocked as well. Then the Christian Kane guy started walking with a plastic bag and was then get them before he realised that there were more people around. He said we had to go and we took the sports car. I asked "is this really the most inconspicuous car?". There were p-plates on and I took them off. The car drove fast and smooth. People were everywhere in the carpark. Later a sketch of some guy was going around the news and I was trying to find out what it looked like to make sure that it wasn't him, but it didn't look like him.
