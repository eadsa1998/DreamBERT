Ezra, Dad and I went to a McDonalds and we were tired. Ezra passed out and Dad said "Great, I've got to take Ezra out". Then he said the same thing about me. I said "I haven't passed out yet". He said "Yes you have" and then I passed out. Then we were in the carpark and we had two cars. I said to Dad, "I think you're dreaming". He was. Then some scary thing jumped up and screamed (as if I was watching a movie). It woke me up.
