A small "grandma" mouse is in danger. A snake is coming toward her and will swallow her whole. I am concerned and squeamish. Then the snake thinks to itself, "I'll try a different approach. I'll go slow and hypnotize her and then pounce." He moves slowly toward her, head on. She watches. I want to call out, "Run. Run." Then the snake goes inside her mouth, instead of swallowing her. She has the opportunity to save herself by biting off the snake's head. I am squeamish because I don't want to watch or hear it, but she doesn't do it. Her mouth is a huge "O" shape as the snake puts his head inside.
