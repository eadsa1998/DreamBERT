Shelly (an acquaintance from Church or the Book Cafe?) wants to visit over nite with her boy friend. I am not certain and hesitate, but then say OK. I go home first and pull out a double bed and offer to make the breakfast the next morning. I say goodnite and see her tucked in under the couers, " like a kitten."
