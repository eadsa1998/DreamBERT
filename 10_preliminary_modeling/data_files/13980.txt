Calvin had sent me a text saying "it was subtle" and I didn't know what he was talking about. I ended up having a baby and it turned out, as I found out from Ezra, that I'd had sex with Silas. I then remembered deciding to have sex, but couldn't remember why. I drove somewhere by myself and I had the baby with me. Mom yelled at me for having it with me.
