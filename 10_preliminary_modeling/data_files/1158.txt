I am driving a car but I'm sitting in the back seat, reaching over into the front seat. Lucy is steering (she is blind). I have control of start/stop. She has control of direction. I see for her and tell her how to turn. I am feeling anxious because we could have an accident. I am driving in the snow. I want to turn right. She doesn't turn in time. We go on too far and then swing around just in time. The tire tracks look like Irish fisherman knit patterns on the snow.
