 I go to the Brimson library to work. I get tired and decide to leave. I sit down in a chair by the stairs. My ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter, her roommate Erin, and another woman come up the stairs. We make eye contact and say a weak hello as they hang their coats up. They go to do work. Jackie pauses as they walk by, and then sits down on my lap. I lean back and say that I'm tired and need a nap. I have my arms around her. She leans back on me and we start to have a sexual encounter. I rub my hand on her crotch. I can tell she isn't used to this aggression. We take our clothes off. She gives me fellatio and we have sex. There is an open door, and we are in a room. I feel like I'm imagining being with her: like it's not real. I have my erection stuck behind my left leg, and I imagine Jackie sitting on top of me and us having sex. It is good sex. She has never had sex before, and is strong, sturdy, and aggressive. She likes the hard physical contact and penetration. The door closes and I notice a person in blue leaving the doorway. This startles me. My state of mind changes: this seems dream-like, and waking-like. I roll or crawl over to the door and holler/moan. It was my housemate Norman Noman at the door. I think: If I was dreaming, I couldn't have been masturbating because of muscular atonia in REM. I ask Norman if I was dreaming of masturbating of if I really was masturbating. He says I really was masturbating: he saw me.
