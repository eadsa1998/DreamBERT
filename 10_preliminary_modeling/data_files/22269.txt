I dreamed I had gotten married and that I went to bed with my wife, who was shy. Then I undressed her and she let me, and then we made love to the point that she scratched me on the back because she was so excited. Underneath my wife's sexual organs blood was running. She was no longer a virgin; the blood was green. She was still awfully excited and asked for more. Then I petted her and woke up.
