Mom, Darren, Ezra, Jayson and I were at the 'zoo'. It was inside, I think. It was all water animals and you got a sheet to tick off which animals you touched. Some of the animals listed were electric eel and jellyfish. I didn't want to touch any of the scary ones (ie, jellyfish). Mom got angry at me.
