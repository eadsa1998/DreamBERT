I am in Dr. Feingold's office in C. City and ask her to write a note to Dr. Smith in B. City to tell him that I did not "run away." "Why?" she asks. "I want it for later." She has to go out and I remember writing her a note with a large pencil with a square eraser. I see a small silver mirror on the wall above me. I have a feeling of missing her and wish I could be back in analysis with her. I leave the office with Frank.
