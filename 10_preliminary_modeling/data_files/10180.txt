We are back at our house in M. City, it is remodeled and looks a lot like the chalet we live in at the Retreat Center, and it has a studio room for Wally and Wendy to paint. shift: long train sequence in a city like London; we are on a train that is being pushed by a small, silver-gray engine from the rear! Then we have to get off and wait for another train; I go to a small store to buy something and MISS THE TRAIN; I have no money, but do NOT panic. I WAIT and finally Frank and the boys return and meet me in the cafeteria; As I walk to the train, I notice that I have one shoe on properly with a sock, and the other with a plastic bag; but when I look again, I have both proper shoes on as usual; we get on the train.
