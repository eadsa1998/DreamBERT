I was sitting in my boyfriend Jeremy's home, I think, with him and his mother.  I was talking to his mother Harriet about how cute Jeremy was, and the need for pictures.  She agreed.  Jeremy had said I used to be like that but I'm not so bad now.  She told me a redundancy joke, which I didn't get at first, which I finally realized wasn't because of me.  It wasn't actually redundant.  I wanted to tell a joke too- the one about the slant eyes and boys and girls.  But then I thought I shouldn't as it could be offensive.
