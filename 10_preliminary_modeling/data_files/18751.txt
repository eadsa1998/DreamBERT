I had not been able to check my computer because some messages were from the future--from people from the past. A message was there from 19B Chestnut St. I knew this meant Nanny and Grandfather's house. They died long ago--but the message from them was in the future. Dora had no address to list her from, so I could not open the file. It was from a different place in time. A whole different dimension. When I tried to understand it--I could hear the circumference of individual letters rather than hear/see the words--the whirring of the vibrations from the shapes of the letters. Moonlight. Dora's message was there but had not happened yet. Eileen's message I wanted to open very bad. I could not open it because a map of the U.S.--the whirring of moving letters--spinning. The machine would not let me see, yet, a message from another time. It was locked away until the time had come. I was getting a list of important messages I could not see because they were not from places I could understand. It was another dimension.
