I am swimming with a woman. It is quite dark and I can't see well. We start wading out over dark brown sand, look down at pools. It is a long ways until it is deep enough to swim. Then I plunge in as she says, "But I can't stay long." We get out and start off and I've left my red flowered suit. I will have to phone or go back after it. Can't think how I could have left it behind for we had ridden down in her car already in bathing suits because I no longer belong to beach club and where could I have changed? I reluctantly decide I had better walk back after it today. Well I won't really have to. This is only a dream.
