I was like all keyed up and wired for sound last night when I told that last story. It was like 10:30. I must've had too much sugar or something. [laugh] Well, anyway, last night I had kind of a transient dream, a short, fleeting dream. I dreamt that Mom was sleeping in bed with me, which she does a lot, but that she was playing the "La La Loo" tape, and it was okay, I wasn't scared or anything because I dreamt that the real song that would scare me would be, I think it was, "Stra la la, stra la la," and some other kind of German or Russian words. [laugh] That was weird! And when I started thinking of that song, then I started getting a little scared. But then I faded off into some dark transient somewhere and I didn't remember too much more.
