I take a vacated seat at the long picnic table but only soiled dishes are there. Someone passes me a yellow slice of lemon pie but I want some of the small cookies and sandwiches the others have. There are sandwiches on a shelf across from the table and a lady next to me keeps getting some but I can't reach it. Her arm seems to be lengthening when she reaches.
