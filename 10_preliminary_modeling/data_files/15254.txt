Dad decided to leave for our holiday tomorrow. I was packing and was washing some clothes (we were at the old house). Mom said I couldn't pack wet clothes especially yellow ones because they would fade. I realised I had no books on my iPhone, but Dad said he had some. We got to the plane and Dad had the tickets, but the pilot said we needed proof that we had bought them. Luckily Dad had some. We stopped somewhere and Dad said it was 'Nottinghamshire or Ireland' and I said that I think it's Singapore.
