Up at cabin with friends. Went in my boat, but it was really a car and we're going around the lake trying to find this certain fish, so we had a pile of rocks and we had to throw the rocks in a specific place to find this "magical" fish. Then it just kind of transitioned to playing softball in the woods. I wasn't disturbed at all during the dream. Pretty much relaxed through the whole thing. Friends were people I know, my age.
