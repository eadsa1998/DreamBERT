I went to the John Cleese show and the room was small with only like 10 rows of seats and I was at the back. There was a small stage. There were other acts and one had Frank Woodley. None of them were very funny or made sense. During the break I went to my car and this other girl was there. A couple went into this shop and started shooting. I snuck off but they came after me. I went into this other shop but no-one was there. I went through lots of doors trying to find the way out. Then I think they had some disease and their skin was falling off. Nana bought tickets for the Wakakiri and I thought I had to dance so was going to cancel, but then realized the ticket was just to watch it and I decided to go.
