I was intimating Ann and she put up mirrors so she could see the act. I watched my penis go into he and it was big. All at once the door opened and Audrey surprised us. I rolled off Ann and she laid there. Audrey sort of grinned at our surprise. I was working on some kind of a problem. It was a mystery or a mystical because it solved predictions. I seemed to be near the North Pole or north near it. I was in Arabia and Arabians were after the knowledge of the mystery. I was riding a cardboard box on the kitchen floor in certain back and forth ways and this seemed to make some sense to one of the Arabians because he told a servant to get me a glass of milk and he gave a certain gesture to her. He gave me the idea he wanted her to slip a mickey to me. I told him not to get the milk for me because I would not drink it. I was going to a bar and there was a bull coming out. The Arabian said, "Never get in front of a bull." I saw 14 on the calendar for the Ohio derby. I was going to see what the daily double was and I heard 6 6. I walked into house and a fellow was coming thru the rooms with some kind of a farmer gardening equipment. He roughed up the carpeting and scattered other things. I got angry and went outside for him. It was dark and I couldn't see him on the street. I clenched my fists and started looking for him. I went into a building to look for the men's room. I looked in one door and I saw a lady apparel, so I opened the other door and I saw some women inside. On both doors and walls there were marking in pencil, "Artist at Work." I picked up one block and it was 59 and another was 54. A fellow lit a candle and put it into his mouth. It raised up to his hairline and went out and then it was a cigarette and he had a habit of holding it up right near his right eye while smoking. I was painting a small rock arch about 12 by 12 and all at once water came between the rock. I thought a water pipe broke and water came from it. Then it stopped.
