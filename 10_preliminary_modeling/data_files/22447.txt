I dreamt of a cousin of mine who is the same age I am, and whom I hadn't seen in a long time. I believe we were in the house of an aunt. I asked her what she was doing and she told me that she was studying at one of the schools of the Agricultural University and that she was studying some kind of art and also the cranial make-up of dinosaurs; I asked her what that was good for, and she told me that it was for general knowledge.
