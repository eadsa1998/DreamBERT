I was in jail for some reason and there were these portals - I'm not sure of the specifics, but we were aware they were kind of safe but the police weren't. They were also maybe controlled by us in some way, like through a control, but I'd never used one. Anyway, I was trying to escape. A guard let me out of my cell but there were lots of guards and I couldn't get out anywhere. A portal was opened and he put me back in my cell but forgot to lock it. Classmate-F-05 was also there as a prisoner and was out of her cell but had guards in front of her. She saw me leave my cell as I slowly walked behind the group of guards and as soon as I had a straight line to the portal I ran and jumped in. Classmate-F-05 followed. I ended up in an outside place, which had park benches and grass and stuff. A few other people were there, including Frederick. I was sitting at the bench eating and he was next to me and kept leaning on me. He kept moving to different areas and it would always be where I was going to go next so he was joking I was following him. I pondered as to whether the portals took us to a real place, an alternate universe or was some kind of hallucination. Frederick said he thought it was like a shared dream and didn't exist beyond the area we were in. I said I didn't think it was a dream because the mirrors functioned properly and I could read words. Later I was sitting at a TV and Nana and Poppa were there, sitting on a lounge to my left. Tristan was sitting on the same lounge as me. Emmanuel was there and we were joking about something and then he said that we got along better than Tristan and Nana and Poppa.
