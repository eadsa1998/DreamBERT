I was working at a library.  I was supposed to be doing something in the corner on the computer, but started neatening up some of the glass display cases, and then organizing books.  I knew I should get back to the work I was going to get paid for, but I got very distracted and completely forgot what I was supposed to be doing for a while.  When I remembered, I wondered how I was going to cover for myself, but wasn't that panicked and continued with what I was doing.  Then walking back over to the computer, I got diverted and went up to the announcing booth of a school football field.  The teacher who coached the football was up there and I talked to him a little bit.  The football game was the last of the season and they had the bad luck of it being played in a swimming pool rather than the usual football field.  The coach was replaced by someone else rather suddenly though I don't know why.
