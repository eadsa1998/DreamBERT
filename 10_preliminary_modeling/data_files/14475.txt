I called Ezra to ask him something and I was on my way home. I was then outside (it was different) and there was a party in there. There were people on my computer, which was right next to a window with no curtain. I tapped on the window and they ignored me. I stormed in, angrily, and said "Get off my computer!". They were people from school last year. They were actually not on my computer and Ezra was. He quickly got off and I pulled the desk behind it away (they had been sitting at a desk where my computer usually was) and I put my computer back. They complained about having to move. I went on Facebook and I had a message and it was from Duane. Silas was in my suggested friends list.
