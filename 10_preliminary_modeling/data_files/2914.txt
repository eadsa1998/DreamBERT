A huge double trailer truck parks in a way that protects the handicapped parking space for me. He likes me and is trying to help. I pull the van up in the graveled spot, glad he is helping me. I get out and am walking and see the ocean on my left. I notice a huge wave gathering up and realize I'd better get moving quickly. I walk quickly uphill, now the trucker is on my left and my mother is on my right. We walk and I feel tired and achy. This is hard work for a person out of shape. The wave comes over us, totally immersing us and I think I'll die and won't be able to hold my breath long enough. Then I notice I can breathe and realize we had made it up high enough for safety.
