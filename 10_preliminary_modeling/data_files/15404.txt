I was at the old house. Ezra was in the study. I asked "one, where's our mother and two, why is this here?' and pointed to a lit candle in a birthday cake. He mumbled quietly and I asked him to repeat it and eventually he said he didn't know. Mom finally came back with Rover and she said she'd been in an accident in my car. She'd had to slam the brakes on. I was angry because the front of the car was smashed in. I took photos and said that I'd never let her drive my car again.
