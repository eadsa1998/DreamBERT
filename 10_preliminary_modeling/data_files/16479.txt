We were still looking at apartments for me for when I'm living at Modern Media College, and I dreamt that this place -- Cedar Park Villas -- was on a ship and there were rooms and rooms for people to stay, but it was like on a ship. And it didn't really have an address because it didn't stay in one place; it could get up and go at any minute. And I was thinking to myself how I would really like to stay at a place that was on land, and I wouldn't want to stay on a ship. And there was another part to this dream. There was a waiter guy who had to come to my room in order to get to either the ship's bathroom or like a kitchen storehouse place, but he came through there a couple times, and he ended up sleeping in my bed. And in my dream I didn't really consciously think he did anything to me, but I kind of asked Mom that, if I needed to get an abortion, would she be able to take me in, not let anybody know. And I don't remember what she said, but next thing I knew, we were on a smaller boat just going for a ride with a bunch of people. And then I woke up.
