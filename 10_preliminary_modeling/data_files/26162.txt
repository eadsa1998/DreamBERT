 I'm in Wilmerton standing outside the donut shop on the corner of Main Street and Friends Ave. My uncle Rusty Redding and cousins Rich and Melissa Redding are there. I talk about fermenting wine in bottles, but I say something isn't right. Rich and Melissa correct me, and I say that what they say is correct, about oxygen and carbon dioxide. Rusty tells me that I'm the number three mass server (altar boy) for church, at Christmas I think! He is the number four server. I Think this is fucked up, and I don't' want to participate in a mass as a server. I want nothing to do with it, but it seems I am obligated to serve because they have me scheduled to serve. John and I have lines to say: we may have to talk during the service, like in a pageant.
