I was in San Francisco. There was a steep roller rink on tracks. I wobbled. There was a drop. My Mom pointed (to) the San Francisco party! (We) went down to see. (I) got lost from my parents. (I) had to go to the bathroom. Charlene, in my purple leotard, was with me. It was just her and me. I said, "At least I still have you!" Then I was on roller skates. There was a glass door. I thought I saw Jacob on the other side. I waved. Me and Charlene decided it wasn't Jacob. We went through the door. It was Jacob. We entered a (Disney) garden. It had a boy fountain, Peter Pan, spitting water with his hands out. My mom said, "Last chance for a bathroom." I looked at her skeptically. Then I miraculously knew right away. I got on the hand and pulled it down. I didn't know how to do it. It was like some unknown force was pulling a hood open and shut. There was something about six inches. I woke up. Setting: First in San Francisco, at a roller rink on tracks. Then I was at a Disney garden. (I) don't know the place. Characters: Charlene, my friend in my leotard. Jacob, with his hair how it was two years ago. My mom. My dad. Matt, at the end. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I was angry at my mother, and it felt as if my dream was being narrated.
