There is a Mets game at Shea Stadium with President Clinton attending, but otherwise the crowd is small and the seats are sparsely filled. Other people I know from work are there also, but most of them sit on the opposite side of the stadium from me. One (who?) comes over to join me on my side. The National Anthem is played while I imagine images to go with it, like a music video. I then hear the words, "Play ball!"
