A family reunion. I eat a chocolate sugar piece. It's delicious. I worry it will start up my irregular heart beat. I have to climb a high ladder to sit on top to await the reunion. I am scared of heights. Dora and I sit. Someone comes by and says Willie/Dwight is an alcoholic and is very drunk, maybe dead.
