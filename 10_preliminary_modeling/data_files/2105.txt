I am at a high school reunion. Darryl is there. He starts to kiss me and it feels wonderful. I open up to the feeling of love and want sexual pleasure. I then realize he's going to leave me again. I feel sad and hurt that it is a second time I will feel that hurt. I sit sadly looking out the window and I'm surprised to see the old M City High doors. It is painful to feel that nostalgia. I'm now walking down a road alone. It's a country road. I get off to the side and need to cross the fence to get back on the road. It's plastic like videotape or window slats on blinds. I bend one, feeling bad about breaking the fence. I get back on the road and see a school bus coming toward me. I think, "I don't want witnesses of the broken fence and me. They'll figure out I did it." I think of hiding on the other side in the woods, but I don't. The bus comes up to me. I look ahead and see a river crossing the path. There's no bridge. I think, "Hey, I'm going to get wet and cold." I try to ask the woman bus driver if I can hitch a ride. She signals that she can't talk to people when she's on duty and goes splashing through the river. I shrug and walk into the river. I get totally wet and it is cold. I get to the other side and discover I'm lost. I realize I'm in France. I ask some questions in French. I ask for a lottery ticket. The woman clerk (older woman) scrapes off the numbers to tell me I didn't win, and then she winks and says sometimes she changes the numbers for foreigners and she gives me a small tiny baby spoon. I am very grateful. I ask, "Which way to Paris?" She points the way. I walk on.
