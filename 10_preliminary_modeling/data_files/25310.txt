 I'm at the Big Dance Club. I get there early, at 3:30 pm. My friend Niles Zelling rushes in soon after me. I sit by the stage. My old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens, my friend Jill Banks, and others are there. They sit in a booth. I join them. They have just ordered dessert. The waiter is a classmate of mine from junior high, Tim Samsung
