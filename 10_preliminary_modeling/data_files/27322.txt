J--- (engaged to M 22) and I were on our way E--- Beach but first we had to meet several women (F 60-70). These older women were sitting on a sofa with their heads cut off. We went up some stairs and got into a roller coaster car. The tracks were covered with small fire crackers which started to go off when we came to the end of the ride. We got back in the car and some-one called to us and asked us to take a boy we had never seen before to the doctor. Several other young people (20-25) got into the car and I woke up.
