I am in charge of a Nursery School; there are many Vietnamese children and black children there; Much confusion. I remember going down a long stairway and seeing box cars that are painted in yellow-blue pastel colors, like toy trains. I notice a place where the cars broke off part of a wall, I say "we will clean it up later."
