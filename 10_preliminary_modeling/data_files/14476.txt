I was at Mom's, which was different. I was talking to her about PETA and saying that there was a Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit episode about them and that I thought they were evil. A group of them came over but they were like carpenters and were showing us different things we could do around the garden. We weren't interested and then this guy was like 'I'll get them with this one!' and Mom decided to go with it. This singer climbed up on a railing at his concert and then jumped into the crowd. They caught him but he was bleeding. Mom and I helped carry him away. This lady was trapped outside? I said "Darren's gay" because he was there. Someone was being distant towards me. I told Mom that someone had made a name by themselves by pretending they were male because "no-one reads female writers". There was an episode of Heroes and we (?) were in a safe and we used phones and ice to block others?
