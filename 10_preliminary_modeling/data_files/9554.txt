Father Andrew visits me at home: I am busy with the children. He talks to me and tells me not to be sad; "you have a loving Father in Heaven." Then Father Andrew lies down and falls asleep on our bed. He is covered with a white bedspread. Then he says before he falls asleep and while I am still busy with my children: "There are days that are seedless days." And I think of what this means? Father Andrew remains in deep peaceful sleep while I keep working.
