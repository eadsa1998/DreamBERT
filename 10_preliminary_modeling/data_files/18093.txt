Last night I had a dream, and it was, I was in this house with a dog and she had lots of puppies, about like 200. And they were lots of Opsos and Huskies and Jack Russell Terriers and lots of other kinds of dogs. And they were all really cute. And it had a really big ceiling in a big house. And we traveled all over the world, but we lived in one house. And yeah, I had lots of friends.
