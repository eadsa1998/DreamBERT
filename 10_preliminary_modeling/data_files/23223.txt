I come upon a baseball game which is being played in something like a major league stadium, though not as large.  It is actually between games of a double header, and it is 11:15 at night.  I can hardly believe that they are going to start a second game at that late hour.  Furthermore, one of the teams has only one player.  I hope maybe I can get a chance to play, but I end up sitting in the stands, in left field.  John Forster is batting, and I can hear an announcer calling the play-by-play.  He says Forster hits a long drive down the left field line; that alerts me to look for the ball, and I see it coming directly toward the person sitting in front of me.  He ducks to one side, and I am able to put my hands up to catch the ball and cushion its impact just as it hits me in the middle of my chest.  I wonder if he has done it on purpose, and when I get a chance to talk to him, I remind me that he has done something similar on two separate occasions.  He claims not to remember it.
