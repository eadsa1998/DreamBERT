There was a new called Serenity (spin-off/sequel to Firefly). I downloaded the pilot and only Mal, Zoe and Kaylee were in it. There was a computer person called 'Woman'. It started off with them in a prison (or something) which they had bought. They were standing under it and it ended up collapsing. I was then there too. There was some animal chasing me. I jumped over a fence and it ran around it. Someone yelled at me to give it the fence. I did, but it tried to bite me still. I wondered what was going to happen to Castle since Nathan Fillion was in this new show and I hoped that Adam Baldwin would make an appearance. It was written and created by someone called Jelly Bean. I said aloud "the guy who does Dexter... oh, girl."
