I was on a desert with a group of people. Although I knew the people were there, they seemed like phantoms because I could not recognize them. One girl (I couldn't recognize her) and I went dashing around on the sand, having a gay carefree time. Another girl (who I couldn't recognize) tried hard to annoy me, and she made me angry for which I rebuked her.
