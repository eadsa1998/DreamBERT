It was like a movie. I had seen 'Gremlins' the night before. I was in an apartment building and it was unfamiliar to me. There were Gremlins everywhere. I couldn't see them, but I knew they were there. One of the characters from 'Step by Step' was on the top of the roof screaming her head off, because a gremlin was attacking her. In the dream I saw her as my sister. A lot of my friends were around, just listening, not moving to help. I was thinking "Why doesn't anyone try to help her?" Then we get to her. She was in catatonic state. I was feeling relieved that she wasn't dead. Then the scene switched to the bathroom, and as I tried to sit down, a Gremlin popped up and then I woke up.
