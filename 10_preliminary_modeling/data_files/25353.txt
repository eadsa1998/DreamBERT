 There is a "Brown" wrestling club. There is a big white kid that reminds me of the freshman at Brimson that looks like a person I played basketball against in high school, named Wade. This kid is kind of fat; his skin is flabby. I wrestle him. There are referees. I smash my fingernail. There is a judge of ideas there. I have a change of thought.
