I was down on the beach, which one I can't recall - The wind was blowing quite hard and I remember being very cold. A mixed group of my friends were also there and we were all very hungry. I recall sitting next to a picket fence of some kind, trying to get warm -- Everyone else seemed to be warm - and eating something. But I don't recall eating or asking for any food, I just sat still next to that fence - and then I woke up.
