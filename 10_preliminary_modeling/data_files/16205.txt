We were in Canada for some reason and it was kind of at night time. And it was Mom and Melinda and Chelsea and I, and we were in this boutique in Canada, and it had roundish brick steps on the front. And we were looking for a prom dress for Chelsea, and we didn't really see anything we wanted, we weren't impressed, but we said, "Let's hang around a little bit because Celine Dion might drop in." And sure enough, we were just getting ready to head out the door and we saw her. And she went in and she got something from the boutique, and then she was like so happy to see me, as if she knew me or something. And we went in Melinda's van and she was driving, and Chelsea, Celine and I were like on opposite sides of the seat, and Chelsea was in the middle typing on her laptop computer, and Celine and I were like holding hands over the back of the seat. And I was asking her about things that she had, and she said that she had this cup that was really, really special to her from her sister, and she keeps it up high so her baby won't grab it and break it. And we get to this hotel thing, and we get out and it's like all dark, we're like creeping through the dark. Oh no, first we're in the kitchen at our house and she's like, Celine is like walking around holding hands with me and sitting on the couch, and sitting with me like Aunt Janice and I do. And Mom said, "You better not be turning out to be a lesbian with her." And then next thing I know, we're in this hotel like in the dark, and I'm asking her about her songs and things. And we kind of like lose each other, and then I woke up.
