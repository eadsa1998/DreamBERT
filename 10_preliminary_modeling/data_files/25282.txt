 I'm driving a car with my friend Virginia Green's house. With me are Virginia and my classmate Tom Dement. I talk to Tom about college, saying he must be leaving pretty soon. He says he leaves tomorrow. I ask him if he is packed yet. He says no. We are going down the street near my dad's old little house, parallel to the railroad tracks. We are going east, towards Friends Avenue. Near the trucking barns, there is a reddish or pink car. It looks like it was assembled by hand using parts from different cars. It is made of steel. I turn right onto a road and go down towards Virginia's house. I park the vehicle, which is a red Volkswagen Bus, on the sidewalk in front of her house. We get out. It is cold and raining. Virginia's father is standing out in the yard. He is clean-shaven and his short, dark hair is combed. Her sister is in the hot tub in the back yard. I think of how I got sick from being in a hot tub in the back yard. I walk from the front of the house to the side door, going by the bushes and shrubs. I think of asking Virginia when her birthday is. Then I remember it is during the school year, in the spring. Now, it is summer. I walk into the side door of the house and go through the kitchen. In the living room are my friend Emily Zates and her younger sister Audrey. Emily hopefully asks me if I brought any board games. I didn't. There is another girl with them. She has five beers. I find a rubber gun that shoots ping-pong balls. The girl I don't know and I shoot balls at each other, flirtingly. I say to her that five beers are enough for her because she is so small. <br/
