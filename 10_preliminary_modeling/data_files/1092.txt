Someone shot an arrow at a helicopter and it crashed in flames. A narrator said, "Woody sort of threw this thing and it made a noise and kind of hurt it." I thought, "What a cover up! Disgusting." I saw a car with huge baskets on the top of it driving away. I was writing a play. It called for a new character. I got stuck and then inspiration struck and I wrote one in. [BL]
