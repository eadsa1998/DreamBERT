I'm in a gym or workout studio, at the entrance end where there's some furniture, and along with a few other people, I'm looking up on the wall at a red flag. It's just solid red, on velveteen, looks like, and it's a kind of trophy for my brother (- although he's a little mixed up with My ex). He's just gotten his "belt" in some form of martial art - or similar physical skill - and they give you this to display. (I guess that makes it a red belt.) He's very proud of this, brought us to look at it for a surprise. I'm pleased for him, but not especially excited, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of point to just standing here and looking at a piece of red cloth. I wonder how soon I can get away, without hurting his feelings. Besides, I have to go to the bathroom. There's a class about to start [I think it's a yoga class, and it's unclear whether I'm supposed to be in it or not] and I go past them, trying to be unobtrusive, to the bathroom at the other end of the room. (There are windows down here, letting in some soft midday-light. This is an oldish place, probably in a school. Everything's used-looking.) I go in and push the door to, but it won't latch. It has a standard brass turn-latch on it, and when you press on the door it seems like it goes in, but it doesn't. The toilet is just a little too far away to hold it shut comfortably. This is a problem. I start to sit down anyway, hoping nobody will come into the line of sight of the door (it just stands open maybe 6"-8"), but the whole class is called down to this end of the room for a demonstration. They file past, and I can see their faces. I try to make the door latch again but it doesn't work.
