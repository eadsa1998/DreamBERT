We live across from Camdens and as I get up I look across and see kids running by. Marissa wearing a headdress carried milk and Father Andrew helps a dishwasher place some boxes of dishes on the floor: see a cut-glass tray and dish that was a present during the war. Paul Camden (Father Andrew's son) complains about their showing too much interest in him. "Where does the shoe fit?" he asks. "Where does it fit perfectly?"
