I was going into the School of Medicine with several boys and girls, and we were all going to take an exam. I did not know anybody, and I felt disoriented. However, I went to the classroom and sat down with the rest, but at that point I discovered that a girlfriend of my sister was sitting in the seat in front of me (this girl studies medicine with my sister). We said hello and she asked me where my sister was, and I told her that she could not come and that I was there to take the test for her. The girl laughed a lot and told me that it was really going to be something since I knew nothing about medicine. But I was not nervous. I kind of had the impression that it was all a game or that we were going to be given some psychological test to take. The classroom was very large. I think it was the largest in the school. I was sitting in the third row, but the exam had not yet begun.
