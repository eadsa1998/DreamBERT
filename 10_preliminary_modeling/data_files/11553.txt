Was getting ready to play basketball in a big gym that looked brand new. Had a little trouble about getting my uniform but finally secured one. Remember a lot of running around on the court and in the locker room. Recall some actual playing and then leaving the arena with an old friend same age as me. We had two girls around our age, mine being a blond. My date had to get home for some reason, but we were having trouble locating the house even though she lived in it. Finally we reached a street where the names on the right hand side were set high above the street due to the terrain in that territory. We spotted the house, but my friend drove on past. Then he turned around and came back and I took her in. Fade out.
