["More rooms"]  I am in some house. It is small and old. It has two tiny bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. I am walking through the rooms to see where the bedrooms are. As I walk through the house, I keep finding more rooms. One is a tiny thing  where the floor is rotten through. I look down and see a busy industrial establishment. A large truck drives through as I watch. I wonder if the exhaust fumes come up into my house. I see Lucy walking near this room and am concerned she will fall through the rotten spaces in the floor. In the kitchen I see a hutch with things on it. I want to move it so it will look better. I go into another room, surprised to find another one. Terence is around somewhere.
