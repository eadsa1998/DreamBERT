I'm at some vacation resort. I've joined my friends, Mary, Lucy, Rochelle, probably Katrina. I am in a room next to Rochelle's. I'm putting lipstick on and also coloring in the flame designs on the wall. I don't know how to do it free hand but I can copy what's there OK. I see a movie through a window that Rochelle has starred in. I'm impressed, and a little envious. Here I thought I was the one doing great things, and here it is her that's working and famous. So we're all going out to eat in the next room. We've got a station wagon and we have to go down some stairs. I physically push and pull the car down the stairs. Mary stands in front to help if I need it. I am amazed I'm able to do it myself. We push the car right into a rowdy gang of boys/men, Ringo Starr and others. They snicker and decide they need to teach us a lesson. I pass them, hoping they'll go away. They follow. I go look out a window with my camera to take a picture of the lovely water (a river). I see reflected in the window glass these guys coming up on me. They gather and talk about how they are going to rape me and hurt me until I tell them something. I turn to them. Suddenly it rains, coming through the open window, drenching everything. I hide under a blowing curtain to not get so wet. A short guy in a leather jacket is going to rape me first. He walks up to me. I say to them all, "If you're going to rape and hurt me, then I will simply get stubborn and shut down. I'll never talk. But if we talk this out, I may tell you." They cough. My back is to the wall. I'm in trouble. This vacation is ruined. I think, "Oh well, no room later out of the rain for me. They'll fix that." Then I remember my friends. I can bunk in with them. I'll be out of the rain at least.
