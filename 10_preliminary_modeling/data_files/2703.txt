I am a white woman, but have lived for years as a sort of servant/family member in a Chinese family. I have a tiny old room filled with all my possessions from the years. There's not anything worth much, just sentimental value. I go to a fair, where white people are, and stroll among the booths. I see pink, crystal-like rocks that are crafted into little souvenir dolls, and I see photos, each wrapped in a plastic wrap, jewelry, etc. I choose not to buy anything. People sort of expected that of me; I never do "the ordinary." I now am walking back to my home and I see a vast ocean, a beautiful blue color. The color is quite special and I am entranced by it. I see a whale fluking his tail (tale) and then feeding right at the line where the gray shallow water and the blue deep water meet. I feel intense joy at the privilege of seeing this beauty. I am so drawn to it that I feel pulled like a lemming to swim out in it and drown - suicide, drown myself under the blue water, being swallowed by the whale. It's scary. Suddenly I turn and realize there is a man standing right behind me, ready to stop me if I choose to jump into the ocean. I notice his eyes are exactly the same shade of blue as the ocean. I am totally drawn to him. We sit and talk. He says, "Let's get married." I hesitate. We're strangers, but I know he's the one I trust. I say yes. I take him home with me to my Chinese family.
