I was at working at the gas station, and a good looking fellow drove in in a golden colored Packard. Somehow he let me know that he was the fellow who had robbed several gas stations and stolen a stamp machine from a friend of mine. He then told me that he hadn't intended to rob the station, but when he saw how easy it would be and thought how much money was available that he just threatened the attendant and took the money. He didn't mention the stamp machine. I put gas in his car, and he paid me and left.
