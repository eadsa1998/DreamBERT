With Father Andrew &amp; Donna in town: great big fire; tremendous screaming "Lord save us." The fire destroys huge section of the town, but we remain safe outside the fire. For a while it looked like cathedral was on fire too, but it was saved on time. Father Andrew is calm and he looks older and wears steel-rimmed glasses. He says You are too impetuous" We go to a restaurant and eat ice cream together. -- With Frank on a lake that is frozen we ski around on the ice; it is just barely thick enough; Frank cracks through in a shallow place and wades upstream. --At the Palmer's: reading movie column; feel removed, not part of group.
