["7th and forgiveness."] I am tired and driving in a cute red car. I am traveling the four lane highways, rounding the curves and making good speed. I feel good about driving. Now I come to an intersection on a smaller two lane highway. I am turning right. A car crashes into me. My windshield is cracked. I pull over to the right edge of the road. I pick up a cell phone and push a button which connects me with the insurance man. I tell him the windshield is smashed, like graveled glass. But as I look at it. It really is cracked like a spider web design. I then say my left window is also cracked. I am then surprised to see that the left passenger back window is also cracked. He asks, where are you. I say just a minute and back the car back to the intersection. I look up at the signpost. I am at the corner of 7th and Forgiveness I say. I chuckle at the symbolism of the street name. Then I go to a small cabin in an orchard. I lie down on the couch. To recoup from the accident. A man named Mike comes in. Charla has gone out to play. A woman is there, being helpful. The man lies on the couch with me, his head at the opposite end of the couch. We talk in a friendly way. We like each other. I tell him of my dreams. He tells me of his. It is pleasant.
