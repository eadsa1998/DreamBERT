I was in Runescape and it was real life. Jayson, Ezra and I were in the wilderness and there were these guys who were strong so we ran but Ezra and Jayson got caught. I started climbing a fence behind this court and the guys were talking about me but I slipped and they heard. I tried to hide but they saw me and they dropped us out in the middle of nowhere and I met up with Ezra and Jayson and we found this old building.
