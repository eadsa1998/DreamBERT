The setting was in an unfamiliar home. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be my home or my sister's. I had been busy arranging the furniture, and it seemed as if the house were incompletely settled, and that some thought was being given to purchasing new furniture to complete the arrangement or else to rearrange the existing furniture to give it a different pattern. At one point in the dream my Aunt Mary was present and it seemed as if either my wife or my sister said something to the youngest child (who probably would have been about 4 or 5) and asked the child if it would be all right for Aunt Mary to use the youngster's toothbrush, as she had none available. The child agreed and then it seemed as if my aunt were commenting about the inadequacy of the furniture; saying something was going to have to be done to make it more livable. At another point I remember standing on the back of a chair to do something with this furniture arrangement and nearly toppled over, and this was given as an example of how the furniture should be better supported.
