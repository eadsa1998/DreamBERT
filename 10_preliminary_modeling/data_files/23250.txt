I am in China, in the summer program at Hunan Medical University.  The program is a little different from before; now it is split into two consecutive sessions.  I'm not sure whether there are two courses in each sessions or only one, nor am I sure whether I am teaching in the first one.  In any case, I am not prepared to teach in the second session, and it is about a week before that session is to start.  I tell Martha Tuttle that I cannot teach in that session because I don't have time to prepare a class, and I didn't bring any materials with me.  I tell her I will stay and participate in other activities and perhaps give two or three special lectures on topics of my choosing; if that is not possible, I will go home.  I expect her to be upset, but she doesn't seem to be.
