I cannot remember the details of the dream except that my mother had to go to jail for something that I knew she hadn't done. It was about 6 o'clock in the morning and she wanted to drive to jail alone but I insisted that I'd take her. She felt very badly about having to go to jail, and I tried to comfort her. When I went out to get the car, I couldn't back out of the driveway because a black car was parked horizontally across the driveway. I wasn't very worried about my mother having to go to jail because I was positive she was innocent.
