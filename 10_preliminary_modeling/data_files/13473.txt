I went to some place with Dad and I ordered chocolate chip pancakes with chocolate sauce (which meant chocolate ice-cream). When it was delivered it was a small piece of something and it had corn in it. I said I couldn't complain and Dad wouldn't complain for me. There was something to do with David Anders.
