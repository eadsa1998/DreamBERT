I caught a man violating the traffic laws. I was a cop. He tried to bribe me. He gave me a dollar bill and the other side was a $25. There was a gang putting acid on people's heads. They put acid on Audrey's, Bobbie's and Franklin's and Donna's head. I got after them. They put some on my head. So I grabbed the solution and put some on his head and face and got away. I saw Mother putting some on our baby's head. I threw lumps of coal at her. There was a man doing some stunts in the sky. He came down and there was a string tied to his back which took him up. Hank S. lived in Bratine. I saw two silver dollars and two gold dollars on a slant that someone bought an item from him and left the money.
