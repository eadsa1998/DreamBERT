Here is a family. They sell things. They go from town to town, gather up a work crew and pay them to work. We hawk up a crew, tell them to go buy some food and we will reimburse them. The mom tells them an economical way of buying so they get more for their money. Then she tells them to line up at the washing machines and she'll wash their clothes. They do and one of the men notices the washers are broken. A hose or pipe in the back is broken. The older man in the family shakes his head. It can't be fixed. It's the pipe. The father tries to talk him into it. The old man bemoans the use of pipe. He says, "It's made of hydrochloric acid." The family, he says, does a good thing. "We sell animals all over the country. They grow and multiply. Out of 100, comes 500 and a return of 5. That we keep for our own." He mentions the chickens, the sweet chickens, and how many have died from the poison in the pipes that we've sold with them. He is sad. Then the mother goes into a house. It's a scary house. There are halloween things there, spiders etc. She sees a picture on the wall. It's not clear. She asks for it to be clearer. The wall tries again. It's not clear. She tries to see it. Then she asks the older man to made it clearer with his dark room skills. He does. The picture shows on the wall. The woman/me is so frightened that she refuses to look. She covers her face with her hands and screams and screams. She thinks, "It's probably a picture of me dead, dressed like zombie." The room is very frightening (I wake up hearing the screams in my mind. There is a dream before this one that I am semi-aware of...I was so sleepy, that I just let it slip by. Before I went to sleep tonight, I asked for my dreams to tell me why I choose to stop enjoyment of an orgasm. After the lst dream of night, I asked for message to be clearer).
