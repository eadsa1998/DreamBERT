I was sitting in the kitchen at the table and there was a large crowd of people in the room with me. My mother was at the stove cooking. Through the open door I saw my brother-in-law, from out of town, and I told my mother she was in for a surprise. My brother-in-law came through the door and then I looked over at my mother, but she wasn't there anymore. In her place was my sister, the brother-in-law's wife. They each let out with a whoop and kissed each other.
