There has been a terrible accident in which many children were killed; we are in a restaurant and are so upset we cannot eat for a while; later they bring in a huge feast and we begin to eat again. shift: I am with a tall handsome young man (who looks like my fiance from Vienna who died in '42). We are walking in a huge parade: I walk with my young man for a while, then see my father from a balcony as he comes out of the house. I see my father and my brother, as a little boy, coming out of the house, but suddenly the balcony collapses (no one hurt) and I cannot find my young man; I run ahead looking for him (poignant feeling of loss).
