There were tons of people in the high school stadium, and they were all waiting for two kids fighting. The track coach told me earlier that I couldn't run ever because I wasn't at spring break practice. I got really mad and went to his office. His office was a room outside, across from the stadium full of people. I told him to come out and he did and we fought. I kicked his ass. He fell down and everyone in the stadium went crazy because I beat him up. Then I cried really hard and my 6th grade principal heard me and I cried because I still wanted to run. And then he came over and said I was a good fighter and I should run more.
