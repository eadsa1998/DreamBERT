I am marrying Ernie. I am surprised. He is seated in a chair. He says to me, come here and sit on my lap. I feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. I gingerly sit, saying, I'm too fat. He says no, its OK. It feels fine. I say I don't want to hurt you. I weigh 148 lbs. His mother is near by. She says come here and we'll talk. She is welcoming me into the family. I notice Ginny isn't around and wonder where she is. I remember Ernie is still married to her and wonder if this is a bigamist situation. We marry. I realize this means we'll have a sexual relationship. I think about Howard. I wonder if it will be better with Ernie.
