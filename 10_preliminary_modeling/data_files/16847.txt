I was out late. I met a guy who said he had a classic vintage bottle of wine - a very famous one. The trouble was, he said, he had opened it a while ago, poured one glass, then re-corked it. But he said it should still be ok. I asked how long ago this was, and he admitted it was years ago. He gave me the wine so I could try it. I took it 'home' (which in the dream was a cluttered wooden house) and opened it in the early hours of the morning. It smelt absolutely rancid.
