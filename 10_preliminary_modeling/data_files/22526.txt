The first dream started when I was in a room with a friend who goes to my university (he is in another field) and we were together in the first two years before the university. In my dream it seems to me that I was like a spectator. he couldn't see me. He was laughing very loudly and was smoking a lot (in real life I have never seen him smoke and he has always considered me as a good friend only). In the dream, however, he hid behind some stairs and when I went through the street (it wasn't any place I know, as I remember), he would tell me compliments. The dream ended there.
