I looked into a tavern and saw a neighborhood girl whom I like. I ran across the street to my car, and before entering it, I looked around to be sure she was watching. I jumped into the car and stomped on the accelerator and went roaring down the street. I said to a friend who was walking down the street, "I must be doing a hundred." He laughed and said, "Oh, you're only doing fifty." I looked at the speedometer and was surprised and rather shocked to see that he was right. I then pulled into my driveway and went into the house.
