I had a dream where I was traveling across country by myself. I had stopped in Michigan and was staying at some unknown rich people's house, a man, his wife and their daughter. Everything was fine until the man became very frightening and tried to chase me. I ran to the next door neighbors, who protected me. The man had killed his daughter. For some reason, I knew I had to leave the neighbors because it was no longer safe. I walked down the street but the man and a friend of his chased me. I ran to a house where an old Indian woman lived and she let me in. The man was trying to get in the windows and doors and finally climbed on the roof to come down the chimney. He made it in the house and I grabbed a knife and so did he. We started dueling and somehow I got away and ran outside. Some unknown man in a car stopped and I jumped in and we drove away. He gave me a green key and said it was to his house.
