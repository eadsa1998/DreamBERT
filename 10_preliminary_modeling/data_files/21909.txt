My sister Mary and Ann and Steve were cleaning up the debris in the yard. I tried to get my sister to come into the garage, but she wouldn't go in. I looked at a small three and there were ripe cherries left over from the past winter. I picked them. There was also a peach on the cherry tree. I looked at it and it was not so good. I threw it at a rabbit sitting on the road. Bob and I picked up a few rocks and threw it at the rabbit.
