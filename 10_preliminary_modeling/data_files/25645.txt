 My friend Fran Susse gives birth to two fawns. The 24-hour period before the birth was interesting. I am flying in a very small plane. I pray the prayer for automobiles for the plane, substituting plane words for car words. The pilot of the plane is a woman. The plane slowly goes down and crashes in a cornfield. It is the pilot's fault, because she took a short cut. I am unhurt. The wing of the plane was knocked off. I am outside the plane on the ground. The body of the plane is a caterpillar-like structure, enclosed in steel bars. I go and help people out of the plane. The pilot whines, saying she needs to be able to fly again. She forgot or ignored a security check. She got into a situation where she had to restart or turn off or on an engine, but she couldn't do this because she was afraid the other engine would fail.
