Sort of that same house, only back further to the living area and bedrooms. Relatives are arriving. Aunt Naomi is there. A naked man is standing in the hall about to go into his bedroom. He's chatting with some other men and all I see is his back. I notice it looks very nice, broad shoulders, firm butt and then I say, "Hey, you can't expect to just say hello to my Aunt like that." Aunt Naomi gets embarrassed and turns into another bedroom (my father or Dwight) to avoid staring at him. I go into the next room and see several couch beds. Grandma Mildred and a female cousin are seated and they look exhausted, staring, tired eyes. I say, "You look so tired! Lie down and rest." My cousin is eating dip from a steaming hot bowl. It burns her mouth, but she keeps trying. Behind her, cuddled up in blankets, is my father sort of laughing at my cousin.
