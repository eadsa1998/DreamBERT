The Birds are preparing for a performance. I notice that Merle looks very good-looking. I wonder why I hadn't noticed that before. He offers for us to have a finale dinner after the 2-day show at the expense of his poetry club called Beef o'Poetry. Just as he offers it, two other offers come in. A dance teacher, Lucy, who I call Vern, offers a night out for dinner. I put my arm around her and pat her shoulder when I call her name, "Vern." Merle is a little annoyed. Lucy is there. Later after the show, I see a room where lots of leftover food has been put on two tables. I want to use up the food so it won't go to waste. I carry out carrot sticks, relishes, and biscuits and butter to place on a table where Dwight of Counseling and Hank and other people are. I start to put the basket down, and I see a huge tray of biscuits, so I move my stuff further down the table because I want it to be eaten and not come back to me or go to waste.
