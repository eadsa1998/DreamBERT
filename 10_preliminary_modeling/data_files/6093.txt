My first dream was the night before I had to participate in the psychology questionnaire. I had a dream that I went to work before the questionnaire was given and that I didn't make it back on time to participate. I work in Newton, so in my dream the green line station was "back of Walgreens" (in reality it is not). I was so confused in the dream and so upset that I missed the questionnaire and the five points that went along with it.
