I was with Ezra and someone. There was music playing and A Glass of Champagne came on but it was slow. I sang along and at the nickelodeon-y bit, I 'sang' it. I watched Moon and Sam Rockwell was on a big spaceship in the sky that was blimp like. It only made $6000 because everyone downloaded it instead of going to the cinema. I was telling Mom that it should've done well.
