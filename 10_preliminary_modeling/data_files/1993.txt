Now I am to be tested. I am told I must cross this deep canyon on a tightrope. If I fall, I'm dead. I accept the challenge. I tell myself I must concentrate one step at a time. I wonder if I can do it. I stand out and then slip and fall. I grab for the rope and catch it and hang by my hands. I go the rest of the way hand over hand, swinging my body for momentum. The rhythm was important. I get to the other side and crawl up onto the land. It is hard and I strain to get a good grip. Finally I am safely over to the other side. Then I see flames. My next test is to permit the flames to cover me, engulf me and see if I can stand the heat. I let that happen and can handle it. I am standing alone on this barren, rocky cliff and then I see a huge, ugly guy. I ask him who he is. He grabs me and holds me to him. I feel like a prisoner, trapped. I decide to try and trick him. I say, "I'll bet I can go the tight rope walk again, want to see?" I figured he can't follow me there, it's so dangerous. I go to the edge to prepare. There is water filled in the canyon. I think about swimming. He changes into a smaller, more handsome man. I say, "Who are you?" He says he's the same guy, but he changes every once in a while so he won't get lonely. I sense an Indian man standing off in the distance. Now I am told to come to the meeting, a reprieve from the tightrope. I say, "What meeting?" They are going to study my case. It's like a group therapy meeting and I'm the patient. Then it drifts into a teacher/counselor staff meeting. Michael R and Roy S are in another office talking about how soundproof the windows are. Then a teacher brings in some cards for the staff to critique. I glance at some and nod. I've seen them before. One has a picture of a family. I see a girl in a pink dress. "Co-dependency stuff," I realize.
