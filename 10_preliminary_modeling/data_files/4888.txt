I and a woman are walking. We hop from one hillock or bump to another. Now we are in a yarn shop. I am looking at the colors, searching for specific shades of pink and purple that I saw in this magnificent sunset. I see the colors I want. Then when I pull them down from the hooks on the wall, the colors aren't as pretty. I am frustrated. I try again. Finally, I have something close to the right colors. I am going to make (crochet) a shawl. We go back outside.
