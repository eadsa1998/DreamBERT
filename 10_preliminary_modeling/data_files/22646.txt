I dreamt about my family -- my mother, my 18-year-old brother, and my grandfather who is 84. We were in the country looking for a place to stay overnight, and we looked constantly until we found a place to stay, but there were only three beds, and the landlady promised she would arrange this matter. Then we went into a room that looked like part of a hotel, and I looked in the mirror and realized that my upper lip was split. My grandpa advised me to close it with a staple, and he himself applied it through my nose. The strange thing about this is that I realized that no blood was coming out and that it didn't hurt. At the end of the day I felt the metal in the staple and its coolness and from rubbing it with my tongue, blood started to come out and I decided to take it off. I think I dreamt this because during the day I went to Chaclacayo with my family, looking for lodging. And then we had lunch at a restaurant and we ate steak and fried potatoes, and my plate was late in coming and my grandfather cut a piece of meat and gave it to me on a fork. And the fork made me shiver, because it was one of those cheap ones which have a metallic taste.
