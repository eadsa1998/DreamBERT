I was standing in the dining room at Mom's, watching TV. The second Twilight movie was on, and we watched it for an hour, but all they did was sing and it had nothing to do with Twilight. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were in it. But then Kristen Stewart was Leighton Meester but she looked really gross and Mom and Darren said that she was really ugly. I realized that it was a preview. I was telling Mom that the books were addictive, but the movies suck. Dad picked Ezra up to go somewhere. It was raining and really late. In the morning, Mom took me to university as she was taking Ezra to something up that way. She dropped me off at the train station and said she would get me in a second. Then it was World of Warcraft and I was waiting at the edge of the platform. This level 10 called [what looks like Thedd, but it's messy] was getting attacked by Murlocs and crabs. I killed them. It was nearly time for my class to start, so I called Mom and she said something I can't read, but it was on Facebook and there was something about a movie and I assumed it was a bug. My car was now there and I drove it to the other side and hit the wall. The guy next to me gave me the key to his car and took mine. I tried to get in the back. I think it says 'quick fingers'. I was then at Nana's at the table and there was a $10 Royal Show thing. There was something about long hair and a joke about something I can't read.
