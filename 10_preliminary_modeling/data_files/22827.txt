Daddy, Jimmy Duggan, someone else, and I are coming home from somewhere, at night.  Daddy tells me I can drive Jimmy's car and he will drive the other one, which is a bronze-colored Ford, about a '53 or '54 model, but very shiny and pretty, with a lot of chrome, including one very wide strip along the side.  I ask him if I might drive this one, and he says yes.  I then ask him if we aren't stealing this car.  He says no, it belongs to a friend of ours who doesn't mind our driving it.  It has a semi-automatic transmission.  The clutch is also bronze and chrome and very pretty, with an odd shape like a shield or something, and letters that say "For use only in reverse."  Jimmy rides with me.  Pretty soon we are successful in picking up about 4 girls.  I tickle the back of the one in the front.  She likes it, so I tickle her stomach.  But Jimmy, who is now Joe Duggan, doesn't go for that.
