Abner has gained a lot of weight. He and his wife are kissing and loving. I feel a little envious. Dora asks me to provide the entertainment for some scouting event. I ask if a person singing and playing the guitar is enough or would they prefer a band? A man at the opposite end of a long table says to me, "Come here a minute." I laugh and say,"It better be good to make me walk all that way." He hesitates and then walks to me to whisper, "Can I stay here for awhile?" He didn't have anywhere to sleep. I say, "It's not my house. It's up to her."
