This dream began after I was awakened early in the morning then went back to sleep for about 45 minutes. The dream began with me entering the subway station where I usually begin the commute home at every evening. Many people filled the station as they waited for their trains to appear and take them home. As I was waiting for my train in the crowded station, my employer appeared next to me out of the crowd. We began conversing about a legal case (my employer is an attorney) that was taking place in the state of Oregon. As we were talking, my employer excused himself so he could make a purchase at the newsstand. While he was gone, I noticed that it had been 45 minutes since I entered the train station and my train still hadn't arrived. My employer returned to where I was standing and we resumed our conversation about something taking place in Oregon. He stated that a court in Oregon wouldn't send him a piece of information that he needed because the people in Oregon don't like east-coast attorneys. At this time I began thinking of the forests and sylvan landscapes of Oregon. I also noticed that it had been over an hour that had passsed, and my train still hadn't arrived. At about this point I woke up.
