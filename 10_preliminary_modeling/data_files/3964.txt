["Hundreds of Arthritic feet."]  Mateo is very upset with himself and is isolating from other people. Charlotte and I are going from one house to another, looking for this man. I see an image of hundreds of naked arthritics seated in rows on wooden planks with their feet sticking through holes in the wood to dangle underneath in the cold murky water. It's like a giant foot stockade. I am underwater, looking at the many pairs of feet, deformed with arthritis and cold and painful. I feel cold as the water myself.  And sad.
