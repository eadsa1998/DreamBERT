I was in A-- (T--) in the home that we lived in there. I went through the house looking at all the familiar objects, remembering them. It seemed strange seeing those things again, and knowing that we didn't live there any more. As I went out into the screened-in porch I thought of the time my father took a picture of me reading a magazine while I was sitting on the bed. Then I went next door to see Mrs. S--, age 69, but she wasn't home.
