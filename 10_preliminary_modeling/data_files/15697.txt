I found a short film that Dan Palmer did. It kept becoming real life though and Co-Worker-F-06 was in it and she was with her boyfriend. We were using this room, playing music which was The National. I was playing GTA V on the TV. There was a pool just outside. Some other people came and looked like they were going to turn the music off and I said "don't even think of turning the music off" and this black guy looked at me like 'whatever' but I just stared angrily and his face softened. They didn't do anything. Co-Worker-F-06 stripped down and went for a swim. Later, she was talking to some guy with her boyfriend and he asked her who he was and she said 'my brother' and he was like 'what'. It was her breaking up with him. Later I was going back to somewhere and went in and there were zombies everywhere. Then it was back to it being a short and it had been a really tense kind of build-up and you wanted to know how it ended and then it just turned to zombies. I really liked it and gave it an 8/10 and favourited it on FilmForum. Jordy had watched it ages ago and had posted a positive review. The short had been made years ago but was only recently added to IMDb. I was thinking that those guys really loved their zombies. There was also a glimpse of Stalled at the end and Dan Palmer looked really hot and I was excited about Stalled. Also at some point I was on the Eiffel Tower and you had to win tickets from games to get higher. I got a burger and it took me 2 hours to eat it. When I realised how long it'd been I wondered how it was still warm. People kept talking to me and annoying me.
