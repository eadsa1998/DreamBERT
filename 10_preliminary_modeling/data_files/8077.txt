Went to see the condo I used to own at North Point Bay. I went down to the end of the drive/street and then began to back into the driveway of my old driveway or the one next to it. I realized I couldn't or shouldn't as the current owners were there. There was some kind of community picnic going on. The residents were participating in special activities. I was trying to walk through. not sure where I was going. and trying to stay out of the way. There was something to do with me climbing up a tall ladder or something and something to do with a swimming pool or water. I noticed two attractive men sitting and talking. As I walked by, one nudged the other and said they should try to chat with me. I turned around and smiled. He then asked me if I lived there and I said no. I turned around and kept walking, wondering if I should go back and talk with them more or if they would come after me to try to talk with me. They didn't.
