I was in an unfamiliar convenience store with an adult male who was mentally challenged. We were in the section of the store where the beverages were kept. (The person I was with slightly reminded me of Dustin Hoffman's character in the film Rain Man.) The man took a bottle of coke and I took one also. I also took a pack of cigarettes. I went to the cashier who was a male, approximately 25 years old, and wearing a red shirt. I placed the items on the counter and then took a cigarette lighter from a box full of lighters nearby. The cashier started the process of scanning the items to total up their price. I was nervous because I was under 18 and trying to buy cigarettes but he didn't demand to see ID. As I left the store, the mentally challenged man suddenly vanished from the dream and I became terrified that my parents would discover I had purchased cigarettes.
