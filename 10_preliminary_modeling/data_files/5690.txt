[1997-07-17] I was dreaming that I was going to a wedding in the afternoon, but that evening, in the dream, I was also going to be attending a play with several family members, but boy, I realized that was going to be a pretty busy day to get through and I did offer a rebate of my ticket at least if for some reason it wasn't used, so evidently I thought that attending 2 things in one day was going to be a lot.
