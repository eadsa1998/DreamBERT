I taught my housemate's girlfriend Suzie something about Christianity in our backyard.  There was something about an Asian family.  I sat and read with my head against the bricks.  My annoying acquaintance Herb wouldn't leave me alone and I got very pissed, so much so that I amazingly grabbed him by the belt and collar and threw him out.  He acted emotionally hurt.  I explained everything to him in cold hard truth.  I yelled apologies for not telling him sooner.
