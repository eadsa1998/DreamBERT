I dreamt about the shoe store where I work every Saturday. When I started to look for a shoe for the customer I was waiting on, I couldn't find the shoe that I wanted. I became very angry because the stock was mixed up. Then suddenly the thing that was hindering me from finding the shoes was dresses in front of the shoe shelves. I was worried because the customer who was a lady seemed to be getting angry at me for taking so long to find her shoe. I went up to Dad who was the manager and complained about the condition of the stock. He told me where to find the shoe. Even then I couldn't get it. I hurriedly started sorting through pots and pans and all sorts of articles. I couldn't understand why they should be in a shoe store. I was very angry at my father for putting so much junk in a shoe store. I could hear the customer complaining about inefficiency.
