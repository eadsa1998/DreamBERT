 I'm at Washington University with my friend Hilary Nano and either Stephen Ramos or Niles Zelling. We're in an old gym with fully tile-like floors playing basketball. I remember looking down at the court from balcony. We aren't making very m any shots. My arms feel rubbery. There is a pole vault contraption built into the floor. It pops up when you step or bounce a ball on it. We walk out the north side of the gym. My friend Nate Nelling is with us. We are going to visit our friend Tony Kramer who goes to Washington, because I know Nate will want to. Stephen is there and I know he doesn't want to go but we are going anyways, because Nate wants to go. We start walking. There is a monastery on our right and people are sitting; we can see though a window. A man and a woman walk across the path. They are older, and neither is wearing shirts. The woman is fat, and looks like a man. I can't distinguish her breasts. <br/
