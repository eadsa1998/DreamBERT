I am in a large courtyard and observe a bus approaching a large Gothic doorway leading into yard. It careens through, but the curve of the left arch is hit by the bus and a huge piece of stone starts to fall. Some people are standing nearby and I shout a warning. They don't seem to hear. But the piece falls and touches no one.
