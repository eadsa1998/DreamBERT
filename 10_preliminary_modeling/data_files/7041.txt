We were waiting for my cousins who were to come to dinner at 12. They had not arrived at 15 minutes past the hour. I wonder if they had lost the way. Finally at their hotel asked two tourists wearing black gloves if they knew the Strongs. They didn't. Go to registration desk and ask to speak to my cousins. He hands me a peculiar phone and I hear a man's voice say, "This is Madorah" but phones goes dead. At last they're here.
