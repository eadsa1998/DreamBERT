I was about to take a plane to London with three of my friends. But the plane had already taken off. We followed the plane by car through the streets and finally managed to jump in it. It was a small plane without one [illegible]. Since there was no pilot, friend A had to fly the plane. When I looked down, I saw a map. We were flying over the big map. I could see the details, such as the mountains, the rivers, the deserts, and the forests, but not a single town. They looked real, but I knew that it was a map. We flew over the Middle East through Eastern Europe. Finally, we reached Siberia. All I could see was the frozen forest and I felt chilly. We wore as many clothes as possible. Then, we noticed that we were short of fuel. So friend A decided to make a landing. Landing went smoothly, and we landed in some unknown town. We went to search for fuel and came across a mansion. We entered the mansion and found out that it had been deserted. Somehow I felt alarmed and started running. There was no light inside, but something like lightning flashed once in a while. I knew that someone was following me. I could hear the footsteps. I finally got out from the mansion and found a hut. My friends were already there and there was also a middle-aged man. We asked him if he could spare us fuel. He wanted something (I can't recall what it was) in return. When we were ready to go on our journey, we saw the fuel tank of the middle-aged man blow up with a terrific explosion. Someone had shot the tank with a machine gun from the bush. No one was hurt.
