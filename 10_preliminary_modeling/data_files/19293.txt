It was in my yard at my house. There were two of my friends and three people I didn't know. We are all about the same age. The people I didn't know faces kept changing what they looked like. Then it switched to my friend in a garden with yellow flowers playing with a dog. It was a pleasant dream then everyone went inside my house.
