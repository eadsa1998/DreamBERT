I was going to Spain with Ms. Hollander again and we were leaving Friday, and then I wasn't even packed. And I was like trying to mix something with an odd-looking mixer -- it was like a box mixer -- and there were like three VCR's and a TV and I was mixing some audio. And Mom was like complaining that I wasn't doing the faders right or something, so I got up and I left. I shut everything off and I left, and I walked around the park and then I came back and I told Mom that when she did that, it reminded me of when I was in Mass Media and stuff, and I started mixing it again and then I slowly faded into consciousness, kind of like a fading in and out the audio.
