[1997-05-19] We were in the kitchen of my parents' house it was about 2PM and I was sitting at the table and a CRIS volunteer was there and she was printing out in Braille. She had always wanted to help but she was concerned and asked if it was coming out readable and I said "yes." I was reading it with my fingers and it was okay, there were some reversals but I could still figure it out so I didn't tell her that I couldn't figure it out, she had reversed a lot of Es and Is but I didn't say anything. She said "can you read the second line?" and I said "yes I could."
