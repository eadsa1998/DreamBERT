Thousands of black Africans in native costumes are attacking. One has a gun and we shoot him and he shoots us. He laughs and says, "We can't be killed and our numbers are endless." I realize he's right and there's only one hope. Now I have a Catholic priest's frock on and I play a peace hymn on an out-of-tune organ/piano. I play it loud, hoping to get others to sing and then the killing will stop.
