Denny Latimer was hitting a golf ball around. He was hitting it back and forth by me. I was going to catch it on two occasions, but it came by too fast and I thought it would sting my hands. He was hitting the ball as it flew by him like a fellow would hit it with a baseball bat. Then Denny turned into Bob Hope and he had on a dress like and his pants shown below the dress. I was looking him over, what an outfit for golfing. I was also thinking of his fame, how he lived and he was just a human like me, but was well known and famous. His aunt was staying with him in one of the cottages. Mike Polca bought a home in Rivertown. There was a barn or stable on the lot. it was $1,800. Mike didn't want it. Hilts was going to buy it. He said that would give him more room for his machines. I looked at the barn. It was kind of narrow. Dave Cooper was working in a place. He got a crate and told me to help him to carry it up the steps. He walked up fast and I had a hard time to keep up with him. The boy that worked in that stockroom would give signals that he didn't want a certain party to know there was a certain package for a certain party.
