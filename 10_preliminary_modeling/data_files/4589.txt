["The literary quad."] Richard L. is a literary quad. He's in a wheelchair. He's won a literary award. I like him. He loves me. He wants to have a relationship. I come close to him to tell him congratulations on his award. I tell him this one is his and maybe the next one will be mine. We're both equally good and will share in our awards. He keeps trying to inch closer to me. I then hug him and kiss him on the lips. He is thrilled and ends up throwing himself out of his chair and now is lying on top of me. We love each other. He is so very happy. I am happy too, not as happy as he is but content. I remember a more perfect male who I wanted to have one perfect dance/swim with him. I knew he was too perfect and beautiful for me to keep, but I wanted the one romantic dance. But after he promised it to me, he fell asleep. I ran up the tiered path crying. His mother watched, sad for me.
