I am going up in an airplane, high, high up, and coming straight down and then learning to pull out before you crash on the ground. I like this experience. Then I land and my "husband," like Bud of the movie "The Abyss," comes over. We go to his place of work, like the counseling department, only in an auditorium setting. He introduces me to the secretary, a large, fat woman and she offers me some potato chips, left over from a welcoming party given for my husband and me. She says to my husband, "Welcome," but she can't come to the party. She can wait in the lounge. My husband is insulted. We leave in a huff. He does take me to the lounge after I say it's OK. The other wives are there and welcome me. We poke around the things there left by our husbands. There are lots of little desk objects like pen sets with little statues on them. A woman's leg and a tower on the same stand. We laugh at this theme as it is on several husband's desks. I want to go to work, but it's clear I'm not wanted. So the wives go in and one says, "Come with me." I don't care, so I follow her. We find an area where not many people are. We are going to write songs together. It's part of the work. She does the music and me the lyrics or she the lyrics and me the music. Jerome comes by. He's the boss and wants to know why we don't sit down where the others are. Later I am driving down a street (maybe M City) and look in an open window and see a small girl, the daughter of my old boyfriend, and wonder if he can give me my truck and I can drive it home today, since I'm back in town this Saturday morning.
