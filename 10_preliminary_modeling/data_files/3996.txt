["Cat Baby"]  I suddenly remember I haven't been feeding the baby for a few days. A girl like Charla is there and I ask her if she did it. She says no. I walk into the bedroom and see the baby in it's crib, still in the swing harness from the day. I get the baby up. I walk around holding the baby in my arms, only now there are two of them. A cat had changed into a baby. The baby that was a cat is plumper and healthier than the other baby. The real baby has red circles under it's eyes. I carry them around with me, one in the crook of each arm. I want to take care of them good, now and am appalled I neglected them so long. I just forgot to take care of them. I walk into another room and with my foot pull out a trundle bed from the couch. I want to put them there to nap. A man is there, he is a neighbor, but we actually live in the same part of the building. His bedroom door is to the right. Which opens into the room I'm in and my bedroom is off the same room on the left.
