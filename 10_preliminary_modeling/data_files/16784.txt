I was in a car with my mother up near the Plantageants' house. There was some kind of problem with the car, and I could hear a noise that wasn't quite normal. The wife was driving, and told me to turn the key in the ignition backward and that should fix the problem. Then, probably not as a direct result of turning the key, the car went flying off the side of the road (staying on its wheels and managing not to hit anything), coming very close to driving into a pond. This next scene seems like it took place in about the same place. I think I have built a saddle for my pony, and I need help, maybe getting the saddle on. I'm in somebody's yard, apparently someone who has a lot of horses and animals of their own. The owners are a Ukrainian woman and her husband, as I soon learn. She doesn't want to come and look at my pony to answer the question. She says to me, "If you consider selling it to me, I'll have to come and look at it," so I told her I would consider it. The next thing I remember, I am in the woman's house with a guinea pig. She tells me that people in certain parts of the world eat guinea pigs. She said that with such calmness and matter-of-factness I supposed she wouldn't be one to blink her eyes if she saw someone trying to put a poor animal on the frying pan. Actually, I wouldn't really have been surprised if guinea pig was her favorite meal. I obviously didn't let her get close to my pig.
