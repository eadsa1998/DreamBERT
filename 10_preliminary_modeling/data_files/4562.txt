["In class with Anastasia."] I decide to sit in on a college course on education. Anastasia is taking the class. The students sit at a long series of tables. They ask me to share what work I'm doing. I say well, I'm not really taking the class, but I did do the first couple of assignments. I tell them I did the work like setting up characters for a play. I think I am interested in working with each student in the assignment in a fair and supportive way.
