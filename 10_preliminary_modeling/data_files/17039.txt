There was-a white, nylon windbreaker that was hanging on a chair, almost as if on display. It was of an old style, maybe from the 1970s or 8Os and of a generic cheap quality. I noted that I liked it a lot, but attributed it as being a little too feminine on account of the color. I thought it would look attractive on one of my two female housemates, and decided to suggest it to them.
