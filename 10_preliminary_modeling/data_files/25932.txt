 I'm crossing the street in Lakeville. There is a traffic police officer there. He says, "One hundred, two hundred, three hundred." A hundred is about equal to one person. When he says this he means of the person to cross the road. Two hundred does not mean two people, it means one person: he just counts in order. I'm on a bicycle. I have someone named Aaron's film. It is too late to drop it off for developing. There is a huge satellite dish by the town that turns.
