I am shocked to realize that the nice girl who was babysitting the children for only an hour ate the children. She is also an alien, with eyes that look like tennis balls. She changes into that shape all of a sudden terrifying me and she roars an awful sound. If you are touched by her, you turn into one too. I am now taking care of a woman who sits meekly in a rocking chair. Suddenly, as I am leaning over her to help her, I drool and grin and the alien head pops on and I roar. Now I am trapped and must stay in the small cabin. I try to lock the doors to keep people out. I don't know who is alien and who isn't. I realize I must kill myself and so must the other woman to save everyone else. I don't want to die but I must. There is no other way. A woman named Mary stands outside calling to me. She says "See, you don't have to kill yourself. I was an alien and now I'm OK." I don't quite believe her and hesitate. What should I do?
