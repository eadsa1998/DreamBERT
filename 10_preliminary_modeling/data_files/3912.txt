["Fighting For My Man."] I am going with a man. He and I are very close, but another woman is trying to take him from me and he seems to be going with her. There is some contest we partake in. Whoever jumps up high enough and touches the ceiling canvas square first wins the man. I am aggressive and fit. The three of us jump and jump and I win out, just barely. The man slowly comes to his senses and says to me. I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that. I can't live without you. I say I know. I am the same way. We embrace with intense love.
