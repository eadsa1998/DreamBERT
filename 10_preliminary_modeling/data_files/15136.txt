It was the first day of semester 2. I had two labs. Mom drove me there and I realized I'd forgotten my lab coat and glasses. I asked Mom for some money and $20 for this math answer book thing. I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Yang had 'showed emotion' when George died. Izzy had long hair and then said she was grateful for it. Someone wanted Bailey to announce something. There were new credits which showed the person's name and then their role (eg, director, producer). Ron Glass as 'Book' was listed.
