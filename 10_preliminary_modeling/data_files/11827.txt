I was still at school and the guys from The Young Ones had come to the school. I caught up with Alexei and later on when I saw him again he gave me and Tiana autographs and took us over to the rest of the guys for autographs and photos. He was dressed as a vampire and was putting on a little show and this weird music was playing. 'House of Fun' then started playing and everyone was like eh? [It was my phone ringing in real life].
