 Tony, the customer from Fishing Haven who staying in a nearby cabin, and three other people rob a Super America. I am with three people. We rob the same store right after he does. He doesn't have a gun. One of us has a gun. A member of my group holds up the teller while his group robs them. They take all the $5 bills being traced. We hold up the same store right after him. We put a gallon of water and a gallon of lemonade in a blue crate like the ones we use at Fishing Haven. We get the $10 bills. We go outside to a pay phone. We need to call a number and get a phone number, and then call that number. It is a slow and cumbersome procedure. The number I get, and am careful to remember and dial is 123-1122, and also 35L8, 10.
