 I'm trying to solve a mystery. I am trying to find a killer. There is a small snake that turns into a huge snake, which is many times the size of a person. There is a boar. The boar and the snake fight. I think the boar wins. There is a ghost, which is nearly invisible, to my left. I catch a glimpse of it, and turn my attention to it. I'm in the basement. Between old bed mattresses I find a little boy. It is my cousin Melvin Redding. Melvin talks about eating a piece of pie and another sweet thing off a tray full of sweets.
