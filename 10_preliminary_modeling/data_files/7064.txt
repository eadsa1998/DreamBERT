He had gone upstairs to sleep again. I went to the foot of the stairs to call him. Woke up several others. We started off with him in a car. I thanked him for bringing me to the lecture but it was a party instead. I found a seat. After a while a man came up to me and asked me to go down in the cellar and get us some coffee but I did not know the way. I must find the G's who were going to take me home. I should have stayed with them. I looked in the bathrooms. Someone else is looking for the hostess to say goodbye. People are getting up to leave. I think I see Mrs. G. She was in the side room at the rear.
