I'm being shown around an institutional venue for some kind of party. Apparently each party guest will be allocated a 'hostess'. The venue is split level and quite large, like a very large hotel suite. The decor is fairly tacky, like a cheap night club. The walls are painted black, and there are fake velvet curtains and covered furniture. I think I know what's going on here (brothel).
