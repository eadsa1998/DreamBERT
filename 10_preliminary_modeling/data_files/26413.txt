 My dad has just called me on the phone, wanting to go fishing. I have told him I didn't want to go. I'm trying to call him back because I do want to go. There is a metal minnow bucket with blue crappie minnows in it. I call 8479----F to contact my dad. I put a tackle box in the back of my truck. There is already one tackle box there. The cover to the box is not fastened tightly. The box opens but does not spill much. The number I dial reaches a hospital after four or six digits. I run out to my truck, which is parked in the main lane of Home Avenue, facing southward. Something happens with an income tax number.
