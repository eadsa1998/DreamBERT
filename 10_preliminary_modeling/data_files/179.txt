I'm with Tom Selleck; we've been somewhere together on some sort of adventure, and come back to town successful and triumphant - even so, it's just us and our other companion (a dark-haired girl, like Barbara Parkins - she's somebody we rescued or picked up along the way.) - whatever we did, nobody knows about it yet, we're just getting back onto the streets and getting ready to go back to normal, I guess. "Barbara" goes off a bit and I can speak to Tom alone. He's wearing a black feather mask like the ones we saw at the Faire. We hug, relieved and tired and satisfied, and I say "I love you", inadvertently. He lets go and draws away just a little, looking askance. I put my hands on his face and say, look it's okay, I don't mean anything bad - just listen to me: show me the truth on your face, let me see the real you, and I'll tell you the truth: I do love you and I'm glad we were together. (I am feeling affectionate and also sure and grounded.) I'm entering the school auditorium, there's an aisle dividing the main floor from the balcony (kind of like the Movie theater, but nicer), and I see the beige/tan fabric on the walls and seats, it matches the carpet even. I usually sit in the balcony, but this time I think I'll try turning right instead and I go down the main floor - which steps down - and I see Cynthia and Linda sitting behind her, one side. So they wave and say hello and I go sit next to Cynthia. They're glad to see me.
