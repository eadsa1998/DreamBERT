I am jogging. I feel I must attempt to go complete around the block. I know it will be tiring, but necessary. As I am jogging, I see a group of people, mostly men, all in a bunch, talking. They have plates that are valuable and are sales men or business men. I have a stack of 6-8 china plates myself, but I'm just carrying them, I'm not trying to sell them. They are looking for the rich old man to do business with...I'm just trying to get around them to continue jogging. As I go by, I see a house/shop with lots of glass/china pretties. I go in. I ask to see the old man. His son says, "I can help you, but most people won't let me, they just want my father." He takes me to see his father. It is a huge house. We go down extremely steep ladder/stairs. I have heels on. Then we are in the basement which is huge, messy and with lots of windows looking out over the fields. I see a crow or raven. He's large. Then I see a whole flock of them, right by the window. I say, "Hello! Hello," at them over and over (like my father tried to teach our crow to talk). The son likes me. He has wire framed round glasses perched on his nose. Suddenly, a lightning, electrical green light saps all around me and I am in a special room where this electrical phenomenon gives me or enhances my special powers. I look at a field of grain. As I look, my powers speed everything up and field is being cut or harvested quickly. Sheep, goats and cows are spared so they can continue to graze and produce.
