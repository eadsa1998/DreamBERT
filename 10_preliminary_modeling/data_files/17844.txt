I was in a sort of entranceway.  I and someone else were headed up the stairs when I saw our pursuer coming in the front door.  I wanted to jump down and go down the other flight of stairs instead, to throw him off or have a better lead if he thought I went up.  I realized the effort was futile, though, as the staircases were right in front view of the glass doors the pursuer was coming through.  He could see me, and going down wouldn't throw him off at all.
