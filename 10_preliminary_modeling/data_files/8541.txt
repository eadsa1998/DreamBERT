I think I was at church, after Mass. I was talking to someone and there people everywhere around me. The person I was talking to pointed to someone and said they were a relative of Marie B. I said, Really? She assured me she was and told me how she knew that. I excused myself and went up to her. As soon as she was finished talking with someone else I introduced myself to her and spoke briefly with her about Marie B. She seemed very cool, aloof, or something - I'm not sure how to describe it. I just told her how much I appreciated Marie B when she was alive and how sad I was to hear about her death.
