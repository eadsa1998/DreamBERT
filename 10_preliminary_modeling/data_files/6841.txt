Find several church envelops for Jan. And Feb. Filled and think no wonder my accounts wouldn't balance. (Repeats an actual occurrence when my accounts were $1 short.) But how did these get left over? Jo., a little boy, hadn't changed his clothes and she told him to go back, bathe and change. I remark how nice that toilet and bath are separate, for I needed to use the latter. Rooms are black and white. See crib and am told they have three, one for each child. (As in J's family.) I say, "how sensible" and speak of advantages of crib over cot. You could push this out the door and let baby have a sunbathe, but I wonder how the rail which dips down in the middle can keep the baby safely in.
