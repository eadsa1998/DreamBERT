["Aliens take over."] I am in a building and am aware that aliens are going to nuke the world. I must create a safe place. I find a bank vault down in the basement. I gather radios and batteries and flashlights and food. I get in the bank vault, leaving the thick door open just a bit so it won't lock me in. Days pass. The radio goes out because everyone is dead. I pile the food garbage in a closet. The place is dark. I wait. Then I peek out the crack of the slightly opened door. I see a small cute alien walking by, carrying a light. As they leave, the light goes to dark. I watch more. Another cute alien with a small white dog with curly fur walk by, standing near the door. They leave. I decide I must go out and explore. Perhaps the radiation is survivable now. I gather up the important supplies and open the door slowly carefully looking around to try and remain not seen.
