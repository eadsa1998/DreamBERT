Driving past a huge dark very modern building that someone told me was a church. From the outside it was very huge and foreboding. When I went inside after driving by several times it was beautiful and very traditional, like a large cathedral that you would find in Europe. The music was very strong but wonderful to listen to. The temperature of the room was very cold. I don't remember ever seeing this place, but I felt very safe.
