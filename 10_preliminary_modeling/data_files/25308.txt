 I'm at the Small Theatre with my friends Kevin Simpson, Edith Sherman, Edith's mother Tracy Sherman, and Edith's boyfriend who is a black man with a child. Two old ladies are working at the concession stand. We get big tubs of popcorn. Kevin gets a spray bottle of melted butter. The theatre seats slide around as the movie plays. People brace themselves by putting one leg in front of the seat and one in back of it. I sit normal, with both my legs in front of the seat. There is a problem with the movie screen. People are supposed to try to climb the curtain around the screen using the knuckles of their index and pinky fingers. I try it. The curtain and screen break and fall down. We can see outside, because the curtain isn't there. We wait for the people to fix the curtain. The Allure family is there. I am sitting down next to the screen. Harmony Allure comes and sits by me. I say to her sarcastically that she must be pretty desperate to sit by me. She sarcastically replies, "Yeah." The movie starts again. We all leave because we don't want to watch it. We go outside. Tom Allure yells at a man driving a truck because the man is scratching the sides of the truck. The sky is black with clouds. There are brilliant light cracks in the clouds that are golden-silver in color. We go to the side of a building where there is a big chalkboard. People paint on it. I talk with Harmony about school. She tells me about how bad her football and German classes were. I tell her I would drop a bad class.
