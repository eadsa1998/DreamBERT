I was in a grocery store wondering if I could make chicken soup. I wondered if you bought a whole chicken and dumped it in a pot of boiling water and let it boil all day and soup happened. It was delicious soup. Then I was wondering if I could put it in old peanut butter jars and little thermoses and have a little each day of the week. I thought I would spend one day cooking a week, but I never did. I was waiting outside with 3 strangers. 2 guys and one girl. It was a shopping mall museum with art hung real close together. They were taking pictures. One guy wanted his picture taken in front of a painting with lots of green. I said, "This is green." A lady asked me did I remember knowing any of the painters and I said one. One contemporary painter, buy you wouldn't be interested in that. I couldn't remember his name. Corinne was wearing blue jeans. She was saying they were old and her favorites. She said there were creases worn into the legs where she'd squat down and lean against the wall of her high school parking lot, smoking cigarettes. She said it was so good to smoke in wrinkled blue jeans. She liked to breathe the smoke in deep. Jasmine was having her evening class party in Ft. Lauderdale. 598 miles away. Alex and I were discussing John Tong, and the guy who makes lists. Elena was looking for her denim skirt. She had a fever. It was hanging on the bathroom door knob.
