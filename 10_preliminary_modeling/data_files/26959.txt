I dreamed that I had a date with one of the younger doctors (age approximately thirty three) on the staff at the hospital in my hometown. I was very happy when I met him at the door. He came in and we sat down and talked for a while. We discussed some of the patients that he had on the floor on which I was working &amp; we decided to go dancing that evening. Then we started out to go dancing.
