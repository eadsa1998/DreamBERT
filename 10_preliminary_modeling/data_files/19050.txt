I'm either reading or writing a report for the commission on research and experimentation. The main point is something, I forget what, is very useful in school. There's also something about my not getting paid for this. I can't seem to catch all of that. For some reason I keep seeing, I keep getting an association of a safety pin being fastened in to something like a sheaf of papers. This was one of he annual meetings in a large city and I was giving this report and thinking that this would now exempt me from having to give a report at the next year's meeting. I can't seem to catch what the problem was, but there is a feeling of going back and forth on some issues, some kind of a debate, like an inner debate. The nearest I can come to it, it reminds me of Ted Fitkin and I arguing as we sometimes do about people getting paid for consulting work. His position is that people get paid by their university and they ought to be happy to do something that they like to do, and my position is that if you don't get paid, eventually you have to settle for the worst people.
