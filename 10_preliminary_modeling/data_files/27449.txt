I dreamed of a girlfriend of mine whom I hadn't seen for two years. The last time I saw her was at her wedding. I dreamed that when I saw her at this time she had acquired much wealth by way of a mink coat, a convertible, and jewels. But, when I asked her if she were now very happy, she cried and told me she would give up everything that she had if only she could have a baby. She cried and told me how worthless all her possessions were to her because of her inability to have a baby.
