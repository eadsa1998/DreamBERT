Wednesday. Two little dark haired boys are sleeping in a huge bed. The littlest one is restless and curls up next to the other one. He gets mad and pushes the little one away. The little one rolls off the bed with a big thump. He gets back in bed and says, "Let's look at the dragons." We then see the wall at the foot of the bed from his point of view. My cousin Sonja and I are in the audience watching. She asks, "What is it?" I say, "You'e never seen the tree leave shadows dance on your wall at night?" The shadows dance. We are hushed and nervous. Then one, then 2, then 4 dragon shapes sit in the trees. One is the little boys teddy bear with horns. "Isn't that cute?," we say. He gets scared and we feel it too. He yells. The only thing we can do is shut our eyes and go to sleep. He clamps his eyes shut tightly and the forms all disappear and it is absolutely silent. He peeks with one eye. It all comes back. He "sleeps" rigidly. His mother comes in with a young lady, his sister. She blows out two candles that had been making the forms and says to the sister, "They've been sleeping here since you've gone from the attic and been to Europe for a year."
