I parked my car in a space in a shop like which was my folk's and my brother parked his beside mine. Charles Ch. and I were in the country. We were by a gate and it opened up. We fell and then jumped up for we thought what if a herd of bulls stampeded us. We looked into the field and sure enough, there were big bulls there. Charles said, "What would you do if the bulls came after you?" I said, I would fly into the air." I flew up real high. When I looked down, it frightened me a little for it was really high. I dropped a little, then stopped myself in the air and flew around a little in the air. I went into the cafeteria to get some ice cream. There were people dressed, especially the 50-year men. Elmer was one of them. Kids were by the tables eating and there were two babies. I tried to make them smile because they were close and looking at me. I seemed to jump high into the air, then I started to come down and when I looked down, I really was high. I came down a ways, then about 100 feet up. I stopped in the air by outstretching my arms and flapped them a little. Then I like floated in the air and was I high.
