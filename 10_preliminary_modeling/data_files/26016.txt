 I'm sitting in a place writing my dreams. There is a woman sitting across from me who seems like my former coworker Jenny but she has dark hair. Some of her friends come, sit on my left for a bit, and then leave. They are getting their hair cut. A woman comes and sits on my left, across from the person, who then is Jenny. Jenny introduces the woman and I. Her name is Kari Johnson. I say to Kari, nonchalantly, "Didn't we sit next to each other in 7th grade?" She says that we did. I tell her I had a dream a couple weeks ago about our 7th grade classmate Kelly Furlong. Kari thinks I am dreaming about Kelly because I'm attracted to her. She doesn't understand what a dream means to me. <br/
