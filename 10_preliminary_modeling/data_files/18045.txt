One day I was climbing a tree and then I fell down and then I went to the river and found an egg. I took it home. I put it in a safe place and soon it hatched. And then I said, "what came out of it". It was a baby crocodile. One day I went to [adult babysitter] Rosa's house with the crocodile and I lost the crocodile for a minute and then I found him again. Well I was glad that I didn't lose him but he was very small. I did everything with him and I took him everywhere but then he died. Well I always remembered that little crocodile . Then one day we went fishing. I found him and he was alive and then I went bike riding with him and finally I just remembered I have to keep pets in a cage so I got a cage from the pet store and I put some things in it. And then I took big rocks and I made a bed for him. Then I put some water in it so he could swim. Then I put some food in a bowl.
