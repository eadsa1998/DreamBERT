I dreamed about next year's school year (sort of). First, I see a pictoral map of QRS campus,which I have seen before but I finally start to understand. It's not really a map though, because I see people moving around and walking into the Prep Academy through it. I walk into a door, around where the library is supposed to be, and it turns into a kind of restaurant. I see it's very cheap, and I'm glad I found it: "Soft drink and one free refill for 99 cents". I wanna go down to the academy to see all the new juniors there, but I don't. There's this girl here who I ask, "Do you wanna dance? I mean, skate is more like it!" and we skate together all around the room, with our normal shoes on although it's like ice skating, and it's fun. Then her older sister comes around and starts saying something about either her or her sister's boyfriend and it sounds like she's complaining. When I leave the building, Chris Farley is standing in the doorway. My father is now there and quotes something from one of Chris's movies or comedy scripts, and Chris laughs. I ask if someone would mind taking my picture with Chris. Then I wake up, and realize he's dead.
