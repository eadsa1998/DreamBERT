In my dream I was walking to my girlfriend's house for a birthday party. She actually moved away in 5th grade. In the dream she was in town for the weekend. She and her dad were in a beach house while her mom, little brother, and aunt were staying in another house, not too far away. On my way to her place, I stopped by her mom, brother, and aunt's beach house. Her brother and his dog came with me. By the time I had gotten to her place, her brother and the dog had become one in the same. Everyone at the party was very quiet and reserved and I felt kind of awkward. She became a dog too and she and her brother began fighting, which was really frustrating because I was trying to reunite them. As the dogs quarreled in a corner of the room, the party turned into one for another old girlfriend of mine. Everyone (none of whom I knew) remained very quiet. Soon the party disbanded, and there were flocks of people there. Her brother was no longer the dog, but himself, and I felt panicked because I was supposed to have given the dog a bath.
