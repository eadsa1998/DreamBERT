I was coming home from staying at Las____ and that I was like on a flight, and when I got off the flight I was at the Washington Dulles Airport, just like I was. And Mom and Dad were there to pick me up at the Washington Dulles Airport, and they told me that they had moved our house into Washington, DC for the time that I was on the trip, so that I wouldn't have to fly from Washington, DC to Eastport. And that was really bizarre, and I had the notion that our house had like shrunk or something. And anyway, I realized it was the same-sized house, but I could not fathom why they would move it into Washington, DC when I was on the trip. I also dreamt that we were watching this mermaid movie that had this different story to it. It's all the basic same thing except they say that they're looking and looking all over everywhere, and it kind of takes a twist like Pocahontas because they think Eric kidnapped her and they see her and Eric really love each other and somebody yells that Eric's trying to rape her. And she like, they're all like running after him, trying to get him, and she stops them, actually similar to Pocahontas. And there were these like statues that were drawn on the back of the movie box. One was Triton holding one of the Mermaid's sisters. Another one was Eric at the ship, and the other two I don't remember. Hmmm.
