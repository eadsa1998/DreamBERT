I was typing up a research paper, and we were in the library and I was using a machine and there were like about five people in line to use it. So I closed out my document and I hopped down from my chair and decided to give somebody else a turn. And Ms. Forrest was there. And there I am waiting in line for all these people to get finished. And somehow I had the notion that I was interning at Safeway, and I was sitting there waiting around, and I don't know, just kind of blah.
