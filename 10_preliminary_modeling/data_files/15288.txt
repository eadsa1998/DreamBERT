There were zombies. I was doing an obstacle course thing. I saw zombies come running through the bush. I ran inside to go to "the sun room" which was a classroom in the shape of a sun. I let some people in and closed the door. It had no locks but the zombies couldn't get in. One of the windows showed a classroom with 5 year olds and Peter Krause was there. The zombies came and got them. Then it wasn't a classroom and it was this weird place with lots of people. The doors kept opening and I went around closing them and then noticed that people were missing. A guy there was sending people out to die. Then I was with Mom and someone else living in this small room. I was driving in a Ute with Mom and Darren. It was a Nissan. We drove down this path for a bit which had small trees planted across it. We were marking things down on a map so we knew where exits were. Then we were on foot and there were bushes to one side. Zombies came and we ran. They went back and I was confused, then realized they came from near our room. I didn't have a gun, just some melee weapon. I closed the door and tried to think of what to do.
