The dream took place in the recitation room of the biology building. My comparative anatomy teacher was standing in the front of the room and it seemed that I was the only one in the room listening to the lecture. As I was sitting here I was debating whether I ought to congratulate him for being chosen to speak before the scientist meeting that night. Then it seems that as I left after the lecture I was chastising myself for even thinking about it since it seemed to be merely a means of softening up the instructor to give me a higher grade.
