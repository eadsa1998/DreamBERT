This dream took place with an unknown individual talking to an unknown doctor, and this person was saying to the doctor that, to not worry, that he wouldn't be needed there at that time anymore. Where exactly they were is very, very vague as far as a setting. None of the two persons in it were identifiable and I was an onlooker to the whole thing. Both of the persons in the dream were males.
