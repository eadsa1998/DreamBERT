The dream took place in Rye, N.Y. in the winter. I was with 2 of my friends from Rye and a college friend. We all were at Marie's house, one of these friends. Her house was pictured exactly as it is in reality except that right beyond the yard was a cliff which overlooked the ocean. The drop to the ocean was at least 50 feet. I had on an aqua knit dress, one which I received for Christmas and a large turquoise ring. Extending from the cliff was a long, narrow diving board. My friends and I decided to go swimming and in order to do this, they ahead of me dove from the board into the water which lay way below. Being last and terribly afraid of height, I can remember the terror I felt as I walked out on the diving board. My sense of balance was not constant and I found myself swaying from side to side. Finally I took a deep breath, hoping it would last until I reached the water, and jumped. Then we all swam in freezing water out to a float. When I arrived there, I looked at my ring and the turquoise stone had melted and turned orange. The last thing I remember is that I thought that the stone in my ring had been made out of dehydrated vegetables.
