 I'm at a gas station getting food and a drink. I want something sweet. I get pink lemonade and a video camera. My classmate Ryan Walker and my friend Kristy Puffy are there. We're on our way to a basketball game in Riverton. I think I need a tape for video camera, but a tape is in the camera when I check it. I'm with my dad driving back to our house with my siblings. My brother Wally is a third string power forward in the basketball game. He needs six liberal arts classes to graduate. I suggest that he take five classes in the fall, implying that they are easy. I'm in the Riverton High School gym. The freshman or B-squad basketball team is practicing. I am stretching. The varsity team comes in. There is a black man on the team. He is belligerent. He argues with me and gets in my face. I stand up to him, and decide to walk away. I feel strong because I was able to walk away, when I could have fought with him. I see a lady that looks like she is on the staff here and I ask her to show me where the principal's office is. I want to make a formal complaint about the man. I complain formally, and discuss my problem with the administration. The administration doesn't care and finds me guilty. My old basketball coach Terry Brady is a student at this Riverton College. The administration thinks I am retaliating and getting back at Terry for going there. This makes me angry. I say I'm going to kick the shit out of their basketball team. I leave angrily. <br/
