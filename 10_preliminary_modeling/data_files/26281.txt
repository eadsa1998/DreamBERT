 I'm hunting squirrels on the Brimson Campus lawn using my friends the Ramos' banana-clip .22 rifle. I see a squirrel in the distance. It runs across the tops of the tall trees. I watch it. It goes onto a high branch in front of me. It's light colored, like a baby, and kind of looks like a baby too. I aim my rifle imprecisely and fire. The animal bursts into flames and falls to the ground. I walk towards it and see that it is a robin. It is long, like it has a three-foot long stick inside it. It may still be flaming. I feel bad, guilty, about killing it, and I hurry away.
