I was eating a late at night dinner at the home of my church choir director, along with three members of the solo quartet, Sop. Tenor and bass. I decided that my hands were dirty and wanted to wash them, but I didn't know how to excuse myself for fear they would laugh. Finally I said, "I have to wash my hands" and went to the kitchen and started to splash about loudly. Just then the bass who was upstairs called, "Oh mother," in a falsetto voice at the tenor who replied, "Do you want me to hit you in the mouth?" Then the bass came down to talk to me about what I can't remember, but his last words were something like, "Well, why don't you?"
