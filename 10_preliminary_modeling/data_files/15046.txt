Mom woke me up. I got ready for school and then she took me there. It was dark and there were like three people there. I checked the time and it was 4 AM. She had woken me up at 2:40 AM. She then text me that she had realised the time. I told her to pick me up. This teacher guy came out and told me to be quiet on the phone, but I had already gotten off and I complained back saying that I was being quiet. Mom took me home and her and Ezra played a card game. I waited for a while and I was going to drive to University but it was peak hour. Note: in RL I had to get up early this morning to pick Ezra and Dad up and when I woke up just now my phone was off. I also watched some Modern Family and there was a character called Izzy Jade who interacted with Sofia Vergara's character.
