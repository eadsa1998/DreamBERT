["Glowing coal and grumpy lady."] I am running trying to return to a house. I can't remember where it is. I come to a street and start to turn left. I hesitate and then turn right. I think to myself. I hope this is the right way. I hold a gold glowing coal in a spoon. I find the house and go in expecting the grumpy old lady that lives there to say No burny, no burny. Someone says she died.
