I was on the bus to Hillside, and I noticed that up by the front of the bus there was a table with a pile of books for sale to whoever would want them. I flipped through the pile and they were all good books, but I didn't have any money, or not much at least. Eventually I got a Hemingway book, "A Farewell to Arms", I believe. Back at the bus station to pay for my book. As I'm waiting for the driver I hear gunshots; people right next to me have gotten their heads blown off. One guy has half his head across the way and is writhing all over the place. I calmly step over the bodies and head for the bus. But the bus is leaving! Shit! I begin to run down the street in an effort to arrive at the next bus stop before it does (usually an easy thing with the Hillside buses) but suddenly everything in that part of town turns into a really dense meadow with really tall grass, and I can't get through it fast enough to catch the bus. <br/
