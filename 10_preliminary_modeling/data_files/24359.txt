My compatriots mess up the log contraption as we're trying to make it through the swampy part of the Indian-made booby trapped path because if you step on a grave, bad things happen. We fall in, but nothing horrible happens. They took apart the trampoline type thing. In a bistro outside the city where I work. Covered. People are taking down and selling signs. I see a main thoroughfare, and then Main Street and Center Street. I live between them. Playing soccer with these kids. They're smart allecky. I score two goals. Starts off as I leave my apartment and walk past a half-soccer field set up as part of a campus behind my building. There are two Mexicans and Arabs playing there.
