I dreamt of my mother's college friend's son Jonathan and Ghostbusters.  Jonathan both complimented and insulted me.  There was something wrong with me, I think.  Jonathan pulled things out of the cuffs of his pants like a hiding place.  One item looked like a small, inflated rubber ball.  Once he got it out, it was a regular beach ball.  I'm not sure what happened from there.  I was in a run down parking lot with the cartoon Ghostbusters, wading through garbage or something.  We tried to blockade the cyclone fence gate as well as possible.
