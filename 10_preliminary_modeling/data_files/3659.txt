I am in a room. We are working with people who come in and tell their dreams. One man comes in and goes on and on about aliens and spaceships and so on, talking like he dreamed it. But I quickly catch on that he is mentally ill and just talking about his insane point of view of the world. Other people finally catch on and leave, disgusted or annoyed. I don't leave for awhile, hanging out to get the attention of this man. Lucy is around.
