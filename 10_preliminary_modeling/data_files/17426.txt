Dreamt about our wedding rehearsal.  First, my boyfriend Jeremy and I were standing with a block corner in between us.  We took turns like we couldn't get closer to one another.  I had mouthwash.  I went inside a small room.  UB40's "Can't Help Falling in Love" was playing.  Jeremy was sitting among many people and I was in complete love of the event.  I hugged Jeremy from behind and he swayed to the music.  I sang a little though it was a hard song for me to model.  Other people were around.  My housemate Drake was in bed in front of us.
