In a car with Bart H. He was driving. We were going to airport to get him a flight home. While driving he leaned over to kiss me. hesitated for just a moment, then proceeded. At first I didn't kiss back but then melted into the kiss. It was very nice. It was our first kiss. He started talking about us being together soon. Then he said something about me being very hot. I moved closer to him and put my hand on his thigh. We kissed again.
