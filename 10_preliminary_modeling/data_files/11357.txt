I was in a classroom; the instructor was lecturing to a very small claps or about three or four students. The lecturer was wandering and a friend of mine in the class put on his coat and was about to walk out. The instructor mildly reprimanded him for walking out before the class was adjourned. The student apologized saying he thought the class had already been adjourned. Later, assignment sheets were handed out. Mine consisted of an envelope containing a children's shoe. I looked at the shoes and wondered whether in this course we would be concerned with multiple correlation techniques. Somehow in the shoe I could see to what extent multiple correlation would be. involved.
