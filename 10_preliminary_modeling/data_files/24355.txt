I'm on a boat. It's a luxury cruise liner set to go off. But before it can do that, it's stopped by the catastrophe that has taken over the planet. A greater cataclysm inspires zombies to appear. The ship then pulls into a river. It is an island, stocked with food, and very well heeled guests expecting only a short jaunt out for a premier or something. They argue over what they're supposed to do. I'm onboard for some reason, though I don't feel a part of the crowd. How I wander this ship and don't care that I'm not allowed access to the front. I go anyway. I lean off and I see them, brown and listless. They weren't moving or attacking right off the bat.
