I was walking down a hallway and all these ghosts were floating around and going through me. I was then Simon Pegg and I was observing. He was the best ghost killer of something. I was in this room and looking out. Someone started shooting the ghosts so now they could see Simon. He had to run through the hall. For some reason, I went with him. We got into this big, flash, red car and weird Indian music was playing. He said he preferred "doing it risky" and started driving on the sidewalks and then shot at a bunch of cops. We ended up on the top of this giant glacier rock thing. The car was jumping onto other ones. He somehow managed to get us on the ground. We ran into this little hut. A cop grabbed me, but Simon got me back and took the cop with us. We went into another hut and hid behind this curtain. This other cop came, but didn't find us. We went out the back and Simon made some noise and then ran. We were climbing this gate and I said that I wished I was strong enough and I was thinking that all this should count toward my exercise (for my diet). I ended up in this section. He found something and I said that it was Danish and then saw this pipe and I realized that the cops were there. We hid for a while but then he yelled out to them and they put pumpkins on our heads. I had '2' on mine. Somehow I knew they were going to squirt us with orange juice.
