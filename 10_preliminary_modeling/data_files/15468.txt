Dad and I were on holiday. I checked a map to see where we were and it said Jakarta. I zoomed out a little and it was next to Manhattan. There were lots of Asians around. I zoomed out more and it was in England. There were toilets where you had to pay on the way out and you had to pay more the drunker you were. People were lining up and I decided not to use them. Dad peed and gave them $2.52 and I gave them 50c. Then we were on the street and there were shops and a beach below us. The tide came up high. We waited for a while but then Dad decided to walk through it but I didn't want to get my phone wet. There was an episode of The Young Ones which had lots of explosions and stuff and had good effects. Vyvyan was doing it and looked at the camera with a smile. Then there was a building surrounded by hedges. Some bad people came and I hid in the building, but they saw me and I tried to get out. I lay on a floating platform which was wobbly and scary. I peeled glass off the window and tore the flywire and crawled out. I ran along the hedges and had some plan to get them but I can't remember what it was.
