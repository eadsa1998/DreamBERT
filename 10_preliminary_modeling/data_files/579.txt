I am moving into my aunt's two room house and there is not enough room for everything I want in there. There is a huge Halloween picture and it costs $77. The house still belongs to some neighbors who actually did own that house when I was a child, but in spite of their being there, I am trying to move in and there is a bed blocking the door.
