Oh, God! It's World War III! Everyone prepares to leave and my family is gone. I don't know where I am. Help, I am alone. What will it be like to be dead, and what if I have gotten shot on every part of my body? Then blood will be all over me. No, I have to get out of here. I have to fly to some other country, but it is too late. I am stuck. Many soldiers surround the bushes with guns, and there are bombs flying over my head. I try to run very hard, but I cannot. I am too scared and I am out of breath. I can hardly open my eyes. Suddenly, a soldier opens fire. I jumped up off my bed and cried out loud.
