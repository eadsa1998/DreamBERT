 I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and our friend Bill Hanson. We enter a large study room filled with college students. Our friend Niles Zelling and many others are there. One man, who I recognize as a stereotypical loud-mouthed jock, yells out to the people in the room, asking if anyone wants to order pizza. There is an enthusiastic response by many of the students. I do not respond.
