I was wandering around with Joaquin Phoenix and Shia La Beouf. I'd not liked them but now I was hanging around with them getting to know them. We were walking the streets at night. They were flirty and kept saying I'd sleep with them but I thought in my head that I'd probably do Phoenix, but not La Beouf.
