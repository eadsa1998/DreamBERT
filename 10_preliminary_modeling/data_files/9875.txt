See Father Andrew: sitting at a table at VA hospital wearing black habit, very friendly; I pass by and sit down to talk to him; he asks abut Frank; I say "He is well, exceptionally well," and explain about his review and what he is doing. Long and pleasant conversation. Then leave; other people come in; I believe I represent "earth week"; I hear Fr. saying "What does 'Earth week' think about this?"
