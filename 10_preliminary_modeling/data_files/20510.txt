I was in a commercial building. There was a hole in the floor about four feet in diameter and about a foot deep. Chicken bones were burning in the hole. There was much smoke. A flue above it was sucking the smoke with a great force. I was afraid it would explode. Then it began to rain outside, and the rain fell on the fire and began to extinguish it.
