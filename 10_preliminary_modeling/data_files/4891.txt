I return to my apartment. I am shocked to see that the kitchen ceiling is nearly missing. Someone is taking it apart wood slab by slab. I see the higher outside roof still intact. I notice other signs that someone is dismantling my apartment. I am moving out, but I seem to be getting lots of unexpected help. I don't know why. It doesn't feel friendly. I hear knocking. I go to the back door and look through a window. I see an Asian man wanting to come in. I open the door for him and let him in. Then I quickly go to the living room and tell people there I did that so he could be watched. Perhaps he will steal something. Then I get suspicious of the older Asian father who owns the place. I sneak a peek in a drawer and find he's been hiding my writings and art work on envelopes (manila envelopes) in there. I am not happy about this. I gather them up to take them with me. I tell a woman about it. Maybe the older Asian father has a secret crush on me.
