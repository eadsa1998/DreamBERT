I was in my backyard. Some of my friends were too and Jim [Molly's dad] was there. Well there was this guy with a gun and he shot Jim. Well it passed a few years and we went to the Emperor under the ground in my backyard and asked him "Where's Jim?" and he said "Well-he died" and we said "Well where is he?" and he showed us under a net where he was with some papers. After that we went for a swim in the ocean with Susie.
