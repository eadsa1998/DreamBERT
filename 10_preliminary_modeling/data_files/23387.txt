I am at work, there is a lot of joy and excitement at the fact that I am pregnant. Another woman here is pregnant also. She is much farther along (Gwen is due 12/30). Anyway, my boss Susan is so excited but she kind of prefers Gwen (who I dream is having a girl, although she is actually having a boy!). Anyway, Susan is happy for me but kind of hustles past saying "Oh, you're having the weenie." In other words, I'm having a boy and that's not as much fun as having a girl. I find this amusing.
