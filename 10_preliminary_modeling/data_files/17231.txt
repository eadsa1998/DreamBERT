I was in a barber shop and upset that someone had cut my hair without permission, much shorter than I like.  Something was conveyed about stopping someone from being raped again.  I guess I was one to help find the guy.  I'm not sure what the situation, but we were to travel to three locations, like on a field trip. We stopped at the first one.  Looking off a cliff to some great trees.  I wanted to take a picture but I was having trouble with something, maybe the camera.  We were supposed to go on, but I wanted the picture. The platform my boyfriend Jeremy and I were on was moving.  I wish I could remember more.
