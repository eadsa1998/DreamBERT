I'm in a "Banana Republic" in South or Central America. I visit the Chief of State ("Caudillo"?). He appears strong and confident. But as we prepare to leave his office and go on a trip, his second in command says he must have a body guard. He tells me he is taking it reluctantly. We go through the streets, I'm beside him in an open car, the guards on the running board. It switches to cab of a big truck and guards lined up on flatbed truck behind cab. Their weapons are pistols (like German Lugers, sawed off shotguns, like Chicago gangsters in old movies and real life) and strange double-barreled things like infra-red rifles used in Vietnam and movie I saw, Outland, for seeing warm bodies in the dark. Suddenly I'm on the curb among those watching. It seems to me that behind every woman watching the President go by is a man with a gun or pistol wanting to shoot the president. I move away and stand by a curb with no one around me. And I count about twenty in the crowd who want to kill the leader. His guards aim at them, but refuse to kill the women they are dodging behind. I wonder why he doesn't resign. I wonder why most don't leave that violent country.
