I was in a hotel like building in the middle of the woods, where I lived. I had my computer there. This guy came and gave me a pack of stuff for my video camera, but I then heard a high frequency squealing, which signaled a bomb about to go off, so I ran. Nothing happened, so I went back to grab some stuff. He came back and we were trying to find out about the bomb. We were looking at photos on the computer and doing a scan on the people's eyes to see if they were a liar. If they were liars their eyes would go red. There was a photo of me and a clown, and the clown's eyes went red. It was actually Jensen Ackles. There was another photo of him and Jared Padalecki, which also scanned red. It meant that they were after us. I grabbed my dream books and we left. This other house blew up.
