I am in the living room and Dovre is out on the porch talking with some people who are demonstrating a car seat and how it folds up and so on. I come out and watch. I ask her what she's doing and she says she wants to buy some seat belts and they have some, but she did it wrong. They came to her and said, "This is how much I want." I say to her, "You could then say to them, 'This is how much I'm willing to pay,' and see if they will dicker." She likes this idea and goes to them to dicker. I walk back into the house very aware that I would be embarrassed to dicker and leave it cravenly to her. I see the little baby girl and go pick her up and discover she has on some of my jewelry. I tell her it is not OK to take things that belong to other people, and begin to remove the many rings and necklaces off her chubby fingers and neck. She resists. I explain how we must ask permission first. She doesn't care; she just wants the jewelry. I tell her if she comes back in and takes my jewelry, then I will take it back, take her to her room and lock it and then take some of her things away. I feel mean. She is incorrigible. I keep removing more jewelry, black beaded necklaces. I find an ugly plastic lime bracelet. She says, "At least let me keep that one, it has my name on it (Fred)." I say, "This is Dovre's; we will ask her permission and if she says yes, you can keep it."
