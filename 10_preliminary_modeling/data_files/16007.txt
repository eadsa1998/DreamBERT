I was reading about Halloween costumes. Mom and Darren were talking and I hid under this table and when Darren came near by, I jumped up to scare him but he didn't really get scared. Later I was somewhere else and I was talking to a friend, a black girl, about Grey's Anatomy and I was saying that George was my favourite character and I lost interest around the time they killed him off and I said they got rid of all the characters I liked and said 'they got rid of the black guy - wait sorry that's racist' and she laughed and I was like 'what's his name? Isaiah Washington'. I was somewhere with Frederick and someone else. Another person wanted to do some experiment and we cut up this meat loaf. I don't remember what we did with it. Then we got in Frederick's car and I was in the back and we drove to Nana's, which was different. I left my water bottle in the car because I thought we wouldn't be long. I went in and saw Poppa and I said 'hi Poppa'. He asked if we wanted stuff to drink and Nana said 'Izzy always brings a water bottle' and I said 'I left it in the car, but now I'm thirsty'.
