I can't remember which school I was at, but the hallways looked like Westport High School, and the main office looked like Oceanside Elementary. And I was in the bathroom and I was going to the bathroom and I was going to go out to a parking lot where Mom was going to pick me up. And I was going pee and this guy was like pounding on the door, opening it up and saying, "Hey, can I see the creek?" And I slammed the door and I said, "Get out of here, you bastard!" And he's like, "_____ you," some kind of comment like, "You've got to be mean," or something like that. And I stood there, yelling, "Help, help, help!" But then I realized that instead of wearing myself out in the bathroom I should open the door and run around the bathroom, and I ran over to the main office and I told the lady what was happening. And I sort of had a feeling that he was chasing me, and what the lady did is she sat me down behind the desk so that he wouldn't be able to see that I was in there, and sure enough, he came in and he was looking for me. And the lady said, "You're in big doo doo." And he started talking to them, and shortly thereafter Mom came in the office with Jennie, and then I woke up.
