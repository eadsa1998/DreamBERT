 I'm on a farm that seems to belong to my friend Melanie McDyss' father, Rob. There are sheep on the farm. I move around. There is at least one big, muddy, 4x4 truck there. Rob stops his truck. I'm there, and we shake hands. I introduce myself, saying I'm a friend of Melanie. He mentions that she came home earlier that day. We keep talking and he says that she went out with her uncle. Surprised, I say, "Oh, is she home!?" Then I think to myself: I know he mentioned this earlier, why didn't I comprehend it then and react? I'm in a room with the McDyss family. Melanie isn't there. Rob offers people a drink: a can of Busch Light. He offers me a drink last, and I say, "Yeah, sure." Melanie's mother April is reluctant to give me the beer. At some point she hands me a green can of Mountain Dew, with her hand completely covering the label of the can. I take it, and see it is a Mountain Dew. I don't say anything, but know that for some reason she doesn't want me to have a beer. I see Melanie with her uncle. The child, who I presume is Melanie, is a young boy, about 10 years old. They are in a jeep. The uncle is driving. There seems to be an assault or conflict, which may be sexual.
