Now I'm going to jail, myself and two other women. A man and a woman are our teachers. They say we have to learn history in order to understand and then be released. 1803, Osprey. 1940. There are other dates and symbols. Three different times the teachers would take a break, go to another room and make love. We could see them and hear them. I commented that's not a very good idea for prisoners to see that because we can't have any. I hope to choose a room next time where I can't see them. I am released. Ginny and I also pick me up. We walk home in the heavy snow. We slide on ice on the road (the gutter the tires made). It's fun. I say, "We got to ice skate in jail." We slide our feet like we're skating. Dovre runs fast to see me. She's excited I'm home. I see a huge turquoise crystal rock and admire it. Ginny says, "It's yours," and gives it to me. I go inside where Ernie and Rigo are waiting. It is a sweet family scene.
