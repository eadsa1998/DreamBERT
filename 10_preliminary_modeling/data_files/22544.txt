I dreamed that I was expecting a baby and was in about the fifth month of pregnancy. I didn't want to get married or have the baby. My sister, who is 25, begged me that if I didn't want the baby, I should give it to her, because she wanted it, and I did it. I don't know how, but she did have the baby and delivered it in a bathroom which didn't belong to our house; it was another one. It had a long water closet, and when I heard the baby scream, I went into the bathroom and found him totally alone. My sister wasn't there and neither was the lady who had helped her, who was somebody I didn't know. When I saw the baby all alone, I lifted him and I already wanted it. I had a discussion with my sister about not giving it to her and I told her it was mine, and she said that it wasn't, that it was hers because I had given it to her and she had had it. I don't remember being desperate at any point in my dream. I was calm, up to the moment when I argued with my sister and was upset because she didn't want to give me back the baby.
