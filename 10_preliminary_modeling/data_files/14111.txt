I was at home. In the pool, I had a fake crocodile lying on a real one. I looked out through the games room door and saw the real one was upside down and I thought it was dead. It then flipped around and I realized it was alive. There were kittens out the back. One was a cute little brown and white one. The crocodile went to eat it. I banged on the door and it ran away. I went outside and took the kitten inside. I showed Dad. We looked out the games room window and saw there were eight more feeding off their ma. One was purple-y with stripes and a black one with bits of white. I needed to save them. Tigger was outside too. I called the place I got the crocodile from and they said they would get it soon and I said I needed to get rid of it now. It started slamming into the door to get inside. It eventually did and I punched it. It stopped moving and Dad said it might not be dead and I ripped its head off and said that they didn't have to worry about it now.
