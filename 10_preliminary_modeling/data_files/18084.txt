I was on a boat and there was an aquarium there and we saw flowers and then this person went into a huge flower and water spinned around it, so the flower spinned too and the person went "Ahhh" and the toys I had were 3 beany babies. They were cats. The child's name was Pounce, the mother was Flip, the father was Freckles. They got dirty for some reason, so I asked my dad to wash them. He did. And then people said "The boat is sinking the boat is sinking" So I packed up all my stuff and this boy said, "Hey-where are you going?" and then we started fighting. I punched him in the stomach and then he knocked me down. Then I held up a "V" with my fingers and said, "Peace," and then we felt the boat tilting, so I pushed my sister forward and said "come on, run" so we ran. Then all of a sudden we were out of the boat and I ended up in my closet.
