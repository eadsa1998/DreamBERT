I was at work and the U.S. Dream Team (basketball) checked in. I was so excited. Charles Barkley checked in for everyone. I was excited also because he had the same silver pen that I have. I put them in rooms 110 and 209. I couldn't believe that I didn't know that they were coming. They all unloaded off a huge bus. Then later I remembered that Grant Hill was on the team; I wanted to see him but I never did. Then this white player came in, but I don't know who he was. And he stayed in the office and talked to me. I was so excited and kept thinking to myself, "I want to marry an NBA player so badly." Then he left, but he said he would be back. He left his glasses on the counter, but he didn't come back. Then later my manager was in the office with me and there were two men in the office. One was talking at the same time as the other. I figured that I would answer one of the men's questions and she would answer the other's. Well, she was expecting me to answer both. She wanted one of the men to stop talking, so she "shhhh'd" me and got mad at me. Then I was really annoyed and frustrated.
