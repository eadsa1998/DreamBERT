Eugene and I had been together for years, or so I thought. He was in bed lying on his back and I got in next to him and put my arm around him. We were talking and laughing. I was at a shop and it was like a huge Big W. I had a trolley and to get in there were these doors that would open and close continuously and I tried to get through it with the trolley, but it kept getting caught. Then I got to the counter and I had to pay to get in. Eugene was around the other side and he didn't have to pay and so he gave me $2 so I could get in. We saw Dad and so ran, laughing, down an aisle to hide and into a freezer. It was big and warehouse like and cold. He went over to the wall to get juice. I thought I heard someone coming and I didn't want to get in trouble so Eugene told me to go. I went through this other door which went into the same section of the shop. I saw a guy who I thought was Dad at the door to the shop and so I ducked. When I looked back up, he saw me and was actually a cop. I could see him motioning for others to get me and they called me the 'juice thief'.
