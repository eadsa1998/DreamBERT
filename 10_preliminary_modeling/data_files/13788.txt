I went on my laptop to get some pictures of people. I had a James Spader folder. Ezra wanted to use the USB so I said I just wanted to look up a picture quickly. He said "Yeah the guy from 21", (Jim Sturgess), which it was. Then I went into this room so I could read this book in peace. Austin and someone came in and were talking, then all these people from school came in and were talking. It was fully packed and I was sweating so I got out. Lucia and some other girls were sitting at the door doing their nails. I said I wasn't worried about where I was stepping and I stepped on Lucia's hand and she yelled out. She said "Yeah, but you're heavy" and I said that I didn't care. Mom was there and was watching TV. Britney Spears was on there and her hair was all wavy.
