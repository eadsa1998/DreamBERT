I was watching House. Wilson died at the beginning of the episode. At the end, House started crying very openly and loudly. I cried too. I was thinking to let Mom know there was a new episode out. We went to a shop. There was a guy and others behind a counter. This guy dragged me around the floor and I laughed and said it tickled my bum and everyone laughed. The guy behind the counter liked me. He said he called a video shop at Morley and had guaranteed me a job there. I drove out of the parking spot by myself and as I drove out, a bus was following me.
