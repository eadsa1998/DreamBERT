I was coming home from somewhere, and took BART.  I had to transfer and got off, but hadn't paid attention to the station and got off one too early- I wasn't sure what was going to happen or if I would be able to get home.  I found Ron and Mary, my online friends in England on the platform, and they were going to help me out.  I followed a woman (Mary?) and we went a ways away into an area with trees and vegetation, but there were alligators as well and we had to be very careful not to bother any.  We leaped over a few and went back to the BART platform.
