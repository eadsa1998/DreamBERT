I suffer from asthma, and I became ill and they had to take me to the hospital so that the attack would pass. When I returned home, I was very scared of sleeping because I thought I would die, when suddenly I fell asleep. I dreamt that I got the attack once again, but this time I really died, of course, in my dream. I cried and asked to be saved, but each time I became more agitated and suffocated. I thought this wasn't true, that I was dreaming. Then I awoke, scared, as though that were really going to happen, and for several nights I was afraid to sleep.
