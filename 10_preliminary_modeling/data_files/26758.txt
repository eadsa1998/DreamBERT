 There is some kind of a battle or struggle occurring. It's not a destructive battle; it seems to be a passive struggle, an acceptance of change laid down, rather than any kind of resistance. I play a role in this. I seem to be the change facilitator, a major player in the war, but not in any pejorative sense because nothing negative is perceived to be happening. It seems that I go around and change things, like tapping people on the head with a wand and in an instant: poof! Change! There is a star wars-like game occurring. One of the characters is not strong enough to mentally perform a task. A red dot appears, as a mental image of an immense air ship begins to tilt, fall, and crash. The red dot helps hold the ship in the air and keep it level. Han Solo may be the character performing the task.
