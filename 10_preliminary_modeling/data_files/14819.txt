I was at Nana's. Mom and Nana were in the spare room. I was watching TV. We went outside later to do some adventure thing. There were quite a few people there. I was recording it but decided to just take photos instead. Ezra had really big boobs. The chickens came and started flapping near me and I squealed and jumped away. There was a round thing in some water that was where the top pond should be but there was no edge and we had to walk around. I was worried I would fall in so I went another way but then just waited for the others to get around and do it. They came around and this guy, who was kind of hot but was related to us somehow, opened this bathroom cabinet on the round bit. I took a photo of him as he did it. He was confused and said it was in Russian but it looked English from where I was and I realized depending on the angle you looked at it, you saw a different thing. I went around to the top fish pond later (under the shade thing) and there were now lots of stalls and vending machines with food (chips and chocolates, etc). Nana didn't know about it but it had been there for a while. She was upset and angry about it. I said 'isn't it illegal for people to try and sell stuff on your property'. She asked someone and they said no. I went inside and Janice (The Soprano's) was on the three seater lounge down the bottom and she was related to us and was called something else. I was going to ask her about it because she knew stuff about that.
