There is a party at my house, which is a house I lived in my hometown. I am upstairs and I see a woman in a nightgown walking in the snow. She falls. Someone calls me to help. I start downstairs but am met by a woman carrying a baby. It seems she is a guest at the party. She gives me the baby and says she's not big on babies. The baby has a crooked back which I can feel under the blankets. Then suddenly I am outside and in my car and a vehicle pulls up. The driver is a man with a gun. He has my husband and son and another little boy and is holding them hostage. My son is a child in the dream. His eye's are very big and scared.
