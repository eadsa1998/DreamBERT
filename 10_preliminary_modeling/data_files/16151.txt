This is the first dream of the year 2002. I dreamt that I was at the radio station -- no, first I dreamt that something funky was going on with our amplifier, and Dad was going to get another one to have on reserve in case ours doesn't work. And we were going to Circuit City or Best Buy and pick one out and then set it up somewhere and make sure that it worked. And I'm waiting and waiting for us to go and Dad's on the computer and watching TV and talking to John and doing stuff and getting computer games, and we haven't been yet. And then I woke up from that one and I kind of drifted into another dream that we were driving around town up by Penelus (?) Park and Mom was scared to carry a two-way radio to keep in touch with me. I don't why, probably because I was, or I used to be, well, I used to be. I dreamt that I was at the radio station for my first day my title would be "teletist" -- and it looks a lot like my bedroom, and I was sitting down talking to either Katelyn or Lydia or somebody, and then I realized I was naked. And so I closed myself in my closet and I got some clothes on and then I came out and started doing some things. And they had this large buffet set up or chicken and bacon and beans and salad, and these big, gigantic cookies. And I took a bite of one of these cookies and then I woke up.
