 I'm in a large cement stadium sitting down low close to the field. There are upper decks in the stadium. It is virtually empty: only a few spectators are beginning to trickle in. Then there is a tall row of seats, as high as an upper deck, between the field and the seats I'm in. This row surrounds the field. The new seats are made to hold more people. This doesn't make sense to me because the original stadium seats not have a blocked view. These new seats are an effort to expand, to accommodate more people. This expansion is ineffective.
