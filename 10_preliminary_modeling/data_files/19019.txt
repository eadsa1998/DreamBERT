In my dream the actions was, I was shooting pool. However, there was no pool table. What seemed to be the center of the dream in the sense of what was being seen continually was the face of a stack of notebook paper. What makes me think I was shooting pool was that I was continually aware of being in a position of leaning over a table and softly banking a ball against the rail going up toward the other end. I lost a lot of what the dream was about upon awakening. My recall of the full dream was not real good. I believe there was someone else, others involved in the game, because I was shooting with caution as if to keep from making any mistake. I do not know who it was playing with me, though. I don't recall seeing a picture of the face of anyone.
