I was working for a company that was involved in some kind of public event. After the event was over we were tearing down and cleaning up. I was paying attention to how someone had run the electrical wiring, or maybe it was related to telephones or computers. I was telling someone that I really liked the way they had set that up - that it worked really well, it was inconspicuous, it was out of the way. As we were cleaning up somebody was selling some things. I paid more than $1,000 for this telephone because I knew that someone had just won more than 20 million dollars in the lottery but they needed this telephone to be able to claim their winnings. I thought that since their prize was more than 20 million dollars they would be willing to pay a lot to get this phone that they need to claim the money. After I bought it I knew I would be hearing from them soon about buying phone. I was having trouble trying to decide what a fair price would be. It certainly wasn't my intention to take advantage of them, knowing that they had to have this phone to collect their prize. My intention was simply to make a good investment and get a good return on my investment. I thought it was fair for me to charge them more than $1,000 for the phone.
