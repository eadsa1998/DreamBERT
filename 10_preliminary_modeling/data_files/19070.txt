I remember being with my brother. We were in church. We were on the second level of a large church. At least it seemed large, although when you look down on the church, it actually looks smaller, but it looked like it was in a large building. I got the idea that it was downtown. I remember very clearly the altar and the aisles and it was empty. I get the idea that it was Gesu downtown, though I'm not certain. It just seems like it though. I remember being in what seemed to be a kitchen where I live. My sister was there and I believe my brother again. My sister was writing a letter and had finished it. My sister works at the telephone company and so she gets a special rate on telephones. For some reason she was supposedly going to get a special rate on a letter, and for some reason she didn't want to sign her name or write out the address herself. I don't know why, but she asked me to write the address of the place where it was going, and I remember writing it out. My brother was also there and he just seemed to be watching. I remember the envelope and it seemed as though someone had actually made pencil marks on it like in a block form, just scribbled on it. I remember erasing a little bit of that. [Hall: It seemed as if his sister were writing a letter to a hotel in Nassau. It was as though the sister was trying to put something over on someone by not signing the letter going out.]
