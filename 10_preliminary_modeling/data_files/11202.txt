I was walking all alone down what must have been a quiet street, as I remember no traffic noise of any sort. As I passed one rather large house, music floated out to me, and I became quite angry because I could not think of the name of the piece. It began to rain then, but instead of hurrying on my way I stood and listened to the music. I was just about ready to give up when a low soft voice said "don't you remember that, my dear." I turned, but no one was in sight. Then the voice said, "that is Beethoven's 4th. How could you ever forget." I looked frantically around but could see no more. Something made me look at the house for a moment, and for a second I saw a lovely face watching me. She seemed to be crying, yet I wasn't sure. The rain came down harder, the music ceased, and I walked on alone.
