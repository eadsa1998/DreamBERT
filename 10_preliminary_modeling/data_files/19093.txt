There were some people talking at the dream institute, but I don't know who exactly, though. It might have been Max and Dr. Hall, but I'm not sure. They were talking about shipping out dreams, I think. They shipped them out of here in these like steel cylinders, the kind you get oxygen in. They were talking about how they get the cylinders from somewhere near, but how they plug up the bottoms with rocks because the cylinders are gotten from toilets, but sometimes they don't get rocks in them. Sometimes they come up without rocks. Sometimes they're kind of dirty inside. And they laughed about that. Then they said, "Of course, sometimes we just throw in rocks." They got a kick out of that. Then there was one other thing. They were talking about the fact that divers -- now I guess these cylinders reminded them or reminded me of divers because they were like oxygen things, the divers were. I think then maybe it was Max that was saying divers, you know, have regular appetites because after they dive, they're real hungry. So they can eat. But in this country, if you have those cylinders and you're not a diver, you're not necessarily hungry when you come up from the water or wherever you come up from.
