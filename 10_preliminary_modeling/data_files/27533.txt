I dreamt that I took a street car ride and finally arrived at the end of my trip. A large brick building which was some sort of club stood there and I walked down a long walk at the side of the building. I was met by a young man I know, about 35, who escorted me to the porch where another man, about 33 was sitting. Both of these men are friends of mine. They sat together on the porch and when they both glanced at me, I noticed an amazing resemblance in their faces. The younger of the two men then accused me of saying that he looked older than the other one. Their eyes flashed a striking blue when they looked at me. That is all that I remember of the dream.
