Ginger Rogers and her roommate leave their apartment to walk to work some few blocks. As they are walking, a series of earthquakes hit. She walks past a line of cars parked and someone says, "Don't look, a man is trapped in his car." I (the roommate) can't resist looking. I see a 1930's style convertible, bright blue, with four to six people in it. It is tilted forward and on an edge. It rocked back and forth and I wonder why the people aren't getting out! That's a dangerous place to be sitting. Then I realize it would also be dangerous to move, it will throw out the balance and the car would go over the edge. Ginger and I walk on and go to our apartment. Fred Astaire is there and doing his best to charm Ginger, who rudely ignores him. I need to go to the bathroom and sit on a toilet which is back to back with another toilet where a man is going to the bathroom. We both reach out our doors for the one roll of toilet paper. Our hands meet and we play fight for the tissue. Finally I'm all wiped off and I go back into the living room. There is a man with a charming fake French accent also trying to gain Ginger's attentions. I sit on a chair and Fred sits on me. He hands me a paper with fake French accents sentences on it and asks me to say these, to the other man to keep him occupied while Fred works on Ginger. I stroke Fred's naked, soft young back and say with feeling, "I'd do anything for you, Fred," wishing he could be mine and knowing it was impossible. He gets up, now dressed and flirts with Ginger and I say my sentences at the man who pretty much ignores me.
