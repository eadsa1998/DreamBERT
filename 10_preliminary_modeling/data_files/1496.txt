A grandfather comes into the room. He announces that the results of the test shows that his grandson's spine will never grow to be normal. He must kill him. He raises a meat cleaver to kill him. I protest. I say, "Wait. That's not right. He can have a good life even if he doesn't grow up physically normal." The old man doesn't listen to me. He starts hacking away at the kid. I can't see it, but I can hear it. It is grisly. The old man lifts up the severed bloody head by the hair and shows it to me. The boy's face is all screwed up, registering pain and shock. He puts the head, which is dripping clots of blood, on the table. The facial expression has changed to a smiling face. The boy's spirit is free to play and race around, having fun. I see things move and the door open and close like a wind coming through.
