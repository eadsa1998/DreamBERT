Then I was in like a department store with...my two younger sisters?  I was put on a unicorn and led around; a person leading or the unicorn I do not know.  This may have been good online friend Del.  There was speaking of, how our love or marriage would be, it seemed.  Or possibly on the topic of what matters.  Then a white room, and we were in what appeared to be a large gumball machine, the best I can describe.  My math teacher Mr. Johnson was there.  I went to speak to Del; he asked about our family friend Neil Block.  Del vanished, so I began telling Mr. Johnson about where I met Neil.  I find either Del or some sort of gadget, and I think I should have known.  Something about Del, I think, in a sort of capsule/incubator type thing, in a coma with a monitor. <br/
