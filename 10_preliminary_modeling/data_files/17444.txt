My boyfriend Jeremy and I were broken up, and I was with some old guy, cuddling.  I talked some about what it used to be like with Jeremy, and it was similar.  I was content.  Then I realized it was temporary- the guy already had his previous girlfriend.  She and the others came home.  We finished putting the building together.  I was to stay in the back room with someone.  I went back and my car was there.
