I am hiding from something (maybe war) and I spend lots of months in a cellar of a woman's house. It's cold and damp and empty, but I'm alive. I come out when its safer. I see the woman of the house who shows me the special rooms she had prepared to hide me, with beds and doilies and lots of pretty things. I see a blue cup with the picture of a cat on the inside and I'm holding my cat under my arm who sticks her nose into the cup to see it better. I say, "How pretty it is," hoping she'll give it to me, but she doesn't. I walk up a flight of stairs and look out the window (see drawing). I come back down and the woman apologizes for my dreadful stay in her cellar. I say, "Hey! At least I'm alive. I thank you for my life." I am grateful to her even though I couldn't reach the nice place in time.
