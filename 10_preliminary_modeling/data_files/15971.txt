I was living with and dating Dan Palmer. Brief moments of us together flashed by but I can't remember them. There was one where he had just gotten out of the shower and was naked. He was getting dressed and talking to me and I was leaning against the door frame. He put his undies on and then came up to me and kissed me. Then he kissed me again, longer this time, and started putting his arm around me. This led to us having sex in our bed. Later, I went into the room and the bed was broken. I yelled out asking what happened and he said something like 'you fucked me for 3 hours doing banana splits'. I wondered what a banana split was and I yelled out saying 'don't just blame me, you were there too'. Then I was at home, which was different. Esther came over and was preparing her scanners for a job. We were in the kitchen with Mom. In the list of jobs for the next week was a travel job which said in the UK. I said 'so you're doing a job in England' and she said 'no, it's in Exmouth, it's ex-English'.
