I dreamt I was walking along the movie shopping district of my childhood neighborhood with my husband. We passed an old shoe store which I remembered well from my childhood days. In the window were some interesting shoes for women at bargain prices, my husband and I went in and I tried on the shoes. I was dissatisfied with all of them and could not find a pair I wished to buy. I remember being frustrated when we tried the new shoes on over my old ones. I knew something was wrong, but it occured to none of us to take off my old shoes.
