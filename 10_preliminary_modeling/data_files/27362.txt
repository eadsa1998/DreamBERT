At the beginning of this dream it took place in a hotel lobby. A friend of mine was standing at a desk, and presently she came over to me with something hidden inside her coat. It turned out to be chocolate, eggs, sugar, and all the ingredients necessary to make fudge. We ran upstairs with these things hidden. The building then seemed to be built like A Hall, and it seemed that we climbed about six flights of stairs. On the top floor we found there was a radio broadcast going on, so we had to sneak down again. There seemed to be about fifteen girls mingling around who eventually began to chase us. This is all I recall, except that at the end the ingredients were combined and we were running with a pan of fudge.
