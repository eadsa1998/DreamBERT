I was at school but it was different. It was the last night of school and we were supposed to wear a 'disguise'. People were all dressed up but I was just in my leaver's jacket. We were in a room, which had round tables scattered around and had balloons etc and was party-like. This teacher called us all to the "birthday board" and they were putting people's birthdays on there. Eugene was there and wrote in Bradley's birthday as April 16th or something. Then I think I might have been somewhere else, but Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were sort of friends with me, but they were trying to put salt on my food, along with some other people. I kept hovering over the plate and squealing and running away but they would follow. Then I was in a hall somewhere and I think it was a movie scene or something. A black girl and a guy made a mistake and it was really funny. There was a dog at the back and Mom joked that it was mine. I then had a little camera and I was taking photos. Cuddles was on my bed, sitting in a bunched up bit of blanket. Ezra was playing with a dog.
