Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly were in town and I remember sitting out in the back yard, Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and me having a good time talking and drinking coffee. But when they came to town, somehow somebody found a way to bring all their equipment and their security system. And they wired our house ___with it ___?___. The one scene I can remember in this dream: Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and I were going to go somewhere, or maybe it was Aunt Polly and me. And we were in the back yard and she said, "When I tell you, you go out the gate, and once you've closed the gate, I'll go out the front door and I will meet you." So she said something and I went out the gate and I closed it behind me and, of course, I knew she was turning on the security system. But before I got too far away, these electronic voices said - "Wait, you went out the gate. You did not close the gate." And I turned around, and sure enough, the gate was wide open and I ran back there and I closed and latched it as best as I could. Then it happened again. I walked away and I got a little ways toward the alley, and I turned back and the gate was still wide open. And I ran back for a third time. I can't remember if I did it three or four times, but I started thinking. "I am running out of time and I need to get away fast." So I ran, and in this dream I could run, but sometimes I can't. And I was running and running _____________________ and I didn't hear anything in this dream, but I knew what was coming and I was glad I could get away. And I had my purse and my phone, and a paper in my pocket with thei phone number, but I couldn't see too well and couldn't seem to make them out, so ____________________. I tried and tried to call them. I tried Information and couldn't get anywhere with that. And I was walking around aimlessly in the park feeling like a disgrace. I'm trying to think. I was first of all feeling afraid and second of all, feeling like a total idiot. I mean, why can't I do a simple thing like close the gate? And I feel like it was going to be a really bad thing for them. And then the next thing I knew, Aunt Polly found me in the park. And I sat there and I put my arm around Uncle Charlie's shoulders, and I said, "I'm sooo sorry for making your alarm sound because I couldn't close the gate in time. And Aunt Polly's like, "No, we're sorry." And I don't remember exactly what happened then. I think we were all at a restaurant, and we were eating like corn and applesauce and then I woke up.
