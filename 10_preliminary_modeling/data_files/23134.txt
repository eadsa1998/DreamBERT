I was being watched by a boy of about 10 who was really obnoxious.  I don't remember what he did to make me mad, but we kept verbally sparring.  I told him he was very rude to talk to older people the way he did.  When he finally said "Fuck you," I really got mad and got up and roughed him up a little and pushed him out of the area where I was working.  I think I said something like, "You don't have any religion, and you are going to go to hell," and he started crying.  He became much smaller then, and I almost felt sorry for him.  He was going to go home and tell his father, and I was afraid I would get in trouble.
