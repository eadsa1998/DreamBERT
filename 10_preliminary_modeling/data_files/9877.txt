Party at our house: many people bring food; Scotts and Ginger (from B. City) are there; see Roxanne (M's godmother) bring lamb roast. I walk out with Roxanne and see charred bones of skeleton of roast, which dogs are eating; during the party we get a long-distance call from Anastasia: Grandpa has stopped sweeping the house and is "on the bottle," but there is nothing we can do; meanwhile the party goes on and Eric Scott holds me close and pays me compliments.
