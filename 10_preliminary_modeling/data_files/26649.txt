 I'm on the phone with my friend Kevin Simpson while talking with his father Dilbert Simpson in person. I'm trying to appease Dilbert and carry on and understand a conversation with Kevin. I'm in the basement of the Redding farm with Kevin. This may be for privacy. We talk. Kevin is having a difficult time. I say I don't always know where I'm going, but that's okay: it works out. Kevin is stumbling in life. I give him advice. There is a pool table in the basement. Dilbert may come down to the basement at some point.
