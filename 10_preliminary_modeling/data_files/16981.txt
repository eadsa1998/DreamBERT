I'm in a house or a remote hotel perhaps in the Scottish highlands. There's a thunder storm outside. I let people in out of the storm. They are in shock. We have to survive as a group - the dream is like a disaster movie. I'm informally in charge, but then more people come in a ruin the group dynamic. I get accused of various things. The group breaks down - there is bullying and misery. the dream gets confused and unclear.
