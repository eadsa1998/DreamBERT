I am in an ocean harbor somewhere and I am swimming around. The water is very clear and very deep. I do not feel too cold or anything. There are boats and catamarans tied up all around me and the water and general atmosphere is very calm. I submerge myself and dive deeply into the water until I reached the bottom. The bottom was alive with ocean plants and fish. I am calm and have time to really view the entire ocean bottom as if I am SCUBA diving. I look up from the bottom after awhile and I realize that I am at least 50 or 60 feet below the surface. At first I am worried and start to swim up, I know that I cannot stay under much longer. As I begin to swim upwards, I am somehow able to take small sips of air from all the bubbles around me. As I ascend my lungs actually seem to fill with air and I become even more relaxed as I effortlessly glide to the surface. I reach the surface right next to the catamaran that all my friends are relaxing on. I climb up and I feel happy to just hang out with them.
