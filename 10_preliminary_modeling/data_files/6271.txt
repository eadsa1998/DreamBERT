Another dream that I had was that I was able to get into a local bar in my hometown using my current driver's license. Even though my license says I'm 20 years old, the bouncer let me in with full knowledge of the fact that I was not old enough to be there. The feeling of being able to go in the bar was awesome. I was psyched because all my friends are at the age of 22 and always go out without me because I can never go into the bar with them. Finally I was able to go out and have a good time with them. The weird thing was that even though I got into the bar, I had a horrible time. You see in the dream I was the only one over 21. The rest of them were only 20 and could not get in, so the roles were reversed. Basically having the dream proved to me that life is not always so good if you live by "only if" phrases. Because I used to say only if I was old enough when the fact of the matter was in the dream I was, but they weren't. This still was depressing for me. So basically now I don't wish that I was older or younger. I'm just happy and content with who and what I am.
