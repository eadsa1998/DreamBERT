["Knitting A Pair of Pants."] Tim Allen and his wife and I are room mates. He comes to me and we talk. He wants me to counsel him because he lost his job and his wife is unhappy with him. He genuinely wants to change but is confused about how to do it. I tell him kindly that I can't do that. I explain that it would be unethical of me because I am a room mate and want to be there for both Tim and his wife. He understands. I offer to give him some names of people he can contact. He agrees. Now we are in another room, a bedroom, I think. Tim is in one bed and I am in the other. I am preparing for sleep. He is knitting, sitting up in bed. I ask him what he's making. He says its pants. I laugh and say let me see. He comes over to show me. I see a regular pair of jeans down to the knees and then he is knitting the rest of the pants legs. I say oh, you're not knitting pants, you are knitting pants legs.
