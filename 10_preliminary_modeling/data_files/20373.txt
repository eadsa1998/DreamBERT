I had come home from the hospital. The house was unfamiliar. My mother was laying a linoleum on the floor. I went to a market. I picked some strange fruit off a shelf. It was on a vine or branch that also had leaves. The fruit was some kind of berry. The store was dimly lit with small light bulbs. I returned home, and my mother had finished laying the linoleum. I saw some places that were not covered, but my mother said to let it go. A fire hydrant near the house was leaking. And a faucet in a neighbor's garage was leaking. The plumbing in our house was shut off, so I urinated by the plug. A neighbor saw me, and I was embarrassed. When I went back upstairs, my mother asked me if the rag was still in the plug in the sink, and I said, "No."
