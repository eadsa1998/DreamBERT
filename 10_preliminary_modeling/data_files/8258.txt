I'm in a public place with some friends and with Paige Davis from Trading Spaces. We're outside and they have a wooden deck. I kept finding coins on this deck. The deck was made of a redwood colored wood. Paige or someone had said that we, this included me, needed to save our money to buy our wedding dresses. I'm not sure if she was only referring to the found money or not. I was amazed at how frequently I kept finding coins in this area. Sometimes the deck was wet. I also found a stack of very large coins and casino chips. I found the man that they belonged to and tried to return them to him. He only wanted one of them back, in the amount of $50. I tried to return more to him but he pushed them back at me. Paige was also amazed at how much money I was finding in coins this way.
