I decide to invite friends and family over for Thanksgiving and am preparing a big dinner. My mother is in the kitchen fixing food, I am scurrying around getting extra chairs. The house is big, with lots of long tables end to end down some long hall. I am walking and enjoying it. Rochelle and another woman in a wheelchair comes. I look at Rochelle's new wig, brown and kind of ugly looking. I compliment her and say it's pretty. She smiles and they go sit and wait as I am busy with greetings. I see uncles and cousins and then my Grandmother Agnes. I am very happy to see her and hug her a long hard time. "I'm so glad to see you again," I say. She says, "Do you remember Sandy?" I think her son. I laugh and say, "Oh yes, when we were children, I was called Sandy and I named him that." I go on and finally find a place at the far end of this endless feast. We get turkey and potatoes and there is plenty, but I realize we didn't get the special treats, the cranberry sauce, the salads and biscuits and so on, so I say to a woman down the table, "Could you ask the captain (of an airplane) to pass down the sauce?" She's embarrassed to do it. I ask the co-pilot to do it. He hesitates and I get annoyed and say, "Oh, for goodness sakes, I guess I'll just do it myself!!" I get up, which shames the woman, who tries to ask the Capt., who ignores the request. I walk passed him and find salads and jellos and biscuits and cake and lots of cream cheese special dishes and start gathering them up; apple butter, applesauce. I see co-worker Gordon and clap him happily on the shoulder and say, "I must have sat at the wrong end of the table. We didn't get all this." He smiles and we joke about how I'm just a complainer. A woman who is gathering up the leftovers says, "What are you going to do with all this?" I say, "Don't worry, it won't go to waste. I'll take it to the babies in the hospital, maybe to the homeless."
