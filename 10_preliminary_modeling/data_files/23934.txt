We were at some movie stars house and were going to go in some sort of boat tour. I wanted to go on the same boat as Jason. When I got on the boat, I noticed that Mack was there, but only his head, it had been chopped off a few days before. Now, he was only a head, that's it. He seemed to be OK about it, a little down. I couldn't imagine what his life would be like now. I went to a store and had this walkie talkie connected with Mack. I was picking him out a dolls body. One woman suggested this gold pillow thing with red pompoms for arms and legs and I would sew Mack's head on top (his head must have been the size of a quarter). But instead I picked out this black plastic figure with movable arms and legs and a neck that I could just pop Mack's head on. It was really cheap. But then, I found this white plastic body that would also transform into a seat. We went on the boat ride. I was on a boat with this model girl. I don't really remember much more except at one point I was looking at this area that was made up of walkways and staircases and bridges. It was fort - kind of like a massive jungle jim. Some pieces were missing so the people on it would rip a section out and put it together again in another spot so they could pass. [Jason = 7th grade boyfriend; Mack = good friend]
