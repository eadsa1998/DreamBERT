Dad bought me this mixer thing, meaning a cake mixer, not a sound mixer. And it was this round ball thing with a handle on it that you would mix around in this big vat container, and this motor would run and make a vat container for some reason. And he brought me this set of stuff because he thought I would like to mix up concoctions and things. And, oh yeah, I was standing at the kitchen counter mixing some chocolate batter and all the food was on top and all the bits of chocolate were on the bottom, and I tipped the container over when I was mixing it, and the motor was running underneath the container, I guess keeping it warm or something. And I dropped the mixer ball and it somehow goes down the drain and the motor starts doing funny things. And I told Dad and he called the company, hoping they can come out here and take it out, but there was still another mixer ball, but it wouldn't work if the other one was stuck in the drain. [laugh] That was bizarre.
