As I enter the dining room I miss the three Chinese chairs (as was the style in Chinese drawing or reception room) that used to be along the wall. I ask mother where they are. She says they just disappeared. "When?" "About a year ago." That reminds me that many things have been disappearing from J's room taken by this man. Now that J. is leaving, more will go. "I'd better go watch." "When does his man go?" "One day" and I raise a forefinger to tell how many.
