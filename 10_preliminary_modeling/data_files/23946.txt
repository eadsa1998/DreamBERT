I'm really REALLY rich. My family is looking to buy a new home and my dad picks out the HUGE one. Apparently it belonged to some super high-up mafia guy before. He was killed there by some hitmen. The house has 3 floors with these massive bedrooms. I'm trying to decide which one I want. One is a really long rectangular room. Nope. I also dont want to be too near my parents room. I choose the room on the 3rd floor which is the biggest. It has a hole in the floor that looks into another room that no one chose. There is one area that is somewhat shrine-like with white marble statues of baby lions. I learn that this was the mafia guy's 'sex room' where he entertained at his more erotic parties. This is also where he was assasinated. Right on the statues. <br/
