We went on a hike. As we walked along a country road, R said to me, "You woke us up to go too early. It's only six now." We walked along further and I looked at my watch. It was still only six. I called back to the priest for the time. He said 6:45. R insisted he had not said it was that late; but I said I plainly heard five. After a bit I asked for the time again. He was now resting with another man on a ledge against a cliff. We said "8 minutes after 7." I said that we would have to turn back or be late for breakfast. So we did and I said to J. we'd better get a taxi the first chance we had. He didn't think so. We passed two cars and then four but they weren't taxis. At last we came to some stairs. I said, "Now I know we're nearly back." Mother will worry. I didn't tell the nurse we were going. J. said, "Don't bother about mother. She is selfish, only thinking of herself." The stairs were pairs. I asked J. which to take. "Either. Why don't you start up?" "You go first." I think he is planning to trick me.
