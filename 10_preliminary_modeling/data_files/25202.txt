 I'm fishing with my friend Matt Yams. We're on my friend Kevin Simpson's boss' boat. We're in a bay. It is pretty dark out. Matt gets a hit; a big one; a really big one! While he is fighting it I get a hit; another big one. We fight the fish. They pull so hard we have to jump into the water! We back reel and try to tread water while keeping the fish on. Finally, we get back to the boat. Matt climbs up the ladder and I give him my rod while I climb up. We both land fish over 20 lbs! I was using a spinner bait. We may get served alcohol at a bar.
