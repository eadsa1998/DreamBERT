 A person I know from high school, Dimitri Klein, and one of his friends, have moved into the new dorm room of my friend Stephen Ramos and I at Brimson College. I am mad! I don't want to live with three people. Stephen doesn't seem to mind. I raise hell! It is raining outside. A new first year student comes to move in. I help him. He has floatation devices blown up.
