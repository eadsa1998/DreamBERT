I was in the front yard and there were sprinklers all over. And they weren't really spraying at the grass like they were supposed to do. They were spraying at the sidewalk and they were spraying at me, and I was getting soaking wet. This is probably because I was hearing the rain outside. And I ran across the street and stood on the lawn of the condo-town home things and I realized they had sprinklers too, but they were kind of aimed the right way, and I was only getting a little wet over there. So then I went in the middle of the street and stood there a few minutes until our side went off. And then I came back to our side, and we had a pet turkey, a female, and she was sitting and sitting and couldn't lay any turkey eggs for us. So, get this, I was reading her a story and petting her to try to kind of calm her down and not make her so nervous and help her lay an egg. [laugh]
