 I'm outside a church with one man, who may be my housemate Stephen Ramos, and two women, one of whom may be my friend Melanie McDyss. There is a funeral taking place at the church. A white limousine comes. It seems powerful. We sit on the street curb across from the church. The funeral procession leaves. I back up from the curb to the boulevard. I have a feeling of being near my neighbors the Shipp's house in Oak Valley. <br/
