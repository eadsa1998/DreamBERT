I was on a bus with other men, and I saw a woman on an elevated road. I thought it was my mother at first, but it was not her. Later I was on a bus with my mother and sister. The driver left the emergency door partly open and I was worried because we could fall out of the bus. Later when we were walking, my mother appeared taller. She soiled something with her urine.
