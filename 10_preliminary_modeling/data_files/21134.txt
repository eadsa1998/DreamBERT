I was picking up some firewood for Grandma. She was going to make a fire in the stove. I was trying to sneak up on a man by going under things, but he seemed to keep the same distance from me. I picked up a couple lemons and threw them at him. They broke and flew like buckshot and did he run. I looked thru the window at my television. I jumped over a fence very lightly. It was old wood. I looked up at some designs on a ceiling and they were red, white and blue. I thought of horses that color and I was flying high. G.G. and some big fat women were nude. He tried to intimate her, but she always pushed him off. Then he got mad. She had a big pair of legs. Then a woman came in and she had one large leg and a thin one. The husband of the fat woman came in as I was going out. Grandma had about seven beds and there was at least one person in each one. There was a nurse by Sister Mary. I said I would like to hug and kiss her. She came over. I put my arms around her and I hugged and kissed her. The first kiss was good, then I looked at her nose as she had a wart and a hook nose. I didn't like her kiss after that. I had a close look at her lips and face and lost interest in her.
