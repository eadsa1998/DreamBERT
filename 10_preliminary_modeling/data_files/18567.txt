There was a tiny chipmunk-sized lion. A female lion in body type, though gender was not an issue for this little booger. He was trapped in the cellophane covering a bunch of flowers: lilies, yellow, that we'd left on the floor the night before and forgotten to put in water. The leaves were curling brown. They were Molly's flowers. But she was laying on the couch and couldn't be bothered. I said, "This little chipmunk lion is trying to box his way out of the cellophane. Don't you care?" She would not move from the couch. It was up to me to kill the little creature for his own good, because that's how it was. The carpet was beige. There was a hammer nearby but I figured I would miss. So I hit him over the head repeatedly with a round metal plan. A flat pan. I had to bash him over and over and it got bloody. Just before the final blow, I said, "I'm sorry," and watched his last breaths. It was gut-wrenching sad. But it had to be done. Blood was all over the beige carpet and folded-up clothes that were stacked on the floor. The couple married one year came strolling through the sliding glass door. I yelled at them, "You could have been shot! Police would call it self defense because somebody could say they thought you were breaking in. Would you help me clean up this blood?" But all they'd do was put a donation in the plate. She put in $1.00. He put in a five. She said, "You sure are messy." I said, "Well, we were doing laundry. What do you expect?" I had to go to the convenience store for the Sunday paper. The paper was empty. In front a Chinese guy was cooking bacon next to the door. The reason was incentive. Smelling bacon would make people hungry and they'd buy more. A band was playing in the store. Not real good either. The movie screen boy ??? ??? was a cult film about love in families and sex. Guys were hooting and hollering.
