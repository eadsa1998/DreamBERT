We had an excursion and we were going to a shop. I didn't have money with me and Calvin was there. I got bored and called Mom to get me. We had to get into groups and Duane said "We'll have Evelyn in our group". I was then at school. There were gangs of white people around a lot and we had to watch out for them. I saw Eugene walk past and then saw his brother Rodney walking a bit behind him. I decided to walk home. Colleen and a guy with a red bag were in front of me. I realized it was Eugene. Colleen kept touching him. Johanna was then there and they did this weird thing with their arms (holding hands and making shapes). I kept getting trapped in it, so I ran ahead and they were laughing (friendly). Then I was at Granny's old house. I went in and I was lying on a mattress on the floor, watching TV. My phone was being screwy. This darkish lady came and I said that I didn't know anyone was living here and that it was my Granny's old place. She let me stay and later this other lady came and she said "This must be your Granny" and I said "No, she's Alice Muriel Wedding". I text Mom and Darren. I tried to call Dad.
