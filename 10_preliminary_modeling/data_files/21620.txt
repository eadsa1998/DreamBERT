I saw 6-6 in the paper. I tried to dream what post position was going to win in the sixth race. I was lying on the ground and a long worm was trying to wrap itself around me. I got up and cut it in two and it was partly in the ground and partly out. I was bawling out my family for not watching Judy. She had a handful of her feces and put it into her mouth and ate it.
