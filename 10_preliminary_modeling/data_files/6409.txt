As I recall, it began when I needed to go over to Jimmy's house to do a report. I brought a book that I needed, but it turned out not to be enough, so I went upstairs (in Jimmy's house) to get a new book, setting down the jar of peanut butter I was suddenly, inexplicably holding. Jimmy's house dissolves into my house. Time passes. Night arrives. My parents come home, and we all start talking together. There is a party of some sort going on around us, and we hear a news report that the police are careening off to some crime. We get in our car and start down Green Drive, pausing to let the police pass when they do. Laura's in the car. We decide to follow the cops, and they lead us to the other end of town, where the K-Mart is, and there is a bank there. We walk inside, and a policeman announces. "Well folks, there's at least one dead teller. Of Penn and Teller." Sure enough, some guy is wired to a computer with lots of squiggly wires. But he doesn't look like Teller of Penn and Teller. Amusingly, he looks exactly like Edward Teller, the nuclear physicist. I think, very dramatically, "HOW to STOP this MONSTER?? AAAH YESS! PLAYING MUSIC OVER THE TELEPHONE!" <br/
