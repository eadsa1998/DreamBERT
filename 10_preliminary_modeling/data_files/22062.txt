I remember I was at a dinner party. Beside me, silent, is a girl dressed in black who looks at me constantly. She is a friend of mine. All the others are friends and they laugh and talk. Suddenly the girl starts to pat my leg. I got excited. She kissed me. I opened my eyes and looked at her, and I continued kissing her, without wanting to. The others weren't even looking. Then I awoke.
