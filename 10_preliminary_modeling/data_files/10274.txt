I am in a Department Store and see Rita (my brother's mother-in-law) we get on the elevator but go DOWN instead of UP shift: I am crossing the street with Father Andrew and Marissa, she is friendly like in the olden days shift: long segment of sleeping in a flimsy tent in the mountains and eating only brown rice.
