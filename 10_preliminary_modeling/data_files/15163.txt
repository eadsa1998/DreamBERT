I was sitting on the step in the back room, talking to Mom and Ezra. Mom was on her computer and Ezra was standing near the table. I was thinking about How I Met Your Mother and how awesome Barney was and I was going to ask Ezra who his favourite character was, but then remembered he didn't watch it. There was a video of Jason Segel (it looked like it was from around season 1/2) laughing a little and looking at the camera. There was a TV show called Triers. Dad said on Facebook that he cried. It was about a hospital thing in the forest. Sharlto Copley was in it. A lady was pregnant. Mom and I were then at the hospital thing. Spaceman was there too. I said 'woo!' and she mentioned Spaceman and I was like 'how did you know I was woo-ing at Spaceman?' and she said 'what else?' and I said "the guy from District 9" and she said she didn't remember it. Then it was like World of Warcraft and there were lots of different mobs in one area. I kept getting attacked by these giant worms and I squealed. I had also been at college years ago and Ted (How I Met Your Mother) said that I just stayed in bed and had sex all day. In Freaks and Geeks, someone had made a video of the 'losers' to show them what they were.
