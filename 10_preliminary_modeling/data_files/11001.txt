I dreamed the atom bomb had hit parts of Ohio and as I walked along the street, I could see the smoke from where the bomb had landed. (This occurred on Monday.) I knew that three days later the bomb would hit Cleveland and I wanted to get home as fast as I could. I was with my 11-year-old sister and together we got on a bus. No one had to pay bus fare because the bomb was coming. I noticed we were on the wrong bus and it took us way out to University Heights. My sister and I got off the bus and ran into a stranger's house to call home. My grandmother answered the phone (here I was conscious of the fact that I was dreaming) and I told her I would be right home. Suddenly I found myself at home. I began to cry and had a horrible fear of dying and of the atom bomb.
