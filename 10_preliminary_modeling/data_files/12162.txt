I was friends with this guy. I liked him and he liked me too, although he didn't show it. This girl, who was going out with this other guy, kept having sex with him. I can't remember the first time, but the next time was at the girl's house. We ran up to the top floor attic thing. And they had sex. The girl ran down as we were walking. She mouthed 'barbie' and her father said something about sausages. I called Mom to pick me up. The guy fell down in an elevator. I couldn't find the lid for the water bottle.
