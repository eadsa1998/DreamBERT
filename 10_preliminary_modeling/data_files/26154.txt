 I'm in a dimly lit bar. My high school classmate Cory Black is sitting next to me. He asks me what the date is. I tell him it's the 15th. I get some things for free. I have my choice of items on a table or shelf. Among the items are mugs and playing cards. There is a list to sign up on to play softball. I think I'd like to play, and wonder if my friends Tim and Niles Zelling singed up.
