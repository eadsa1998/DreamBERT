I got a kitten and Mom spent some time with it. A few days later I called it Vera. I had to catch a train but I kept missing it. There was a weird elevator somewhere. I went to sit down. Adam Baldwin had his legs up on a desk. I sat in front and played the theme song from Firefly. Mom had gotten rid of a pool that he had had and I was amazed about it. I watched a Firefly special feature where Inara and Mal had a fake wedding. Then I was watching Castle and Beckett asked if Castle would give her sperm. Then ages later she cried out "what you did is rape!" And she also had had a baby. A DVD cover mentioned Firefly.
