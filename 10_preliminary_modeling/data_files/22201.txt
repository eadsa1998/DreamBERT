Suddenly a race was organized in which a friend of mind participated (he is in the U.S. studying and I haven't seen him for three years and I don't get letters or news about him, but his brother who is in Lima came to my home about two months ago, asking me to get in touch with him because he had something to tell me, but I didn't write and I don't see him. This is for your information.) I lent him my "station wagon" and when I left, I wanted to tell him to take care of it and that if it didn't work, to let me know immediately. Merely by wishing to speak to him, I appeared in front of a house with very long stairs which led to the first story of an old house. When I talked to him to tell him what I wanted, he answered me by saying that he would do so and that I shouldn't worry and I left. I woke up when my brother-in-law asked me to take him to the airport at 5:30 a.m.
