 I'm with my psychology professor Marianne Stash and two women at a fast food restaurant. The women may be my friends Nicole Peterson and Mya Rousing. I say that Marianne grades really hard. I have a bunch of carrots in my lip, like a pinch of chewing tobacco. I spit it out, and joke with the women.
