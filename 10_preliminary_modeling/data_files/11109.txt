I was at work typing when the company president came into my office and asked me to come and take some dictation from him. This was my first experience of working with the president and I was excited and afraid. The president was a very stern man and frightened me. As I started, I had quite a bit of trouble, first a broken pencil, then I got a little behind the dictator and I began to think of losing my job. I became so confused that he had to dictate the whole letter over again.
