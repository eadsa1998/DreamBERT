There were different parts of the river we could swim to. Destinations. One was in the ocean. It was an accomplishment to swim there and back alive because of the dangerous undercurrents. Out on the rock in the river, I was asking a guy about the alternative uses for "x" in an equation. I said (that) "x" was unknown but he said, "no," (that) I couldn't use it that way because I was using it with people variables and not numbers. My mother had 2 TV dinners, frozen, in the cabinet. I did not like everything in there--only one part of each one: the grits from one (from the egg lump, grits and wad of ham) and applesauce from the port chop dinner.
