Brad is describing a joke that Hannah once played on him. As Brad tells his story, I see what happened. Brad is climbing up a ladder, embracing a gigantic can of Mountain Dew. He reaches the top and I see that he's on top of a pool slide. Right before going down the slide into the pool, he opens the can. But Hannah had set a trap. The can explodes, drenching Brad with Mountain Dew. He looks so pitifully silly that I wake myself up laughing.
