Yesterday, last night, I had a dream that Dad and I were at Scenic Point having a picnic and Dad was over doing his exercises and I had the boom box on my blanket. And I was playing the "Wee Sing" tape. And it was playing and going on and going on like the stuff that it has and then a couple songs before "Blue Bird" I decided it wouldn't be such a good idea for us to hear that, so I shut off the tape and put on the radio. And soon after Flounder from the Little Mermaid was coming up to our blanket like a pigeon and he had claws like a bird and he perched on my hand for a little bit. And then he jumped back into the water and I jumped in with him and I swam around for a little bit. And then getting out was like no challenge at all. The water was like a few feet down from the sea wall and after that we were going to meet Mom at this far thing like Disneyland and there was this playground that we were going on and I was supposed to have a tape machine, because I was going to record all the noise and sounds and everything from the fair, but I guess I left it at the picnic area. It was really Mom's boom box and we were going to go see Mom on this playground. And we did and I found her sitting on the bottom of this like walk-in bird cage, and we started talking about different things, and we planned to go to this like show with elephants or something. But I woke up before we got there. That was weird! But I think it has a lot of roots of my past. In this dream about me singing "Blue Bird" I wasn't really scared; I just didn't feel comfortable playing it in front of Dad. And the Disneyland fair thing, there was a lot of, we went to Disneyland a lot when I was younger and we met up with Samantha, Sandra and Derek at different places. So that's that.
