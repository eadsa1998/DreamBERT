Matthew was about six or seven years old. He was wearing a pair of shorts and a white T-shirt. I was sitting in my favorite chair in the living room, and he came running in and jumped up in my lap. He was sitting with the back of his head resting on my left arm, and I slid my right arm under his knees and kind of pulled him closer to me, and in a semi fetal position. I said something to him either about how much I loved him or how important he was or both. He just gave me a sweet smile. Then later, he comes downstairs and he is holding something in his right hand that is about the size of a posterboard and he has something in his left hand as well. I ask him what he's doing and he says he is going to color except that's not the word he used. I don't remember the word that he used. It wasn't a normal word. Nothing I'd heard before, but in the dream I knew what he meant. He was sitting at the coffee-table coloring like he always used to do. I was sitting in my favorite chair. He asked me if I wanted to color with him, and I said I didn't know. I was really in a funk. The best way I can describe it is to say that sometimes I just get this feeling. It's a feeling of uneasiness or unrest, or as if something bad is about to happen. It's a very odd feeling and I can never identify what's causing it.
