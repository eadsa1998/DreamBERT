Then I dreamt that I and a girlfriend went to a beauty shop where I haven't been in a long time, but in the dream the beauty shop wasn't in its own place, but rather in the place where my present beauty shop is. I went in and the hair dresser there, Elizabeth, received me very well and asked me why I hadn't gone there in such a long time, and she made me sit to comb my hair. Then I felt the beauty shop more concretely, the chair where I had sat had been moved with me and Elizabeth to the little garden in front of my house.
