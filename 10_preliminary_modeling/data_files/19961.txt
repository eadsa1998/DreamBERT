A hysterical woman was pulling off the top of her dress, exposing her body. Later I saw a man and a woman burying a man's head in a lot. The man had a turban on his head. As they drove off, I tried to get their license number. The man saw me. Later as I was going into the building, the man appeared behind me and began chasing me. I shouted for the police. He kept following me.
