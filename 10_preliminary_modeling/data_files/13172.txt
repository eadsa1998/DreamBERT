I was at school waiting for Mom, because I was wagging. I found out that Darren had adopted some guy called Matt Keeslar and I was thinking of Brennan and Matt Keeslar (the actor) but it wasn't either of them. They went somewhere and my phone was missing and we discovered that he had taken it. We got home and he jumped in the bin. Darren was going to bash him. Mom and I drove off and she was crying.
