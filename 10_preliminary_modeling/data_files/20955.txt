We were in the shop and I saw oil running on the floor. I was barefooted. I told Bill Grove the oil seemed to come out of the floor. He went downstairs and water started to gush out. Then spray. It got me wet. I could see a sewer drain when it stopped. We sat in the locker room and Mitchkash sat with us. I knew he was dead. He looked young and I was going to ask him if a steel bull was going to win his race, but I was backward.
