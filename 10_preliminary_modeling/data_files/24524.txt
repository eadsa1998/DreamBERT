It's night. I'm returning to my apartment in a dungeon-like building in New York. It's dangerous. I want to get inside. Once in, I see someone banging on the window. I should be frightened but I'm not. The small man tells me about a job offer in social work. He resembles a VN vet seen in a store last week. I go to the interview. A young black man performs a comedic act. Then a young woman tells me about the job. It's clear she has done this many times. She pitches an entry-level job as if it is exciting and desirable. Until I ask, she leaves out the actual work details, which are to administer cognitive tests to children. The location is vague. A female cashier I speak to talks up the job but I'm more interested in her bust than what she says.  I don't want this job. It reminds me of past experiences in life. I don't want it at all. I don't immediately decline, but ask the female interviewer to send me details. Then I walk towards an open area with trees and grass. There is a table with fruit on it. I accidentally drop some on the ground. Several policemen sit at the table for lunch. Recollection ends here.
