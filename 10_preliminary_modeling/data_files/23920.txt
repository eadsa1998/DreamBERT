I'm walking down the street wearing the rubber gloves I wear at work. On my street, which actually looked more like a suburban street, I came across three black guys trying to break into a car - a silver Audi. I suggested they use my rubber gloves so they wouldn't leave fingerprints on the car. I was at home, I know Eric was there, maybe Julia. There is a ring at the door. I open it and in walks about 20-30 black guys who just barge in. They ignore me as they just casually walk through the door. I recognize the guys who were stealing the car. They are trashing the place. I'm scared but when I see one of the car stealing guys I act like he's my best friend - "Yo, what's up, etc..." - so casual. I try to call the police but keep on dialing the wrong number. Another time there is someone on the phone - I think maybe it's Eric on the line - I tell him that we need to call the police. Eric decides to go to a neighbors house to call so he sneaks out the back door. I know a bunch of guys have left the house and ask the car stealing guy what they are doing. He calls them by some sort of title and says they are the meanest guys in the bunch and they like to kill people for fun. They are going to get Eric! I'm terrified. I think of those guys chasing Eric down the street with knives trying to kill him. [Eric = my brother; Julia = my sister]
