A young lady was asking me for a loan of ten thousand; this girl seemed to be a hairdresser (employed at the place where they do my hair). She told me that she needed the money and that I was the only person who could help her. We were in a room which seemed to be part of a building. The girl was behind a wooden counter. I was next to my father.
