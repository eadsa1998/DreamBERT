My wife Anita and I are walking in our former neighborhood.  There aren't as many houses as there are in reality.  We pass one which is tiny, and appears to be nothing more than an outhouse, though it is made of nice wood.  We pass another one, slightly larger, and I decide to go take a leak there.  When I go in, I find that there is indeed a bathroom, but there are also people playing cards in two rooms.  I apologize for the intrusion, but they aren't upset.  One of the guys gets up and introduces himself in a very friendly way.  His name is Derek.  I assume the place is a kind of social building for the community.
