There's a street full of pubs. It kind of reminds me of a hilly part of Edinburgh, but I think it's meant to be London. It's an area that seems to be slightly rough. There seems to be plenty of students around. I think I'm there with my mother who needs cheering up. I buy her a drink in a pub that's full of young people. It seems like we stick out there.
