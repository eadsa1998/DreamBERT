I came home from work and rushed to a softball or baseball game where a team I played for was playing. The game was already underway.  I thought I was the on-deck batter, but then I noticed that my team was in the field, and there was no place for me.  At first I thought my team was playing the Detroit Tigers, because the batter had a Tigers uniform on, and I thought that it was strange that they would play an exhibition game against a ragtag team like ours-but then I saw that the other players on his team had regular clothes.  As I watched, the batter was hit by a pitch.  He glared at our pitcher, and then he took a few steps toward the mound, the bat held above his head in both hands.  Our pitcher took a couple of steps toward him, but then players from both sides held them back, and some shouted "Bush." at the batter to chastise him for his actions.  I thought he was trying to emulate big leaguers.
