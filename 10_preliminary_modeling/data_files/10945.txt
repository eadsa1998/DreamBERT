I was in a room in which lay on a hospital bed a male patient. He was losing his eye, only didn't seem to care. The next day I was going to a party and found that I had contacted the disease took and was quite worried because I didn't want to bear the pain and lose the eye. My friends took very good care of me. One bandaged my eye while the others waited in the car for me. I was sorry to keep them waiting so long, but they said that was perfectly all right. We rode to a beautiful village and it was night time when we arrived there. Everyone was very hungry, so we stopped at a strange little place for food. I felt wonderful again and more reassured about my eye, which though it was still painful and inflamed, seemed to me to be healing. After eating, we played hide and seek, and then had to go on. I didn't recognize many of my friends, but I knew I liked them all, everyone was in a good humor and laughing and joking.
