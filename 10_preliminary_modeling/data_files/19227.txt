My dream took place in an area that looked like a mix between southern Arizona and Minnesota. It felt like a spring day, and I was on a beautiful well-built horse with a deep chest and strong fore and hind legs, wide back, and a smooth gait. It was a chestnut mare with a black mane and tail and a white star on a wide forehead. Birds were twittering, and I was flying at a full gallop, the thrill of the ride filling me and making me vigorous and full of life. I was happy and at peace.
