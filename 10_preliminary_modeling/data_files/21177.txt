I was operating b and s; the spindle would stop every once in a while and make a bad one. I took the tool out and was grinding it. It was lunchtime and everyone went to eat. We were in PA on a visit. We were in bed. Bob got up to take a pee. Rose Lasko was looking at me. I could see her eyes and face. I went hunting with Wiatrack. The shells were ragged and went into the chamber kind of tight. We walked thru the weeds and grass, but couldn't see any game. I carried something to the shop in a tablespoon. I was late. Walter Demo was small. I told him what a shrimp he was. He was as small as my Bob.
