I was with "my" [imaginary] animals. A white goat, muley--no horns--butted me playfully. I could not tell if the goat was tame or wild. It sort of butted me towards a hilltop. As we went to edge of dry stream bed, the slope down one side and up the other was easy to walk, even though the sparkly sand (volcanic ash?) changed to frost and light snow--not slippery at all. It was crisp to walk in the cold air and hear the quiet crispness underfoot. Above me was my pet male deer, Elk, Moose--it had the largest horns I'd ever seen, all branchy like an open fan. I walked closer, my goat just behind me. I took off my black belt and came closer to its pretty grey-brown neck. I put the belt around it and closed it, with some of strap left over like a handle, fearful because the horn hitting me would kill me with just a twitch of the deer's head and neck.
