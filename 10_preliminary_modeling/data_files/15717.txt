I went to The Room screening [going to one this week]. I got there early before the movie to get autographs and photos. I got Tommy Wiseau to sign my stuff and Dad's stuff. I had a photo with him and he had his face pressed against mine and drooled on my face. He was really strange. Later there was a big crowd and Greg Sestero wandered in. I was stalking to him and gave him Dad's stuff to sign -- Wiseau had written 'happy birthday Dad!' and Sestero copied it. I gave Greg the book to sign. James Spader was on the cover. He started tracing his face quickly and also wrote 'James Spader' and did all this weird stuff to it. He was joking around and laughing and then Mom came in and I told her who he was and she said 'oh yeah, The Room sounds good'. I said it was. I was making jokes about that and laughing. I wanted to ask for a photo but I felt awkward now.
