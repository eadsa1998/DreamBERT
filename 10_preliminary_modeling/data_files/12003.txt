We went to 'Seabird'. There were two caravans. Mom was there and we were going to share the bigger caravan. Nana owned them or something. There was also a boy, who was a serious computer addict. He lived in this room, which was stacked high with games and other computer things. We went to the big caravan, which was messy. I went to the bedroom and turned around and screamed. A room on the left side had been one which I had dreamed the Zelda person (The lady from 217 in The Shining remake) was in and I was seeing things. It was really scary. We ended up in a small cabin looking outside because there was something evil out there.
