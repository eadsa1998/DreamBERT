I was in a shop. This guy was putting on a show, by hanging people up and eventually killing them. I was one of them. I managed to escape, but he caught me straight away. I escaped again and he came after me and eventually got me. I escaped again and went and hid in the music section. There was a guard at the exit. I moved a little and the guy looked and he realized something was up, so he came over to check and I hit him with a chair. He shot his gun and fell. I ran out. The guy was there and I ran into the carpark. I called Dad and told him to come with Mom. The guy was sometimes Michael Rosenbaum. Mom and Dad came and the licence plate was different. The numbers at the end had three lots of numbers and I realized that they were dodgy, so I ran. The guy would let me choose a section of the carpark to darken and I could hide and then he would come after me. I went to some foreign girl's caravan. I told her my boyfriend was after me. Her sister came. She let me hide in this corner of the caravan. The bad guys came to question her and they were James Spader and Vanessa Williams. They were talking to the girl and I got bored and jumped up, but James just asked the foreign girl to marry him. There was something about David Tennant and he had red hair and his brothers had red hair and freckles.
