I can't remember properly, but I was walking home past Midvale shops (like through the carpark and down the road behind the church). There was a girl with short, curly hair who was often there. She followed me, which creeped me out, so I called Mom to get me, she agreed to reluctantly. She took me to a party and the girl was there. She wanted to talk to me and I ran. It says something about a theft play and something. We got out and took her in with others? Calvin was with her. There was a theatre. Ezra was there. There was a video of Yuckfou, supposedly, giving a speech. The videos were all [something I can't read] and stuff to make. Something was level 88 on Runescape.
