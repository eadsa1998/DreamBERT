I dreamed that Pauline and I were in American Studies, and our final exam was to do a scavenger hunt in the chapel. The whole school was there, and there were clues in Middle English. Pauline and I took a while to get to the end, but we finally did. We had to hack open a pew. When we did, there were fingernails inside. I screamed and cried and the whole school thought it was a terrific joke. It was horrible. Then Sue, Camilia, and I were all sharing a room in a small Spanish town, and were trying to get lunch, but the line was too long. Then I woke up.
