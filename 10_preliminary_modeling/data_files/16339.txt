I've been having a little bit of a dream dry spell, but last night I had a pretty really neat dream. I dreamt that Dad had bought me this Little Mermaid videotape because it was on sale at Blockbuster, and it wasn't the original story, but it was kind of like a side little story -- not necessarily a sequel, just kind of like another story. And so we sat down and we were watching it, and we had the surround sound turned on, and I went up close to see it, and of all things [laugh] Flounder and Ariel were at a casino gambling and Flounder was like putting money down with his fins. And there was like all kinds of flashing lights and stuff going on [laugh], and there were these other mer-people there that were like doing the same thing. And then all of a sudden, in the middle of their like card game, I guess it was, Ursula comes in and like waves her magic wand and makes everybody like silent and still. And Ariel and Flounder managed to escape because the other mer-people turned to stone, and then all of a sudden I'm like in the movie and I'm at this like Adventure Island kiddie pool, and this girl who's kind of dressed like a mermaid is saying, "Jasmine, come this way; you're going the wrong way." And I'm trying to remember what else was in it. I don't remember too much else. And that's all I remember unfortunately. I didn't have time to take this down this morning and now it's like 24 hours later, I guess, oh no, it was like a few. Now I'm all confused. Well anyway, you get the gist.
