Charla is deliberately refusing to obey me. She is running down the stone steps of a huge Catholic church. I am very, very angry at her and crying and upset. I cry out to her, "You must stop. Come here at once," and so on and she laughs at me and keeps on going. I know somehow that to keep chasing after her and pleading in anger isn't going to work and I should withdraw, but I am driven by my strong feelings to continue. It's as though I can't stop. Jake comes up the steps and I see he is going into a room that has religious statues and I hope he will at least nod his head toward them in respect, although he won't do the Catholic thing, seeing as he isn't Catholic.
