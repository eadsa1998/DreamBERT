Myself and some of my family members were at a middle school, attending an event for Bob F's three older boys. They were all wearing navy blue slacks with red and gold shirts. I was thinking how grown up they all looked. Stephen F had said something to Bev about something he heard but he only told her part of it because he couldn't remember all of it. I was talking to Bev about it. Because he couldn't remember all of it, it seemed to cause her some concern about Rachel S. I remember saying to her Oh Bev, it's not like she's going to be the next Hitler.
