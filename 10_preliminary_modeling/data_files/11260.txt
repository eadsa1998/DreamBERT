I received a phone call from an old girl friend of mine. She asked why I hadn't called her. She is going to school in Chicago. She acted as though she was very interested in me, but I had the feeling that it was just an act. She asked me a question that I couldn't answer. This question seemed ridiculous to me at the time, and because of that I forgot what it was she said.
