I inhabit a world whereby countries as different as Germany, China and Sri Lanka exist as suburbs or village-sized locations in the local landscape. I walk from one to the other, which are separated by a gradual change of countryside. In 'China' I stay in a hotel, which is small but beautiful - some kind of mixture between modern and traditional Chinese architecture which consists of interlocking planes of reds, pinks and blacks.
