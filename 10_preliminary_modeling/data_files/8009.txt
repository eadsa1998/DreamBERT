I was back at the old house on Lakeland Drive for a visit. I looked out the patio door and saw that they had removed the deck. I went to the backdoor in the laundry room and opened it. They had made the yard much higher, the height of the door, both to the left and to the front of the door. You could step out about 3 or 4 feet. In the grass directly in front of the door there were cement strips. They were about 5 feet long and only about 6 inches wide. They went to the top of the yard and had about 12 inches of grass between each one. I tried to use them to step up and see the yard but wasn't successful because they weren't wide enough. I stepped back inside and tried to close the door and saw a snake hanging from the top of the door. I grabbed something and tried to knock it off and to the outside and close the door quickly but there was another. I swung at it a couple of times and couldn't knock it out. As the dream progressed there were snakes everywhere in the house. I don't like snakes at all so I was panicking and terribly frightened by all of these snakes.
