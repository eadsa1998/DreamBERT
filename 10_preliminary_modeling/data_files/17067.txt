The Tae Kwon Do master is teaching me how to throw a good side kick. He is showing me, while I was sparring against another student. I accidentally kick the other student in the back. The master says it is okay, that you can dislodge someone's limbs if you do it properly, even though it's against the rules, and not safe. Then he told me my back was too tight. I knew I needed to stretch more.
