["Man desperately wants me. I am afraid."] A man is desperately in love with me. He is consumed by the need. I am afraid of him. He could hurt me. He is stalking me. I run down the hall from an apartment and sneak into another apartment, because he broke into my apartment to get to me. I hope the owner is not home. I listen intently at the door. The man is coming. I also see the owner of the apartment is home. I hide under a counter with a curtain across the recessed area. Both men are talking about me. Asking where I am. I am afraid. He will find me. He might kill me. I am not attracted to him but am amazed at the intensity of his feelings for me.
