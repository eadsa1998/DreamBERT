I went back to highschool to redo it to change my course at university. Darius and Eugene were also in my class. Darius sat next to me and a short time later, he and Eugene were talking about something that I couldn't hear but it turned out they both liked me. They more than hinted that at this girl sitting in front of us. I whispered something and she told me to shut up and I yelled at her. I was in a car later and she smashed a rock on my bonnet. I got out and smashed her phone and hit her in the stomach with a rock and drove off. I went to this place in the forest and asked Darius to lie and said that she smashed her phone and I only hit her once after she threatened me. She overheard me and said he didn't have to lie. Then I was at a resort place with Eugene and we were dating. I followed him to our room and was searching through everywhere, opening cupboards and I was touching his clothes. There was a folder with school work and something that he'd written mentioned 'homosex' and I laughed. He said 'I love you' to me. Then this girl was having an affair with this old guy. He turned into a fish and then it was a movie and it was shot like Zelig. At the end, he turned completely into a fish and was on the floor. She put him in a bowl.
