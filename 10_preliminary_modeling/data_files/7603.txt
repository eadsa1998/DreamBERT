I was at a party at Adam's house. They had many of their friends there and I felt very uncomfortable and out of place there. There was one man there, younger than me, who seemed to be interested in me. I couldn't believe that he would be. However, he was persistent and we ended up getting close. Not sexual, but emotional. We held hands, talked a lot, and kissed. Later I was with him and my family.
