We went for a drive and it was late at night. I was with Mom and Ezra. There was a little ball of light that looked like it was floating. We were living in this place which like a caravan park, but it wasn't. It was like a small community thing. We went back a while later and there was a cloud with the light and there were sparks. It was worrying me. At some point we went to see some live concert in a small area in a tunnel. We couldn't stand and it was hard to get a seat. This young Indian guy got offered a house if he called the owner and get him to sell and do something else. We drove home and we lived near the beach. I was with some guy. Chiana (Farscape) had some food like those Turkish meat things. I signaled someone to get me some but realized she made some for me. I couldn't remember what they were called. We went to Dad's house. It was clean around the side and there was a toilet in his bedroom. We left the caravan park again. We stopped at a shop. The car was next to a window and I was on Ezra's side and he was on mine. I locked my door. Mom came back and this girl got in the passenger seat. Mom and I kicked her out. I was worried she would follow us. Then I realized it was a dream. I was scared and wanted to wake up. Then I opened my eyes and felt tired. I was now 'awake'.
