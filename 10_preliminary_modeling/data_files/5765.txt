[1997-06-19] I was in my church and I was at a counter to buy something. I don't know what it was. A woman from the church came up to me and said that she would take me up to the classroom where we had to go, so I just left a $20 bill on the counter to buy whatever it was. I didn't get anything for the 20 dollars, I just left it there. Then I took this lady's left arm and started walking with her, which is something I never do, unless I have no choice, I always take their right arm with my left arm. But I took the left side and remembered wondering why I had done it. Then we went up and sat down in the classroom.
