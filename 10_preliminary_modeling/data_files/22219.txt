It was a sunny afternoon and I found out I had a little sister. I was about 11 years old. I wanted to kill her, to crash her against the wall. I felt furious and had a jealousy attack, because I realized that I wouldn't be the only one any more, and I was like a tyrannical king, mean, in that I rejoiced in suffering, in tears. At last I accomplished what I wanted and I felt the same as before, because I had killed a person who wasn't good for anything, and most of all, she was in my way.
