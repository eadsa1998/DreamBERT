Earl comes to our house for a visit; but it is full of young men who are helping to paint the house; I see them painting the window trim white; I notice the curtains dipping into the paint, but I say nothing. One of the boys says they need more paint and I tell them where the nearest paint store is. Then I get ready to go to a restaurant with Earl. I comb my hair very carefully, and it is blonde (like when I was quite young in Vienna). I lay my bobby pins and comb on a ledge near where a woman, wearing black and looking very dour, is sitting; she is irritated with me. I apologize. Then I try to turn on the light, but the light bulb is burned out.... I mutter something like "This is my house, and this is where I always comb my hair:"--Finally I walk out to look for Earl. He has just arrived and goes to his car to get a sweater and tie and his best clothes. Then we walk down the street, arm in arm, feeling very proud. "Did I ever tell you that you look like my father?" We laugh and joke about it. And then he says: "Did I ever tell you that you look like...? "he does not finish the sentence. I feel happy and proud. I take my camera and we go for a long walk and we make a $3 bet, but can't remember what we bet....
