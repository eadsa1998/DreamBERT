A large field surrounded by woods. The field was grown up in tall grass -- almost to my shoulders. There were one or two rather faintly marked paths. I seemed to be gathering up some sort of rubbish (like pieces of bark, etc.). Something white caught my eye; proved to be a "fringe bush" in blossom. Nearby another white object was a number of newspapers fastened on the limbs of a small tree in such a way as to form a wall and a partial roof. Seemed to be a shelter of some sort -- perhaps for spooners. The rubbish was to be wrapped up in pieces of newspaper.
