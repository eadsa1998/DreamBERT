I liked some guy, but went out with someone else instead. We went to a hotel and had sex. We ended up breaking up so I could go out with the other guy and I said to him, "there's something I should tell you, I'm not a virgin". He was like "what..?" and realized I had slept with the other guy. I said I didn't plan it, it just happened. Then it was Dawson's Creek and Joey and this guy were talking in bed and she said "you said you didn't... and I don't know what that means". He said he didn't enjoy himself. She had recorded it and he found it. Then I was watching One Tree Hill and someone ran a restaurant and was looking for plates and went to Nathan, even though he had never gone to the restaurant. Haley was fat.
