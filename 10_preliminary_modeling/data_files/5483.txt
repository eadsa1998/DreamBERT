I had a dream that I was standing in a rehearsal of my community chorus for a concert and we were dancing as we were singing a mellow Carpenters number and I was relieved to find that I was following everyone else's movements and not out of step with them. Our conductor asked a friend of mine, R, a recovering anorexic, to stand up and speak some words about the disorder in the middle of a song, but she never got up and because I didn't hear her speak I thought to myself: "why is she not getting up?" and speaking the way she's supposed to be.
