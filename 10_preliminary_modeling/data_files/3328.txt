My rooms are very cluttered and messy. Some women friends come by to visit and peek in and start to go away because it is such a mess. I call to them and say, "I've been cleaning it up; come on in." They do. Now I am at a doctor's office. A man like Billy Crystal sits on a toilet and gets some procedure up the ass. He now understands what it is like for women giving birth and so on. He is surprised at the pain. Now I am going on a drive and read an account that thousands of starlings are in the area. I want to see them, it would be beautiful and interesting, but I add, "Not where I'm driving, because I could get into a wreck." I'm driving along the coast. I stop and see a small boy crying and adults trying to explain things to him. A woman says, "He wanted a cone to eat." I say, "I have one." She says it's OK to give it to him. I go down a ramp to him and show him the ice cream cone, which is filled with sticky cactus-like things. He's eats it all. I am amazed. As I go back up the ramp, walking, I notice some of the sticky cactus things are stuck in my flesh. I pull a long thin thread of one out of the palm of my hand. Then another one and several others on my hand. Then the woman, like Hillary of Merton Circle, says, "You are bleeding," and I see a hole in the palm of my hand with blood drops coming out. One drop falls to the floor. She assures me I'll be all right. I keep pulling these things out of me.
