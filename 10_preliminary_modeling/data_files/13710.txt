Mom and I went to a petrol station or deli. Ezra was on TV talking about Runescape and summoning. I was thinking that I wanted to do my summoning. Someone was questioning Mom about us, so she made us record a bunch of stuff so she could say she was with us. Some lady was in a building with another lady who she was protecting. The bad guys came and she said "we gotta get out of here". Then it was a game and on the screen there were lots of dots and it showed which dots were bad guys. I had to find a path where I'd be ok. Then I was at school and we were watching something which was really weird and I said "It's like David Lynch!".
