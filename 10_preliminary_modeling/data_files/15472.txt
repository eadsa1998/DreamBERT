Mom was pregnant and pretty far along. I drove her somewhere and we got into this big argument and we yelled loudly and I got angry. Then it was a movie. These 4 teens/young adults were at this house. There were dragons in this building across the road and they could talk. They had to sleep on this 3 layer platform outside. Three moved to a lower layer and one left and went inside. It showed a dragon stabbing a blanket and then it showed them sleeping underneath. A guy inside came up from a trapdoor to the basement. There was a hologram of these nerdy collector cards if you took this carpet away. He ended up finding out all this information about it and got armour and special powers. He took some others to this bridge thing. They had to hold hands and touch this thing and hold their hands up high and aim at the bad guy (who was fighting the good guy). It was hard to keep your balance though and they lost the first time.
