I was at the post office or something. There was a box with envelopes and I found one with my name on it, but it was just a shirt. There were two more with my name but they weren't filled yet and I was annoyed. There were some photos of me, just my head and neck but I was naked. I was wearing a necklace and I was really grossed out by it. I was then at home waiting for the delivery truck. A car drove past but it was a hearse.
