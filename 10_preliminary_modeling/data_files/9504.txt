       At the Office: overlooking Mississippi river: beautiful view: watch barges go through narrow place: one esp. goes fast. Then Father Andrew goes for lunch with men to a cave; I stay behind. Then I see Ukrainian birthday celebration from the window: children, horses, wagons, singing. Marissa Camden &amp; Nevena there; sudden thunder storm and they take shelter at Morris &amp; Christie's. I go over and talk to Zig about getting good ginger ale and 7-up. Then walk over to Marissa Camden who is walking out with another woman; we sit and drink coffee and they gossip. I feel quite different, and they seem strange and old.
