I remember that a friend of mine and I were walking by a familiar, but not too often frequented place. I don't remember why we were walking that way. Before getting to the corner, my friend turned around and, pointing to somebody on the opposite side of the street, asked me whether it was a man or a woman. The fact is that it was very difficult to tell, and I told him so. Then he told me that even though it was a man, he could pass for a woman. This would have alarmed me if it had really happened, but in the dream it did not bother me at all. Rather, I told him that I would find out the gender of the person. Then my friend asked me for a cigarette, but he did this in a "charming" manner, if that is the expression, I suppose, so that I would not refuse him. But I did not have any cigarettes, and I told him so. The way he asked me for the cigarette irritated me.
