I sometimes have a recurring dream where I am at the top of a cliff. The sky is red, the air is very humid and dry at the same time. And I can't see below the edge of the cliff. The cliff is made out of some black rocks. My mom is standing on a rock directly at the edge and my dad is standing on a rock directly at the edge. There is a faceless person ordering me to push off one of them and for me to follow, or else both of my parents and my two siblings will die. Both of them are telling me to push themselves and I can't decide. I am tortured by them torturing my siblings (I can't see them, I just know they are there) until I decide. Sometimes I wake up crying.
