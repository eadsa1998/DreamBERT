 My high school classmates Wyatt Belzer and Mya Rousing are going to, or have gone, to France. Alister Thomas is going or has gone as well. I'm a robot or an efficient worker. I rollerblade along a busy street and catch up to a teenage boy. A man there, who has a high status, sees me as I rollerblade. He asks me a question about being an efficient worker, and I reply. I seem to have to be near a median in or near a busy road.
