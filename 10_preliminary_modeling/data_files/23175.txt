I was teaching a university class.  There were very few students-maybe 8 or 9-in a rather large room.  I was trying to determine everyone's names, without much success, by asking the class as a whole rather than each individual.  Finally I asked a guy on the front row, and he said he would have to wait and see after the football season began.  I got really angry at that point, and began to rant and rave at them.  Then I started to go over an outlining assignment that I had given them the previous class and found that they either hadn't done it or had done it incorrectly.  But when I started to explain it to them, I realized that I wasn't well enough prepared to explain it to them.  So I was really embarrassed, especially since I had lectured them so angrily earlier.  I felt that the class was really unraveling.  Worse, I then realized that I was absolutely naked.  I left them and went to the departmental offices nearby to see if I could find something to put on. The class was meeting outside the building, so anyone passing by could see me, as could anyone in the building from the windows.)  All I could find was some aprons, which would have covered my private parts (from the front anyway), but they were brightly colored and feminine, and I feared they would just call more attention to me and be a source of derision besides.  Mary Kodd was in the dream, directing someone in straightening up or remodeling her office.  I could see her through a strange gap where two walls did not quite meet, but there was not enough space to squeeze through.
