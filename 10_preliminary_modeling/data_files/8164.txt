I was at USC. I was sitting in a room working at a computer. It was at a table with a high stool type chair. There wasn't much room. There were rows of table without much room between them. I was sitting there working at the computer and I noticed out of the corner of my eye that Ben D was trying to sneak up behind me. I turned around and saw him. He came around the other side of the table and said, Hi Sweetie. We hugged. We chatted very briefly then he turned and walked away to put something in his office. His office was not very far away. He was wearing navy blue sweat pants and a striped shirt and tennis shoes. As he came back out, I was stretching and rubbing my eyes because I had been looking at the computer screen so long. He said something about that. I said I just forgot to bring my eye drops with me. I said I should probably go try to get some. He told me where the nearest drug store or something was. He said, Of course, they're going to be getting ready for the St. Patrick's Day parade now. Then he was saying something about the fact that they don't get as many people coming in there as they used to because they're located in a small strip center. The big strip centers are in other locations and not as many people come in there as used to.
