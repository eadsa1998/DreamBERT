I am in a room. Bonnie comes in to introduce her new fiance. He is short, balding, has a moustache and is white. He has several sons. One is a midget and retarded, full-grown man. I call him "son" like he's a child. Bonnie takes care of him like Cher in "Moonstruck." I am surprised she chose him. I feel sad, realizing I'm the only one left unmarried. I ask if he smokes. She says no. I then say, "OK, I won't smoke in your house. I will respect that."
