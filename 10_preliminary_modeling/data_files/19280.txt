It was in the street in the middle of the day, but it was dark. And me and all the people in my grade that I hang out with - boys and girls - were fighting like boxing in the streets. Then we would go back to school. Then the next minute everyone was at my house eating chicken and it kept switching off like that. All the people in it were my friends, 16, 17. The people weren't really talking. The only thing I can recall being said was, "Let's go eat chicken."
