There was a hot pink blanket 50 x 51 inches. The tag gave the dimensions. I was suppose to fold up the blanket but I couldn't fold it good so I wadded it up and walked with it on my head. On 8th Avenue I met a guy who was complaining viciously about art school models. We had to sit completely still. Complete. The pyramid. Dominoes were big. Evelyn was teaching a class called "late prevention." I wanted to learn how to get (to) places on time. The papers. I was in charge of picking out Christmas presents. I had folders and I was looking for Christmas paper. I was at work waiting for the time clock to hit 15 so I could go. I could go. I went to the bathroom to kill time. The "G" ???.
