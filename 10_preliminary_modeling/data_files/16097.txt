Okay, I had a dream that I was at this place, I was with this group. I must have still been in Spain because we were speaking Spanish sometimes. I'm kind of stuck on that. [laugh] And we were going to see somebody ice skating or rollerblading or doing some kind of tricks like that. And we were on rollerblades ourselves, and we were hurrying up to this place. And then we jumped on these escalators that go twice as fast as regular ones do. And so then they started, we like jumped on these escalators and they go really fast up, and then we arrived at the top and there was this ramp. And I couldn't stop my, I sat down on the edge of the ramp and I couldn't stop my feet from rolling down into the ramp. They were like hanging off into the middle of the floor there. And then I think I had another dream. I think we were there too early so we couldn't see the show then. Then I had another dream that I was at dinner and we were eating, eating, eating these things. I had just finished a course, and already this Spanish guy was serving me these things. He had a tray with like six compartments and he had to take these two spoonfuls ... [tape not working]. This is a horrible tape!
