I am in my childhood home and look out the window. A young Dutch woman friend of mine is upstairs. She tells me to come up because I'll have a better view from up there. So I come up to another room on the same (top) floor. She says, "Come, come here, you'll see better." So I go into the room. It's the great love of my youth. She is just as beautiful as in the past. Her legs are covered with a blanket and I kiss her feet through the blanket.
