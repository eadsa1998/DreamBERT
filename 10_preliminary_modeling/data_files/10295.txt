I watch a couple from the Meditation Center dance very formally; she fusses at his costume which she had sewn; He wears a dark grey suit, and she has on a dress with ruffles at the neck. -- shift: WALLY comes home; he is very happy, he found a job and he shows me his acceptance on a piece of paper that has "Sholes point" written on it; I show it to Frank and he merely nods; later I see Wally helping people as if he were a waiter...(NOTE: Sholes is the last name of my best friend Hillary)
