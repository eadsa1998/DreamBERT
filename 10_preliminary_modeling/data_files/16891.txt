I'm wandering around a fantastic suburb of beautiful landscaped gardens. It looks hyper-real like a David Lynch film. This place is full of tension, emotion and romance. There are hedged mazes, follies, ponds, lakes, complicated walled gardens, hanging gardens, raised walkways. It is truly beautiful. Strangely it seems to be located in a suburb in my hometown that in real life is dull and boring.
