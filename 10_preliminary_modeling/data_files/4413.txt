["Sweet boyfriend wants me."] I am working on a project. This involves putting things in order on a poster board. A young man, sort of Darryl and Michael J. Fox is watching. I am in a school, I guess. He comes over to look at my work. I explain the rows of things. One row has valuable collectible coins. I show him the Dover side and the E City side. He is now impressed with me. He starts to walk away. Then he changes his mind and walks back to me. He comes very close and says "I want a girlfriend." I am thrilled. I smile and he leans even closer and begins to talk sweet things to me. He asks do I want to be his girlfriend? I say Oh yes. I really do. We kiss. And neck. We walk hand in hand to the swim pool in the gym. We begin to swim laps. He is an excellent swimmer and I struggle to keep up. Soon I am neck and neck with him and occasionally even beat him. It is a competition done lovingly. We enjoy the power of our excellent swimming have fun trying to be better than the other and love each other through it all. The coach sees us and is very impressed. We will be great for the swim team.
