I had a sleepless night, but I really slept really well. I dreamt that I was listening to the clock radio some more and Mom was talking to me, and we checked it before I went to sleep. But I could not get it to shut off, and I was trying all kinds of different things like make sure the s______ function's off, make sure the alarm's off, make sure the switch is off. I could not get it to turn off. I had to like take it apart just to make it shut off so I could go to sleep, and then I was really frustrated. And then I remember I came down to the couch with Mom, where we had the system on, and Dad was there and he started talking to us and we were having like a family conference at 11:30 at night. And then she was going to the swing, and I was getting back to bed. And then I remember being at this reception hall -- I've been having dreams about that lately. But, you know what it was? We were at Modern Media College taking a tour and we had this -- it was Melinda, me, Mom and Angel, I think -- we had this really funny elevator we had to keep going up and down. And we were in the lobby that looked like the reception hall where we had the wedding, and then we came down this funny elevator and we landed in the parking garage, supposedly go into another building. And we saw Mrs. Hollander across the parking lot, which is the lady who gave me the four-year degree lecture several times. And we just waved and smiled, and she said, "Are you here seeing the school?" and I woke up before I could answer.
