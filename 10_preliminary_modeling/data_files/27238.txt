I was staying at a large home--the home Or my aunt and uncle, and there were lots of people around--lots of girls staying with me for some reason. They kept coming in and finally the clothes rack was so crowded not another thing could be squeezed in. A boy in whom I am not at all interested came into my room while I was studying. Then I saw us in bed, I only partially clothed. I kept assuming provocative positions and teasing him. Finally he grabbed and kissed me, and I very coldly told him to leave the house. He then went to the bathroom and I wondered whether he would use my pretty yellow towel. I can remember other bits of the dream--red carnations and a bottle of perfume that was found in the back of an old drawer. The bottle was gold and shaped oddly like a flask or a snake. I opened it and everyone said the perfume was lovely but I couldn't smell it and I, very panicky, kept asking, "Why can't I smell it? Why can't I smell it?" I rubbed it all over my hands in order to be able to.
