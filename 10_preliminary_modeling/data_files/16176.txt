I was driving the bus, and I was at the control panel and there was like no steering wheel. There was this shifter stick thing. And there were like four or five different keys, and I'm talking quietly because I have a sore throat and I don't want to strain it at all. There were four or five different keys, like and they made different sounds, and one made the back-up alarm sound. And I kept forgetting which ones they were and what sounds they made. And I dreamt that I swore I wasn't going to ride the bus next year because the bus was going to get the scary back-up alarm sound, and whenever the bus would back up I was going to hear that sound. So I swore I'd never ride the bus. Then I remembered if I listened to the personal CD player on the bus that the sound would drown out the back-up alarm anyway. Gosh, wouldn't that be scary! And then I woke up.
