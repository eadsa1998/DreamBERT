I was staying at somebody's house out at the beach, and we were watching The Little Mermaid movie, and it felt like I was right there. And it was a little different than the usual story really is because, first of all, there were only a few events in it. Eric and her had a few more dates before they got married, and King Triton was never in the scene. And she stayed a mermaid while she was up on land with him. It was just so weird, so strange, so different. And after the movie was over, I woke up.
