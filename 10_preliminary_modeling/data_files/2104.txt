I am ooking for the bathroom and I'm in an elevator that is very crowded with lots of people. I am Lucile Ball, and I play with her comedy face. Is this the ladies room? I see the men and say to myself, "Just the lobby, I guess." I find an escalator going down only to see a sign for a second flight of stairs. I groan and then throw myself toward the stairs going, "Oh, Oh" as someone grabs my shirt from behind to steady me. I make it down without falling and go into the ladies' room where there is a series of platforms that act like conveyer belts for joggers, only bumpy, so it's like a comedy routine. I get tired of that and go back out and see old wheelchair toilets in a storage room and go in to use them, knowing I shouldn't. After I pee, a red light goes on calling the nurse.
