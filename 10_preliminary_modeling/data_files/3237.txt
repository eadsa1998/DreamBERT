I am getting ready to go on a business trip to another community college. I remember I should go sign out so the woman in charge will know where I am. I go to the sign up sheet. I sign my name B and write the name of my town. Then I remember it is a different town. I have some difficulty writing things down correctly. Charlene (the personal attendant) says I should have written my name up in this special place, not in the list with everyone else. I shrug and leave it as it is. Then I see Bill Cosby playing good music on a saxophone. Then I and several others are going to get some food for dinner and breakfast. The young man with us, early 20's, gets a forklift-like thing and goes to a great deal of ornate movement to get the loaf of bread off the high shelf. The black janitor that I had asked to get the food watches, shaking his head. I hear music, loud and flamboyant orchestra music, very dramatic, then applause, like a recording of a concert and the audience applauding a great finale. I laugh at the pretentiousness of it all. He could have simply reached up and got the bread. I return to where Bill Cosby is and he is playing a very good sax. I admire him and am wishful I could play for him and maybe he'd see I have talent. I go on, but instead of just walking down the sidewalk, I tap dance. A woman, perhaps Charlene, watches me, admiring my steps. I get to the corner, where my boyfriend waits for me. He and the young man are playing a dice game and I tap dance around the dice. My boyfriend disapproves and asks me to not do that (dance). I am angry, but don't say anything. The young man tells me if I keep it in, I could get ill. I say. I could have just stomped on his dice, but I didn't. I think I tell the boyfriend off and to not tell me what to do. If I want to dance, I will.
