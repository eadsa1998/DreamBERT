I, but it wasn't me, was young (like 5 or so) and knew I was going to die. Dad and I went to a restaurant and had tuna. Then I was poisoned. I tried to tell Mom and she was like 'meh' and rolled over to go back to sleep. Someone told someone else to stand on a log in water and said it would roll around on the spot. I said it wouldn't and that it would go down the waterfall. They eventually believed me. I found blood on my sheets, but the blood was from the future. We thought it was from a cut I had gotten from a bush. A friend tried to make me go into this dark place with a sword, but then I saw my real friend. They looked the same. I pretended that I hadn't seen anything, but then I turned the sword on the fake one.
