At a new Church: very large and strange - I sit outside with strangers; I see Father Andrew - half stripped to the waist (looked like CHRIST figure with lance wound), see him from the back; try to go past him and up to the choir loft, but the stairway is walled up; "Go up to the Choir the other way"; Chris (choir director) is very friendly, he won't mind if you're late." says Father Andrew. - friendly; leaves.
