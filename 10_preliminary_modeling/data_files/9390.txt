In a field at a family picnic; a 3-year old boy asks if Jesus Christ was a great psychologist? Indeed, he was one of the greatest!! I explain it in child's terms and get flowing thanks from him. Shift: We are back in Vienna. We are lying on cots on high balconies looking out over the city. See the church spires, the dome shaped "Karlskirche' and the "Votiv Kirche." I suddenly realize that there are no floors to the balconies. I look down and am scared of falling down. (uneasy feeling throughout). Shift: Stairways to heaven; I am going to heaven with various people. But I must abide by very complicated rules and have to stay in heaven after the third trip.
