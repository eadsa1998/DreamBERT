Wes S and I are both building new houses on the same street within a few blocks of each other. All of the other houses along these same few blocks are complete and the homeowners have become friends. Wes S and I have both met everyone, so we have not integrated into the group yet. The group participates in a number of activities together. Some of it is community service. Wes S and I are the only single people and neither of us have small children as the other families do. Some of the individuals are having relationships outside of their marriage with someone else in the same group. Wes S is moving in after I have. When I heard someone was moving into that house, I didn't initially know who it was. I see Wes S socializing with one of the other female homeowners and wonder if he is in a relationship with her, though later learn that he isn't. When he and I finally do meet again and talk, I find out that he is not in a relationship with anyone. It is late evening, dark outside, and we are standing outside his home, on a deck. He is leaning with his back against the railing and I am standing facing him, resting against his chest. He has his arms around my waist. Even though we are both single, he feels there is a reason why we cannot pursue a relationship. He is also planning to move again very soon. He tells me that he still loves me, that he will always love me. It seems this is painful for both of us, to have feelings for each other and not be able to be in a real relationship.
