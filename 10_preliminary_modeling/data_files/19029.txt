The setting was indistinguishable and there seemed to be an almost football-looking object. It just seemed to take up the whole dream in the sense that there was nothing else to be seen but this object, and it was bouncing up and down, sort of moving all over in the scope of vision, within the field of my vision of the dream, something like follow the bouncing ball on Wrigley's commercial, something like this, and this seemed to be predominant through most of the dream. And then the next thing I knew, I was sitting in what I believe was the library and I was waiting for someone to apparently arrive for some reason or another. It wasn't real clear. The person apparently never did come. Then this little ball seemed to come back again. The dream didn't seem to have much meaning, and it wasn't very clear. The only thing that seemed real clear was this, as I said, this football-shaped object moving around without any real pattern or any reason for its movements. The dream seemed like it took a long time, and I didn't recognize anyone in the dream. The only person in there was this person I was waiting for, plus I saw myself sitting in what I believe was the library.
