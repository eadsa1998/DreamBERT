["Three questions of the dreamer?"] I am in a gym like room. Bill is conducting his dream class. The grad students are lined up, seated around the walls of the square room. They are some distance from me and Bill is in the center of this expansive floor. A woman student asks me "What are your thoughts on Marriage?" I chuckle and say this is a hard question for me. I have conflicted feelings on this subject. I was married for 10 years. It was not a good experience. I worked for years on understanding and learning how to work through those issues. If a man comes along who can be my good friend as well as a lover, then I would consider marrying him. I had turned my head toward Bill so he could for sure hear what I am saying. Then another woman student (not one of the DreamWorkers) asks me a long question. I say I didn't understand all you said, but I did hear it's something about transportation and relationship. She then stands up and walks right up to me, I am sitting. She towers over me as she repeats the question. I stand up and say please don't do that. I then stand over her as she sits back in her spot. I end up standing straddle over her bowed head. I worry she will turn her head and be looking up my long skirt. I feel embarrassed. I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea. I step back and say that's what it feels like. It's very demeaning. I try to answer her question saying something about relationship. I hesitate over choosing the word person rather than man when answering the question. Then Bill tells the class it is time for the quiz. I sit over next to the nice woman grad student. He asks the question. I don't clearly hear it I only hear something about what will you do if you meet someone at a train and your job is to entertain them and they are boring. The class writes their answers. I watch.
