I'm out in a boat with a friend. I don't know who he is. The propeller on the engine comes off, and we are stuck. But here comes a great big whale. My friend jumps out of the boat on top of the whale and ties a rope around him. This way we get him to pull us back to port. When we get into port, we don't know what to do with the whale. So we operate and remove his pituitary gland. Naturally he doesn't grow any larger, but smaller. Finally he is as small as a goldfish and that was the last we saw of him.
