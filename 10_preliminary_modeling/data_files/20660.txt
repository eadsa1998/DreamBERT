I was able to purchase some food with some tickets until a certain time. I bought some canned food. Then I went back later to buy more, but it was too late. I would have to come the next day. I put the canned food I'd bought into a bin. Someone was advertising a new kind of tissue. I took some and helped advertise it. Later at the bin I saw that in other bins there were appliances like vacuum cleaners. I was surprised that they could be bought with the tickets. I had a moving sign with a girl in a nursery rhyme. Santa Claus danced gaily on the front lawn. He told a helper to polish his boots. Later I noticed that some fruit was missing from the bin.
