I went to England. I had to marry an English person for some reason. I saw Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson at an Internet Cafe. I asked them if they knew anyone to marry, but they were mean and said no. Later, they apologized and said Christopher Ryan would. So I met him and he was really weird. He made this million page survey thing, which I thought was cool. Then people were in a car and evil animals were on the loose. There was something about death, pain and suffering. I saved the day.
