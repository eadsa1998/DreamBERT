I went to a school because I wanted to be a teacher and I thought I would have to speak to a teacher I had when I was in 3rd grade, to get a position. I found her in a library. It was a very elaborate, comfortable library and the class of little children were climbing all over the furniture. When I came in the children climbed all over me, and the teacher was trying to talk to me but the children kept interrupting.
