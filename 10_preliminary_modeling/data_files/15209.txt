I was on the beach. Quentin Tarantino had a stand with a back room for watching movies. Dad knew him. Mom and I went down there and she recognized him and was like 'what's his name?' and I said "Quentin Tarantino!" and she asked "Are you a fan of [babble]?" and Dad was then there and said I was a fan and Quentin said I could come by one day and watch some movies.
