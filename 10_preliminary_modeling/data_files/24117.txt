It was my first day of class. It was a small class in a wooden open building/room. The professor was a white and middle aged male. It opened out into a beautiful area. The professor was friendly and mingling. We were all mingling. Something was wrong, I can't remember exactly, but I think I felt too heavy to go to the corner of the room and pick something up? We were outside for a while. There was a man who was my age and who I remember from somewhere. I thought it was highschool, but wasn't sure. I laid down next to him, naked. After a while he started touching me. I told him I had a boyfriend and asked him to stop. He did. I feel like there were many more things happening, but this is all I can remember.
