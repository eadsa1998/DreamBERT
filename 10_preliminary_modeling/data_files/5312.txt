I dreamed that my father and I had to get secretly married. We were in some foreign country where that was the law. After we were married, we had to race back home. I couldn't fit everything into my suitcase, so I had to pack extra bags of all my stuff. When we got home, the whole cast of Friends was at my house. I told my father that the next time I got married, I wanted to have a white dress and that I wanted to marry someone that I loved in that way, not because it was the law. Then I woke up. Weird.
