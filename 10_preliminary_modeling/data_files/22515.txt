I dreamed I was with a group of friends who were going on a picnic. At the last moment I decided to join them, but I got on the bus when it was already moving. Everybody helped me to get on, and they laughed because I had tricked the driver and hadn't paid the fare. Then I was in some sort of field with trees and bandstands. I got up on the bandstand and then had trouble getting down, but they also helped me. I had fun and felt very happy at the picnic.
