Ralph Macchio (the actor from Karate Kid) was in the dream. He was desperately in love with a woman who had left him and gone to Mexico. I told him he must go to her. He had a daughter about 5 yrs old maybe. When he got to Mexico, he found the woman and her son with another man. The woman did not seem terribly happy to see him. Then he was in a drunken state lying in a flooded gutter with mucus and all kinds of slime all over his back. A little angel baby was trying to get him to get up. The angel baby said, "Come on, pick yourself up. You don't want to drown in this sea of boogies." Ralph Macchio asked the angel what his name was. The angel said his name was "Cross." I flashed on an image of Cross. It was like a picture of him with his name printed under it - the name kept changing from "Criss" to "Cross." Ralph Macchio said, "What kind of name is Cross?" and the angel said, "You can call me Criss if you prefer." Then the woman approached breathlessly. She had been looking for him. She was sad to see him lying in the gutter.
