I was at a shop. Ezra and Mom were there too. Mom came to get chips. Dad had gotten a divorce from Nana and Poppa and I was wondering why he would do that. Darius was trying to sell stuff. Ezra had some scales. I spilt money all over Darius's back and then I was picking it up. Midge Ure was playing a piano. When I got near it, he finished and Ezra was talking to me and said "you have dreams?" and I said "yeah" and he said something and I was annoyed and he said "and dreams about that gran vienetta son" and I laughed and the guy who sings it was right there and he pushed me so my butt would be in Midge's face. This red haired guy called Rex was around and he reminded me of Brucie from GTA 4.
