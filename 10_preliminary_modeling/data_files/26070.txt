 I'm on Fishing Haven property, on the 15-Mile property on the hill side of the driveway. I'm back in the woods 50 feet from the driveway digging a hole with a shovel. I move leaves, dirt, and lots of worms. I have branch clippers too. A person is coming up the driveway. I see only their legs under the tree branches at first, and then he or she comes into view. It's a young man with a short red beard. At first I think it's my old roommate Sean Williams. I say hi, friendly, and then see it's my former boss Mike Hollow. He tells me to move my things and pick up the clippers and leave. I show him that the cardboard box I was digging from isn't on some plants, which is why he told me to move it. I ask him why he doesn't respect people. He replies with a question about my respect for him. I know I did maintain respect for him until he became unworthy of it. I walk down the path to the driveway. Mike follows slowly. I tell him that in his dream the skeleton is a part of him, and if he doesn't know that by now he must be pretty ignorant. He doesn't respond, but acts stern and silent, like he knows best. I can't find the clippers, and ask Mike in a friendly manner, which is quite an abrupt shift from my stern words a moment earlier, if they are back near the trail. He doesn't answer. I think I must have walked by them.
