In this dream I found myself on a type of spaceship. The inside looked like the starship Enterprise. This is strange because I really don't like Star Trek. For some reason a door is sliding open and closed, and I am shooting a laser at the opposite wall trying to hit two blinking discs. The laser I'm using isn't working so I switch to something stronger. The first beam was a red beam and this one is now a yellow one. I finally hit one and go out into the hall, walk a little way and enter a room with a sliding door. There is a girl dressed as I am, in some kind of uniform. The girl is someone I know from high school. I can't really remember what made me shoot but I did. The laser hit her in the foot taking a big chunk out. I remember seeing the chunk missing in graphic detail. I remember feeling ashamed I shot her and sad also. That was the end of the dream.
