I am watching a TV show. A woman is interviewing Dana Carvey who is totally goofy and lies and makes a fool of her constantly. I notice he has taken my wallet and I am furious. I demand it back. He laughs at me and continues teasing me. I begin to dump out his pockets and so on, making a terrible mess. I am furious and self-righteous. He begins to like me and continues teasing me. I bolt from the place, now naked and stoned or drunk. I cross the freeway, not even looking to see if I'll get hit by the cars. I go down a bike path near the river. Dana jumps in the river and swims to try and follow me. I go into some restaurant and see a woman who is the manager. I remember I tried to be a manager once and didn't do a good job of it. This woman with exposed breasts is doing a fine job. Dana is there, loving me. I ignore him.
