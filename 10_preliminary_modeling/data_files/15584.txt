I was in a building, possibly an office. There were 'zombies' but what was actually happening was people would get sick and either die or turn into controlled 'robots'. You were likely to catch it if you went near them. A bunch of us were hiding out in a back room and went out the front to have a look. Some people got sick and us others went into a small booth and they fell down. Aliens were doing it? Their 'car' came and they could kill anyone by pressing a button (we all had a number and if they chose yours you would die). They hit a few and some people dropped.
