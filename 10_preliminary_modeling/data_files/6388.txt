I drove my car to school, and parked it behind the music building, right up next to the fence. I had something in my hand which my inner voice kept referring to as a Blitz, and I didn't want it. It looked a lot like a candybar. I rolled down my window and threw the Blitz out. The Blitz struck the fence with a hollow rattling sound and dropped from sight.
