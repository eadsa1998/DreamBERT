First of all, we were on the nature trail and we were walking along looking at different things -- Mom and me and my sisters, Samantha and Sandra, and Derek. And we were showing pictures in the picture album; we took a few more pictures. And then we came home, we stopped on the way home at like a big service merchandise store thing. And we looked around and we bought something that was like a DVD player, and some other boxes looked at it and then we decided we were going to buy it. So anyway, we bought it, and we got home and immediately when we brought it home, it was a VCR, and I took it out of the box and hooked it up to the amplifier as if I'd done it a hundred times, like I do with the the board. Then I took the closest video tape that I could find and put it in there to check it out, but I didn't even turn on the TV because all I was interested in was the audio. That was weird! And then Dad was coming in and I turned everything off so that he could turn it on and pretend that he was the first one to turn it on. And then I was with Brad and Randy and Mark from Home Improvement, trying to make them work something out, and showing them our family pictures. And then I woke up.
