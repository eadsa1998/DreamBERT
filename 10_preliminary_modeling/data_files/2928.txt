I am seated on a high contraption seat that is on a cart (tea cart like table on wheels). Jake starts taking it apart so it doesn't sit so high. I decide to go to the bathroom and a man follows me to the door. I shut the gauze curtain door and think about locking the door but don't because I might insult or offend the man. I then sit on the toilet which looks a lot like Rena's wheelchair. I am slumped like she is. Then the man returns and wants in, peeking through the curtain. I am angry at him and tell him to go away. I'm glad I'm clothed so he can't see anything. My mother comes in and I comment on her sunburned face. It is bright red but only in parts. A swirl around her cheeks is still white. Lydia is there and I ask her how old she is now. She says, "13." I think, "Oh oh, I'm glad she's going back home with Mom." The teen years are hard. I remember I didn't know her during her teen years because I married and moved away. Then, Jake and Dwight are setting up a garage sale and I go out to see what we're selling: lots of lawn mowers, and lots of beautiful glass vases. The vases are my mother's and they are beautiful. I think of buying them but they are too expensive: $280, $40, etc. They are too much to ask for at a garage sale.
