I was in a foreign country, in a hotel. As I was leaving the room, a pretty elevator operator who closely resembled somebody I know (I still can't make the connection) warned me that I was in danger. I can remember running through the lobby and out into. the street. Twomen started to chase me, shooting as they ran. Then as I continued running, the street scene melted away and one huge man was chasing me around a race track. As he gained, I found that although I was running was not moving. Just as he was about to overtake me, I woke up in a sweat.
