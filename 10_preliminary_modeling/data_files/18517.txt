Me and Francie were playing. We hadn't seen each other in 13 or 14 years. Francie was wearing bright pink. She had bright pink pants on and wanted me to find some too. Not exactly the same. Jesus said, "This is our clubhouse." We were going on a bicycle trip, me and Francie, and I was riding alone first to meet them and the tube. ???. My tube and tire blew out. Since ??? busted ???. The airport seemed to do better. I told Francie, "I'm gonna have to push my bike 'cause the...out the blowout." Francie picked out a great ochre, tan, and brown turtleneck halter top and then she left. She had reasons. I had a hole in my pants and I wanted to buy new ones. ??? paid for the peddle pushers in the ???. We were playing World War III and we each had a real Lazer gun that looked like a toy but was real. I was laying in the floorboard of the backseat of a car in the parking lot waiting for the right opportunity to shoot my gun. I had 10 bullets. Then I remembered I had to get my bicycle tire fixed. I was upset since I was not sure if it was a real war or a game. I was picking out pants that weren't quite comfortable. I could not understand right now. The free samples were stacked high in a tray ???. On Elizabeth St. the closing door came down on my head. I had to roll under like army men.
