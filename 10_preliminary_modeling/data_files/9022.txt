I am with my family in an airplane. I don't know where we are doing. Dick W is the pilot. It's a small plane, maybe seats 20 or 30 people. There is nothing that separates the pilot from the passengers. Dick is standing behind a co-pilot. He's talking to air traffic control. He's telling them that he has two different problems with this plane so when he lands he wants to change planes. I was thinking that it was nice to finally know what he does for a living.
