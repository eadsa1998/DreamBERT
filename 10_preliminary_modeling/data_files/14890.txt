I was watching True Blood. Sookie died and turned into a vampire. Someone complained about it. Then it was real life. Three others and I were vampires. We could go in daylight at the moment. Someone was walking 'cool'. I watched a movie with Dad and Ezra. Nicholas Cage was in it. He had died and Dad was upset? Dad asked "who's Angelina Jolie's husband?" and I said "Brad Pitt".
