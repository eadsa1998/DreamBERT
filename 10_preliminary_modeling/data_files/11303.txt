A friend and I are playing in the street near one of those deep street excavations that Cleveland Illuminating Co. makes to install cable. It is covered by a complex of tangle and wooden structure and is of infinite depth. I am not too anxious to climb on this wooden frame but feel as though I must or lose the admiration of my friend. (I have no idea who he is.) As I climb around I realize that one false move and I'm cooked. Sure enough, I slip and almost fall into the dark depths but something, somewhere, somehow, saves me. I remember feeling a sensation in my genitals as I am about to fall (falling actually does produce a sensation as does most motion through space). It is accompanied by a vacuum feeling in the throat.
