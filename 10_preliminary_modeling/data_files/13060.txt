I was at a shop, but the 'shelves' were all metal and there wasn't much merchandise. There was a Dalek and a bunch of soldiers there. There were also civilians. The Dalek and I were killing the soldiers. Then we stopped because we couldn't win (which I questioned). Then I told the Dalek we should work together and they all died. We had to kill the people and animals too, but I couldn't kill the animals so I told the people to follow me. We ended up at this place and Jennifer Saunders was holding the door open. Dawn French was also with her. They had this auditorium thing, so we all went in. Mom and Ezra were sitting there in different seats, so I called them over.
