I am kissing Mary passionately. I "see" two heads locked together in a deep, wonderful kiss. I see Mary clearly. Or, if I didn't actually see her face, I know it is her. I do not see the man's face clearly, but I know it is me. My "dream" is an instant flash in which I see the two of us kissing. It was nice.
