My mom called me at home (she was at work) and asked if I want to go visit her at work and we'd have a day together, so I went to where she works and her ex-boyfriend was standing there and she told me she forgot to mention he'd be coming with us. So we went on a picnic in some park and they skipped off into this forest and I went after and every time I found them they'd skip away again, so I was lost in the middle of this forest when I woke up.
