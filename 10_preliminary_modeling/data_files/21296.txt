There was a tornado coming. We hid the best we could and it went over. I went out and met Bob. I told him not to be afraid of tornados and not to listen when people try to scare you with them. We were in an old barn or lumber building. A tornado was coming up again. The building was beginning to shake. I ran over to Bob and got him by the hand. I kept on looking up at the tornado watching its course and we ran out of its path as it came along. Then it came down low and its point and all its body ran parallel to the sidewalk. It went between trees and we followed it across the street. I watched it as it whirled. It was about a 100 ft. long and about 10 ft. in diameter. It was not doing any damage because it knocked no trees down. The tail end of it there was a sort of bluish light and seemed like a fan turning to keep it moving and twirling of the cloud. We then left it and went thru a barbed wire fence and I found a $10 bill, walked a little further and found a $20 bill. I put them into my pocket and told Bob to say nothing to no one that I found the money and he promised. We were walking towards the lake and I thought of writing a book of my dreams. I heard or saw zigzag as a winner.
