We were in my birth home or my parents new home. I don't know which. Daddy had died. The rest of us were together. Doves kept coming up to the window. We were very touched by that. But then it made me cry, too, because I missed Daddy. Mother came up and comforted me. Then Bev and her family were going to be leaving soon and she asked me if I wanted to take a nap with Rachel S. So I went in to take a nap with Rachel S. Then when they were getting ready to leave I asked John S about my computer. He said it wasn't done yet. I asked him when it would be and he said not for a week or so. I thought Oh no because all of the information I need for job hunting and for school and everything was on there. So then, they kind of hurried and started packing up. He was going to try to start working on it. I said, no, I will find someone in the city where I live to finish it. I don't remember what else happened with that. We were changing Rachel S's diaper and she had a big growth near her genitals and I was afraid to ask Bev about it. I was surprised she didn't say anything. Finally she did. She was frustrated because the doctor's weren't acting concerned or anything.
