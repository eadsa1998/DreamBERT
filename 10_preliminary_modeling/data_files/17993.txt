I was in the rumpus room.  There was a commercial for the observatory.  The filming circled around and showed the old dorm.  Then I was there on the mountain.  There was flooding, and the houses surrounding the mountain near the old dorm had been raised so as to avoid the flooding.  Some were still waiting to be raised, and one was in the process.  I helped take apart a shower on the first floor of the house in progress.  We had to unscrew something I think in the showerhead, but I didn't have my screwdriver with me.  Then I was down a street, talking to my boyfriend Jeremy's coworker Douglas, I think about sparring.  I saw some people throw some kicks, and worked on stretching some.  My muscles were tight.  Somehow the conversation drifted to that of a LAN party instead, but I complained about the difficulty in determining which computers were the best or fastest.  At some point I lost the tweezers and toothpick out of the new pocketknife Jeremy gave me.
