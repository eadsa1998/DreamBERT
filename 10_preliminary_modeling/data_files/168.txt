I'm at a fair-sort-of, very festive, clean place, lots of trees and light, but at a building like a church, school, something with grounds and passages. More an Artfest crowd, Sunday-dressed, well-behaved. There's a blonde guy and his wife interested in my necklace, slightly aggressive but not wanting to be overt about it - the wife walks off a bit to look at something else, I think so the guy can try to sweet-talk me out of it by himself. He is pretty good-looking in a yuppie sort of way, they're a nice pair. [quote note:] I take it out of its bag and it came apart - it's made ["long?"] like Tom's but bigger. [I don't know what that means now except that the pendant was made to come apart.]
