I was with a girl who may have been my wife. We were wandering around in a triangular plot of land bordered by railroad tracks at two sides. I was looking over the land to determine its possibilities for shooting (possibly hunting). I was very doubtful about my reasons for doing this or why I had chosen this plot to look over. Then I started to discuss my plans with the owner of the land who was a railroad official. I remember the plot of land as being located near the East Cleveland Station where I had sometimes played when I was a boy.
