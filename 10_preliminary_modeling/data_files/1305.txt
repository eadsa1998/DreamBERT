It is a performance and it is my turn to dance. My partner and I start dancing but he leads us in an improvisational dance instead of the one we had rehearsed. We do well. The large audience applauds loudly, warmly and long. I look for and signal for the rest of the troupe to join us in the finale curtain call. They are slow in doing so. I think, "I really like this," and bow to the audience.
