We were out the front of home. We had a pool shaped hole out the front and we decided to fix it up. There was me, Dad, Ezra, Aunt Sally, Uncle Vic, Uncle Wilbur (who had lost weight) and Poppa. There was music playing and Poppa and I were trying to guess what it was and what year it was. I Will Follow Him came on and The Great Pretender which we said was from 1955. We were thinking that it was year Nana was born. I was taking photos and I was going to put this thing on my side (the hole had a wall separating two sides). I said to Aunt Sally "they don't know". Tony and Michelle (both 24) were there.
