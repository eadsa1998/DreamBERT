Mom and I went for a drive and went to the roundabout on Camberwell, but it was like all white in front (like there was nothing there), the houses nearby were sort of misty and see-through and we decided to go another way. We thought maybe it was like the end and the whiteness was taking everything and we were concerned about going back home, but when we went back the white was receding and it was just a light mist left.
