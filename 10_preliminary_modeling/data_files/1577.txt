Karl Stone has invited me to a 3 day contest. I am to listen to bands and judge them. On one of those nights, the Birds will perform, but he won't tell me which night. He drives me home in his pickup. I am exhausted because we've been up all night and now I have to go to school. I am at Grandma Mildred's and excuse myself to find a bathroom and go to their bedroom. As I start to open the door, I realize oh! Grandpa Lloyd might be there and then remember that he is dead. A girl friend drives me to school. I fall asleep in the truck and she leaves me there. I sleep all day.
