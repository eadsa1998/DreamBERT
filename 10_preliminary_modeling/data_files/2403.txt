I am in bed and notice my wheelchair is far away in the next room. I'm surprised. Judy P comes over to talk, and I ask her to bring me the chair. She does, but I don't use it since I seem to be able to walk well enough at the moment. I'm embarrassed that I asked her to go to that trouble. She tells me a woman in the computer group sent her a complaint and shows it to me. Judy is wondering what she may have done wrong and lists a few things it might be. I look at the letter. It is a beautifully embroidered piece, nicely framed. Roses are embroidered around and with the complaining words. I admire her stitches and think about needlework and how the thread (yarn) crosses the corners as a diagonal. Each corner must be covered.
