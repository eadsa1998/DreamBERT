My mother was very sick so I took her to the beauty salon where she started taking some electric treatment. The lady in charge told me that my mother would have to take that treatment one hour every day for one year, or else she would never get well. The lady said that I would have to be with my mother during that hour, and, consequently, could not go to school the rest of that year. I felt pretty bad about that, but was willing to do anything for my mother.
