Dad, Ezra and I were in some water. I tried to keep my phone above the water. We got a call that Granny was ok, so we gathered. We were still living at the old house. I was outside for a while and then I remembered I'd left some private stuff on the desk and I ran back inside. Ezra followed me and I tried to get rid of him, but he came in anyway. Austin was in my chair and he sounded like he was drunk. Everything in my room was a little messed up. He ended up showing it to Ezra and I had a whole box full of stuff. I tried to get Mom to make Austin leave. There was a fair thing. This kid and I went on a slide and we had to hold tight and it was fast. The police were chucking stuff into the middle of it. We got out of there. Then me, this young girl, Nate (Gossip Girl) and I lady all got into the back of the car. A guy was in the front and we drove off and saw a guy with two dogs and they were doing tricks. One of the dogs did a handstand. I was then at a bridge. Simba and Spaceman threw a mouse into the water. Rover ate something and vomited.
