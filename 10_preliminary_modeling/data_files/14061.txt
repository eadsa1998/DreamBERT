I was in a lucid dream (in the dream) with some others. We were in the common room but it was unattached to the school and was different. I said it wasn't really a safe place because of all the glass. It was night. We tried to find weapons but none were around. A girl wished for a chainsaw and one appeared along with some baseball bats so I wished for a chainsaw too. Zombies suddenly came and were walking through the wall. Lots of them came and we were killing them. Jeremiah got bit, so I killed him but later he was ok and kept looking at me strangely. We left and I had wished for a car and me and a girl got in it, but we stopped and there were two zombies in it. I grabbed the girl's gun and tried to shoot. I hit one and missed the other. I couldn't reload. I jumped out of the car and couldn't work the gun out. Other people came and killed the zombies. Someone else wished for these jet ski things. I got on this one called a 'bananarama' and it was yellow and blue and little. Ezra was there. We were driving on a road and there was a bend, on a cliff. I fell off the side of the road, but managed to get back on before going off the cliff (it sort of flew out and got pulled back). I went around it a second time though and fell off and into the water. I wished for a path to the road, but ended up with a rope instead so I climbed up. The way I was climbing meant I was rubbing against the rope and ended up having an orgasm. There was some movie from the 1920's and Granma was in it. It was like Dead Like Me, but was Blazing Saddles and I thought it looked lame so I didn't want to see it. It was also in black and white. At some point we were at a house, which was home and we had no food. We were hiding there from the zombies. Dad had Oreos. I had a couple of biscuits and a piece of toast, which I ate.
