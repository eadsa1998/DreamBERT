I dreamt that I walked into a drug store one day and sat at the soda fountain on a revolving stool. The waitress came to take my order, but I was undecided as to what I should order. After waiting about ten minutes, the waitress became rather angry and said that people like me were always going around in circles. I didn't understand what she meant, but just then the stool I was sitting on began to spin around and wouldn't stop until all at once I fell off.
