I dreamt that I met a middle-aged man in S-- S-- who had a most precocious little boy, about three years old. The little boy, who was blonde and blue-eyed was amazingly intelligent. I don't remember our conversation at all, but I do know that this child had almost a mature adult mind. The rapid transit came and the father and the child, along with an older son, about 12 or so boarded it. I went along too. While we rode I was conscious of the steel tracks in front of us and also was aware of the tremendous danger of rolling off the tracks when the rapid made its many turns. The motorman seemed to be aware of this danger too because he went very slowly and mentioned the danger of the slippery steel tracks which gleamed in the sun. The bright little boy sat with his older brother in front of the father. I sat next to the proud parent who gave me a further account of the prodigy.
