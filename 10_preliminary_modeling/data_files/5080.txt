A young boy is curious about kissing. He wants to know what it will feel like. I/myself/his mother, decide to kiss him myself to show him. I know it's wrong, but it's better for him if I know him, than for a stranger to do it. (That's my reasoning, anyway.) Later, the color blue, a journey and snow. [BL]
