We were going to my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  There was a tiny display of miniature trees at the corner in the street.  We went to the door, Grandma Jane came and left.  We went in.  She had moved.  It was a similar setup to her old house, but larger.  She showed me the bathroom.  My mother and my brother Stuart walked in on me.  I rolled to the door and closed it.  At home my room had the old carpet in it.  I first watched Mr. Rogers, and then it seemed like Sesame Street dealing with September 11th.  I looked for my purple crystals so I could put them in the windows in my room at school.  I sat on the floor with some others.  My mother's college friend Lynn came in and offered her things from Grandma Jane's.  Magnetic balls, a cup, and a little booklet.
