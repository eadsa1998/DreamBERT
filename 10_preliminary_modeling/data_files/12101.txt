There was a little house in space and some dude turned small and green to get in, and in his house, which was mansion-like, had books with the answers to everything. I was pregnant and I looked at a book thing which said I was having twins called Peter and Peggy, but they were black and then they were Sims and their father was Joe Carr. I was at a shop, one day before the kids were due. My water broke while I was in the carpark so I went to the hospital. Mom thought I was naming the kids Jayson and Kate. I had them 'cut' out and the scar bit was an ad on TV. There were pipes and people underwater on the ad too. I wanted to name the kids, first name and middle name, Jessica Madison and Adam Michael because their father was Michael Palin.
