I was with a guy, Ezra and someone else. We were taking photos together. Then it was a movie. There was a girl and a guy, who was played by Jude Law. They were best friends. His name was Gale and they were looking for someone called Harold. I can't remember it properly, but they were at some place in the middle of nowhere (it was sort of like the movie, Unknown). I read that the ending was much better than the theatrical release [note: I downloaded the Paranormal Activity screener last night and I read that the ending was better]. They escaped from there. They were trying to get a car started. Someone shot himself and the guy realized that it was near a car and [something I can't read, looks like 'roband'], which meant that it would explode if they touched but before he could say anything the guy started it up and it exploded. The guy inside drove out onto the road and it exploded again and flipped. The other car had trouble starting and they backed it out onto the road. There were three cars in the left lane and there were two right lanes. There wasn't much traffic in the right lanes but the left lane had heaps. Then a bus pulled onto some long grass and the driver said people always needed to picked up from there. Everyone from before was dead now except for me and Gale. He got up from the grass. We got on the bus and he drove and then I noticed we were at the same place again. I realized he had purposely missed the turnoff. I saw an image of the bad guy (who was now Gale) and his evil self took over. The girl character (who I had been) didn't know. Then sometimes later she was Jessica Stevenson. They kissed. Then I was at home and Mom and Darren were there. I had just finished dinner and watching a movie.
