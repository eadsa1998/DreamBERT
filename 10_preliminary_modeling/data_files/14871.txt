I was at home but it was different. I went to go have a shower but Darren was in the bathroom. The shower was in the middle of the room next to the wall (like, sticking out from where the window is and you could walk around the other side). I left to go wait. I saw steam coming out of the fishtank and realized hot water was going in. I pointed it out to Mom and she was on her computer but was like 'meh, there's nothing we can do'. The eel was smaller and there was a crab and other fish. They started to go crazy and I was like "can't we move them or something?" and I was freaking. Then it was like a movie. This guy went somewhere to get a wish granted. He was then Jared Padalecki. He was at this place where there were train tracks for like a coal train. Then I was there with Eugene and we ran to catch this person, but we were really fast.
