I was at a house with Dad, Eugene, Darius and Jeremiah. Eugene had this video in a dodgy lounge for safe keeping. It was from some really hard achievement in a game. If he lost the tape, he would lose everything. He had a photo with Joss Whedon who had been at a book signing and I was jealous. I said I almost got one with Nathan Fillion once, as I'd met him in a doorway at a nightclub [I was thinking of a previous dream]. I leaned on the lounge and fell back, but the video was ok. He told me to be careful. I did it again, but barely touched it and it all fell apart and I fell over it and hurt myself. The video tapes shot out and Eugene came to check it and they were bent. He looked devastated. We weren't friends, but he didn't yell or anything. I sent a message apologizing to him. I cried at one point because I was sad for him and because I'd probably lost any chance of being with him. I was talking to Jeremiah on MSN and he said to not worry about it and that it was just a game and that Eugene places too much importance in it.
