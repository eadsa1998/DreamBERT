My brother and I are preparing to go into an exam. It's some kind of art exam, and it's going to last about 4 hours. I'm in a house with my brother and my grandfather who both seem laid back about leaving to go to the exams. I'm getting concerned about being late, and I'm expecting a lift. An old colleague is also there from an old job. He starts pointing out how difficult the exam is going to be. Have I researched this or that? I'm thinking "no".
