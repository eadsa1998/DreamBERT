I had just moved into a new neighborhood and see an empty garage. A man is inside, just under the ceiling. He appears to be cleaning or repairing it. It occurs to me that I would like to rent this garage. I tell the man I would like to rent the garage and ask where I may find the owner in order to negotiate this. The man is very friendly and tells me I can't rent it because he has recently rented it for himself. At this point I seem to have lost my direction. I am (floating?) up in the air. Ahead of, and below me, I see Mary. She is lying on a lawn and is wearing a reddish colored housedress. Mary is looking up at me and smiling. I have a complete frontal view of her. Her smile is beautiful, and she is looking me straight in the eye. She waves at me and signals directions on how to find my way to her. The dream ends as I am moving towards Mary, who is waving at, and singing to me.
