I started working at this takeaway place. First it was inside and one day I 'floated'. But now, everyone could float (we just sort of hovered in the air). I was saying that it happened a month after I floated. Then the place was like a wagon outside. I asked this lady where to sign in and she told me to go to the office, which was a huge shed/warehouse thing. Elijah was there along with some others that I knew. This chubby Asian lady said something weird and Elijah and I were giggling. He was kind of hot. I went to the office. There was a swamp in it with crocodiles. There was a really hot guy there whose name was Joe. I went in there, I think at some other time, and I took this book which had everyone's names. His name was Joe Jayone and he was born in 1985. I saw two school bags lying about and I realized he was a killer and I saw him throw them into the water for the crocodiles. There was like a rope and when he left, I swung past and tried to save them but I couldn't. He was coming back and I was with some friends now and we went to hide. I didn't hide in time and he saw me. Somehow I got away from there and I was now at a park at night. He had chased me there and we had a struggle for a bit and I managed to get him on the ground and I was sitting on him trying to stop him. He kissed me and then rolled me over so he was on top of me and we had sex. When it finished, Ezra came and I pushed him off me. He got arrested later. I read on a profile of him that he had killed lots of people. I was in the car with Mom and Ezra going to the movies. Mom said that it was my "first clean fuck". Leroy was then outside the car and he wanted to come along and he had lots of USB's. I was then watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson married this rich girl and he was on a farm and they had lots of land. The others annoyed him about it.
