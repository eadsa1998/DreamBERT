I go into a bathroom, and when I open the door, I see a dirty old man sexually hitting on two kids. I slam the door shut fearfully and run to a close phone to call for the police. Then I realize I'd left the kids in there with him. Before I have to go back in there to get them, he lets them out and then he comes out to get me. I retreat back into the room. He is a horrible, mean man. Now there's a little mouse he torments. I wait for the police to come and save me. Somehow he goes away. I go back in the bathroom and look around at his lair. I see shelves and a secret trap door into the attic. I pull a chain of beads that somehow represent my Aunt's eyes. She's dead many years. I shudder and go up the shelves to have a look. Perhaps there is treasure up there. Maybe he's up there, or a trap. I am scared and then throw myself up quickly and peek around and zip back down quickly. I do this over and over, each time using my arm and hand to sweep out of the attic anything I touch, hoping like crazy I don't touch anything awful. There are dust, dirt, layers of rotted away stuff, but nothing else. Then I see a lighted glass case that has my "Aunt's" favorite things. They are glass articles: statues of head and shoulder, pictures of her in her favorite pose, hats with feathers, coiffured wigs, pretty things. I guess she liked to see likenesses of herself.
