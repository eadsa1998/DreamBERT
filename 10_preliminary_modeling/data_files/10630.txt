My car breaks down in the middle of the desert. I wonder how in the hell I'm going to get to meet these people on time. I grew these huge wings. They were thick and strong. I turn into a human angel. I flap my wings and start flying towards the middle of this rock/mountain alcove. I could see a city nearby. I stopped to look at the city lights and the sun going down. My wings were so big I could feel the wind from flapping -- I could hear them flap. It was so loud, I woke up.
