R. asked me for directions for my typewriter as hers was giving her trouble. I said, "yes, I had them." and looked in my desk cubbyhole for them, no luck, pulled out all the papers, not among them. Then I remembered I had removed them from desk and put them in the typewriter case. I was visiting some of my family and had planned to go to the Strongs who were on the other side of city on Wednesday. But M. told me they were expecting their children on Thursday who'd leave Friday so I decided to wait until Saturday.
