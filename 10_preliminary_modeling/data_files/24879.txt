Melissa and I went to a Beatles concert at Sand Harbor. Onlly the stage was in a different spot. There was this cabin where you get tickets and we're looking for my mom to get a blanket to sit down on. We were just walking around and then there was a pause where nothing happened. Then the dream ended. Setting: Sand Harbor - Lake Tahoe outdoor theater. Characters: Melissa, my best friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. Very strange.
