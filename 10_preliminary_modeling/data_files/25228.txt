 I'm with a group of people and we're going to play softball or swim. There is a conflict over which we should do. A kid on my dorm floor in the group is eating. There is an advisor there, and something happens with an appointment. The group walked through a home of college-aged people. A black man is playing loud music. We decide to play ball because it is too cold to swim.
