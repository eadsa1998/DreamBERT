I was in a building and I was looking at my timetable for school and looking at the teachers that I had. The Wayans Brothers were listed. Tom Cruise and Kiefer Sutherland were the drama teachers. I think Eddie Murphy was there too. I was telling Mom about them all being actors. I was in some room and someone came running in trying to shut the door. Someone was after him trying to kill him. We all started running and we jumped through this 'screen'. We didn't know where to go. I ended up in this office area and Christopher Lloyd was there. Christopher was going to hide behind a desk and I squeezed in near him. He said something, but I all remember is "shaved leg". I pulled this curtain so that I couldn't be seen. Christopher ended up moving. I ended up at home and I was trying to find somewhere to hide. I couldn't fit anywhere and the person arrived. I rewound time. This whole thing had happened before, and it kept happening again and again and I couldn't stop it.
