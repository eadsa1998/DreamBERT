This dream I had was about Madonna. I dreamt that I was in her new Erotica video with her. This is odd because I've never seen the video itself. We were both dressed up as clowns and it was filmed in downtown crossing. After the taping a friend, Madonna and I went to "our" dressing rooms and when we walked in my Uncle John was smoking a cigarette. He wasn't supposed to because he quit. My uncle was Madonna's manager. I woke up.
