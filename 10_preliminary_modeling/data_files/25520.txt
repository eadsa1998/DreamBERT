 I'm in a school, which may be Brimson College, Armstrong High School, or Holy Middle School. My dad brings something for my sister Heather. He talks to me and says he wants back some hand written notes he had given me. My high school teammate Ron Lind is there, and he listens. My friends Holly Lapson, Emerald Reinhold, and Jill Banks walk by. Holly doesn't look at me or say hi. She does her characteristic nonchalant walk by. I talk to Jill a little bit. There is a dog there. I pet it, and it shirks away from me like it is scared. I am confused about the scheduling. I can't tell if this is Armstrong or Brimson. I have class in the field house during the 3rd trimester, which, I am told, is still the 2nd trimester. I'm in a hallway with a lot of people. A teacher comes out of a classroom and tells people to quiet down. She scolds the students that are close to her classroom. I say there is a whole hallway of students: why did she only yell at the ones close to the room? I talk with my friend Binky Ahmed and another person about basketball. He says I should play in the Jamboree. I say that my knees would crumble if I played, but it would be fun to play.
