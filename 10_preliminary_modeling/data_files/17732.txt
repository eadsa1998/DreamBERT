My boyfriend Jeremy was in college, and I was going with him.  I think it was an English class.  I talked to a girl who was also a psych major.  The teacher seemed obsessed with the number eleven.  Even though I was just a guest in the room, she called on me, and I had to stand in front of the room and answer her question.   She asked for an example of some literary term..I don't remember what.  My example was working in a pizza parlor with a guy you like.  My answer was acceptable and I went and sat down.  Then I guess we had a break.  My boyfriend Jeremy was gone- maybe left to go to the bathroom.  I talked a little more to the psych girl, but she left before I could get her email.  I was getting over a cold from the two previous days, so I blew my nose.  It got to the stuffy solid part where it's hard to get anything out.  Finally, I did get something out.  Looked like I'd blown out a rock or something.  Then I looked at the desk I was sitting at.  There was about a 3-inch diameter piece of my brain that I had apparently blown out.  I picked it up, and it felt light and dry, like Styrofoam.  I was disturbed by the matter, though, and I asked someone to show me where the office was.  The person who stood up was Rahim, a classmate from elementary school.  I was surprised to see him there and asked how he was doing- apparently well, and he enjoyed the school, even though it was a college that looked like a junior high school.  He took me to the administrative office.
