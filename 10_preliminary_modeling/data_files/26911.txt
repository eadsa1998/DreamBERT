 I'm with grandpa Redding. He is old and doesn't hear well, so I speak loudly and clearly. I ask him if I can buy one of his shotguns, if he doesn't use them anymore. He's responsive in his peppy, affirmative way, and goes to get one. I tell him I would use it for duck and deer hunting. He takes out a gun. It looks odd, like a special high power rifle, not a black and brown shotgun, like I expected. It has a silver barrel and several connecting parts where the trigger is. There's a small triangle piece that is the scope. It sticks up off the barrel a little ways. I look though it and the edges of the field of view inside the scope are blurred, like in a normal scope. He takes out the bullets for it and shows me. The look like .22 caliber shells: about a half as long and look empty, discharged. The bullets have to be placed over small nub-like projections, like a hairbrush with thick bristles. The shells have to be placed over the numbers, with ten or 20 in a bunch. It takes a long time to load the gun. Grandpa has several small boxes of these shells and a larger shoebox size box of ammunition as well.
