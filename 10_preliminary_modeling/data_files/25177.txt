 I'm sitting by a heater vent like the ones in my home. A woman comes and sits across from me in a chair. I say, "Hi, I'm Kenneth." Her name is Ellie. She isn't from here; she is the guest of a friend. I look over in a corner, and see my friend Binky Ahmed talking to a woman. My classmate Elise Rooks is there at some sort of a stand. She and my girlfriend Annie come over to chat with me. We have a box of donuts. My history teacher from high school comes over and changes the heater vent that I'm sitting by. I smile. He is a good guy. Then we're outside on a street with the box of donuts, eating them. Elise has a long anteater-like nose that she sticks in the box. I eat a lot of donuts. I run to the local college liquor store in Woodland, I think to empty the box. There is no liquor there. I know that all I have is a driver's license. I run back. I am wearing winter boots, running through puddles. I pass a man and woman and tell them that it's the same for all couples; that everyone goes through the same stuff. I have to call Annie, then Elise to buy at the liquor store. Then I call Ellie because she is the one I want. I run up to Home Ave and 2nd St, as if I were in Oak Valley.
