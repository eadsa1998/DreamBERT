I am sitting on a couch. A friend, Keith, also a friend of Derek's (not in real life), comes in and behind him is walking, with some effort, Derek. I am surprised. He comes in and talks a bit. I respond back in a friendly manner. He is still uptight about our breakup and non-connection of the last few months. Keith comes over and sits beside me on the couch. Derek walks over and puts his face between our faces. I kiss him on the cheek. He is still distant, but then he keeps talking and I keep talking and then he kisses me on the lips in a genuine sweet kiss.
