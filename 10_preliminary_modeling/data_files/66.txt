I have been in this place before, a flea-market sort of place with banks of booths inside a larger building, like Big D Bazaar. I'd gotten something here I liked a lot, in the way of jewellery, I think, from an older guy, a craftsman, in a middle booth. I want another one, so I've come to see if he's in, but I can see that nobody's open, all the places are empty and covered up. It's not out of business, just closed for Sunday or whatever. Still I walk all the way around in case. I see a few people in the open space (like the concession area) - one of them is the guy I'm looking for, and he's facing off another guy about his own age and type - some other men are sitting down watching. I can see they're about to have a fight. They're angry, but not enraged (yet), and the fight is structured. I think they're going to use swords, but not fancy or sharp ones, and they're not trained swordsmen. I don't want to see them do this, so I'm gonna duck out.
