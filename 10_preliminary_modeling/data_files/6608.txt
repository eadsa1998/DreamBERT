I am led through two locked doors, then taken through trap door up attic in a hammock by men. Have me part way up when they say, "We'd better not let her see these first" and they let down 1 or 2 unconscious men. I see part of a man's head, black hair and a very white face. Then I'm up attic. Two children are playing with dolls that are really babies. I think they are illegitimate babies and that's what I will be made to produce. I ask where the babies were found. They point to a corner. I ask R. for toilet. She says there is none up here and I'll have to get along without. I find slop pail partly filled with soapy water and use it while R. is smoothing up bed with no sheets. I hear the urine in a stream. I know torture is to await me. (Woke needing to urinate.)
