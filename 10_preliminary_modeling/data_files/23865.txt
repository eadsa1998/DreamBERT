I was in a downtown area, a little lost.  I wanted to see homeless living areas or abandoned buildings.  I got on a downtown bus, not knowing where I was going, went to the bus depot or turnaround.  It was also a Goodwill center.   I was walking away then, and a man asked me for assistance.  I told him the Goodwill center is right there, just up ahead.  He seemed glad for the direction.  I kept walking.  I passed an out-of-business restaurant, for sale.  It was pretty cool, a garden patio area entrance, an upstairs, wood, quaint.  There was a sign there about the windows, the garden patio.  I was interested and wanted to check it out, it was empty and sort of abandoned, but I didn't want Mondo people to know I was showing interest in another place.  They might think I had given up on their place.  I went to the place I was buying, another restaurant type place, but doing business.  People (women) were there to pick up surfing equipment, booties, and the owner was there helping hand them out.  I think - what a good idea.  It was part of the purchase, to get a day's rental of surfing equipment, people knew this.  I get more acquainted with the place, the people, the stream and flow there.  I was content with this place, looking forward to having it be mine.
