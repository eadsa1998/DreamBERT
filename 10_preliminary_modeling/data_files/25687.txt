 I'm on a mountain bicycle going down a hill by Washington University. Cars go by. It is a big hill. My bicycle is thick, heavy, and sturdy. I go on a path that puts me in the Big Resort Area. The path is right on the edge of a cliff next to a huge lake. There are many rocks in the water: a rock island is barely underneath the surface. I can't continue on the path: a tree is in my way. I pick up my bicycle and walk back to the road. The road sign points to the town of Moter. I am looking for a town that has a name that begins with the letter "S".
