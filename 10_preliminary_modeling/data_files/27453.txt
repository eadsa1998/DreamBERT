I was having trouble getting to work and to school at the appointed times. When I was at work, I should have been at school or on my way to school and vice versa. One of the times when I found myself at work, there was some sort of entertainment going on, and while we were all watching it I began packing my lunch. Even though I couldn't seem to budget my time correctly, I felt no particular anxiety or worry over the matter. The other people in the dream are indistinct.
