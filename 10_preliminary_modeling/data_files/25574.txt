 I'm at a casino dealing Blackjack. My high school classmate Lyle Zeffman and another man are at the table I am dealing to. Lyle has five red five-dollar chips bet. He doubles down. I have a ten showing. I line up his chip stacks. The second stack of chips is one short. I add one and make the stacks even. I flip over my down card, which is like a film case that you put a used roll of film into to get developed. The card has 10 dots on the other side: I have 20. Lyle loses the hand, and $50. He throws chips on the floor. I pick them up. I think about stealing his chips. There are other dealers there. <br/
