Working as volunteer in bookstore, I get a lot of orders for books; a woman buys a second-hand hard cover book, whose spine is coming apart; she asks if I could repair it a little; she wants to pay only $4 instead of $5 as listed. I repair the book and the book keeper issues a refund. I say: "Wouldn't it be easier if we asked for another check instead of issuing a refund?" some confusion and the woman leaves. shift: Frank and I are holding identical paper back books with the same cover design: a tree with white blossoms and a title that reads something like "You and I Together"
