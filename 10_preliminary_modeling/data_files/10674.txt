In another dream my friend Mary walks down the path and she's super excited to go to the carnival. She tells me it will be fun, the whole thrill about it is that it's scary. Besides, if we go together we'll be fine. I'm nervous, but happy we're going to do this together. We go to the carnival and although it's creepy, I start to have fun. I realize if I'm careful, I have nothing to worry about. Now I know what it's like. I'm glad I came, but realize I won't be coming all the time.
