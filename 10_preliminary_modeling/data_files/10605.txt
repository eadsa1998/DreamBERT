I am in high school and I have on this black mini dress I've been wanting for a while. The bassist and singer of Guns and Roses were playing in these wheelchairs and they were going through a door. I opened it for them and we just talked and had lunch. They were teasing me, but drummer told them to stop. Then they all kissed me.
