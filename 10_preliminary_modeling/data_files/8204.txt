I was in a car by myself. I couldn't get the brakes to work and the gas pedal seemed to be stuck, maybe the brake pedal as well. I was beginning to get scared because I didn't know how to stop it or slow it down. It seemed to actually pick up speed; it was going pretty fast. I pulled off into this field. I was going to drive around in circles in this field until I figured out what to do. I saw a police officer sitting in a patrol car in the field watching traffic. I thought, He's going to come after me but I don't know what else to do. I went ahead and pulled into the field. Sure enough, the officer turned on his flashing lights and came after me. He pulled up along side of me and looked at me. I said, help me. I can't stop my car. I thought he was going to abandon his car and try to jump onto and into mine so he could help me. Shortly after that I was able to stop the car or it stopped itself. I looked down and saw that the floor mat had been jammed up under the pedals. It had the gas pedal stuck so the car was going fast but it also had the brake pedal stuck so I couldn't press down on it to stop the car. I just fixed the floor mat, started the car back up and then left. The policeman was mad, not because I had left but because he had come so far into the field. I don't know if he got stuck. I don't know. But he was kind of upset.
