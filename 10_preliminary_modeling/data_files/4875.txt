Dovre and I are at a hotel. We are trying to get breakfast. We walk along a line of long tables. Apparently it is full. But then people are quickly leaving. Now we have plenty of places to sit. We get in line to get our food, only now we're buying books. The man at the counter says OK. Pay me. I look to Dovre. I say Where's my purse? I am concerned. Did she lose it? She says I left it in the car. I question her, concerned about this. Are you sure? When did you do it? Now, I am watching a man and a woman who bought some things. The woman bought 3 dresses, a red one, a green one and a black one. She's asking the man if she should wear these green pull on sleeves in the black dress. He is distracted as he's looking at the lovely faceted jewels and stones he bought. A black agate cut like a diamond. He's showing them to a man. There are also pretty copper objects. The woman wants to wear the red or green dress and doesn't think the green sleeves will work with them.
