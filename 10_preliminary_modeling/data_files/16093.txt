The Spanish group and I were staying at this strange hotel, and it had many, many, many rooms. And we were in this one room that was like a gift shop display room. And there was this fake wedding cake to feel that was supposedly Celine Dion and Rene Angelil's, and supposedly there was a painting of Celine and Rene doing it on the wall, and the girls wanted to go somewhere else. This room was really neat. So I walked out with them and I walked around, and we got on this elevator that was absolutely bizarre, and the elevator would like go sideways for a long ways, and then slowly get down to a floor or two and then go sideways some more, and then get down a floor or two, and then go sideways some more. And so on and so forth. And then we got off and I was walking around again. Anyway, I was walking around with them, and I was ___?____ to go back to the room with them, but instead of going back to the hotel room, I went to the room with the wedding cake and stuff and was touching the pretend wedding cake. And then I seem to recall some man entering, and I remember walking around with this man for a while there, but then I don't remember who he was or where he came from. I woke up.
