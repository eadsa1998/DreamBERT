Took place at: somewhere I'm not sure of (can't remember), though it was some place familiar to me like a video rental store or the library. The people were me and my friend, another female I've been dating off and on. The feelings were pleasant and happy, excitement. We were just sitting there, lying around. She recited a line from the movie Reality Bites (we had watched it a couple of nights ago) and then we kissed.
