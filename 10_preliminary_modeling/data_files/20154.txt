I met a girl about 8 years old. She seemed distressed. She explained that her uncle was planning to ask her a number of personal questions about herself and her brother. I held her close to me and tried to soothe her anxiety. I felt a sincere and pure compassion toward her. I was sad because I did not see a way to save her from her uncle. She seemed to like me, and she was attractive, but I saw her only as a companion. There was no romantic attachment. After she left, I saw another girl alone, but I did not approach her. Later I was walking across some hills carrying two bags of marbles. I came to a cliff. It was about 25 feet high, so I could not jump down. A ladder was slightly above my reach. I perceived that if I managed to reach it, it would be too slanty when I lowered it. I tried anyway, and as I did so, one of the bags of marbles fell and the marbles rolled into a sewer. I threw the other bag of marbles into a corner where two walls came together, and they did not roll into the sewer. I was surprised when the ladder was not slanty when I moved it down as I had expected. I was able to descend.
