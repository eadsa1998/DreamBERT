A princess and I are trying to hide out. There is an old boyfriend around. We go to a house to get a room. I walk down two flights of stairs. The banister is very rickety and wobbly. The man at the top of the stairs is thrilled to be touching the same banister I am. We get to the bottom of the stairs and the princess says, "The landlady won't show us a room. We'll have to take it sight unseen." I go to the landlady and say, "I want to see the room before we decide to take it." Something in my tone makes her decide to show me the room. We walk down a hall to our "room," which is a bed and a tiny two-drawer bureau. There is a large window with a nice view and more space because it's at the end. I ask if there is a bureau and she says not. I ask if I am expected to buy one. We agree I do.
