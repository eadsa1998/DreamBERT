It was really cloudy and dark. Calvin was staying at our house on a bed in my room. Soon though, he didn't. Anyway, we went to this place and we realized a tornado was coming. I was freaking and asking this girl if she had a basement or something. Everyone ran out and we were running too. The tornado kept 'following' us. We got to the car and then it was right behind us. Other people were driving away too. Some guy went on a boat because he thought that he could escape if he went on the water. The tornado was coming to him. It went away and Dad and I went home.
