A male friend of mind had finally come back from his vacation and I was flirting with him and he turned me down. We were eating pancakes outside. I remember leaving the table and the pancakes no longer hungry. Then I came back wanting to eat the pancakes again. Then I got in my car and drove for a long period of time.
