At table at the Camden's: I spill something liquid and try to blot it up with a small sponge or paper towel but it won't get blotted. I begin to laugh and cry and say, "This reminds me of when I was a child and I never could do it right." Father Andrew leans over gently and takes my hand and comforts me very much. He guides my hand as I clean it up.
