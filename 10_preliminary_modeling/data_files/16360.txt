I didn't remember it very clearly this morning, but as the day went on, it became clearer. That is very unusual because most of the time it works the other way around. First I dreamt that me and Astrid were like playing with toys, like we were kids. We were winding up all of our dolls and our animals and things and we were making a parade the way I used to do when I was little. And she was listening to like a personal CD player. And she was lining up some baby dolls and stuff. And her mother came back and told us we should totally stop that because that's immature; that's like kids' behavior. And then I woke up. And then I went back to sleep and I had another dream that Samantha and Derek were in town and Derek was using this audio program that's different from Digital Performer, but it was kind of similar. Mom had her own machine just like mine in her work room and her monitor was up on her high boy dresser. And I was like kneeling up on the stool, so that I could see it, and Derek had composed this rap thing with MIDI, and I was going to like go over it and sing some melody, like Ashanti sings for Javol (?) and Beyonce sang for JV (?). I was going to do that for Derek and his rap. I was like trying to do this and it like wasn't working right, and I had to close out and shut down, but I woke up before I could do it.
