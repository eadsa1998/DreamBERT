["Tornadoes approaching."] I married a man with a number of brothers. I live in my house and he and his brothers live in the house next door. I walk over there to find him. I see that their father has cleared several paths through the bushes to make it easier to go back and forth. I thank him for doing that. Suddenly I am aware of high winds and turn and see in the distance, behind my house a tornado or two. I go into my house and am worried for the children. They are outside in the back. I open the door. By now the winds are ferocious. I call to the children, fear in my voice. They hear me but are slow to respond. I demand they come in the house right now! As I am herding them toward the house, the tornado approaches very close. I get them in and Ellie tries to follow me back out. I yell at her, Ellie! Over and over. Finally I get them and me inside. I say stay in the kitchen because it only has one small window. I say I wish we had a basement! I am scared we will be hurt. Now the tornado is very close at the far left of the house. I looks like it might pass us by. Then suddenly it turns and passes right up against the entire back wall of the house. The branches of trees caught in the whirling winds rake across the back. Now there are a row of windows across that wall. The windows are breaking and flying glass is all over the place. Miraculously we are not injured but it is a close call.
