At a lodge meeting but the speeches were not in the ritual. At the close a man comes to me and offers to take me to her brother's funeral. I said I didn't know if I could go as I was still working part time and asked when it was to be. 6:30 p.m., Wednesday. I said I could probably go although I didn't often go out at night. He said to call him if I could. I handed him an envelope and told him to write his name and phone number on it and asked where he lived. He told me and I said, "Then you could pass right by the Home."
