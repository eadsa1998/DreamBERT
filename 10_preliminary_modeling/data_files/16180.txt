These two boys were over, like teenagers about my age, and they were working with Dad on something. And apparently Dad got this antique fire alarm at an antique show, except it was regular wood-grain color instead of red. And it was like, it was bigger than the one we have on the porch. And they were working on it on the front porch, and I went upstairs and I thought that I still couldn't get far enough away from it, so I went outside and I was going to swing on the little swing outside. But then they brought it out in the back yard and they started working on it out there.
