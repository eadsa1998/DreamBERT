I was lying on my bed in my room, but everything in my room was on fire. I couldn't get my covers off me and my vision started to blur. I saw my great-grandmother coming through the fire to get to me and take me up to Heaven with her. I walked to the door where she was. Then I was whizzing through a tunnel with her while a golden light was pulling us on. I loved it. (Real: when I woke up my mom was shaking me and she said that I hadn't been breathing and she couldn't find a pulse on me.) Setting: First in my bed, then through a gray tunnel that was really windy. Characters: My great-grandmother was in my dream to take me to Heaven. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy when I saw my great-grandmother; scared my room was on fire; relaxed &amp; excited in the tunnel. I think I might have had a "near-death" experience. When I woke up I wanted to go back to the golden light and my great grandmother. I have always wanted to meet her and I finally got to. But now that I think about it, I almost died. This strengthens my faith in God even more, because now I know that he wants me to live even just a little while longer. My fever was 105 degrees when I woke up.
