I was again in a new house-whether mine or someone else's, I'm not sure.  I was in bed in the top bunk of a large (full-size) bunk bed in the middle of a parlor-type room with a high ceiling.  I couldn't get out of bed because I was naked, or had on only boxer shorts, and there were no clothes in the room and there were lots of people all over the house.   There were two little boys, about 8 or 9 years old, who came into my room, and I asked them where to go to get dressed, but I don't remember what they told me.  They were going to play football in an organized game the next day, and one was teasing the other about being too small to play safety.  I told him that you didn't need to be big, just quick, fast, and tough.
