I showed up to take my Genetics mid-term. Only two others showed up. Time was up and I wasn't finished. The professor was not there. It was someone I knew. I think it was my mom. I asked for a few more minutes and she said okay. The test was so hard. A few questions were not even about Genetics. When I got my test back, I had failed Big Time. I got only 7 out of 100 right.
