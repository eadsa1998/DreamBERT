I am driving a sedan over a large bridge. Anderson is on front seat with me and Chester and another (unknown) person on back seat. This is our second trip over this route. Anderson asks if there isn't a heater on the car, as the weather is snappy. He has a screwdriver and is opening the heater vent, but I explain there is another "valve" or cut-off next to the engine, and until this is adjusted very little heat will come through. We reach the entrance to a bridge leading off to right, and though I somehow believe we should turn on to this bridge, I finally continue straight ahead. This second bridge is a makeshift affair, partly resting on roofs of houses. Presently we enter a large court, surrounded by buildings. I ask Chester where we are but he doesn't answer. I repeat the question several times and then realize Chester left the car sometime back; and I am rather annoyed by the failure of the person in back seat to tell me when Chester left.
