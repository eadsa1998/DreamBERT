I was over at these friends' house, a married couple who go to the University, and I was talking about some experiments that I had read. As I talked, I could see the cat in front of me that I was talking about. It said that if you have a cat and you feed it when it is blindfolded and then remove the blindfold, it will be very vicious afterwards and will attempt to bite your hand and bite more food and so on. Whereas the same cat, if it's not blindfolded, will not be vicious. As I say, the cat was kind of right in front of me as I was talking about it. That's all I remember.
