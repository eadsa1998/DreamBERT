There are two men, one is older, like Morgan and one is younger. They find me. I had left them before. I leave them again. I go to college. I am an artist that chose not to use my professional status to get a good spot at school. I ask for a male teacher, and then I connect with another woman artist and together we create really beautiful art. We compliment and complete one another.
