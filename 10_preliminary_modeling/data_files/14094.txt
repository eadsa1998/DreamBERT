I was watching Ugly Betty. Daniel and Betty were going out. They were kissing. He put on a black jacket and someone got this UV light and it had stains on it. He had black stuff around his eyes [episode I watched last night, Alexis did]. He had a baby, but it wasn't his [in the same episode, it was discovered Daniel Jr. wasn't his].
