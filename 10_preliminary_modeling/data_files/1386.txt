There is a small baby. I lay it on its tummy. Some woman is concerned. She feels the baby is safer on its back. I change the baby's position. Then I change the diapers, several times. I ask the baby if her clothes need changing too. She says no, they aren't too wet. A man is hoping that I will go into relationship with him, making the baby his niece or nephew. He is hesitant and warm. I look over his apartment. I comment this might not do because he has lots of collections of things that a baby would disturb. I'm pleased he's so rich. We hesitantly kiss.
