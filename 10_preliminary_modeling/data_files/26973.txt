We were at a large gathering. It may have been lunch time at school, but it seemed to be more of a party. I guess just about all my girl friends were there. I recognized many of them, but I can't recall who most of them were. I don't remember whether there were any men present. One girl was walking around blinking her right eye and looking quite miserable. I recognized her as a girl whom we try to escape at lunch every day at school. She's quite repulsive, and none of the girls care to have much to do with her. In my dream, no one was paying any attention to her as usual. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she'd had something in her eyes for days. She was working at it with a bobby pin and I immediately realized this was very unsanitary, so I offered to get it out for her. I pulled down the lower lid and saw a tiny black speck in the corner of the eye. I decided first I'd need a toothpick, but thought, but there aren't any around here, with a feeling almost of panic. Then I remembered having seen some somewhere, and found them in a very unusual place, on a shelf where I would never expect to find them. They seemed to pop up there just because I needed them. I had the feeling that I was very triumphant. I felt almost as though I had worked magic. I took several out of the box they were in, and put one in my mouth because I felt that after all, that was where toothpicks belonged. Next, I needed some cotton, and that turned up in much the same way as the toothpicks had. I felt the same way about finding that. I also felt pleased with myself because I was being so benevolent to this character. I didn't waste any love on her, to be sure, but I felt that I was at least doing my moral duty which was more than any of the other girls were doing.
