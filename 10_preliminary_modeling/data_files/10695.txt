Leaving Donald's house with Wanda. I decided I needed a blanket and went to my ex-boyfriend Sam's house. When we got there I realized that I didn't want to be there and hoped that we wouldn't see Sam. He peeked his head out of the window. We left and went towards my mom's house. I told Wanda to forget about the blanket.
