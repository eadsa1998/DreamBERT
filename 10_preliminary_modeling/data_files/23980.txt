I had a dream and I was getting married. My family was there and my friends and my dad were not there yet. And then all of a sudden my dad comes with a summary and we watched it until my dad left. Then he came back and I got married. My two dogs were there at my wedding too. After the wedding we went in a big room and had a party. We ate food and had some cake. My husband and me went to the hotel and my dogs came with me. We went inside the hotel and it had one door to walk in, two beds, a TV, table and chairs, a sink, and then the bathroom. Then we went downstairs to get a soda, then I woke up and got ready to go to school. The End.
