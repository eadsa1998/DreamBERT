 I'm in a house full of people, upstairs. There is a conflict between my sister Heather and her friends, and another group of people. Heather urges me to stand up for her. I acknowledge to everyone that I am siding with Heather's group, because it is the right thing to do: their group was being wronged. Heather wants me to hold hands with the group and make a demonstration, but I won't. Later, I get angry with Heather for being stupid and irrational. I leave. Eventually she comes out too. I am putting my shoes on on the steps. <br/
