I am standing on a very rickety old stage and must be careful not to stand on any of the rotten spots or it could cave in and I'd fall through. I have a mike and am explaining this to the audience. Alexander is in the audience. I joke that one doesn't know what kind of horrible rotten stuff is accumulated down there. Jerome is in the audience.
