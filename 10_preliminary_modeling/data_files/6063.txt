I had a dream that I went into an apartment house and rang one of the bells for my friend to come downstairs. (The ironic thing about that is that none of my friends live in apartment houses.) Finally all my friends and other people were all gathered in the hall. When my friend and I left to go to my car I noticed that someone had smashed my car while it was in the parking lot. The driver's side door looked like someone took a metal stick or pole and scraped it. The front of my car looked like someone just smashed right into it and left. Then some kid who I know because he is an acquaintance of my ex-boyfriend told me that he knew who smashed my car. I kept asking him who did it, but he wouldn't tell me. Then finally he told me that he was the one who did it. I can't remember anything after that because I woke up.
