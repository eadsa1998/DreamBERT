Long ceremony at Church: Father Andrew is getting married and "rehearses" ceremonies with me: 3 types of ceremonies. Many luscious cakes, ornaments and music. During the last ceremony he embraces me. Also see another Fr. there, with white hair: I go to Church every day, only to have to leave for Texas before the final celebration. See lots of children and priests praying and bowing.
