I dreamt I was out riding with my cousin, age 40 and his wife, about 30. We rode along for sometime and finally a huge amusement park of some sort came into view. The place looked tremendously attractive. The buildings were painted in beautiful bright blues and reds. There were numerous neon lights radiating about. The above description makes the place sound rather garish but really there was a certain unique charm about it and we decided to stop there for awhile. It seems that I had heard something about this place before and from the conversation of my cousin it was apparent that it was very well known. When we entered I felt that I had once been here before, yet, I know of no actual place like it. We entered some sort of building which had a restaurant in one half and a photo studio in the other. A rather nondescript girl, employed at the studio, was showing us samples of their work in photography. The girl was rather young about my age, I imagine. The pictures were mostly bridal pictures. I can't remember anything else.
