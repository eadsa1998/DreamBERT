Many people including my family and friends were sitting on very comfortable chairs and couches in a huge, beautiful room with columns and pillars all around the room. Straight ahead was a section with steps leading up to a space occupied by a very long desk. Seated at the desk was a man dressed in a judges' robes. A friend turned to me and told me to notice that the man in the judges' robes was a fellow I was dating. Then at the other end of the room music started playing. This fellow in the judges' robes came down, stood directly in front of me and asked me to dance with him.
