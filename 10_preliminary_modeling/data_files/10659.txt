I was at an old beach house with Tina. She was really excited to see it, "Wow, this beach house is really nice," she said to me. Except we were in the new beach house. "This is nothing. Wait till you see the old beach house." I led her past the dunes. We walked forever, but the house wasn't where it was supposed to be. Sebastian Bach (heavy metal rock star) came over and we were so in shock. All we could say was, "How was your plane flight?" He was nice, but seemed bored. I went to the cupboard and it was full and clean. I got him something to eat. My parents talked to him for a while and I was worried they'd bore him, so I was getting embarrassed. My mom told me they'd be done with him soon, I could have him later. Tina got into a dispute with him. She was sitting down by the kitchen door and he was standing. I was happy and confused. We took him out on the town. There were a lot of gypsy stores. Some girls tried to talk to him and we told them to step off because he was ours. We wanted to get a picture and he agreed, but we never got one.
