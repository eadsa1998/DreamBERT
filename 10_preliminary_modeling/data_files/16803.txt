I was in a room with my sister Lori. She was angry with me because I had given away this crystal sculpture which she called her "telepathic crystal." I tied to console her to no avail by giving her a Shiva statue. Then the phone rang. It was my friend Barb. Barb told me that she was really upset about the way I left Sally last summer. I explained to her why I had been so upset and needed to leave so hastily. I told her I wanted to renew our friendship. Then she was suddenly there and I was trying to get her to go out dancing with me. We were in my old bedroom from my adolescent years when I lived with my mom. I was smoking a cigarette. My mom's boyfriend came in and told me he didn't want me smoking in the house (his manner was surprisingly calm). Then I was outside. The house had burned to the ground except for the stairs.
