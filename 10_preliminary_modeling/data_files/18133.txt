It was night and my husband and I were coming back from some sort of function, and we were going out in the parking lot toward our car. I looked up and saw the moon in the sky and some distance away from it I saw another moon. I thought that was awfully strange. There were two girls walking along behind me and I asked them if they saw it too. They said they did. I thought, "That just can't be so. One of these isn't really the moon." As I thought this, one of them started getting larger, and sort of reddish. And I thought, "Aha, this is some sort of meteorite or something that's going to come crashing down onto us." So my husband and I got home and turned on the radio to see what the news would say about it. But nobody was saying anything about it. There was this girl commentator who said that she had a special news bulletin that all of Georgia and Louisiana and some other place were on fire, but she didn't elaborate on it. We got the idea that whatever was happening, they were trying to play it down. It was daylight now, and the sun was in the sky. When I put on dark glasses and looked at the sun, I saw that this thing that I had seen yesterday was impinging on it and was touching it and was about the same apparent size as it was. I mean, now I could see that this thing was round, but you could see a crescent outline on it, like a crescent moon. So I went back in and told my husband that I knew what that must be. It must be Venus, but I wondered why it was so big. I thought there was something strange going on.
