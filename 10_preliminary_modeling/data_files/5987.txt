It is time for X., a graduate student who is collaborating on research with our group at work, to defend his Ph.D. dissertation. Somehow X. has changed his field to music, and the doctoral defense is to be a piano recital. An appropriate recital hall has been set up, and I am among a group of people making a last minute check of the arrangements. We discover to our annoyance that the furniture on stage is lacking and that the piano is either missing or is not suitable. We leave the hall briefly and return carrying new furniture. One of the other people rolls in a beautiful grand piano on wheels. To test it out, we all sit around the keyboard and take turns improvising and singing silly songs.
