I am on a trip with my extended family - parents, several relatives, my own husband and children. I am returning to my hometown. We stay in a town about 100 miles away and are happy to have one more day of vacation. Then we have to come back. When we get back to my hometown there is a lot of snow and we have to walk a long ways. Just as we arrive at our house there is a lot more snow and we can't get to the house but there is a step ladder and it appears if we climb over the ladder we can get to the house. I go over the ladder and see we are still blocked off on the other side. My daughter, who is a small child in the dream, and some other people are on the other side of the ladder. I reach down to pick my daughter up and find there is smoke coming from her boots. I realize spontaneous combustion has occurred and her toes have burned off. They are all black and charred, but she does not seem to be hurting and isn't even crying. From my position at the top of the ladder I can also see someone in my family is checking the mailbox on the side of the house, but there is no mail. I know there will be no mail there because the right mailbox is on the front of the house.
