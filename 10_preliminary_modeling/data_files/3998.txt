["Walking."]  I am walking and it is somewhat difficult because I usually go in a wheelchair. I am walking down a sidewalk. An older unkempt woman is in a wheelchair on the sidewalk. She grudgingly gets up and steps aside so I can walk on the sidewalk. She is annoyed with me. I continue. Now I see a woman evangelist sitting on a large wooden structure. She is preaching to one lone woman seated on a bench across from her. The listening woman looks bored. I pass between them. As I continue, I see other people standing around on the sidewalk. I walk with effort and concentration, kind of surprised I can manage this long.
