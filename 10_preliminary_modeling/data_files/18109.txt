I was in my house with Cassie, Katie, and Kristina.  We were having a sleepover, and we had just woken up.  Everybody left, and I went to the beach with Erin, Heleyna, and my mom.  I started to swim, but it was very hard because there was so many big, sharp rocks.  But in the middle of the ocean, there wasn't any rocks.,  I started to swim out, but there was a huge wave,  so I swam back.  While doing this I cut my toe.  I got to shore and I met Heleyna there.  She told me: "Don't get in a boat here, because you just get cut from the rocks."  Then a big whale was in the ocean, and then the whole ocean became an aquarium.  Then it became a theatre, and Cassie was up on stage singing.  I was the stage manager, and I was sitting with the unicorns, because this was a fantasy play.  I went home and started listening to records.  I realized I didn't have a sing to sing for the talent show the next day, so I panicked and tried to pick out a good song I knew.  The next morning, I got up on stage and decided to sing "Lean on Me."
