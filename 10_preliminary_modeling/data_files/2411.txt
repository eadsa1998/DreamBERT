Ellie and I went to a conference. We sleep together. I wake up and see Paulina, who had slept in her father's room, taking a shower. It looks like a good idea. I see a woman swimming past me, near the far wall. I'm surprised and wonder if there is water in the room. I sleep more. Paulina B gets into bed with me. I pretend I'm still asleep but enjoy the sweet hug she gives me. I hug her softly and pat her. She pats me back. I notice the difference between my feelings with Ellie and her. Ellie and I are always on edge with each other. Paulina and I exchange true feelings of loving each other. It's almost like she's my baby girl again. So now Ellie and I go to take a shower. The thing isn't very good. There are different nozzles and not much strength in the stream of water. Someone leaves the door open. A young teen boy comes in, rough and smart-mouthed. He has a scissor and threatens me. He rapes me. I have no feelings, even though I cry and sob and cry out, "help" and "rape." Later, I critique a story or movie about a mild man who has a water process to create steel. The macho men laugh, it won't work, they do fine with their fire and forge. Later, they learn this new method is better and have to back up and respect him.
