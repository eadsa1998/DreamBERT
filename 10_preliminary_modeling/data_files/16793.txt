I was laying in a field of grass. My mom was standing at my feet. She seemed sad, angry, &amp; remote. She told me she was never going to call me again, but I could keep calling her if I wanted to. I was trying to figure out why she was upset. I asked her if I had been calling her too often lately. I explained that I had been feeling kind of lonely, that I don't have any close friends right now, but I assured her that if I was calling too often I would stop. She said she had to leave and walked away. I called for her to wait and said, "Don't you want your gifts?" I reached into a bag that had two beautiful wrapped Christmas presents I had gotten for her but when I looked up she was gone. In the bag was another gift from my friend Tina to someone I didn't know. I wondered how I had ended up with the gift. Since I didn't know how to find Tina or who the gift was intended for, I decided to keep it. I unwrapped it and found a basket of fancy soaps and a bath sponge. I went to take a shower.
