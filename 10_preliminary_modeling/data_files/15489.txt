I was watching The Amanda Show, but it was actually with Drew Barrymore who hosted it from the ages of 3-10. Drake Bell was 13 and had had a kid at that age but separated with the mother until he was 'of age'. I told Mom about this in the kitchen. Then I was in France with Mom. There was a shop and I found Alain Delon related merchandise on a shelf. There were also his personal belongings. There was also a diary I liked. I realised there was a queue behind me, so I took the diary. Mom said she only had $20 and no Francs. I said I had money and the lady behind the counter said that she could convert the currency. I told Mom to 'shut up' and the lady behind the counter said I should shut up too and I said she'd been driving me crazy. I realised I had grabbed the wrong diary and I went back, but it was gone. I got an alternative and she said it cost "2x5" and I said it was too expensive. I was walking with Dad on a big road. There was a bridge with a huge drop. Cars were driving vertically down and I walked behind Dad and we had to hold hands to walk down.
