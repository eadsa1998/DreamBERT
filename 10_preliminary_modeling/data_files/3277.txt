I am in a house. A silver-papered bag of cat food is in the sink, but we don't have cats any more. A tiny baby girl is laying on the floor. I dance around her, teasing her, my toes nearly stepping on her head and shoulders. She doesn't much like the teasing. I sing a chant about "No more flu germs, No more cold germs," like a chant to ward off germs. I prance around saying that over and over, and then as an afterthought, I say, "And no more germs from outside this room too," meaning if I go outside, I don't want to catch any germs there either. It's a way of protecting us.
