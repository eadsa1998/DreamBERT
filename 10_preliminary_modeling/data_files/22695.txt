I was in a church where a group of soldiers with spears were marching around me; that is, they were going around the aisle between the seats. I was with somebody (I don't know who it was), and then two gentlemen came (they were rabbis) and sat on the other side of the bench. Then a group of people appeared in the upper part of the church who started listening to the priest first, one on top of the other, in such a way that later on they could fall in line.
