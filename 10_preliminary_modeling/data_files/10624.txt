I went to school and my friends were in a circle in the gym. I got mad because this girl kept saying she hated these people and I tried to tell her to stop. Then I got mad because no one paid attention to me, so I went to talk to some other friends and mimicked my other friends. Then I ran to the bathroom and these spiders were making a design on the floor. No one was there because these machines were going to make designs everywhere and if you were there, it was dangerous. All over school this happened. Then I picked up this girl I baby-sit for with my friend Heidi. The little girl kept switching from a girl to a boy. Then she fell asleep. There were all these boys at school and I had trouble getting to my classes.
