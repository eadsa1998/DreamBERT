I was at home. The mail had just come and I received a letter and a postcard from my girlfriend (age 22) whom I hadn't heard from in two years. She said she was divorced and that she now lived in S--. On the letter and postcard were pictures of S--. One scene was of a village with mountains in the background. It was beautiful and the colors were gorgeous. My girlfriend and I were in the gas station getting fuel for the car. The station was on a hill. Suddenly the scene shifted and I was in a classroom. I sat down in a chair that had several coats on it. Again the scene changed. It was raining and I was reading the election headlines in the paper. Wallace's name was there, but all I remember was something about rain being mentioned.
