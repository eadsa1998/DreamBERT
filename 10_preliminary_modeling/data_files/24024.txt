In the beginning of my dream, I was walking here at school, with one of my friends to my next class (math). The bell had just rung saying that lunch was over. I think me and my friend were talking, but I'm not sure. We were still walking to class when the bell rang, which meant we were late. We didn't seem scared or worried. One of us might have said, "Oh, well, we're late." I am not sure, but I think my friend said that. When we got to class, our math teacher handed us each a detention. We were standing at the back of the room. I said, "I thought you have to be tardy two times to get a detention." Either my teacher or my friend says, "That's only for P.E." "Oh," I said. During math class I wrote on a piece of paper: 1) Not sure. 2) Tardy to math. I am not sure why I wrote this. I think it was for my mom to explain why I got the detention.
