 I'm in an English household where a famous painting was just stolen. There are two small golden retrievers. They might have taken the painting, but no, a man did. There is a limousine where I go to drop off a girl that is my age. The driver has a gun. I borrow the gun and shoot at a squirrel. The squirrel charges me. I kick it, and hit it with the gun. The theft has become a murder case.
