Traveling at night in a rickety boat. It's like a square, like a floating house. There are provisions, but the whole contraption, with an attached dinghy used to keep the horse, feels like it could collapse or be swallowed by the choppy sea at any moment. Where we're going, I don't exactly know -- but it feels like a necessary adventure. I didn't know my traveling companions well, but they were friendly and we had similar goals.
