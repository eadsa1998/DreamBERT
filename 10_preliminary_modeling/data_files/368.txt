I'm with a group of people who are unrelated but living together as a family. I'm visiting, or I've stopped here on my way somewhere. The weather is getting windy and cloudy, and I'm looking out the window. In the distance I see a fast-moving, whirling black cloud showing behind other clouds, and I think it's a tornado. I call out to the others, and some come look. A man tells me, "That's probably not a tornado - sometimes we get these, they don't touch down." As it moves, I can see that it's up in the air, very big, very black, but no funnel tip. But as I watch suddenly I see there are things flying up in the air toward it - there are little pavilion tents, cows, pigs, wagons, stuff that belongs at a medieval fair. Huh? [Apparently going outside,] I see that a little way off from the house is indeed a fair, but it's kind of mixed up. I'm not sure if I'm seeing a medieval fair, or a Dickens-y or an Alice in Wonderland theme park. Fun, though. (Is this where I was going in the first place?)
