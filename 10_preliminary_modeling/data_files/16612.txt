I was at the house of the Polish people behind us, Catherine and Fritz, and I guess we went over there at the start of the party or something ___________________. And the funny thing was these different people. When we got there it wasn't Fritz and Catherine, it was somebody else, but it was ______________________ house is. And so we got there and there were a bunch of people there and ___________________ and they had a piano in this other side room. It was the one like Erica has. It was like this ____________. And it was like the one that I play at the _______________ where if you didn't turn off the ________ machine thing, it would sound kind of funny. Let's see, how did this even begin? A bunch of people were talking __________ and the main _______________ piano, and I think, there was one of these dreams where I was trying to play and I can't really. And I didn't have the sense of ______ in this dream, so that didn't help. [laugh] But I really wanted to, and it was one of those dreams where I couldn't consciously remember ___________________ I guess. And then I went to this bathroom and some little girl walked in on me, and it wasn't really that big of a deal, but she left the door wide open and she like bouncing from her bedroom back to this bathroom. __________________ And then Mom and Cassandra came in and _______________________. But they stood around talking, you know. Let's see _____________. And then next thing I knew I was standing ______________ at this house and I came to the understanding that _________________________ house and the piano was still there, and I was actually staying in the room with the piano. There was a bed and there was like a crib for these two little girls, and for some reason I couldn't sleep and I got up at like 3:00 in the morning, and it was so strange. I had my CC TV at this house, and I had my little tape machine, and I was in this bedroom where the piano is and ____________ gotten up and I had turned on the CC TV and I was reading _______ stuff ______ or like _______________. And I was listening to _________________ little tape machine. And then ___________________________ _________________. And then the little girl started to cry and she didn't see me _______________. _____________________ and then the most crazy turn of all, I dreamt that it was the next morning and ___________ there with some other lady friend of hers. And I'm trying to think who else was it ____________ having a party, and it was like, you know, like having a little tea party _________________. And I was laying on the floor for some reason in the other room and ______ was showing her lady friend all of the American Organist magazines. And then the last thing before, the last thing in this dream is __________. She was trying to get this room air conditioner to work because she was hot, and it was kind of like the one we have in the bedroom. And she turned it on high and I guess she thought it was _______________ thing. And somehow she was able to make it sound like it was going, "Boom, boom" like she was stepping on the gas pedal of a car or something. And she said, "______, I'm hot, I need air!" And then I figured it was time for me to go because I was freezing and she was still wanting the air to be colder, as it usually goes in those places, mostly in big buildings at the college and _______________________ freezing my buns off. And so then I realized I need to ____________ some stuff and go home. And I was able to unplug the CC TV to carry it across the alley and through the back yard and back home and put it back in place. And then I was making somebody a cake, and what I was going to do was I was going to cut one of those______ like in half and then put a gold like __________ so that it looked like a basket. And I was going to write something on it. And I can't remember who it was for, but it was somebody's birthday. And I guess that's all there was to it. Boy, that was a long dream. It was all these different things in the same house. I wish I could have gotten to play the piano, though.
