I was with a friend who had recently been to Tibet, or near Tibet.  I told this friend about another friend's trip there and he didn't seem interested.  The friend was tall and thin and had a mustache.  I think he had a sister, and he lived in an apartment with his parents.  His mother's first name was Jane.  My Mother was there, and I was surprised that she called the other woman by her first name-Jane.  They had some slides of Tibet, and I asked to see them, so they got out some hors d'oeuvres, set up the projector, and began to show them.  I only remember one of them-of the friend and possibly his sister on the top of the mountain or a cliff.
