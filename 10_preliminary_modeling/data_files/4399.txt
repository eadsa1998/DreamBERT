["Grandma Anne loving and giving."] I am in a house, talking with Grandma Anne. As we chat, she brushes her long thick grey hair. I remember the time she asked me to put her hair in pincurls and I felt so uncomfortable. I wish now to brush her hair as we talk. She is loving and wants to know how I'm doing. She gives me an antique dress, with an elastic waistband. It is long, white and pretty, with ribbons on it. I try to figure out how many years old it is. Over 50. I think the dress will be too small for me, but it does fit well. I look good in it. We spend hours talking about family and old times. I really appreciate this information and the openness of her. Then a man with a broad face comes in. She introduces him to me. We sit at the table chatting. I think Grandma is trying to set us up as a couple. We chat pleasantly.
