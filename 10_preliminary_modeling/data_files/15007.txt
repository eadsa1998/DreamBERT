I went to the toilet and I saw Simba with a half eaten mouse. I distracted him and it looked like it was still barely alive, which upset me. I accidentally pushed Simba into a hole. I freaked out but he was ok. Gizmo was around too. I went to some shop thing with Dad, Ezra and something that I can't read which were all tall and big. Then it was a show. David Anders and his brother (?) were scientists, but different kinds. Both invented a similar thing. Then David Anders spent ten years building a tall building thing. Then I went to a simultaneous world? One of the brothers was $1000 away from $50,000.
