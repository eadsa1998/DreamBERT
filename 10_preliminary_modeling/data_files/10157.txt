On a long TRAIN trip, riding along a high mountain crest at sunset time; we arrive at a station that reminds me of Livingston, Montana. There we have a lay over and have to stay a long time, waiting for our connection. I see others leave on a bus, and wait a long time for the bus driver to return; he promises to get us "there" on time.
