My dream consisted of my father's Corvette being stolen. It was stolen when I was driving it and left it at the shopping center. My father didn't get upset, because he was going to buy another one. He bought another one and then wanted to buy parts. We went to a guy and my father and I bought parts for his new Corvette. The parts we bought were our old parts from our last Corvette. We realized it and got our Corvette back and now we owned two Corvettes.
