The game was interrupted and I found myself walking down the road in front of one of the houses our family once lived in. Near the speedway. I've dreamt of walking or driving around here before. There was a big city show going on. It was like the downtown where I went to college is now. There was one display that was now underground. A friend of my father's was there, setting it up. He was like a building contractor. "The display was so popular last year, the people practically tore the thing apart hitting all the buttons." So now it's more secure in an underground bunker with CIA-level security.
