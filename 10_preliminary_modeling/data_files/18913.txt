Involved myself and three other characters. I was walking down the center of a very large reception room with two other people. I was on the extreme right, and there was a long, narrow carpet leading from the entrance of the room to a throne. On my immediate left was a man wearing a high silk hat, and he was the president of some country. He was also the holder of a Ph.D. and M.D. degree. On his immediate left was another president of a country who I believe was the holder of a Bachelor of Law degree. The three of us were in a very jovial mood. The purpose of our being there was to see the king. We were going to receive some kind of an award or very high sort of recognition of some sort from the king. We were striving jauntily towards the throne in very high spirits smiling and sort of the attitude of congratulations toward one another for the three of us being there on this, what seemed to be auspicious occasion. I would say there was even some levity in the situation, and as we got within a few steps of the throne, we stopped. The man to my immediate left in the high silk hat knew the king and he was going to introduce us to him. The king stood up and he said to the king, "I would like to present to you ..." and at this point a look of amused bewilderment came across his face, and he quickly broke out into a very large grin and started to chuckle and said that, "I've forgotten how to pronounce your name," and this was addressed to the king. And at this comment, since the tension was very high, we all broke out in great guffaws of laughter, including the king. All 4 of us were laughing very long and very hard. Then the man in the high silk hat kind of got carried away and reached over and picked me up off the ground in sort of a bear hug. We all seemed to find this an extremely funny joke of some sort. That's all there was to the dream. <br/
