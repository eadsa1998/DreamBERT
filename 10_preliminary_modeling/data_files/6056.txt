This was a difficult dream because it was all about my good friend's death. I more or less relived her funeral. I was at the church, looking at her in the coffin. I all of a sudden couldn't breathe. In the dream I then fell to the floor, and I had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The last thing I remember was the doctor telling me that I was also going to die and I had only three months left to live. It was at this moment that I woke up.
