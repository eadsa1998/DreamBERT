I am watching road construction at the swimming pool in my town with my daughters and some friends. It is the time of year when we have boat races in my town. A friend from grade school and I drive a car into a pool of water but we manage to get out. I forget to take a picture of the boat races. There is a green figure, like a Buddha, in the dream. The Buddha is on the mountain at the end of the main street in my town.
