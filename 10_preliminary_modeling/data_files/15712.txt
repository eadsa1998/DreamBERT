I was on Skype with Benjamin and he changed his profile picture to one of him which he had taken with his laptop and at a low angle, with a weird smirk on his face and looked a bit different. Behind him was a cupboard/shelf thing with a few bits and pieces on it -- one of them was a trophy of a hand giving the finger. Later, the picture changed to a video in real time and I clicked on it trying to work out what was happening and it tried to video call him and I cancelled it. Then it changed to this film he had been in. It was set in older times with farmers. He was in those ratty farmer type clothes [Hobbit-like] and he was lying on the grass with one of those wheat things in his mouth talking about how great the day had been. There was a girl lying next to him. Then it was real life, but it was in the present and I was there. He was talking to these two girls and I kind of walked off, but he re-joined me. It was night. We walked for a bit and then I was suddenly in this long dark hall at the door. Benjamin was outside on the porch and knocked. I looked out this little slot in the side but saw there were these two ghosts. They were cartoonish but had armour and swords. He was fighting them off and I was too scared to let him in. I saw this furnace in the door and switched it on and they melted. I let him in, but it was pitch black inside and spooky. I found the light and then we went into this room and there were computers and computer parts everywhere, as well as books. At some point, I realised it was a dream and was looking at this shelf of books and noted how similar they all were -- they also all had the same title, but I've forgotten what it was.
