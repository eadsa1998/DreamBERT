It was the day of a major track meet. The coach had very little interest in my career at the time because of all his stars from previous years. They were graduating so he let me run for experience only. I won both the 440 and 880, and was he surprised. I thought I was going to die I was so sick, but I came out ok. My times were the best of the year and those 10 points of mine eventually won the meet. Thereafter the coach paid a little more attention to me. I had had the ability all along but lacked interest and wouldn't work too hard.
