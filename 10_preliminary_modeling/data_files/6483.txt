I dreamt all night long, but now I only remember snatches -- a spider dream, a dream about camping, one at the Hillside Library, and one about some strange backwoods country dance where one man had three dozen pairs of clay eyes running up and down the bridge of his nose, and this girl who was previously thought ugly redid her hair and ended up being gorgeous. "All the men's eyes" were on her, and the singer of the band with the three dozen eyes had them all trained on her. So the singer's three dozen eyes was supposed to represent the eyes of all the men at the dance.
