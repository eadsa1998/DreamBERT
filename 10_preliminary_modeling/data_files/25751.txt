 I'm at a party in a house. My friends and classmates Nicole Peterson, Wyatt Belzer, Hank Anderson, Norman Noman, Jimmy Youngman, Mya Rousing, and others are there. There is a young kid where we are. It feels like an ice skating warming house with a rubber floor. It is winter, after spring break, and there is snow outside. People are returning. There is a very carefree atmosphere. A salesman is trying to sell the young kid really expensive roller blades. The kid resists buying them, saying they cost too much. The salesman then tries to sell him an expensive CD player. I need to get a ride back home. Hank and Norman have a full car. Mya can give me a ride with her father in 20 minutes. I dance with Hank, Norman, and Nicole. I knock a bowl off the counter top in the house. It is my mom's good china from the wedding. The party is at my house. There are many people there and some injuries. I want everyone to leave. Something bad has happened to my classmate Wyatt Belzer. My friend Sarah Reed and her mother Rachel help to find out what has happened and where he is. I go through big garage doors, and find my gold colored deep diving metal fishing lure on the ground. I'm looking for Wyatt. I go in the house where there are black people, including my classmate Chad Owens and his brother Ron. I go out of the house and the police are coming. I walk nonchalantly to the back of the house and signal for Sarah to leave without me. My classmate Trevor Adams is near the front of my house. I see him and we talk. The tall, crazy, dark, lanky man from Brimson says hi to me like we're buddies. He wants to use my house. I throw a snowball at him, and think he is a fool. The senior party for Brimson students is happening. I see some of the students.
