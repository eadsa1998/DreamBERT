I went to Mercy College. It was gay and had little greenhouses everywhere. Then I had this twin and we didn't look alike and I can't remember properly but she was trying to get away from these dudes. Ezra flipped some guys the bird. Mom pulled over and ran and hid, but I stayed in the car and this guy came over and I was like "It wasn't me! It was my brother!" he said it was rude and I said that he does it to everyone.
