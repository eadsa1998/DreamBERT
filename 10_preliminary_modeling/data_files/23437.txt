I'm in a store with my husband -- he is returning a shirt. The salesperson ends up leaving with us -- we take her somewhere. Then I'm at some sort of health club or spa. A friend from high school is there too. I try to talk with him but he is in a part of the club I cannot get into. There was a third part to the dream I can't remember now.
