I was watching a large procession of men, led by Winston Churchill, walk into the parliament building in London. Behind Churchill a small man with an umbrella trailed. I went in with them and was seated near Churchill. Proceedings began and a young man stood up to talk, but I couldn't hear him because of planes overhead. Everyone laughed at him and he was very embarrassed. I stood up to berate the members for not allowing him to talk, and they were all very surprised to see an American in their parliament. As I talked, the planes became louder and everyone decided they were being bombed and left. I remained alone.
