I was working again. A fellow worker was walking by with a sheet and had some results written on it. I glanced quick as he walked by. The names seemed like this is that, etc., sort of rhyme horses. I heard a fellow say the cops shot at two men who grabbed a scratch sheet and ran. I saw cops made of men from the shop men. They had fancy new clothes. I sort of joked with them as I walked by.
