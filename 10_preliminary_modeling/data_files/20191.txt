I was in a bed next to a patient named Young. He asked me to put my foot between his thighs, and I did so. Later some veteran patients were leaving the day room to go on a trip. I had intended to join them, but by the time I dressed, they had left. I was angry at myself for being so sluggish. I became determined to do something about that lethargy.
