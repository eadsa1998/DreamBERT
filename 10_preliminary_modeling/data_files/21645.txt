Ann and I went into a restaurant. She wanted a certain table. I went up to the desk to ask. Before I could ask the waiter gave me a ticket with the table number. It was 77-11-77. We went to the table and it was still soiled. Five men were sitting next to us. One of them was breathing heavy. We were separated by a long table. I was carrying a big man like a baby. He was heavy and pulled me down. I met Mrs. Rudic and her husband. He was a stranger to me. He was not Frank. I shook hands with Mrs. Rudic and then she introduced me to him. The kids were having fun. There was some kind of ducks or monkeys that would bounce up and make a pyramid as they landed.
