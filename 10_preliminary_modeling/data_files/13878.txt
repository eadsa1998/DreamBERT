I was in a backyard. Jewel Staite was in a chair, signing autographs and the like. Mom and Ezra were there. I was telling Ezra about how nervous I was when I got a photo with her. Granma was then there. Mom made some rice salad. There were some signed videos but I don't know what was on them. I had gone to the shop earlier and Michael Palin was there and I had fainted and then Paul McCartney was there too.
