I was going to my birthday party and it was going to be a place that looks like Morrison Park's Club Saturday dance room, and so the plan was that I was supposed to enter real slowly with a wireless microphone in my hand and give a little speech and sing "Happy Birthday" to myself, like I'm going to do at my graduation, kind of like. But I forgot all about the plan and I run in there because I want to be involved on the party, and I have this notion that I'm late to the party. And so I get in there and I start partying and dancing and stuff, and then I get up by the sound table and I'm ready to sing "Happy Birthday" and Dad goes over to the sound board and starts screwing up the levels, so that I'm way low and the music is way high. And then I go over there and I'm like, "Hey, what the heck are you doing?" And I'm like trying to readjust it and having to justify why. And I dreamt that the CD player had two separate outputs for its two separate trays, and that we had to mix on the mixer so that the right hand try would be on the right channel only, and the left hand tray would be on the left channel only. And I understood this and Dad was having a problem understanding it. And I'm trying to get him to realize what's going on here and what we gotta do, and before I know it, well first, everybody at the party is gone by that time. And then I woke up. I was going to say this early this morning, but I had the machine out and ready to go and rewound, and before I could record and speak, I like fell asleep with the thing close by. [laugh] That was weird.
