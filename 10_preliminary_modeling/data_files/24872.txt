I was taking this ballet class and my friend, but I don't remember who, was in the claSs too. We did warm-ups and then this "toe" workout/stretch. Then we had to walk around the room while he checked our strength. We took a break and he asked me if I was the one allergic to tofu. I said, no, not really, and he started talking about someone else allergic to tofu. Setting: In ballet studio. Characters: My teacher (male) who I don't know, and 3 other girls in my class, one of which I don't remember. Feelings and Thoughts: Relaxed. I think it is strange because I have been thinking of taking ballet soon.
