It was last night and I couldn't sleep [I also had trouble sleeping that night]. I ended up taking a swim in this pool. Everyone was awake and got confused. At 6am I asked Ezra and Dad when I needed to get up for Christmas but they didn't know. Then I was at school or work and I was cleaning and my shoes got filled with white stuff and I kicked them off and people laughed at me. Eugene was there too and we were sort of friends. There were other people there and they were laying on the floor and people were pouring alcohol into their mouths. I also did it. Eugene was trying to tell me something (that he liked me) but I kept waving him away.
