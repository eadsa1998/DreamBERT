I was watching a football game. It was played on a roof of a building and it was a roof that was not flat, but an angle like an ordinary house, but not quiet so steep. They made a play and the players were crawling along the man with the ball made a touchdown and the game was over. I was in a cafe and was looking for a big man that was wanted by a certain man. I shook hands with another big man who knew me and wanted to buy me a drink. We were watching three horses that were being ridden by three boys. This was on sand. It was like a desert or a seashore. One of the boys started his horse. He ran over the sand and the boy fell off the horse. The horse kept on going for quite a spell, then turned and came back and he was ferocious looking as he came charging at us. We all ran for cover. Three of us ran into a building like a barn. I got up out of his reach. The horse came in very fast and then looked for us. He came at us very wild-like. I was high, but still within his reach. He then turned into a man. I had an object in my hand for protection. I then flew outside in flight from him and he was after me. I flew and flew and then he started to sing and this was like a movie being taken. I thought the acting was easy because I didn't talk, just perform. I was sticking some label on a book or into a book. I was playing cards and the cards seemed to be torn. I played the last card and couldn't see what it was and threw one of my good cards and Ann took it from me. I complained it was dark and I couldn't see what the card was.
