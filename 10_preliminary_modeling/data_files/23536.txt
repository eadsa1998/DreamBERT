I dreamt that I was graduating from high school and going to a big dance/dinner. The location was at a junior high and elementary school near the house where I grew up. The two schools combined into one in the dream. I was having problems with my skirt -- the buttonholes at the waist were torn so I couldn't button them. I was supposed to have dinner with Jim. He had used my girlfriend's last name for the reservation. I wanted to dance with him. He was not close to me. There were lots of people I know there (not high school friends though). Larry and May were there with their baby. The baby looked just like Larry. Its back was covered with hair (like a grown man) and he had a long dark ponytail of head hair.
