I was defending the Eskimo culture in a courtroom situation. It is the custom of the Eskimos not to bond or show love to their babies for the first year and a half because so many of them die. If they live, then they are loved a lot. There is a white man judge and lawyer who are trying to prove this is cruel and unusual punishment. I shout at them and call them names and argue eloquently and tell that I was an Eskimo for 1 1/2 years and then a white woman. So I can understand both sides. Later I am lecturing the Eskimos' parents to take better care of the babies.
