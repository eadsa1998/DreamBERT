There was a carnival out in the country. I was standing by a shooting gallery which was managed by two men. They asked me to try my luck. I smilingly replied, "Oh no, not me." They coaxed me jokingly, but I refused. they then jumped down from the gallery and chased me. I turned around quickly and grabbed each by his thumb exerting pressure on the digit. I led the two men around like bulls by the nose until I saw a policeman to whom I gave custody of the men. I jokingly retorted, "You boys won't be in jail long. Probably for the night -- anyways the rest will do you good." Ironically I said, "They have nice soft beds there. See you again next year boys, when the carnival comes this way?" "Oh no you won't," they replied.
