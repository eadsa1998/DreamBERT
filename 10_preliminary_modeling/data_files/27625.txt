I dreamed that I went to a dance with a group of exceptionally beautiful girls. They were all beautifully dressed, but I had one, a gown that was just a little more beautiful than theirs. We went out on to the dance floor and the handsomest fellow in the stagline asked me to dance with him. He completely ignored my beautiful girl friends.
