I was watching a filming with Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt.  The director asked Helen for more emotions.  They were in a haunted house.  There was a mirror in a hall, in front of one wall.  Helen stopped and looked at it.  She was able to walk through.  As she passed through the invisible passage, only her irises and pupils were visible.  Liquid invisibility shimmered.  She called Paul in too.  It was the bathroom.  I went in.  On the steamed mirror appeared the words, "Go away."  Paul typed back over the toilet asking for specificity.  What exactly did it want us away from?  Jargon appeared and we scampered out of there in fear.
