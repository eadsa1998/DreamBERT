I don't remember much.  My friend from the dorms Peter was there, and my roommate Sally.  God spoke to me, and explained to me that I was to give up milk.  I think I cried, sad about the sacrifice God wanted me to make.  My boyfriend Jeremy came to visit, and I was grateful.  We were lying down somewhere and I was compelled toward sex.  He got up to join some people in work, and I got up too.  I had my stuffed animals with me, including Rosebud, the gorilla Jeremy gave me on our first month anniversary.  I don't think I was completely healthy- I was treated like one of the other patients, as it was a mental hospital.  I was holding a nearly empty bottle of water by the mouth of the bottle between my teeth, and I was swinging it back and forth in a trance.    Someone warned me of injury and directed me to take it from my mouth.  I told him that it was the only way of drinking and took another almost empty bottle.  He passed.  I went down a hallway with bumps in the floor. I found my psych teacher at the end.  I did not want to be considered, mental, but I wanted someone to talk to since I still don't feel right.
