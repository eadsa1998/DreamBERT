A group of friends which includes X. and Y. (a married couple), and I are standing around in my living room. There is a pause in the conversation and Y. says, "Everybody! X. has an announcement to make." All eyes turn to X. After hesitating for a second, X. blurts out, "Y. and I are going to have a baby!" I am surprised by the announcement and exclaim, "Oh, I am so happy for you!" I turn to Y., who happens to be standing next to me, and give her a big hug. "This is great news", I say to her and X., but actually I have very mixed feelings. I am concerned that I will be spending less time with my friends and drifting apart from them.
