I was in my living room, at my parents' house, only it wasn't our real house; it was the house of my best friend from high school. I walked into the kitchen to get a drink of water. The water was in an odd dispenser that looked more like a transparent plastic dish. I drank a little, when I realized that the water had LSD in it. I thought that was cool, so I was going to drink the rest of it, but then decided not to when I remembered that I was home for the holidays and my relatives would be there. I walked back into the living room where my younger brother was. Apparently, he also knew about the water. What stuck out, though, was that my old dog was lying on the couch partially rolled over. She looked at me, but was expressionless. This felt very odd since she died almost 19 years ago. I laid down next to her and gave her a kiss on the cheek, and then stood up again. At that time, my dad opened the door and came in. He had just gone to the airport to pick up some family. My older brother walked in and walked over to me. We embraced and exchanged kisses on the cheek. Then my grandmother walked in, which struck me because she also died 10 years ago.
