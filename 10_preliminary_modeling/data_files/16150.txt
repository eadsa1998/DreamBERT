Dad took me to the radio station where I'm going to intern and just kind of set me loose to explore around. And I came to this big foyer area that had a white floor and a big huge Christmas tree, and there were carolers sitting and this elderly woman who was directing them, kind of like Barbara. And I went over to her and I talked to her, and she was this really high soprano that could hit this high B-flat, and she couldn't understand why I couldn't. And so I told her that, I told her to tell Mom and Dad to meet at the big Christmas tree at 7:00 o'clock. And then she kind of led us on this tour thing, and we went into this other foyer that had carpeting and there were like boxes and stuff all piled all over everywhere. And she watched me go into this other little room where I had to climb over boxes to get to her, and there was like a broadcast booth and I sat there in the back. And it turned out that this is Melinda's car and it's not a transmitter, but a receiver in there. [laugh] And Melinda's car drives away and drives back home. [laugh] And Dad says, "She was sitting over there till we got there." Then I had this subordinate dream that my watch said 7:48 in the morning when I was supposed to have been out the door at 7:00, and Bobby's clock said 2:00 in the morning, and I couldn't read the time on mine. And I went clear to the microwave and the microwave said 2:00 in the morning. That was weird; I didn't know exactly what time it was.
