 I'm in a garage with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and others. It seems like the television show the Wonder Years. A black man and woman are there. They argue about when and where he can touch her. My friend Kevin Simpson may be there. A killing man is coming. I look for ways out of the garage. I try to slide under a garage door. There is snow there, and it is a tight fit. The killing man arrives. He looks like my friend Hank Anderson's friend Ryan. I don't try to run. I have a skateboard deck as a weapon. My classmate Erica Fronz is with Ryan, or Ryan may become Erica. I hit him with the skateboard deck as he approaches. Erica Fronz is there. I hold her easily, and defeat them.
