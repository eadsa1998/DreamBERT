A crowd of people want to get the best seats and rush forward. I want to be one of them, but hesitate. They go up a lot of stairs and sit way up high in a balcony near the stairs. I realize I'm glad I didn't join them. The stairs would have been hard. I leisurely go up a few stairs until I get an adequate, only slightly blocked view. I start to sit on a "pew" but notice a purse. I choose the next lower "bench" as it is empty and I don't want to share the space with anyone. I have to bend my head some to be able to see clearly.
