I was sleeping in a dormitory with two patients in beds next to me. A patient holding a knife came and said he saw them having a sex affair. He attacked them saying they'd "get this, now." The patient with the knife resembled a patient on a former ward whom I had seen having sex affairs with other patients. His name is Carpenter.)
