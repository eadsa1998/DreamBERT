I had center coverage at 1:30 in the morning. The phone rang. It was Claire K, a client, then she changed to Ernie. He was threatening me. He was going to kill me. He was standing outside my locked door. I could see his feet through the crack at the bottom of the door. I quietly picked up the phone to call the police. The line was busy (twice).
