I was out with Ed O'Neill. I was going out with his son. He took us to a movie, but first took me to the place to buy food and stuff. We got alcohol, snacks etc. This lady asked "who's this?" and he said "my date". She asked me "how old are you? 27?" and I said "19" and she said "and he's 50?!". I laughed and said "I'm with his son". We didn't make the movie on time.
