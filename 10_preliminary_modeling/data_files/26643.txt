 I'm with my mom, other family members, and people from a different family. I see a snake come out of a rock-like area where a sleeping bag is. I point it out. People are frightened. I grab my camera and run to try to get a photograph of it. It's about 30 feet long, white and black in color, and really thick. I follow it and take a photograph. Several people are carrying the snake, a couple meters apart. I take a photograph of them carrying it. The group I'm with is going to my friend Hank Anderson's grandpa's cabin. We're in Fishville now; my mom has driven this far. It's getting dark. I'm full of energy and want to go. I say I'll drive. Another family is in a vehicle following us. We leave a park-like area after adjusting the loads and the passengers in the vehicles. Initially I have trouble driving: I can't find the brake pedal. I'm not used to driving in the United States. I say it's less than an hour to get there, and I try to remember the exact route to take.
