Today is my graduation. Last night I had this very, this dream. It wasn't really that scary, but it probably was supposed to be, I don't know. It might have been set off by Dracula or it might have been set off by being with Sandra and Lee who are Christians. I don't know what it was, but I dreamt there was this really awful like monster's den, but what it was is you would go down this river, and if the current would pull you the wrong way, you would get down this tributary that after a while, once you got down further and further, it would be, there would be more and more monsters trying to get at you. And they would all be surrounding you and they would all be moving in for the kill, and there was no way that you would survive that. And the worst part was, after you died, just like in Dracula, you would become undead and you would become one of them. And I had my little subdreams. I like dreamt that I was awake, and then when I wasn't like awake, I dreamt that I was like involved in that. And I would always like wake up every time and be like in the first level of dream before it would really be like not real. And I dreamt that I like read in the newspaper that there was one way to get out of that, that was to ask Jesus for forgiveness and suddenly you would just be out of that river and back like on some sidewalk. And I don't remember too much more. I know there was a lot more, but, of course, I put off putting this on here.
