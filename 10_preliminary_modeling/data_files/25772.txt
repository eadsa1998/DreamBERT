 I'm in the back yard at home. I have a pistol with three bullets and three chambers in the gun. George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld, from the television show Seinfeld, are there. I pull the trigger and the gun goes "click": It won't fire. I unload and reload the gun. I keep pulling the trigger, sometimes with two of the three bullets in different positions: "click", no shot. We see the northern lights. I realize the lights are actually many big planes above. I think it is a crop duster leaving trails. I get my parents, who are inside cooking dinner. The planes are very low and are in a very neat flying pattern. One plane shines a light down in our back yard. I am in the illuminated spot at first, and then I run out of the spotlight. It is like a light from an alien spaceship. An object drops from a plane. I know it is a bomb. I run and hide next to the red brick wall separating my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard and the adjacent house. I crouch down and cover myself. There are many atomic bombs dropping all over. One bomb lands in the back yard of the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue. I am running by when it hits. Everything is destroyed, including me. I see the bomb's energy raze the area. Dirt lifts up into the air from the impact, like sawdust bouncing on a workbench when a hammer is pounding the bench.
