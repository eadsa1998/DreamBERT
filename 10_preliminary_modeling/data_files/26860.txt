 I'm with my friend Emerald Reinhold and others. I persuade Emerald to let me cut a piece of flesh from her stomach, where a scar or cut is. This may be for fish bait. She has a long scar on her leg. I take a photograph of my uncle Rusty Redding, cousin Melvin Redding, Emerald, and my sister Ramona by pulling a string, which sets off a timer.
