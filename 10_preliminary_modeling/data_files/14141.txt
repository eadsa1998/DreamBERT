I went to Granny's old house for something. Nana, Poppa, Uncle Wilbur, Dad and Ezra were there. Later, Elijah was there too. I was telling a story to someone about how Dad and I had gone there and this guy from "208" (a TV show) was there. Someone was playing a video game on the TV. Elijah got bored and left. He actually went to a place to see if his computer was fixed. We were going to see a dead relative and someone thought my clothes weren't formal enough. There was a blue car and then someone and I were climbing in stuff in water.
