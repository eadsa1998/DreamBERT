I was playing Runescape. I was in a field and I had to go through this gate and there was a monkey or something at the top and I didn't want to pay to get through so I just walked through and it was throwing stuff at me, which hit for quite a bit of health. I went to a shop and I was with Mom. I wanted to get a game but they only had ones I didn't want.
