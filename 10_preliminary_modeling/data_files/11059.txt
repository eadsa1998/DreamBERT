Ray and I were driving along at a pretty good speed. We were in the back seat dressed in our ordinary clothes and seemed to be on our honeymoon. I told Ray I was afraid because the car was going too fast. He said, "Don't be silly," and we came to a bridge--the countryside was rustic and pretty--a little wood bridge and didn't make the corner and went off into the water, which was quite deep. We got out and I saw myself fluttering upward through the water, but Ray was staying to look for a valuable dress dummy we had with us and not finding, came to the surface only to see the dummy pop out of the water. But I was nowhere in sight. I felt alarm at seeing the dummy, not myself, pop out. The alarm rang. I feel the dream unfinished.
