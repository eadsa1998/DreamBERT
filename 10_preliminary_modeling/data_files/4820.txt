["Blind man and the baby."] I am in my van. I am moving with my "partner" a blind man, and the four children. He is out of the van with three small children and I am in the van holding a baby on my shoulder. I can't get out. And the blind man is crouched on the ground trying to keep the children with him and know where they are. He needs help too. I look around for someone to ask to help. Some disinterested residents are nearby but they don't help. I feel a bit frustrated and annoyed. I try to get the lift to work so I can go help. The lift comes down crooked and I call out for them to help me. They walk slowly and are not helpful. I am angry now. I tell them how to fix the lift when they say they can't do it. I finally get out of the van. What a frustrating day.
