Walking with Father Andrew, hand in hand, talking of Faith and Poetry; a young woman objects to his quoting Matthew Arnold's poetry; So we make a U-turn in order to get away from that woman. Father Andrew tries to distinguish between "good" and "bad" poetry. Then we drive through a MEDIEVAL TOWN with Gothic arches, painted ceilings, etc. We have to lie on our backs to look UP; there are many MIRRORS. I carry a heavy folder with my typed dreams, but a carbon paper slides out and a pencil falls on the floor... I awaken as I try to retrieve it.....
