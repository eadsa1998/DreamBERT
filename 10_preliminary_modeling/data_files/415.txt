I'm in the library, just arriving (later in the day - maybe back from lunch or a trip) - it's pretty busy, lots of people in - I notice Ramon checking out. I go into the back room and check who's there. We have a number of people helping us out because we're so shorthanded, people from other branches and downtown. Most are taking breaks, sitting on the floor against the wall - it's a long room, dark with only the oblique afternoon light coming from the wall of windows at the far end. Everybody's in that sort of half-shadow - not dark enough to not be able to see, but not light enough to see clearly. I count heads, and exchange a few words, making sure everybody's okay and we're covered on the desk. I don't want us to get exhausted, and it can be a near thing. I go on into the next room, where there's another workroom. I go back there and [lost - do some stuff, notice the clock, something's wrong with it, it's been moved or it's broken or both] - I have to go out front and check out. But VK's taken away the checkout stand! Why in the world would he do that? Didn't he realize we need it? I have to improvise - quickly I grab a nearby lectern, brown wood, not real sturdy, but it'll have to do. Now I have to gather up circ. forms and so on. In a couple of minutes I'm checking out okay, just making do, but later when I get time I'll have to get things better organized.
