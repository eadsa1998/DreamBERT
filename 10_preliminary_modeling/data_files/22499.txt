I dreamt I lived in something like a boarding house and that a boy from the university with whom I had never spoken also lived there. Being in the same bedroom with him, we talked with the greatest ease, as though we knew each other very well. Next day I waited for him to come soon, to see him and continue to talk to him. That was all.
