I am in a classroom that is filled with a lot of noisy children. I had never taught a class by myself before, and today I had my chance. The teacher was ill and Mrs. A-- was coming to observe my class. I had no lesson prepared, but I completely controlled the class. I said exactly the right things at the right time. The children were spellbound by my manner. Mrs. A-- thought I was the best teacher in her whole class and gave me "A" in my lesson.
