 I'm chasing my shadow. I'm conscious of being after my Jungian shadow, not my physical shadow. I'm pursuing and confronting something that I know is part of me. It occurs to me that parts of me that I know to be my shadow may actually be the 'light' parts: the desirable parts of my personality, while the persona, the parts with which I am familiar, may actually be my true shadow.
