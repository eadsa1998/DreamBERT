I was at home. Nana, Dad and others were there. Santiago told me to move the exercise bike into the games room. There were different groups of females. They were allowed to request one thing each for some competition thing. One of groups was black women. This other group had this pretty girl in it and she wanted this cream and I was like "Why don't you just get food instead?". I was out the back. Leslie was knocking on the door. I had been looking after her kids, but I'd forgotten all about them. Nana thought something I don't remember was bad for young kids. Dad was making my lunch for school, but we only had bread with sultanas in it. I asked if any shops were open and the only one was called Copenhagen. We went there. We were outside and Nana saw a competition where you jump up and hit this part of a poster and if you hit all of them, you could win trips to different places. She won a trip to this theme park. Dad and I were waiting for her to finish there. On the TV it showed her going down a waterslide. Then these people wanted to interview us (we had all gone now). They were setting up video cameras in this shop. We were lined up, so Ezra was at one end, then someone, someone else, Trevor Fehrman, Dad and then me. I complained about the order and Dad said to go next to Ezra and I said "No, I'd rather be next to Elias here" and pointed to Trevor. They were asking Dad questions and pulled him away from the shop. We went to follow them but they told us to stay. The interviewer kept pulling people away and then it was just Trevor and I. He said "That was a tidal wave" which was a reference to an earlier joke. I laughed. There were boxes for Sims 3 and we were arguing about it and the people were filming our argument.
