I was on a boat in the ocean with an old man and maybe a boy or girl around my age. The sea was a bit rough and wavy. I remember we landed on a beach or an island that looked deserted. Then I remember it turned dark and we were all on the beach. In the dream I knew these people, but in real life I had no connection with them at all. I remember the beach being very small, and as we looked out into the sea, I saw a very ferocious whale. I was not afraid of it though. It might have been a sperm whale. Then I recall going into a lighthouse with the child my age. It was a very odd lighthouse with many long windy stair cases. The last thing I remember is that there was a head (I think I was male) and it was in a case and as you turned a sharp object pierced the heat. I was very disgusted, but not as much frightened. Then I left the lighthouse. I just recently (a week ago) remembered the dream.
