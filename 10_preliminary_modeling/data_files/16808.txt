A man and a woman were standing outside of a van. The man was decapitating a mannequin. He told the woman, "This is what is going to happen to you." He stabbed the mannequin in the heart and the mannequin bled. He then proceeded to kill the woman. These old people at a park across the street were playing golf. They witnessed the blood scene then and stealthily left. I was observing from a distance like I was watching a movie or something. I was angry at first that the old people had just left and made no attempt to help the woman. A man's voice (who was my companion) said, "Well, what do you expect them to do?" I thought about it and agreed that there wasn't much they could've done and it was right for them to save themselves. I was hoping that they would have the decency to report what they had seen to the police.
