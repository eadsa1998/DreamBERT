I woke up and went on my computer and realized it was late and we weren't at school. I called out to Ezra to ask why we weren't at school. Then I realized it was Sunday [not really]. I was glad about this. The internet wasn't working and I kept resetting it. I found four more episodes of season 3 of Supernatural, but they were classified as season 4. I had another download going and it had 9mb left. I finally got the net working.
