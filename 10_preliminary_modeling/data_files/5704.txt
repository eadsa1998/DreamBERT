I had a dream of a friend of my father's whose been very kind to me since my father died, I'll call him Jim [not his real name]. In the dream I was laying in bed, I was with Jim, he had his arms around me, and he kept saying, "Oh, its so good to have you back in my arms again." That's all that he kept saying. It was funny, because it wasn't a sexual dream, it was more a comfort dream, it was comforting to be with him and the senses I used were three of course; hearing, I could hear him talking to me, touch, I could feel his arms around me, and the mattress and the bedding, and smell, I could smell his cologne. It was not sexual, it was comfortable, peaceful, I enjoyed being with him.
