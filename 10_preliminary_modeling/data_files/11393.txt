I was playing football with a group of young men mostly my own age. The person playing full back, however, was my father. We were all dressed in old shirts and trousers. We began to line up for a defensive play and I was playing right half-back alongside my father. As we lined up, I had just stooped over when my father reached over and slapped me on the back and said slash in there, slash in like hell. There seemed to be much excitement all around.
