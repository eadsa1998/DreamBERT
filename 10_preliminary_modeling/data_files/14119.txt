This guy had a picture of himself in a red room. He was in a hotel. He didn't remember anything that happened before the photo, which was recent. He went to a car yard and it asked how many years he'd been playing 'Pokey' and he said eight years because he could get a free car (for lease). It was a scabby car though. The guy worked there was gay and they became friends. He had an argument with his boss and the guy let him stay with him. He was getting changed and the gay guy had no shirt on and the straight guy had no clothes, so put on a pink shirt of the gay guy's. This girl (who was a love interest) came up and saw them and thought there was something going on (jokingly) and walked out. She thought it was funny. He was driving with her and was looking somewhere and drove off the bridge. He was trying to get her out of the car and he ended up dying and she was ok.
