 I feel my front teeth touching each other. There is a tension like a strand of yarn is attached to each tooth, stuck on a prickly part of the tooth. I open my mouth, knowing my teeth are fragile. My front, top tooth on the left side cracks and crumbles. It continues to crack until it has completely fallen out of my mouth, in bits. I'm in Australia with a month left to live here. I think about dental work here, since I have a big gaping hole in my smile. I hold the pieces of the tooth in my hand. I know I have been lacking calcium. I think about photographs, and having a toothless grin: how awful it would look.
