The dream is about a play that I was watching. In the first act it involves a girl and a guy. This play was like part of a class I was going to, more than going to a theater and watching a play. Exactly what the play was about, I don't know. The first act between the fellow and the girl, the fellow was supposed to be very good, and it turned out that the girl was doing a lot more believable job than the guy. The audience was heard to comment that she's a lot better and just how disappointing he was. Then it switched to a second act and these three kids, they were three boys, I guess, an age group of 8 and 9, somewhere around there. It was supposed to be night time. They were night creatures, sort of, and things that go around scaring people, and it became very distorted because this one fellow was making really weird faces. I mean, his whole face was changing. Of course, everybody was laughing at him. This was as far as the play was carried in my dream.
