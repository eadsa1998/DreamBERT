It is Halloween. I have a hard time getting my kids to sleep. Now we are trying to sleep and there is a disturbance outside of a neighbor's house. Some kids about 12 years old are bothering some turkeys out there. I see the turkeys are vomiting blood. I go out and demand to know what they did. I am carrying a sharp knife but I don't use it. Some younger kids give me names and say what they did. They fed soap to the turkeys. The turkeys are gone now, behind my house. The kids who did it are Tina Turner and David Cunan. (These names mean nothing to me). A woman picks up one of the kids in a car. I tell the younger kids they can't come in my house. They have to wait outside. I am very angry. I will call the police. The phone rings and it is a mother wanting to know what I plan to do. I say I will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law because of the poor turkeys. It is difficult to talk because I am so angry. I can't breathe.
