Ann and I stopped on E. 55th St. and Superior and there was a couple getting married. Pauline H., a friend of mine, was taking care of or was getting married. There was a young couple in a car. They had big hook noses. They looked like brother and sister, but they were man and wife. A fellow was joking how he looked like a pig, but people should look how they look before they ridicule others.
