I'm at an office. Marv C and I are very attracted to each other, sexually. He moves toward me, trying to get me to kiss him. I want to, but he's married and so I choose not to get involved with him. He keeps following me and cuddling up. I'd be tempted but then I'd see his wife or think she's there. He kisses me sweetly with great sexual need and I feel a powerful surge of desire and I can't fight it any more, so I respond and we make love. It's wonderful.
