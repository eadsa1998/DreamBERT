[1997-06-07] My dad had passed away a few years ago and this was the anniversary of his death. I dreamed that he spoke to me, I did not touch him. I was lying in bed and my father spoke in his quiet, somewhat gravely voice and just told me to keep doing my best in things and to keep watching out over my family and things to make sure things were going all right because he could only look from afar.
