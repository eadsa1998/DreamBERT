Dovre, Ellie, and I are trying to find a way through to a road. It is the way to my job interview. I try several side streets but they don't go through. I backtrack and find W's house. Only the XXX's live there. I ask directions of the man. Then I decide I need to change my clothes so I'll be better dressed for the interview. I put on a blouse and a skirt. Then Dovre says, "Look," and I notice that when I stand up, you can see through the skirt. In fact, my legs look real muscular and cute, with a bruise on the right side of the knee. I think about putting on an underslip.
