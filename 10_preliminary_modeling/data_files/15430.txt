I had work, but before that I went to the movies or something with some girl friends. I ended up a little late. My pants were ripped at the crotch, so I changed them. I then realized I had no shoes and it was now 5.40pm. I told Isaak and he went to the shops nearby to get some. I said I was a 10.5 in men's. He got work shoes though and I said "I'm an 8 in those!". They were way too big. Chicken Treat was different, by the way. I helped a little without going out the back. I still got paid for it, but I wanted to go home.
