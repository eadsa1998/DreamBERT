I was technically in the dream -- The dream was watching Kirk race around the house getting ready to leave. He was in a hurry but he kept stopping to do eccentric things (for someone in a hurry), like organizing his room, making tea. The weird thing is that I was seeing through his eyes the whole dream -- as if I was him. He finally got out the door and to where he was going -- band practice. He kept apologizing for being late.
