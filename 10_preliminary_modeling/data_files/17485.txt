I was going down a few ramps in a parking lot.  I stopped and asked my longtime classmate Rina Gupta if she wanted a ride.  I overheard someone say something about a bus connection to the street near the house.  It was not necessary to take the same bus all the time.  I went into the store and ran into my 7th grade science teacher.  I tried talking to him but he didn't say much.  I talked about working at the observatory.  My mother showed up.  We were supposed to return the cheese she bought for my boyfriend Jeremy.  My mother sent me to the car with meatloaf and my brother Stuart's kittens, which were much bigger.  The car was not in the parking area.  I walked in a rainy drab run-down construction area, stepping over pipes and things, and cutting through a shopping area- a video store.  The roof was smoking.  The store next door set it on fire.  As I went up the stairs to the back door, I listened to the music.  Something about Mercy, faith, and love.  I thought it was an odd song.  Someone apologized for the ___ Morro song.  The song on the radio I woke up to played the same melody as the song in my dream.
