I was at some weird place. These people decided they had to kill Calvin off and they shot him in the back of the head. But he didn't die and he ran away. There was no water around as it was rare. But, there were these (what I called) 'tribunals' to pump water from some place (which I thought I had taken from Kin-Dza-Dza). Ms Quintana gave me drops for my nose/eye. The liquid from the drops goes down your throat. I went to find Calvin. I was outside some shops and I ran away from people. There was this trail somewhere and I found Elijah, Seamus, Dmitri and Daryl. Someone had a fight.
