Granny had a house by herself and I was there. It was really hot. She gave me a muffin but it was too hot, and she told me to wrap it up and put it on the toilet. She went to bed. I walked out of the kitchen and Alec Baldwin was there. He was friends with Granny. I text Dad saying there was a Baldwin here.
