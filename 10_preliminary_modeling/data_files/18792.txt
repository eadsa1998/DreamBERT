I was taking a nap at home and was awoken by my little brother who was in the next room and he had a sword and he was dueling with somebody inside the bedroom as he was standing in the hall, and apparently he had said, "Tushay" or something and my sister who was in the room at that time jumped up off the chair and said, "I'm going to have to look up that word." So she ran out of the room and I went back to sleep. This is all a dream.
