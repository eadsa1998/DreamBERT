I was in BR. I seemed to be walking toward some of the shops, though I was weaving my way behind them. There wasn't much space, quite a few trees, and it wasn't a straight path. It almost seems as though I am surrounded by buildings, in a very small, oddly-shaped space. There were also a few mannequins in this space, making it difficult to get through at all. Another woman walks up and says something to me. I look at her, smile, respond, and continue making my way to the street in front of the shops. I am in a larger open area, with quite a few young trees. Michele is planning to hold a birthday party there and is talking to me about where to set things up. She points to the trunk of a tree that had been chopped down and said she could sit the cake there. To the left of the trunk there were some large roots protruding above the ground. She said the person she was having the party for could sit on those roots. I am in a small room with Matthew and Chris H. They were roommates and a third roommate had recently moved out. Chris H was not happy with his study space. He had a fairly large, U-shaped desk and credenza. When sitting in his chair facing the bottom of the U, his back was to a window. He also had just enough room to get behind the desk. I reminded them that they had set it up this way to make room for their third roommate. Now that he had left, there was room to reposition the furniture so it would be more comfortable.  I suggested they move the desk and credenza ninety degrees to the right. That way Chris H would have much more room to walk to sit at the desk and he could enjoy the sunlight from two positions. They agreed that was a good idea and decided to do that.
