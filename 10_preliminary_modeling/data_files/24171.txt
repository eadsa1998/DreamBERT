The only dream I can vaguely remember was one involving a lot of friends from Highschool. All I can remember it was action-oriented. I can't remember exactly who was in it and what they were doing. The setting was rural, but may have either been my small hometown or Santa Cruz or both. Neither pleasant nor unpleasant.
