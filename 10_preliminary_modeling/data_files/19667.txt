A boy about 8 or 9 years old throws a stone, apparently at street lamp. I explain to him that these lights are expensive and that he must not throw at them. He replies that he was throwing at a bird, not at the light. He has a wonderful throwing motion, and is extremely accurate. I suggest that we have a throwing contest, which pleases the boy, who is eager to display his ability. The parking in center of street is bare (no grass or shrubs) but there are a good many small stones lying about. I search for some stones suitable for throwing, but all I can find are either too small and irregular in shape, or they are entirely too large and heavy. Another difficulty is the absence of a target, though I finally decide that a large stone about 100 feet farther along in the parkway will answer.
