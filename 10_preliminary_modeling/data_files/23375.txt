Classroom situation (looks like my old elementary school), but it's more of a college class. Several adults including myself in wooden chairs waiting for teacher. My supervisor from work, Lynne, comes in. She's the teacher, and announces a test on the book Treasure Island. (We are all disgruntled.) I protest. Getting haughty. I say the book is boring. She flashes back "It's not like you're paying that much attention." Alluding to my current lackadaisical, somewhat tired approach to work lately. I feel embarrassed and angry. However, somewhere in this dream, I don't remember at what point, someone is surprised at my interest and knowledge in great literature. I say jokingly, "Well not only do I watch PBS, but I also read extensively."
