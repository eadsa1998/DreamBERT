 I'm eating dinner with my uncle Rusty Redding and his family. We're nearly finished. I clear off some plates, including my aunt Sheila's, which still has food on it. I scrape off the plate, and scrape the last part into a big bag or bin. Rusty says that this bin full of scraps and leftovers will be cooked and reused as a dessert. As I leave with others, a try of dessert cookie-like items is presented to us. We take some. It's raining when we leave. We turn around because we forgot to drop off, or do something with my cousin Rich Redding. The family is playing basketball inside when we get back.
