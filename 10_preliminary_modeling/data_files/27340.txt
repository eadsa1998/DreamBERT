I dreamed I was with a strange fellow climbing up steep steps to get to a seat in a theater. I saw two friends of my mother's. These women (about 50 yrs. old) were made up quite extremely &amp; I felt a great distaste for them. For some reason or other the curtain was half up. I could see an actor In a red room climb into a coffin. Although I realized it was only a stage setting, I felt frightened &amp; turned to my companion for assurance. We left almost at once as if the play were over. We walked down many, many stairs which were covered all the way down with an awning of green stripes. When we got outside we could look back &amp; see the different landings of the steps covered with one huge awning. Each landing led to an exclusive night club. There were about 5 neon signs.
