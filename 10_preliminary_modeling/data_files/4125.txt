Lucy and I are on a swim team. It is competition time. I am swimming with strong clean strokes in a square around the four sides of the pool. I come in second or third, with Lucy, who didn't swim in the middle between me and the first place winner. Now I have been reconstructed and am able bodied. I am slim and wearing a red two piece suit and black high heels. Lucy and I are walking across a street toward a tavern area to socialize. No one will acknowledge me. Archie, with scraggly long hair, balding on top, won't give me eye contact. He walks past us, pausing to chat with Lucy. I walk back across the street, where I had been reconstructed. I walk slowly and stilted. There is a robot named Oscar that apparently had killed hundreds of people to get the parts needed to reconstruct me. There is a sense of fear. I am in danger. So are others. Then there is doubt. Maybe I was the one that killed them.
