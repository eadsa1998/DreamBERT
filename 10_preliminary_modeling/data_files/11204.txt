This dream seems to have taken place in a hotel ball room. It was graduation night, and my wife and I were celebrating by having our big night out. The room and people were very real and colorful. The one impression I had upon awakening was that everything seemed so real and alive. The women's formals I remember as bright red's, greens, and blues. The good was just as tasty as it is real, and I remember how satisfied I felt after we ate.
