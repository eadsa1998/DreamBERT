At the next table I hear someone say something about potato chips. I go over and pick up a chip to sample. She said, "That's not the one. Take this half size." I did. Later she brought the other chip. I ate both thinking it wouldn't hurt even if I shouldn't eat salt. ...Taking my clothes from the line to carry upstairs. ...In the hall I am directed to one of three empty seats but that is in the wrong direction for my good ear.
