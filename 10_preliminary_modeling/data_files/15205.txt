I was doing a quest on World of Warcraft. When I logged on I was underwater and this big thing started fighting me. I got down to 2000hp quickly but then I killed it. I had some other quests underwater and it spawned quickly and started coming over so I left the area. This guy who was an alien or something, came over to where I was. He shook my hand and I fell to the floor with an orgasm which lasted for a minute. I couldn't move. There was a Sporcle quiz on all the types of characters in Joss Whedon shows including demons, names of demons etc.
