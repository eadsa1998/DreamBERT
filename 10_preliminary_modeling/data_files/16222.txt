Sandra was here and I was telling her the story of we set up the keyboard on the kitchen counter, of all things, and it was white, the body was white and it was twice the size. I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, "Wow, girl!" And Dad was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the Performing Arts Center and Sandra and Dad wanted to go with us, but I guess they weren't ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I wasn't steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see Mom and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that Mom pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I didn't want Dad to know that I "drove" even though I didn't drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, "Nah," and I don't remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on. And then I woke up.
