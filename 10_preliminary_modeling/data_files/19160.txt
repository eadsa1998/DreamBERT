I dreamed I was riding my motorcycle. I was riding it down to the Grove. It was quite a long ride just for the sake of riding. I remember weaving down back streets. Once I even pulled in front of what looked like a Bell Telephone truck being driven by one of _______, and she was startled. I swerved, but it was alright. Then I stopped at this little house. The bike was out of gas. It was because I didn't have the gas turned on. So I turned on the gas and the bike ran alright. Then I went in this little house, and there was this girl that I knew a long time ago. She was one of my friends while I was ____________ and she was fixing breakfast for her husband, her new husband. She was divorced from my friend. He was in the bathroom getting dressed. It was early in the morning. I heard this thing that sounded like an electric razor. I said I couldn't use an electric razor, especially first thing in the morning, because it pulled the hairs out of my face. She said no, it wasn't an electric razor. It was one those hair massage vibrators, scalp vibrators. Then her husband came out, and I met her husband. That's it. Hall: Sam didn't know the husband of this girl. In fact, he doesn't know that she has a husband. She never got married again after she was divorced from her first husband who is a friend of Sam's. When the husband came out of the bathroom, he was wearing very peculiar-looking shorts. They looked like a slice of a soft boiled egg. That was all that he had on.
