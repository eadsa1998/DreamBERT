A few days ago, I watched a show called Rescue. There was a police officer who saved a grocery clerk from being killed in a hold-up. My goal in life is to be a successful police officer. During my dream, I was considered to be a brave cop and was always thought of as being gutsy. There was a situation where I was driving in my cruiser and was called to a scene where a man had a gun to a woman's head ready to kill her. I risked my life in trying to save her by going in the bar and trying to talk to him. I succeeded but sweated every moment. All that I remember was that the suspect threatened to kill me. When I woke up the next day, I started to question about becoming a police officer. A frightening dream.
