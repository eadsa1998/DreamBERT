 I'm in my Historical Geology class. It is the last day of class. The professor Greg Welters talks about rock units. There is a formula for measuring the thickness based on one measurement. Something in the formula is _. My friend Jill Banks is in the class. I sit in a corner. There is a metal shelf system that partially blocks Jill's view of me. My classmate Todd Murphy is there. Greg asks for any questions. My hand and arm are lying across my forehead, like I do when I fall asleep, but I don't have a question. Greg looks at me, but seems to know that my arm is up because it's comfortable for me, not because I have a question. I hoping he doesn't call on me. There are no questions. He then gets the test scores out. I get a 96 on the final, which is the top score! My upper teeth are pressing down on my bottom lip. I associate with Jill and Todd. I can't talk because of my lip and teeth. I feel like I am getting sick: I have a dry cough. But I think I'm not getting sick. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas in the hallway. <br/
