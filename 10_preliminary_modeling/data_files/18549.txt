I was looking for a Section 8 place and I didn't know where to begin. I had a list. It had Fountain Inn on there. Chuck's mother said she had stayed there when she was an alcoholic and in school full time, since Chuck wasn't around to take care of her. Another place was on Avenue C and parents in prison went there to re-acclimate themselves to the mountain family existence of upstate with lakes. Chuck's mother said when she was too drunk to take care of things and Chuck was too drunk to take care of her; she stayed at the residential home in Fountain Inn.
