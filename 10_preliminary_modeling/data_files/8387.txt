BJ, Matthew and some of his friends, and myself were all spending the night at my birth home. At first we were all going to be sleeping in the same room, what used to be the boys room. We had one large bed and someone had pulled chairs up alongside the bed so one more person could sleep across the chairs. The people who had been in what used to be the girls room were leaving so I was going to go sleep in there. BJ came in and was going to sleep in there as well.
