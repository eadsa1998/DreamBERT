I was with my dad and Uncle John. My uncle went up to my dad and punched him into the stomach. He felt it, I could see. My dad backed up, then walked up to my uncle and gave him a vicious punch into his stomach, then backed up. Now I could see they were going to fight. They started to walk towards each other, so I walked between them and stopped the fight. Later I was asleep. I got up and was going to go to the bathroom downstairs and I saw my dad sprawled on the stairway asleep. I was on the street and there was a piece of ice about 18 inches thick, about three feet wide and about ten feet long. It was frozen to the sidewalk. I got a long knife and cut thru the ice as though it was butter. I cut out round pieces that looked like barrels and then I ran the knife under the ice and loosened it from the sidewalk, then gave it a push and the ice slid on into the street and blocked it. I was driving my car and the traffic was quite complicated. I thought if I had my motor tuned up by Pontiac service or Esper's garage, it would run better than it does now. I threw a potato that was on fire. I had a tube from the gas tank that I carried to a filling station. It was a pipe like or supposed to be a gas tank. It was about two inches in diameter and had a balloon on one end like a gas tank about four inches in diameter and about 1 foot long. The overall of the pipe was about 4 ft. The gas station attendant put the gas nozzle on the pipe and filled it with gas.
