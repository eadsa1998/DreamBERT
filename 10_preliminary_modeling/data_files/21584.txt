Bob and I were on a farm in the country. It was muddy. We put on boots except I. We argued with a boy. I told him it was 8 miles to Charvat's farm from our house, which we thought it was. I was watching a farmer enjoy a little coke. He played and drank it a little at a time. I saw chick or chic as the first selection in the first race at Ascot. I saw dru away.
