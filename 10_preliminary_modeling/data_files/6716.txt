I had thrown myself on my bed when someone awoke me with a kiss. It was J. I asked the time. He said 12 o'clock. Then I must have slept a long time. "What day is it?" "Sunday." So I got up but could barely open my eyes. Went into the kitchen to get dinner. Mother was there and said she would get dinner, but he said he had already eaten. I asked mother why she came to help, when she usually didn't, just because J. came. When I knew it was Sunday I had said to myself that I was just too tired for church. I had to sleep.
