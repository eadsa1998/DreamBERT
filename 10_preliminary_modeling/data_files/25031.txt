 There are four bicycles outside of Mason Cafeteria on a trailer-type apparatus. They need to be moved. I keep walking to Franklin Hall, my dormitory. My friend Stephen Ramos and three other guys get the bikes. Tony Ramada takes one. He rides it and then does a ghost-rider, letting it crash into a semi-truck. The semi drives over it and it remains unscathed. <br/
