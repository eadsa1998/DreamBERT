I am on my mom's boat and we are sailing in the bay, but Richard isn't there. Only my mom is working the sails. I am standing on the bow and the waves keep hitting me in the face, and I can taste the salt water. My mom calls me to help her with the sails, but I don't know what I am doing. So then I go back to the bow and look around. The weird thing about my dream is that I never really saw my mom.
