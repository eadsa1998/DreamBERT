I was a student at some university.  Claudia Limmer asked me about what I was going to take the next semester.  I told her Christian Ethics, Probability Theory, and two others that I don't remember.  But in my heart I knew that I wouldn't come back, that I just didn't belong there and I wasn't even attending the classes I was in this semester.  After I talked to her I went to a class that I was unprepared for.  The teacher was a young woman with a long, narrow nose and a saffron robe like a monk.  Later on, I was in a room when a large group of women who looked similar and wore similar robes-Buddhist nuns.  I said that one of them had been my teacher, but all denied it.  They were going to perform some kind of experiment on me, and one of them put a cloth (but more like a soft Brillo pad) soaked in ether over my nose.  I knew that it was pointless to try to struggle, but I held my breath a long time, to make them think it wasn't doing any good and perhaps give up.  But they were persistent.  Fran Nguyen kissed me, and I told her that if she would do it again, I would breathe so that I would fall asleep.
