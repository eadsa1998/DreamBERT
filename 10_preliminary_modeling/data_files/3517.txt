Fred Astaire is married to another woman. But it isn't working out. I like him and am trying to encourage him to break from old patterns. He is shy and used to routine. There are a bunch of teens he is trying to teach. They are surly and unruly. I am going to go to the opera with Fred, and as we walk down a hall, I hug him, leaning him up against the wall and cuddling. He feels a bit strange and doesn't respond, although he likes it. He is after all still married to the other wife even though he doesn't love her any more. Now we're in the auditorium. He's being loving and trying to encourage the teens. Women are talking about me behind my back. I interrupt them and try to involve them in some sort of gesture game. They start to like me a bit more. Off in the distance, the actors are singing away. Now it's a sort of prison and the guards are after the teens and Fred. I call him Freddie. I sneak into a room where I see Freddie's things arranged like at an altar, only it's at a small sink,  few metal round things and some seashells. I decide to put a few of these things down the garbage disposal, realizing he'll probably be upset with me, but somehow this will be more safe for him if I get rid of these things. Only I realize that metal things in a garbage disposal are noisy and will not stop being ground up so it will call attention to the room. I feel a bit stupid. I should have realized that before I plopped them in.
