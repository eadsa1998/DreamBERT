This was rather a disconnected dream, and I'm sure there was more to it than I can remember. However, it took place in a rather barren room, which was evidently my living quarters. I had captured a tiger (!) and kept it stuffed in a large chest. The tiger knew something which I wanted to know, so I told him I would free him if he would tell me. The tiger had the face of a man, and stood on his hind legs. The last I remember, we were in a telephone booth together making an important phone call.
