I don't remember it exactly, but I was at school, but it wasn't really my school, and there was this girl that I remembered but I don't know who it was. I remember standing in front of a bunch of people who asked me who I was and what I was doing, so I ran outside. There were a bunch of my friends outside, one of which was my friend who moved away a couple years ago. We were drawing all over these lockers and then we were writing notes. That's all I remember because then I woke up. It was not an unpleasant dream, but it wasn't really cool either.
