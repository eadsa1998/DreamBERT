I dreamt in black and white again. The dream was less vague than others. I was talking on the radio, my transmitter and was experimenting with it and the antenna. I was talking with two friends with whom I had talked yesterday on the radio and had made experiments with them. In short, the events of the previous night were repeated in my dream. I was a little bit afraid, I think, because I didn't want to spoil my radio set. Then I started to try to communicate with another friend with whom I had not spoken last night, and I had a great desire to speak with him, but couldn't. I think I dreamt this because of my intense desire to hear him. I became quite agitated in a given moment in my dream. All this took place in my room, which is also my radio room.
