[2nd dream] As I got out of the ricsha, a button came off the lap robe and I handed it to Dr. C. who pulled the ricsha to the side of the road just outside the gate. As we went in, he said, "I thought we might have a swim. We passed thru Uluniu and then Outrigger for I now belong to that club. Dr. C. asks for the Waikiki room and is told it hasn't yet been cleaned. Very few on the beach but I can go to my dressing stall and sign for Coales as my guests. A woman brings me a board on. I do and ask where to sign for my guests. I have trouble getting into the pants of my two-piece suit, finish after leaving stall. I haven't my dark swimming glasses with me and the light hurts my eyes.
