I had a dream that I met a whole bunch of celebrities. I was waiting at my bus stop, and a car pulled up with Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise, and Christian Slater in it. They started talking to me, and they were really nice. They all gave me their autographs, and told me what it was like to be a celebrity. But then my alarm woke me up from this dream, and I had to go to school.
