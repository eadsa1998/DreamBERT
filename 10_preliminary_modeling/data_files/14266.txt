I was in a room, and there was a garden like setting behind a glass wall. Two people were in there because were zombie like. Calvin was telling me about Quarantine and I said you should watch [Rec] because it was probably heaps better [watched it last night, but haven't seen Quarantine] and because Jennifer Carpenter can't act etc. Eugene and his father Abraham were there. Mom had been going out with him. I thought it was strange that they did because Eugene and I were going out. The house was like Mom's. I went out to the lounge and his father was in the kitchen. We joked around for a few minutes. We then had to move the zombies and Calvin was the only person with the code for the door. He didn't want to put it in, but did. He told the zombies to watch [Rec]. The zombies switched between zombies and people, and they were more people like at the moment. Calvin had been bitten, I think. I was then in the dining room and my tooth hurt. I played around with it and then it came out. This other one was loose too and I pulled that and it hurt and was still attached by a string like thing. I grabbed the string and pulled it out, which also hurt. I put them on a tissue and showed Mom. I said that I thought I'd lost all my teeth and she said we'd go to the dentist soon and mentioned that people are always so scared of dentists.
