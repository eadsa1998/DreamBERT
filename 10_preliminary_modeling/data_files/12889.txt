Eugene was sitting next to me. He was talking to someone and laughing. I think I was involved in the conversation too and I was looking at his hair and I wanted to touch it. I went to this lady's house with Mom and Ezra. She was rich and had this nice house. She gave us food. I was trying to work out what food I could eat because of my diet. We were hiding from someone. I was then at home and someone kept coming to the door trying to find me and I was pretending that I wasn't there.
