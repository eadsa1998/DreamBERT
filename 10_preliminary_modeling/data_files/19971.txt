I was repairing something. Later I was going to a printing plant to apply for work. A man was at the railroad station who looked like he was very experienced at traveling. I missed the train, because I couldn't find the platform. I walked on the tracks, and passed some lizards who were eating each other up. One that looked as though it were eating another lizard was actually eating itself. I came to the plant, but I didn't apply, because it was only bindery help that they wanted. My mother was working there. I was clad in trousers and an undershirt. I passed a sandlot and became very nostalgic, because I was reminded of some event of the past.
