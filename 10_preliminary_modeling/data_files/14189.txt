Ezra was playing on the Wii. I wanted to play Bully, so he said he'd save his game and let me on in a minute. When I did start playing, it was different. I had to find a date for a dance. I was looking at the girls to find a pretty one. One of his enemies was annoying a nerd, so I chose to beat him up and let the nerd go to the toilet. I was helping others out. The bad guy complained and said he came from a bad family. He decided to fake something so the bad guy didn't have to do something. I had to go to the toilet (in real life too).
