I saw that there was lots of blood on the pavement, and I picked up what had coagulated. Near what I saw there was a crashed motorcycle, next to the sidewalk. Without seeing the person who had had the accident, I awoke amazed and scared. Note: I told what I dreamed to an aunt and she told me that the dream meant death. In effect, that day my brother died in a plane crash.
