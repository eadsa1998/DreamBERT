There is a split in the church and I try to find out the details for Father Andrew. I show him a brochure, and a painting with yellows and greens, a landscape. He asks me to find out more details and to report back. Also remember saying goodbye to certain people from Church - kissing their hand as they leave and murmuring, "It was a privilege to know you." I wonder if I can say the same words to each person. ++ feeling.
