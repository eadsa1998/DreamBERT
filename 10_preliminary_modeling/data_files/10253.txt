We are at the Retreat Center in the dream: I am happy to be there; talk with people who were there last summer and tell me how hot it was; shift: I am making a FIRE in our fireplace; see the pink embers glowing. (vivid image) I hear Frank talking on the phone: "We have to be careful, my wife is here with me." When the woman, Brenda, a redhead, arrives, Frank assures me that we will all be doing things together and he denies what said on the phone. Later Frank and I and Brenda start out on a hike. (Brenda = no one I know nor resembles any of our friends.)
