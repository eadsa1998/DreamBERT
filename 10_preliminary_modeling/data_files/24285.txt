Dream back at home with me going to the movies, getting two tickets to a stupid new special ops themed jack black movie at consecutive times, returning a ticket, and feeling forlorn. How my mother got in trouble by owing $60,000 in garnished wages by hurting some other woman and getting a douche bag like Michael Milton to represent her and lost the case. And how I got upset. How I went home, and snuck in when someone else was living in the tall wood slat old house, and a stringy haired black girl like Savanna from high school was going inside to do something and I needed to change my clothes.
