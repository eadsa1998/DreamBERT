Something happened and Godzilla was real. He was different though. I went into this shop with a fortune teller lady to hide. He was after me. I was running through the shop aisles. He found me and I ran with others and hid under this log thing. He wanted this kid under there too. We were face to face with him and I was hoping he wouldn't kill us.
