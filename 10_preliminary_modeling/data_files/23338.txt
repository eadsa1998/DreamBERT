I dreamed that I was in an open boat on a sunny blue sea. I thought it was off Newport. A low and sandy shoreline was visible at a distance of a mile or more, and presently there shot up from it heavy gushes of smoke with jarring reports. I judged that a mortar battery was in action. After two or three discharges, I noted that I could follow the projectiles with my eye as they swept high in air and descended again. Suddenly I saw that one was coming my way. I had time to see that it was an old-fashioned spherical shot, when it landed on my head and I woke.
