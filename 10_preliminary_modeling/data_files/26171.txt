 I'm with my classmate Allie Crater and others in a trench with a fence on one side. We want to get over the trench. We talk about the classes that we had in high school that would prepare us for cellular/molecular biology in college. I say that I had no biology, but more importantly no physics! Allie acts a bit surprised: I get fleeting sympathy. We are on some train tracks or in or around a trail tunnel. A train is coming and we need to move. I hop out of the way. Allie and the others take longer to move. I encourage them to move, and they finally do. I'm in a room sitting on a bed. My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson is there, with others. She says to me that she won't stay over at my house on Saturday or Sunday. This is her way of saying she is going to restrain herself on these days and see how things look on Monday, in terms of our relationship.
