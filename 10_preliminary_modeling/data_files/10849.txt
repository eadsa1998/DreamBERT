This subject was on the second floor of a house, her own home, and she called her mother, but she was not there. Then she decided to go out and look for her mother. She went out the second floor window and floated down the roof of the house, and then started to walk, and the farther she walked, the more obscure the neighborhood became. She took a bus then, which went on past her the first time, but she took it on the way back and was the lone passenger. The bus was bright red. They drove down a steep hill, recognized a house and large lamp post in front of the house. The house was orange and she took out a key which fit when she tried to unlock the door. She then entered the house with a feeling of belonging there.
