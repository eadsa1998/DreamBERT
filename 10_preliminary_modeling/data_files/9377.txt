Dr. Brooke (thesis advisor) asks me to go to a night club called "Iowa Park" where they usually drink till 4 AM. I don't want to go but he said that he would not look at my paper otherwise. He even buys me a tiara! Shift: Mother is still alive (she died 4/13/47). She prevents me from going. She is jealous and she wants me to help her clean the house.
