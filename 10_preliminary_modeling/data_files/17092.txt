I guess it was in a hot tub.  A group of people came in, perhaps five guys and another girl I'd seen before.  Somehow the atmosphere was quite friendly.  Somehow the cutest guy there was next to me and my head was on his shoulder.  He was tan.  Then my brother Stuart, one of his friends and I huddled around the kitchen TV.  The cute boy was on TV, and I pointed, "He's the one I like," I said bashfully, not letting on anything else.
