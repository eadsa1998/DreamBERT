Matthew and a lot of his friends were at a social event, male and female. I went for some reason other than to attend the event. Lindsey H and Chris H are the two people there that I knew. Lindsey H said a couple of things to me that I found very odd, because they almost sounded flirtatious, as though he had a romantic interest in me, which is preposterous. But then someone else said something to me about him having a romantic interest in me. I didn't know what to do with that. I certainly didn't want to encourage it. I've always really liked Lindsey H. the way any mother really likes a friend of their child. They are having a party around a swimming pool. It's as though I'm in the background observing. I see them drinking. maybe take shots of something. then jumping into the pool. They know the water is going to be really cold so they let out a yell before they jump in. There are four or five jumping in at once. feet first. I'm disappointed to see them drinking, especially Lindsey H, and especially the ones that seem to be drinking too much. I'm talking to someone, I think, about how much I enjoy watching young people grow as people and mature through the high school and college years.
