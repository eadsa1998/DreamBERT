I come from the garden carrying a large twig of a Christmas Berry tree. See dark bunchy stuff as well as the red berries. See J. who lifts a brown, nude 2 year old boy down and we walk on together, he carrying the child. I ask, "Can't the big boy walk by himself?" He says, "Yes, he can" and puts the child down. I wonder, "Why is the child naked?" I won't have to go to the mainland if J. is there. Where is he staying? I didn't know he was coming. I'll have to have him in to eat.
