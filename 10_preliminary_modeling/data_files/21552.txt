There was a light on the sky. I was watching it. It was like a movie. It advertised Halle Brothers because Halle was on the light. Then it was like a map. It showed an island in the ocean right next to our continent, and it was blue. Then I was looking at an island from before. It was all rocky, no vegetation. There were a few trees or shrubs on it. There was a row of trees on the edge of the island. A real estate lady took us shopping for a home. She was taking us on the island for a lot. Ann kind of liked it, but I didn't care to buy on the rocky island. There was also a row of homes on the island's edge where the trees were. It was in the country.
