We were in this, a trip that we were in Iraq or Afghanistan or someplace like that. And we were at this park that had trees that were all painted by the people. The people painted churches and farms and trees and stuff all over these trees. And I was climbing on these trees, and there were these ducks and seagulls, and it seems nobody ever fed them because they were so hungry. And these pigeons were just so tame. One just sat on my shoulder the whole time until I could get him some bread. And there was this bird bread I was giving them and they were just all over me. And then I dreamt that we got back in the car and we went to this beach. I think Samantha, Sandra and Derek were there, but I'm not sure. I do remember, however, that I had to sing at this beach for some reason, and I was trying to figure out how was my voice going to be able to soar above the roar of the sea. [laugh] And I also remember I had a machine like they have at Memorial Stadium for editing in the car, and I was real quickly trying to edit some accompaniment. That was crazy, man. [laugh]
