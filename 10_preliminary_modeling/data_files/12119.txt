I was at home or somewhere. I was taking pictures and the camera had two pictures left, and I put them on the laptop, but then we didn't have it. I converted them. There was some hot guy. This crocodile ate these two old people and the hot guy. Then there was another hot guy. I had to share a room with Dad and Ezra.
