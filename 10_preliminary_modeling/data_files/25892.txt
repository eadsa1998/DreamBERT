 I'm at home with my mom, brother Wally, sister Ramona, Aunt Willow Redding, Uncle Rusty Redding, cousin Melissa Redding, and others. We're eating dessert. Rusty and Melissa leave, and will come back. I say to them I may be gone when they return. It is very windy outside, and it is raining. I know that my friends are out in this bad weather.
