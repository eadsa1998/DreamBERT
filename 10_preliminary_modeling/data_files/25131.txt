 I'm in the Zelling's house. My friends the Zelling twins and their parents are in Rome. There is a little girl there. It could be their sister. My girlfriend Annie comes over in a truck. It's getting late, dark out. They left their dog in the house. I am there 12 hours: from noon to midnight. There is a $6,000 grand piano, an Uno deck, and the dog to keep me occupied. I play with the dog. The little girl is secluded. I don't talk to her. When Annie arrives, she feeds the dog and talks to the girl. Annie was eating a granola bar. I am eating a banana.
