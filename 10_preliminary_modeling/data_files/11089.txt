I was driving in a car with a man. Evidently I must have known him very well because there wasn't the slightest fear or question in my mind. We were driving someplace near Berea because things I saw seemed very familiar to me. It was getting dark and we had absolutely no idea of where we were and I kept having the feeling I was looking for something. As we turned down a dirt road, I saw first a quail and then a big dog which my companion said was a fox. We were getting worried and I was becoming frantic looking for something, when we saw a sign that said Strongsville. We knew we were okay then and we drove into Berea from the south side of town. I still had the feeling of looking for something. As we drove into Marting parking lot, another man I know very well came out to meet us with a white mask on his face. It was then I woke up.
