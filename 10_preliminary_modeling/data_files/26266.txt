 I'm lifting weights with my friend Tiny Combs. He plays Ba Ba Boey's song "Ether Can Eat A Big Fat Dick". There is a line in the song that I have not heard before. Darth Vader speaks this line. I am about to do bench press, but I don't feel very strong. I haven't lifted weights in a long time and am very out of shape.
