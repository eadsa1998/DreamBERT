I was at Nana's. I got my laptop back. Mom's friend was called Pale. Mom said that it wasn't the usual model he worked with, but I could sign in now. It was like Sims 2. Mom kept calling my laptop Andrew. We were then on the back of a Ute and holding onto the rails. The bridge had the word BRIDGE on it. Then we were in a normal car. I saw Rodney outside a newsagency on the street. I was looking for Eugene. I saw Elijah.
