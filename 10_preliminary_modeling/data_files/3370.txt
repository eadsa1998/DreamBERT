I am traveling somewhere and see a beautiful vista and want to stay and take pictures. My lens isn't clean, so I try to clean it but it only smudges more. I struggle and struggle. I decide I need to find a photo shop to get it repaired and I decide to spend the night in this little resort town, in the mountains. Now the scene shifts and I am being initiated into the army kind of a thing. I am going to be whipped by the men as I pass. I carry my own whip and I fling that whip around so quickly and strongly that they can't hardly get near me. After this, I am given a sign that says, "I have balls" and another sign that says, "I am a bird that birds love." Now I go on up the mountain. A narrator sort of describes how some people meet with bad times and some with good times. I see a tidal wave coming and a woman is killed by it. I see a man, a family member of mine standing at a spot where the tidal wave uncovers a wall of gold bricks (like pyrite crystals sort of). I am rich.
