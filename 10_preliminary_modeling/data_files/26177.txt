 I'm outside at a picnic area. People from Brimson are there, including my advisor Mary Monroe and Kari Cutting, another professor. They talk about ordering sandwiches from McDonalds as a class event. Mary is downwind from me and says she smelly my body odor. I tell everyone that I really take pride in my filth, and that I was going to take a shower, but just didn't. I walk towards my home. I walk by a church-like ceremony where men are pushing boats on trailers: one per person. I go down a grassy step-like hill into a dormitory area. One man walking near me turns left and goes through some glass doors to do his laundry. I go straight to, my room, and see Peter Crater outside my door. I then realize I have forgotten my key. The door is open, I see, so I go in. Peter follows me when I invite him in. My classmate Allie Crater opens the door to her bedroom. She is sitting on her bed inside the room. She has a white blanket covering part of her body and doesn't seem to be doing anything but sitting. Her bedroom is entirely white. It's pretty. I think we may have interrupted her masturbating because she doesn't look like she's doing anything. I go upstairs to my bedroom. Peter and Allie are going to a bookstore. They ask me where it is. I don't know. We decide it's probably over by the campus store.
