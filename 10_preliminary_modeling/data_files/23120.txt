I am late to teach a Sunday School class, and am not prepared for the class.  The only thing I know to do is to assign each person to read a different chapter or different story in the book, and have them talk about it.  But I feel that that is obviously a waste of class time to do something that they could have done at home in preparation for the class if they had been told to do so, and I am afraid someone will complain.  Carl Scheibe is in the class, which surprised me, because there are different levels, like in language classes, and I think he should be in a higher level.  There is some scheduling conflict, though, that necessitates his being in this class.  I am really embarrassed about being unprepared in front of him.
