I had witnessed a murder by a gang. Mom got me and Ezra to stay with some friends that were high up in the drug world. We settled in well. One day I went into an office and was talking to them and someone turned on the police scanner and they heard they were coming to this street and going door to door pretending to be a charity. They quickly hid us in a basement. There was a window with blinds and Ezra opened it a little but I told him not to. There was a lady in sunglasses. A guy was naked and standing in front of a window. Then we were actually in a car and under a seat. There were 4 cars. The lady thought something was up and opened the car next to us and there was a guy in it and was confused. She said she was as cop and he pulled a gun out to shoot and she shot him first. He died and this other guy came out and shot her. There was a big shoot-out and everyone died. Ezra and I got out and decided to run home. There were police sirens in the background. I got my phone out and took photos. The house was on fire and there was lots of smokes. We ran and I took more pictures. We got home and Mom was there. I said 'they're dead, everyone's dead'.
