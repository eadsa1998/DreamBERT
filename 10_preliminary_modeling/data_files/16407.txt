Samantha, Sandra, and Lee and Derek and Mickey were in town. I don't know if Lee was there, but I know the others were there. And I had the notion that Sandra was getting married again. I wasn't sure if it was remarrying to Lee, or if it was marrying somebody else, but her and Samantha and everybody were like keeping everything all secret for some reason, I guess they just didn't know, and they were all kind of unprepared. She was just getting herself together. And I didn't really know if I was supposed to be her DJ sound person for her reception or not, and I was going to go over to her and ask her and say, "Hey, what about your reception?" because I had to know whether I should pack up the Peavey system or not. And I don't remember what she told me; I think she said, "I'm still not sure." So [laugh] that's pretty unsure. And so I packed everything up, just in case, and I think we were in the truck going down there, and Derek was driving, and I was there and there was somebody else, I think it was Mickey in a black dress, and all the other people on a different vehicle. And then I kind of woke up. I didn't think this was important enough to put on here, but then I realized that maybe it is because it kept coming back to me all day today. And I think it came from listening to the graduation footage and all the commotion that was going on in our house that we'd been hearing all their voices again, and thinking about when they were in town and all like that. And I guess that's all I have to say.
