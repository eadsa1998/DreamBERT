I went shopping for new bell bottoms. I met this girl and we said like two things to each other. Then I saw a kid from my school pulling all the clothes off the shelves. The only bellbottoms I could find were ones my 10-year old cousin already had. Setting: Limited, Too (a store). Characters: Eleanor - rich person I don't like (?). My mom. Girl I don't know. Charlene: cousin. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. Disappointed. This is a pretty much true story.
