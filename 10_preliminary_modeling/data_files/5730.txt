[1997-05-13] I was in the rearmost seat of a station wagon, where the seat faces back out of the rear of the car. I was sitting on the driver's side and sitting to my left was my Brother in law D from Kentucky. He was driving the vehicle and I remember thinking "boy, I wonder how he's driving this thing from all the way over here in the back." I could tell by his voice that he was turning his head around to look forward to see what's going on but he was talking to me. For the most part we were just riding along and he was looking at me mostly and yet he was able to control the car.
