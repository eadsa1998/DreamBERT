I had a volleyball game at the school gym and our volleyball coach came up to me and told me she was going to play in the game. I asked her if the coach was allowed to play. She said "I'm not going to be the coach; the 8th grade coach is going to be the coach, so I can play." I was really confused, but I went along with it. The game started and then I woke up.
