I was watching three people being covered by sand by being too greedy that one was going to survive the other. All went to eternity. A big bear was after us. He was so big we were afraid the shotgun wouldn't get him, so he was covered by a sand fall and went to eternity. I was waiting by a r.r. crossing to be picked up by a train that went by twice, but didn't stop for me. The train went by away from us.
