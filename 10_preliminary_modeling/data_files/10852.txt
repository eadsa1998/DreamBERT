I walked toward the desk in our den. There was an envelope with writing on the inside. It was from a girl who worked for our family when I was a child. She was with us for about 6 years and practically reared me. I was very attached to her and still do hear from her occasionally. I couldn't understand in the dream why she had written the letter on the inside of the envelope. I was blaming my mother. I don't think she wanted me to know what was said in this letter. There was also another envelope with writing on the inside, but I don't remember whom this was from. In the dream I was thinking that when I wrote this dream up in my dream report, I didn't think I would be able to remember from whom I had received this second letter.
