I was sitting in my room reading the newspaper that I get from my home-town. I noticed a picture of my girl friend, A. from home. A. is twenty-four-years-old. She is one of my closest friends. Her picture was in the society section. She was dressed in a bridal gown and veil. Her picture was above the picture of her brother's bride-to-be who is about twenty-two-years-old. She was also dressed in a bridal gown and veil.
