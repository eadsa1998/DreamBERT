I was at school and [adult babysitter] Joan was picking me up at the end of school and then I told Joan I had to do something at the end of school for a basketball thing and Michael Jordan was on my team and all of a sudden I just hugged him and he lifted me up and we went around all sorts of rooms in the school and he put me down and I realized I was dreaming in my dream and then when I woke up I saw his trophy that he won and I took it home and Judy and Rochelle were at my house. I showed them the trophy I got.
