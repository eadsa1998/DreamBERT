["Grandma should teach Charla about sex."] I am in a room. A woman is there and so is Charla. The woman is telling Charla that it should be Grandma that teaches her about sex. She meant I should have sexual contact with her to show her how to do it. Charla is disgusted by that idea and has her back to me saying to the woman, but I don't want to. I feel very uncomfortable as well. Is that supposed to be my job? It doesn't feel right.
