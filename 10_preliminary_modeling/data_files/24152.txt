The dream involved a couple of people in the dance troupe that I'm in. Also my housemates took roles in this dream. One of the guys in my dance troupe and I were involved with each other and my housemates were teasing me about it. I don't like being tease and my housemates do a good job at such things. These people involved were the same age as me. The guy I was 'involved' with is cute, but annoying to me and we don't get along with each other.
