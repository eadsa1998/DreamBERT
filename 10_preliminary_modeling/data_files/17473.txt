I and several others were at a birthday party for a teen boy.  His father was about to tell him to thank us for our being there, as we were somehow benefiting them.  Instead the kid got indignant because we were not appreciative of being at his party.  The father opened the trunk and there were all the presents, unwrapped.  The kid awed over a fiery license plate frame.  He posed for pictures in a wet suit with a 3-foot surfboard.  My mother took the pictures and wound the camera, as it was the end of the roll.  I was thinking like it was mine.
