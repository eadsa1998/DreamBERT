I saw two hands, representing gay marriage.  Then I was a girl in her early twenties, but not me.  I watched from the third person.  I was sad and felt left out.  I wanted to be a witch like the rest of the women in my family, but for some reason was not allowed.  I was making out with my boyfriend on my bed, but my father kept coming by and interrupting us.  I saw a large brownish-orange cat wearing a hat.  Then I was crossing a flower crop/field.  I think I ended up in a church or mission courtyard.  My father had followed me.  The squirrels started talking, screwing with his head.  I climbed in the water.
