The stray kittens plead for food. They are very hungry. I feel badly for them. I look in the refrigerator. I find some sugar cakes and some cheese. I am dressing up to go out on a date. It's a conservative outfit, but as soon as I'm out the door, I'll readjust the front and it will be very sexy. There's a bruise on my neck. I have a belt around my neck and then I put it around my waist. My kids watch. I go outside, stairs. I say, "Where's the elevator?" They say, "No problem. You can go up the stairs." I am annoyed. It will be painful. I go up one flight. Then I sit down and say, "No, I'll go in the elevator. These stairs don't go where I want anyway." (they went back doors). I see penguins that live on the stairs. If radio activity gets bad, they die and then we know. Some lie down dead. [BL]
