I was at Nana's. We were getting the photos off the camera and onto her computer. They were photos that I had taken. Mom was deleting the movement before the photo. Then I was at some place where people from school were and I was taking photos. I had photos of Daryl, Dewey, Kirsten and others. We went on a bus and someone said something about wanting a boyfriend and then this guy walked past and she was like "ooh, him!" He stood at the front of the bus and I said "I think he's going to kill us". He did something and the bus started rolling backwards so I got to the door and got out. It rolled off this jetty into the water. The guy made me go with him. I called the police but didn't tell them where the guy was. The police saw him though and we started running. There was a fair place and he was running through all these 'rides' and we got separated, but met up later. Then we were Smurfs. I was little and had red hair. He said something about me being 7 and he being 30. We were jumping on this hat to go this place where the police couldn't see us. He said something about kissing and having sex with me and he was holding me. Then we were at a shop and there was another Smurf. There was nacho flavoured ice-cream. This guy made bad guys eat it. The police came because he was saying he was the killer.
