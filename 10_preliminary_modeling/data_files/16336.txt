I had to get, it was like dark, it was early in the morning and I had to get on the bus to go to school. And it was okay to ride the bus naked, but it's just, I mean, the boys didn't mind, I just couldn't show some of the more squeamish girls. So it's okay to ride the bus naked, but it wasn't okay to go to the bathroom all over everywhere. So [laugh] I really had to go, so I'm like by the side of the house going to the bathroom, and buck naked, and I'm peeing like a totally gully washer, and I finally finished that, and then I go poop. And oh, that was a lot! [laugh] And there was like gooey yucky mess all over everywhere and I can't even wipe up because there's no toilet paper. And then the bus pulls up and I'm running to the bus and trying to streak past these squeamish girls. And I get on the bus and I sit down and I'm finally okay. And we're going to school, and [laugh] that's all I can remember. I think there was more, but I can't remember it.
