In this dream I was talking to somebody who was an official or some type of an official at a, working in a morgue, and he was telling me that everybody that they bury, that they put a camera, a movie camera, inside the coffin with everybody who gets buried now. I asked why, and the answer, I don't remember it, or I mean he didn't tell me why.
