I am living in my parents' house. I am in the kitchen. A cute, round, delicate creature is flying gently around the room. It's a pet of my parents'. It's name is Paper. It's like a small, fat mouse sitting on a pretty, white, ruffly doily. It comes near me and I ask my mother if it will bite. She says, "No, just be gentle and don't move around too suddenly." It comes up under my chin and nuzzles. I pet it and feel very happy with it. I decide I want one of my own. My mother says, "They cost $5.00." I decide to buy two. I need to go to school. I go outside, but now I have to go back inside to change my clothes. I go into my parents' bedroom. My brother Dwight is now there. Now, I'm in my parents bed and Dwight is in there with me. He loves me and wants to make love. I feel sad and nostalgic. I kiss him on his cheek and pat him. I say, "I love you," meaning, "I love you but we can't have sex." I get up, sitting on the edge of the bed. There is a pile of clothes on the floor and I pick them up one at a time to find a proper outfit. I see my sexy K-Mart slip/skirt. No, it's too sexy. I pick up a red under-petticoat and a see-through turquoise skirt (like my Mexican dress). I explain to Dwight how it wouldn't do to wear them together. I see my jeans skirt, but that's too old and out of style. I pick up a pair of cotton white pants with pink 1950's designs on it and find a short sleeve blouse to go with it. At first I don't like the outfit, but after I button up the pants, they fit comfortably around my plump middle and the sleeves are long enough to cover my fat arms. I have trouble buttoning the blouse with my arthritic fingers, but as I slowly and patiently work on it, it gets all buttoned. I bend down and pick up several sacks of rocks. They are my father's rocks. Some are like my belly rock. Some are crystals and so on. I put them aside and go on out, headed for school. It's 10 of 1 and I'll soon be late. It's raining outside. I find a big elevator.
