 I go into my dorm neighbor's room. Rachel Watson and Laura Hampton live there. Their room is different. It is on the opposite side of the hallway than where it actually is. The dorm bathroom is in their room. I say to Rachel it must be weird having the bathroom in their room. Then I decide they must get used to it. I'm going to take a shower. The shower is really small, and I have to kneel. I can see over the shower curtain. I use a dandruff shampoo. Rachel walks towards the shower. I can see from her shoulders up, over the shower curtain. I can tell she isn't wearing a shirt. We talk. There is a little door-like space that she opens in the curtain. I can see her breasts, which are very nice. She can see me naked, kneeling and washing myself with a bar of soap. I cover up my genitals. She stands there and we talk. After a short while I stop covering my genitals, moving my hands. It is an uncomfortable feeling. I man comes in and helps Rachel move stuff around the room. Her roommate Laura is sleeping in a bed. I didn't notice this before.
