A nurse talks to my little girl and is going to show her some things in a glass cabinet like a counter in a store. It is against my wishes because she had wanted to, but I didn't want her to. As the nurse, like the goody two shoes she is, shows her things, the girl also steals things like I knew she would. The idealist nurse brings the girl back to me and I point out a list of items and one thing the girl has isn't on the list (or vice versa). Anyway, I deliberately squealed on the girl. The nurse is surprised. I say, "You took her from me because you felt I wasn't giving her enough experiences and you were right to some extent, but I knew she would steal you blind. She is manipulative. You didn't know that." The nurse leaves us and now a doctor watches me from a distance and then writes a soap opera based on things I do and say. It's quite popular and people laugh. I am unaware of all this until I see it. Now the doctor likes me and wants to marry me. My husband, Spencer Tracy, says to him, "So you just want me to move out, huh? Well, OK, as long as you leave a bridge so I came come back now and again and visit. It's probably better this way anyway," he says. "I would be better off living alone." The doctor asks him where he'll go. He says, "If I go to live alone with someone, the safest place would be Brazil, where there is lots of food." I see the jungles like I'm in a plane and then I see a dinosaur looking up at me. "And," he continues, "lots of food that can eat me." Or he may live in the tropics under a palm tree - no house, no clutter, no things. It sounds good.
