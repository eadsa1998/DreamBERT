["Island travel on a couch."] Children have decided to travel to an island. A boy asks me to come with them. They will make a new home for themselves and I will help them. We get in a station wagon, the boy (teen) driving. The way out is extremely steep down a dirt cliff. He points the car straight at it. I say No, go down sideways, its safer. We do that, sliding fast down the hill. We go down a road to a beach. We put boxes and backpacks of our things on a baize couch. Then we sit on it and wash out to sea. Then we wash up on an island. There is a store there. The lady owner allows us to store some of our things in her backroom. I see an orange cement BBQ pit or fireplace in that room.
