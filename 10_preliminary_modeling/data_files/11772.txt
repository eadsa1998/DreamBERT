I was at Valerie's and it was very different. I looked out the window to see some guy throwing cats off walls. There was a greenhouse thing. I went to this toilet cubicle that was in the kitchen after being chased by an evil clown. I was on the toilet and Teacher-M-03 sat down on chair at table. I recognized him but couldn't remember who he was. He had his legs folded and his hands were clasped on top, and he had this big grin on his face. I said "Who the hell are you?" and he said "I'm Teacher-M-03" and as he bent down to his suitcase I ran out of the toilet screaming. Then he turned into an evil clown.
