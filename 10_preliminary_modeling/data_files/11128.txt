I was a teacher in Alaska in this dream. My husband (I'm not really married, but unofficially engaged) and I lived in Anchorage. One day an American ship was coming in; the last one before the hard winter season. I took my class to see this ship. We went through it from top to bottom and I received photos of it to teach the class what it looked like. Before we were able to get off, the boat left shore and there we were, on the boat. I was frantic, worried sick and almost panicky. Then what did I see but my husband working with the crew. He let down a life boat, put all the children in it and sent them back to shore. There was no room for me in it, so I had to stay aboard ship. The ship gave a big lurch and I woke up from my dream. I was very confused.
