We are at a Learning Center for single parents; I ask a man's young son about his religion; he is vaguely Christian and his sister is Lutheran; I remember that there is a square RED crocheted rug on the floor; I cut off some loose ends -- vivid; shift: Pedro and a friend are sleeping over at the Center; I want to ask them questions about the atmosphere of the place, but we are all too sleepy and fall asleep in our separate beds. -- later find a spot of BLOOD on the sheet where I slept.
