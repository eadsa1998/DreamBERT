 I'm walking down 1st Street in Oak Valley, going east. There is a huge crowd of people ahead of me, going to the bars. I come up to the back of this crowd. My childhood neighbor, Tim Robbins, is 23, and is a bar bouncer. The people at the back of the crowd drink Type I: drink Busch Light. I want to move from this position, to the Type II crowd, where the drink is Randy Light. This is a difficult move to make. There is Banana Mush, which is a social/popularity knowledge slush drink. My friend Patrick Bergman is at the back of the crowd trying to recruit people for a bowling league. I see a league advertised on a board, two days per week, after school from 2-4pm, or 4-?pm. I see my neighbor Mary Robbins across the street.
