Doctor Pi and I were in a room talking about some of my course work. He started to leave. As he started to leave, I began to get undressed. He turned around and came back in. I had taken off my nightgown and was now holding it up against me to keep myself covered. He made some comment about my not having anything on. I told him I thought he was leaving, that was why I did it. He went on to make some comment about what people on campus would say or do if we were personally involved. He said something about getting fired and then something else I don't remember about it being risky. I said, maybe I don't mind the risk! He just looked at me kind of odd and half-smiled then left. The next thing I knew we were in a bedroom, still talking about my classes. I was lying in bed covered with a blanket but had no clothes on. Doctor Pi was sitting on the bed beside me with his back to me, though he was leaning against me, and he had one hand on me I must have said something to him about being worried because he said, yeah, I'm scared too. Then he smiled reassuringly. Students kept coming in to ask him questions. I was worried about this but it did not seem to bother him.
