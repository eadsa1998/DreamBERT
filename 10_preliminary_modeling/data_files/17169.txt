I only vaguely remember now, but the dream I had last night was interesting.  I was gliding over the muddy grass and whatnot.  Somewhere we found a girl, who joined our party.  Chinese, I believe...running from something?  We were hopping fences to a park, and came across a van...got a ride...perhaps on the bus to my brother Stuart's college.  We had to transfer to another vehicle.  Something large and looming and undefeatable was pursuing us.
