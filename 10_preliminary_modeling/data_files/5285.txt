I dreamed that I was taking a shower in the bathroom, but it was in the main building. I was fully clothed, though, so I just walked out of the shower. Vanessa came by and hip-checked me out of the way. I was really nice to her though, even though she is a bitch. Then I was in chemistry class and we were trying to make shampoo and they had to test it out on me. It was horrible. Then I saw Jackson and woke up.
