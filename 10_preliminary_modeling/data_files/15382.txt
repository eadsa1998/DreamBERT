I was at university/school. Classes were sets of seats near edges. There were these balconies all across and in the middle was nothing. One of them had a fat kid sitting in front of someone else and it blocked their view of the lesson. There were two groups and one needed a stick to pick up loot and the other was mine and we could just pick things straight off the floor. But I still had to pay $1 for a stick. There was a letter from a Macedonian church saying something was free. The teacher lady thought it meant stuff related to this loot business.
