Bonnie and I are at a store/restaurant and she orders lots of different food. It comes time to pay the bill. She's had a few glasses of wine and now orders a cute little puppy to take home. We go to the counter to pay and to pick up the puppy. Bonnie is upset that her part of the bill is so much more than mine; she hasn't realized it's because she ate much more than me. I feel angry and guilty so I offer to pay the tip and pull out $3.19 and put it on the table. The sales woman goes to the back room and brings the leftover food orders and a cute puppy. I see a basket of sweet puppies in the back room. I ask to buy a cat. She brings me a black cat and I hold it, pleased. Then she says, "But you wanted a white cat." I feel upset because I like the black cat, but I'm willing to change my mind. I follow her into the back room and she hands me a tiny white toy like those clip-on animals. It's stiff. It had been clipped on a pole with thousands of others crammed together. I am disgusted and say, "I wanted a real cat." It opens its enormous black eyes and I realize the poor thing is alive. I feel sad for it and angry at the woman for the dreadful living condition she forces on these little creatures. I refuse to buy anything from her to teach her a lesson.
