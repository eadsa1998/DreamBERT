I went out to a used car dealer who handled, I think, Studebakers and Volkswagens, a new car dealer who also had used cars. I kept thinking in the dream that I wanted to buy a used VW even though every once in a while I would realize that was not what I wanted to do. I wanted to get a 1960 compact or something like that. I went ahead and got a trade-in estimate on my car of about $795, which seems rather high now that I think of it. Then somehow I went ahead and paid the man what money I had with me to make up the difference on another car. Then I realized that was sort of stupid to go ahead and do then because I wasn't even sure that he would have the kind of car I wanted. But then I started looking at his used cars an he showed me a full-size 1960 car, 59 or 60 car, 4-door with an automatic transmission. Then he showed me a Willys and another car whose name I can't recall, except it was a very odd one. Both this car and the Willys were very strange because they looked very old-fashioned. They were open and like a surrey with a fringe on top. About at this point I started talking with my wife about a car that we needed. We were in my hometown at the time at my mother's home, although I don't think she's there, which is strange because we expect to buy this car in my wife's hometown at my wife's parents' home. We thought that we really wanted to look around some more to get a better idea, but we really didn't have time since we had to go home in a couple of days. So we'd probably go ahead and buy one off this car dealer's lot anyway.
