Mom did something to my car, and then ended up getting the whole windscreen smashed. We were driving in another car and I was annoyed, but not overly angry. I kept mentioning it though and worried about how I was going to get to work. We went to a petrol station, which was tiny and she parked in it - that is, the bonnet of the car to about the windows was as big as the store and my window was just next to the counter. I saw some of those mint slice chocolates and wanted one but didn't ask. There were two policeman nearby too. I can't remember what happened, but I ended up meeting some people and staying with them in a hotel room. There were 3 guys and 1 other girl - but I think she was already a friend of mine? Or at least I knew her before the others. One of the guy's was called Dave and was the hottest one and who had taken a liking to me. He had brown hair and a bit of stubble. They all wanted to throw a party and took a vote on it, saying that I wouldn't want to, but I agreed as well. I was slightly excited about it, but also already bored by the idea. They started setting up, gathering drinks and snacks and so on. They were rolling a dice to see who got to choose which drink next (drinking before the party started). I was sat against a wall, the girl on my right and one of the other guy's on her right (all spaced quite far away). The other guy (not Dave and not the one sitting down) was the one she liked. He had a bit of a chubby face. Dave was talking to him just outside the room and I noticed he had a ring on each ring finger, which annoyed me. I was thinking I'd drink a bit and wanted to sleep with him, but wondered if I could go through with it if he was wearing jewellery. He grabbed a bottle and came over to me and said something about 'being in love with me' but that I wasn't interested. He sat down right next to me and I made a face and said 'we've known each other for like 2 days'.
