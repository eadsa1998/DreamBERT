I heard Duke won as I was awaking. I saw Seebit as a selection to win. I was finding money on my back seat in the car. I found a lot of dimes as I or someone would sit on the seat. I was always picking up coins. Then the seat was an old bed, old iron bed. I said, "I'm going to keep it behind the garage." I was invited by my sister Mary to dust her rugs. She asked me to do it and I said, "Ok, I'll help you." There were three friends of mine who traveled by car and got very little sleep. We had a dog. He saw a toad hopping around. He grabbed the toad in his mouth and bit it a couple of times. The toad got bigger then the dog acted like a human being. He put his paws together like a man would put his hands and he coaxed the toad to come to him. He picked it up and hugged the toad.
