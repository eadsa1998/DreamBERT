["Visiting Hector."] I am in Mexico City to visit Hector and his family. I fly in an airplane and feel quite comfortable. There are fewer stops this time I notice. I arrive and his sisters pick me up from the airport and take me to their house. It is late at night and I am remembering that I did go to the Doctor's office before I left to get the stomach pills to ward off The Terrible Tourista. Sickness. I am taken upstairs to the sister's bedroom where a third small cot has been set up for me. Hector isn't anywhere around and I expected this. I am happy to notice that I feel fine about this unlike the last time when I was angry. I am determined to enjoy this trip and not make the same mistakes I made the first time.
