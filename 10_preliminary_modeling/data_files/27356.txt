I was looking at some oil wells when they suddenly burst into flame. The fire spread until everything was blazing. People were running back and forth, screaming and crying. I had no feelings of any kind - I just watched them all. Then a large crack appeared in the earth at my feet. All the people screamed even louder and jumped down into the fissure. Then it closed up again and the fires died out. Everything was gone and I was standing alone on a large level plain.
