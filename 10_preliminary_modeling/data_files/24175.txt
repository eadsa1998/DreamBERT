I had just moved into a new apartment with three guys and two girls. It was sort of a tree house and there were a lot of steps to get up to the apartment. My room fit only my bed but my closet was huge and L-shaped, if you walked straight through, it led to the dining room. In the end of the room there were lots of built in drawers for clothes and things. I was trying to convince my roommates that the dining room should be part of my room. Then I went to school, but all I knew were the names of my classes, not where they were, so I was running around from building to building, trying to find my classes by asking people outside what class they were waiting for. I woke up before I could find my class.
