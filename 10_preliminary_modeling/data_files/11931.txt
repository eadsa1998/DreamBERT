There were people from Alias and Victor Garber had this really cool handwriting that I tried to copy. We were doing some mission thing. We tracked down people to a castle thing. I don't know what happened, but we got passed (I think we shot some) guards and then this person caught us and people or something were shooting things at us. None hit us and we escaped with "important information". We picked up a call that was meant for other bad guys. They were saying stuff in code that I worked out and they had said something about a playground. Victor Garber's handwriting I mentioned earlier was seen because he had written a letter that I was reading at the castle place. It explained some information about the castle. He had weird t's that looked like the t shown in the diagram, but they were cool. We were at some desk place. There was one person per desk and people were inspecting them. I opened a door and some guy was there and I was apologizing but I actually had to go in to get some messages. Then we were at the playground. The bad guys were almost there which we knew because we could hear their car. We left two people there with a note saying "Do not harm or we'll play Jay-Z and some woman singer [don't remember who]" and they didn't hurt them.
