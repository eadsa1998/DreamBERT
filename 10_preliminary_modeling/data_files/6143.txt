I'm driving in my car. I come to this building so I park the car and get out. I go into the building and there is food all around and the people are all dressed up. I walk around the building. In every room there was a dance going on. Then the people started to leave the building. I climb back into my car and start to drive again. Then a cop pulled me over and gave me a ticket for not having my child in a carseat.
