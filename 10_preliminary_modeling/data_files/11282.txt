I was at a television party at the home of a friend. I did not recognize those who attended, outside of a girl who was supposed to be the sister of the girl with whom I was involved (I never did see my girlfriend in the dream at all.) This sister, however, I recognized as being a young widow with whom a friend of mine actually had an affair; I had seen a picture of her a few months before. At any rate, she seemed physically desirable to me in the dream, so I purposely waited until most of the others had gone home or had fallen asleep -- was dimly aware of the fact that the party had worn out its welcome, and the host wanted us to leave (it must have been 3:00 or 4:00). We finally got up to leave; as I was the only one who had a car, I was obliged to take the others home. I intentionally did not take this girl home before I dropped off the others. Then we parked. I placed my arm about her, and noticing the disgusting leer of sheer physical desire on her face, I recalled thinking that I was certainly a dirty rascal intending to make love to this girl merely because her sister (allegedly my true love) was not there.
