 I'm in a house that may be my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I lay on the floor trying or pretending to sleep. Kevin enters to sleep in his bed. I'm talking with Kevin and my friend Stephen Ramos in the house. I ask Kevin about the Big Resort Area: if he wants to do two trips, one with just us, and maybe cover some new ground on the Woodsville side of the Big Resort Area before the rest of the group comes up. We could meet people there. Stephen is pinching me. This annoys me. I tell him to stop. He doesn't stop at first, and I yell at him loudly and angrily. I tell him that I don't like the pinching: I really don't like it! I'm very assertive, very angry. I say that kind of joking that we used to do is unstable. I leave promptly, feeling disturbed. I walk down towards Pool Park and interact with two young girls.
