["Letters from Brian, wish I knew who he was."]  I am working hard and feel very tired. I fluff up some pillows and prepare to rest on a big easy chair. Another woman friend is also tired and takes my place. I see this and happily give up my spot for the other side of the chair. There are two large holes in the corners of the chair and I stuff a big brown pillow in it and arrange a few more for comfort. I curl up. Now I get up to look for some letters I received. I had gotten a postcard from someone named Brian and I wrote back. Only I can't remember who Brian is. I got three letters. Big fat ones. My name Beverley is written three times across the envelope. I am excited about receiving these letters. They look like they will be fun to read and full of information from the past. I try to think who Brian is. Maybe an elementary school chum. Maybe I met him at Aunt Millie's. I open his letter. He has a whole list of facts about my Grandma Agnes' family on this paper. I begin to eat the paper. It tastes very good. I then realize that I am eating the facts before I even read them. I don't want to lose the information, so I nibble around the margins, because I really like the taste of this paper. It is crunchy like potato chips.
