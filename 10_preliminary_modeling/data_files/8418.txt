Darren needed to tell someone, a woman, that I am still alive. He's really struggling with it. I think we're at the condo. He's struggling because he thinks he's going to have a really hard time with it. Maybe it's mother. It suddenly seems that it is mother that he has to tell. I sit down on the sofa with him. He is wearing the purple robe I made for him. He's been crying cause his eyes and nose are all red. I asked him why this is so difficult for him. I asked him if he is concerned about trying to explain why I let her and others believe that I was dead? I said, If it is, just tell them that at the time that I thought it was in Matthew's best interest.
