I had lunch in the mall with my CRHP sisters and Sue P. Sue P said Vince P hasn't been well and hasn't been around much, maybe not in town much. I wondered if this is why he has not returned my calls lately. Sue P had black and yellow hair braids attached to her hair. We all sat at round tables with 3-4 people per table. We were at Keystone at the Crossing Mall. When I left the mall I couldn't find my car. It was near Christmas time. There was snow on the ground and it was very cold. I went into another restaurant, which you could enter from the parking lot, to warm up. Bill C. was there alone, sitting in a booth. I joined him and he told me he was waiting on another couple that he was going to be dining with. We chatted until they arrived. They all invited me to stay and then Bill C could drive me around to find my car. When we got ready to go he needed to use the restroom. He went down this long hall and was waiting for someone to come out. He was wearing a long beige sweater, similar to one I own. His had large patches of brown leather on it. We were driving around looking for my car. We were talking about Christmas and that he still needed to do some Christmas shopping with just a few days left. I recall talking about his family and some other things. He told me that I needed to lose weight. I could tell there was some chemistry between us. I don't recall if we found my car or not. Before I got out of his car he leaned over and kissed me.
