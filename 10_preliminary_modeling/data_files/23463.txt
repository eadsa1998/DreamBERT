I'm packing everything up to move on again. I still have some remaining items from my early career as an artist. I have to get a hold of Tabatha to pass all these items on to her because I know she will be thrilled. I want to clear out and get rid of everything in my life that represents my old life -- I do not want to move it to my new home. At the same time, I hear that my friend Angie has begun a new career as a comic -- she has a routine as a fly where she does acrobatic work around a person in the audience and does jokes.
