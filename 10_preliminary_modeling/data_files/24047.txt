In the night sometimes when I'm in bed, I'll feel like I'm being squished. And there starts this throbbing and no matter what I do, it won't stop. If I talk, my words start to throb with the throb. If I breathe out of the throb, it will grow louder, and all the time I still feel like I'm in bed. It scares me a lot. A couple of times I still scream.
