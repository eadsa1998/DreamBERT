I was working at the computer with a bunch of different files for the doctors. I was moving them around getting all the files in the right places. It was taking me a while and I was concerned that I wasn't going to get it done in time for them. One of them said that I just needed to finish it by the end of business on Friday, then they would have the weekend and Monday to review it before they needed it on Tuesday.
