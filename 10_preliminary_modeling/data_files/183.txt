I'm with Arnold Schwarzenegger, who I keep calling Conan - he's driving me back from somewhere and I talk him into going to pick up Melanie, who's at a house somewhere in a neat neighborhood, and she's like spent the night with this unsavoury guy who may do her some harm, I think. So we get there - actually I think he knows the guy, or something, and goes in. Melanie comes out, I'm not sure she comes out the door, does she sort of "escape" out a window or something? Anyway, she gets to the truck and I'm rather nervous about being here and want to get away quick and Conan isn't coming out. I don't feel right about leaving him but I drive us off, and it's getting dark and (raining?). Actually now that we're on the road there's a 3rd person with us, another woman - we're on a big road, close to where we're going, with 3 lanes or so each way, and lotsa traffic, and the road being torn up. I'm not having that easy a time handling this truck, and what with the slick road it skids and turns over on its side. We're not hurt, but we gotta get out and away from the traffic - we scramble to the front and I can see all these other cars coming and I'm terrified they're going to crash into us and pile up several, right on top of us. We're scrambling over the piled-up road and clamber over into the big ditch by the side of the road. Geez what a relief. But now we gotta be rescued from the ditch. We watch for a while and people come with emergency cars and stuff. Then we go over to the left side (backward, that is) where there's a bit of ledge we can climb up on and stand close to the top. Some people come there to help - turn out to be somebody I know (LT? SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM?), so we stand and talk while we're waiting for someone to pull us out.
