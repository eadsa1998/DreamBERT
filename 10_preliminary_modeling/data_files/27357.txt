I was sitting out in the grass with my youngest sister (19). A queer animal - a cross between a spider and an octopus - started wrapping his tentacles around her neck. I tried to pull him away but I couldn't. Then I started cutting the tentacles with a pair of scissors. Finally I succeeded in removing it and dropping it into a pail of scalding water. In the water it turned into an enormous yellow toad. It hopped out and hopped away into the woods. It was quite luminous and left streaks of light all along its path.
