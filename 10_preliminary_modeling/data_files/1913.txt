I am newly married to the guy. I'm his second wife and he'll come into the room at any moment, so I'm hurrying to change into my nightgown for our "first night." We are strangers and I feel uncomfortable (strange) that we'll be making love soon. He peeks in too soon and I feel caught or embarrassed. Then his first wife runs in and out. She's drunk. I explain to her that her son responds to his two mothers differently. I think he responds to me better. Then President Bush comes through (it's like the old M City house) to the bathroom where he explains he keeps extra sets of clothes so in case he needs to change to accommodate a new person or situation, he can. Then he's in another narrow, long room. He says, "There's a lady here, what shall I wear? Shall I wear a dress?" He holds up an ugly polyester dress. My husband and I shake our heads no! How are we going to keep him from making a fool of himself by wearing inappropriate clothes? The first wife runs in and gets up on the counter and I say, "Oh no! She'll mess up his dinner." We rush over and pull her away from the microwave. I say, "It really is hard to have a sweet, cute sister-in-law who is drunk."
