I am back home in M. City: Amy &amp; Reynaldo have come by, and also Hillary. But nothing is ready yet for the party. I wait for others to arrive. While I wait, we walk around with Father Andrew and look at photos and pictures various people have taken. He is very appreciative and talks with everyone. I get his attention and show him a painting by Wendy of the Annunciation! We are all impressed and he thanks me profusely. We go back to my birthday party.
