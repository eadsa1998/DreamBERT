My mother called and said my brother Gerald had a sudden heart attack. I thought that was surprising, as he is 21 and healthy and active. I thought at first it wasn't as bad as she made it out to be, since she tends to blow things out of proportion. I went home -- a long way, but compressed for me in time -- and met them at the hospital. The doctors were hesitant to come out. I knew then that trouble was in the air. A rage, worry and panic took over. And I could not let what they were suggesting happen. I tore through the hallway and pushed open the double doors to the bay. There were many beds in a row, curtains around them, and very dim in the light. At the end of the room, there were several people wearing scrubs and masks around a hospital bed set against the wall horizontally. Gerald was there, and he was laying still. I ran over and started yelling at him. Dammit, Gerald, wake the hell up. Come on. You're better than this. I put my hand on his head. He had long hair like he had when we were kids. I tousled his hair. Then he began to stir. He turned over.  I could see the blood-stained spot on his hospital gown where the doctors had performed surgery. He turned over. I thought that wasn't good for him. He was thrashing and rolling around. But at least he was no longer flat lined and gray. Get up, Gerald. Then I woke up.
