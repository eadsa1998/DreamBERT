At least three of the characters are the three judges from the TV program American Idol. There were stacks of paper, shrink-wrapped. There is something about whether or not there is enough copies in these stacks or as many as there should be or if it is something about each individual dictates which stack they get based on what they deserve or what they earn or what they qualify for or what they worked for. There is something special about it though too. The stacks are in different places but I can't see them sitting on anything. It's almost as though all of these elements are there yet. It's like I know the judges are there but they aren't sitting in a row together at a table like they would be on the TV program. It's as though they aren't even standing together at all. They are each in a different place, yet they're observing or guiding. It seems that I move from one stack of papers to another to another and I don't know if one of them is for me or if I'm just acting as, to guide other people or to explain it to other people. I don't know what my role is there.
