["Luscious fruit feast."] I am visiting two older grey haired women. Rosalie and perhaps her sister. They are retired and quite wealthy. We get into a small private airplane of theirs. Rosalie is the pilot. We are flying to their summer cottage on the coast. I wonder if we are safe. We land safely on a road. The cottage is huge and has many rooms. Lovely furnishings. I start to walk to the window to see the ocean but am distracted to yet another room. A feast is prepared and one table is filled with lush cantaloupes, strawberries and grapes. The colors are bright and very enticing. They look luscious. I am curious to return and see the view of the ocean. I start for that room again when I notice the entire cottage is moving like a sideways elevator. The landscape is spinning by very fast. Finally it stops and I look out. I see a vague coast line, but no ocean. I am disappointed.
