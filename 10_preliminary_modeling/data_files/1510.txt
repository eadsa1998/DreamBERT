I am a teacher and I am mildly interested in one of my students. I know it's not right, so I resist. He tries to interest me. In a fit of energy, I start to clean up the room. I get a broom and sweep Toostie O's on the floor. He also starts to help. We feel good about being responsible and taking care of business before pleasure. After it's clean, we (now my daughter Dovre and the young man) laugh and frolic together. I (a mature person) am pleased with them and approve of their actions.
