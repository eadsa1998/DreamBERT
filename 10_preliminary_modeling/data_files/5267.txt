I dreamed that there was some sort of Olympics at school. There were 3 big events. Halfway through one I ran to Taylor for some reason just to hang out, I guess. Next day I was watching the real Olympics. I realized I had hockey practice, so I ran to Bundy to get ready. I was really panicked because I couldn't find my watch or something. When I got there, someone had died. We had this huge underclassmen funeral. Then I was in a department store of some sort. Someone else was with me and there were these two sort of scary-looking men, who wanted to buy us jewelry. We found two pairs of earrings we liked, and they went to buy them for us. The woman at the counter said they were Tiffany earrings, but somehow I couldn't believe her. There were 3 little dogs there too and they were yapping all over the place. So then I was at Hogwarts. Professor Snape was looking all over the place for me. I accidentally set off a charm that made all these bombs explode. The whole school rushed into the hallways. We had to bring as much money outside as possible. It was freezing outside. But then I woke up.
