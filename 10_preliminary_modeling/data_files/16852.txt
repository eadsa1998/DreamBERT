I'm looking at some houses on a street in a neighborhood that seems lawless. The housing is newly build, and aesthetically unpleasant. The occupants seem to be wrecking the place. One house is teaming with children of all ages who should be at school. Then I notice the mother is drunk and more interested in her partner, another woman, who is high on drugs and grinning from ear to ear.
