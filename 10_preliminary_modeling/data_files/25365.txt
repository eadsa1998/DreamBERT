 It is winter. My friend Matt Yams' mother, grandpa, and grandma pull up in a recreation vehicle in my alley at home in Oak Valley. They unload a bunch of stuff. There is a toilet among the things they unload. We carry the things in. I take the toilet. Matt's mother criticizes me, saying, "Aren't you going to clean it before putting it back in the bathroom." Matt's grandparents are strict.
