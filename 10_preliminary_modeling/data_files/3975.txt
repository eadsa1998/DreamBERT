["Albert Einstein and family love."]  Albert Einstein is working on new inventions. He has a glass beaker full of some thick scientific liquid. He comes out of the room and announces he has found the cure for tuberculosis. His family take the new invention and carefully put it in safe keeping. They are monitoring his work so that when he dies his legacy will be intact and will be passed on to them. However, some other people come and ask him to sign over his works to them. He does so and then goes back to work.  His family is deeply upset and hurt. I try to explain to them. I say, He loves you but his first love is his work. You don't matter, in the long run. They have hurt feelings.
