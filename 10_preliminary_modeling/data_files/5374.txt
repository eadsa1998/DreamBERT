Last night I had a dream that I was taking an exam in the athletic center. Ian pulled me back and started flirting with me. I stroked his chest and then went to take my exam (what is my problem!?). Then I was in some huge house and it was all metal and connected to the athletic center. I had to go to a certain college, and my father was driving along a very precarious and windy road. I was watching him driving for some reason, when I think I was supposed to be in the car. We were on the golf course, on the 6th fairway. Then my brother woke me up this morning.
