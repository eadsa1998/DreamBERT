 I'm at Armstrong High School. I have $7,000 worth of crack cocaine. I need to get rid of it. I remember that my dad has died. I'm still grieving. My friend Bubba Hacker is back from the National Guard for the weekend. The crack looks like the caps that one puts in a cap gun. Young students recognize it though I don't. I put the crack in my razor case. I run. I want to get rid of it. I can't give it to Bubba, because he is in the Military Police branch of the National Guard. There is a locker full of stolen money. I put two 20-dollar bills in a nearby locker in case I need them. I can't remember the combination or I can't get the locker open. My sister Heather has a remote sensing device. She uses it to sense feelings. She is on the roof of our house, and I am on the main floor. She knows where I am, and is after me. I take my mom's car and escape.
