[1997-07-25] I was going to the store to buy bread, and I went next door across the parking lot and I remember the sun, it was a hot, sunny day and the humidity was relatively high and when I got there, the door wouldn't open, it was stuck and I thought "oh well, they must be closed." I started to walk away and then someone opened the door from the inside and said "Oh no, we're open, come on in." So I went in and I couldn't find anything that was familiar to me, the whole place had been rearranged, there was hardware up front and I thought I must be in the wrong store but yet I could smell bread being made and I said to the guy, "Where's the bread being made?" And the man said "You're in a paint store." I started to leave and as I did someone came up and started to ring up their purchase and I could hear them say you have milk, eggs and 2 loaves of bread, and as I started to wake up I wondered how they were able to get bread when I couldn't.
