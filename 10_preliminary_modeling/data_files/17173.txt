Last night I had a dream from which I awoke with a sore right bicep.  The dream I had had children in it.  A family with twin babies.  One slid down a ramp walkway in the bedroom and injured its head.  Something about getting food in my father's car.  And going in a store with a person...an accomplice.  I signed the receipt as Luciano Pavarotti.  I was committing credit card fraud.  Then some sort of play structure.  I think that is where my arm is sore from.  I think I threw something at a little kid.  There may have been a medicine ball around, and I don't know what else I might have done to get the sore muscles.
