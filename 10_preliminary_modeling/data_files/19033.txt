The setting is at either a stadium or theater, auditorium or something like this. I was going through the setting and came across two fellows playing cards, not for money, just sitting on the steps, sitting on the steps and playing some weird game of cards, stereo voice. There were probably 8 or 9, something like this. Then the scene changed after one of them had won a game of cards. Then the scene changed. Myself, a friend from my childhood, when I lived in New Jersey, John, and some man who I didn't know, and one other person decided to play a game of pool and it was on the kind of pool table you find in bars. About the two fellows were playing cards, I knew them they were familiar, but I don't remember who they were. I mean my relationship to them was familiar, but I don't remember who they were. I mean my relationship to them was familiar. The scene seemed to change quickly and one of the fellows who was playing cards seemed to be my brother Dave, 17. When I asked this guy to play pool, Dave looked at the other kid as well were walking away as if to say, "Well, why didn't he ask one of us to play instead of that guy, but the face I saw wasn't Dave. It was some other kid who I don't recognize at all, so it had sort of switched appearance from my brother, who was actually about six foot to a young fellow of 13 or 14 of 5 foot, even though I recognized him as my brother, it was him when he was young, younger than now, in his earlier teens, probably 12, 13, somewhere around there. When we started to play pool, he, my brother, and this other guy who he was playing cards with, just didn't enter the picture at all and the only thing in this picture was myself standing there chalking the cue, taking it away from John.
