I dreamed I was in a beer garden drinking beer, when all of a sudden I saw an old girlfriend of mine sitting on the stool next to mine. She was supposed to have been married and I asked her about it. She said that her engagement was broken and the next thing I knew I was in bed with her in my bedroom. Then I had a noctural emission.
