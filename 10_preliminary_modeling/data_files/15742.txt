I was going out with Stephen Merchant, though he was younger. We went on a trip with Mom, Ezra and a friend of his. Everyone kept changing around though, sometimes Ezra's friend was a girlfriend, sometimes Steve was my girlfriend and sometimes Mom was 'her' mother. Anyway, I can't really remember where we were or why we were there. Mom made these muffins and she went off to do something and we were eating one each. I had a chocolate one and I said it was really dry. Ezra and his friend had a bag of weed and stuffed some into their mouths. They gave me and Steve a pinch and said it wouldn't really do anything and went off laughing. Steve and I looked at each other and were like *shrug* and ate it. We hadn't had sex yet but wanted to and planned to try and do it on this trip. We went off to the bedroom, but it was two bunks. Ezra and his friend were wrestling on one bunk. Steve and I kissed, but then next thing I knew, I woke up to Mom checking our hair and mouths crazily (looking for pot). I was on the floor and Steve on the bunk. My head felt weird and I just sort of looked around confused. Also, earlier there had been a 'pop-up' to choose between one thing or a free meth lab (think like Tropico 4), and I chose the meth lab because it was free. Steve, who was then not really Steve, was unemployed and poor etc. He was using the meth lab to try and get some money. There was a big bag of powder which he said he had 'found' and I was worried it had been stolen and people would try to get it back. Later, I was working somewhere on first shift with Esther and Hector. I had to park near the staff parking, which was underground and near a pool. I walked up and there were a bunch of photographers waiting for something. Esther and Hector were there and I joined them. We had to watch some announcement before we could go in. There was also this big ball that had been found on Mars and people had unravelled it (it was like metal strings) and it turned into a piano.
