I was in this place and I was monitoring,. It was like a shelf with stacks of tea bags. They were four deep and maybe 8 high stacks. They were right up against each other. Somewhere along these stacks of teabags there were also some other things like bags of M &amp; M's. There was something else but I don't remember what. Even though they were teabags and candy, they were meant for these babies we were caring for. They were like health supplies or nutrition or something for these babies. There was a baby that needed one in particular and we were out of that one or a baby needed something and we didn't know what or maybe I had given the last of what that baby needed to someone else. Then there were these little packages of something like lifesavers. They looked like lifesavers but they were more like sugared jelly candy in mini-rolls. I opened one up to show someone what they really were.
