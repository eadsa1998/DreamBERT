I sitting in a bus with Pedro and others. He says, "I wouldn't be around disabled people except it's my job and I have to, so I make the best of it." I feel a little hurt but also glad to hear the truth. "Ah," I say, "I've felt that and it's nice to know that's true." It is a heavy and good emotional moment. It clears the air. A man driving the VW bus parks it. From where we are, we can see the beach and ocean. It's night. I sigh. Pedro says, "This is where my wife and I park and neck." I laugh and say, "Maybe we'll do that in a few days (because we're going to a conference together). He and I laugh together. It's a joke to ease any tension. Then I sigh and say, "I'd really like to go on the beach." I think about how hard it will be to walk. Then I'm sitting on top of the VW bus. Cory is going to drive it off a cliff. He's all happy because one doesn't have many opportunities to do it and it's fun and perfectly O.K. to do. I'm scared and as we fall; my stomach does flip flops. As we hit, the bus starts to roll over on its side. I hear Pedro and friends yell, "Roll away from it." I do so. I am unhurt. Cory gets his leg caught under the bus. I go quickly to him and gently pull his leg out. I feel the fear and guilt from the people on top of the cliff. I see that Cory only has a scratch and is O.K. I pat him and offer him my other pair of crutches. I signal "O.K." with both hands to the people on the cliff. Co-worker Josh is first one to arrive at the scene. I remember thinking, "Of course, he would." I feel a little annoyed at myself for having to be the one to signal O.K. I'm always taking care of others.
