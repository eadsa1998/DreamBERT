I am living at my grandmother's and am single but I just had two babies, a boy and a girl. They are not twins. WE are in a field sitting on a hill. My grandmother, Uncle John and I, and Kevin, my old boyfriend, comes to visit. Kevin gives me a kiss and I cut it real short. He asks when he will get a longer one and I say not with all these people. After they go in I give him a long kiss and decide to feed the babies. (The babies are not his. I don't know whose they are.) I go to feed them and they look unhealthy like they have not been fed. I cover them up because they look cold and try to feed both at once. Just then some children come and want to see the babies.
