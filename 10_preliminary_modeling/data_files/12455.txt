I had S+E and Ms Corbett wanted us to stay in the library during lunch. I had to collect paper and I had to keep going through the library. Calvin came. The library was different. Pieces of paper from my dream book and stuff were falling out. Someone asked me something about going out with Payton. I was like 'What the hell?!'. I went over there. Payton and this girl had found a dream of me going out with Payton. I tried to explain. Ezra, Nicolas and some others took off with my bag. So I went to the Year 8 block. The playground was knocked over. I asked lady about the Year 8 block and then I saw black smoke, so I ran to Yr 8 block. I jumped on this thing and finally got to end (there were lots of jumps and stuff). Samantha was in this box thing at the end. She started eating this thing and others came and they were all eating and I realized eating meant death. So I survived.
