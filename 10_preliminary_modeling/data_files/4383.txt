["Dead body in the river."] The beds for Charla and me are being remodeled. She's been sleeping on the dusty floor. And I had to be next to her area of homemade wood slats and a mattress. Now the new beds are made and I sleep in her new bed. This seems kind of selfish and I think oh well, she is used to the uncomfortable floor anyway. Then a man is in the room and he and I are making love. Charla is gone. We are trying different positions and then he puts himself in a position where his back is on me so I don't get any pleasure but his penis is up and ready to be stroked or licked. I complain this isn't fun for me and we quit. I feel frustrated. Then a woman comes in and demands to know where the body is. I feel caught realizing I'd thrown the dead body out the window into the river. Now I must escape out the window&gt; I end up in a bed like barge on the river and the current is increasing. potential danger of rapids. I see a crowd of people and we must somehow avoid them. I feel the ironic justice of being on the river, the same river I cast the dead body.
