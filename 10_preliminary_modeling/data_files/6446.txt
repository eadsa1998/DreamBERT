I'm in Patrick's "hovel". Patrick has built a bizzare little house for himself among the roots of a huge oak tree. It's one main room and a couple of side rooms. Patrick has died, and in his will he left me my old Apple II+! I turn the computer on and begin poking with the files "on it", as if it had a hard drive.
