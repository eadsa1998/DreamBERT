I'm at a small rather shabby wood-frame house with a porch. The second room on the porch is mine. I'm with other people and there are guests or somebody like visitors anyway. There's some organized affair going on, don't know what. Some of these visitors are in the first room (my brother's?) and they decide to go through the connecting door to my room to (confer?) and I don't want them to. I firmly explain that they're to stay in this room. My brother has a confrontation with a mysterious stranger - blonde man - My brother prevails (though it wasn't a fight) and he (or we?) have to figure out what to do with him(116 words)</span
