I was in the Albert gymnasium locker room. There were some men who seemed to be on the basketball team. One, although I do not know him personally, I had seen before. These men seemed to be in a state of rebellion although the exact nature of it is not clear. Someone gave me a knife that snaps open quickly by pressing a button on the side. I held the knife in front of me and made two of the men move. One of these men was the one I had recognized. The knife kept closing on me and I had to open it up by throwing it out with a motion of the wrist.
