I was at some sort of art exhibition with my parents.  Originally I was not impressed.  It was just holes in paper, organized in a certain way.  Then I returned to the entrance and my old best friend's mother Dena held up a really interesting piece.  It used depth and layered colored construction paper.  The exhibit was arranged so that you could make your own art.  You pick up a piece at each station and add it on.  I think I started with a grey piece of plastic that was shaped sort of like a toy bus.  The supplies were quite ample.  There was a big bin with electric drills and whatnot so you could connect pieces of plastic.  Some looked really neat.
