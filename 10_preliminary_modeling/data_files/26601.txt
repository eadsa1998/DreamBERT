 I'm at an ACDC concert. The band is on stage singing a song entitled "Burning The House Down". I'm one of several people that have extension flags: long poles that extend and have orange triangular flags attached to the end. We tap and wave our flags according to the Yankee Doodle song. Then, Julie Nichols, an acquaintance, is the matchmaker. She comes on stage to try to match people up. I know she's going to involve me, and I don't want to be a part of this publicity. I flee out the back. I'm the bass player for the band. I leave even though the band will be without a bass player. I run away in the rain.
