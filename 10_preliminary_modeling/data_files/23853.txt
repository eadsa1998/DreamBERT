Driving, traveling across country, in a desert area.  Felt like I was moving, but I didn't have much in the truck.  Felt like near El Paso or Carlsbad.  Then I passed out or blanked out and my truck was taken.  All my stuff was put into another vehicle.  When I became aware, I was in the back of another truck with two guys,  someone else was driving, and all my stuff was there like it had been in my truck, set up the same way.  The guys were leaning against thin mattresses propped up against the side just like I had them in my truck.  It was okay.  But I was pissed my truck had been taken.  I was just trying to figure out where we were, a way to solve this.  Then the two guys were gone.  I went up front, made the driver tell me where we were.  I think I looked at a map.  I asked him or told him to get out and he did, kind of sheepish.  It was kind of accepted that I was entitled to take over this vehicle since my truck was taken, or they had taken my truck.  I was then pedaling this vehicle, it was a struggle, hard work, and I was thinking how could I ever get across this whole area by pedaling.  I missed my truck.  I stopped or slowed down to let Risk out.  A Latino guy came beside the vehicle, put his hand on my breast.  He was nice, he said "perro" to Risk, and a whole sentence in Spanish.  I stopped.  I let Risk out.  I found an old, sort of antique cello in the back of the vehicle.  I talked with the guy about selling it for cash, we sort of hooked up together in some manner to make cash.  He understood pawning, and knew how to make quick cash.  He told me the cello's value, what we could probably get for it.  A partnership was possible with him, traveling and making cash.
