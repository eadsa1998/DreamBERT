["Burt Lancaster and me."] Burt Lancaster/Archie sits next to me. He is very attracted to me. He is smiling and gently and pleasantly insistent. I am shy and unsure. I withdraw and he pursues me. Everywhere I go he is there. Slowly I am drawn to him feeling attracted to his physical beauty as well as the loving feelings he is sending out. I begin to wonder if there is something nice I can do or give him, as I appreciate the strong loving feelings he gives me. He is constant. I like it.
