 I'm on a walk to Mud Mountain. We're going to do a side trip to Davern's Tavern, but will start from Lake Vera. We walk around the ridge, looking up on the ridge to see approximately where the cave is. I'm with my friend Reed Maxwell. We're in a fairly flat, gravely area with a stream running through it. My friend Sarah Reed and her friend ride up on bicycles. We stand around in this flat area. It's a bright sunny day. I'm wearing my green wool hat with a white t-shirt tucked in the hat, falling down over the back of my neck and shoulders. I'm wearing cheap large black sunglasses that block out all the sun. I have a camera that I hold out in front of me, pointing it at myself to take a photograph. Sarah is behind me and will be in the photograph. When I'm about to take it she pushes me forward. I lunge forward while trying to take the photograph. We're about to walk up towards the cave. I see my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer and one of his friends riding on bicycles up towards the cave. They get off their bicycles because it's too rough and steep to ride, and they carry them up. We get over to the base of the ridge. Sarah says we have to go past ten poles. There are steps leading up and around the ridge with poles marking the side of the track. The steps are wide, wooden, and completely enclosed. We get a bit up on the track and there is a view of Mud Mountain with Oak and Maple trees in the foreground. Their leaves are changing color and the green grass is neatly mowed. I take a photograph. The landscape is cartoon-esquely surreal. At the top of the stairs is a shop/tourist place that is mostly empty. It's made of stained and varnished hardwood. There is a cafeteria-like area. My roommate Glen Ryan uses the toilet there. I think he must be defecating because in the bush that is the only time one uses the toilet.
