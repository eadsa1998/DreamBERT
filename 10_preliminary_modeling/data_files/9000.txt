All of my dreams last night seemed to have been about my online store. It seems that I had a number of items that sold, but only parts of each one sold. I had all of these pieces left and I realized that I should have done the listings differently. As it was I was just combining these pieces and reselling them in a way that I now realize I should have done to begin with. I am feeling absolutely sure that now that I have learned my mistake that I will sell all of these without a problem.
