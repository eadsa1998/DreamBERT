I was in the hospital where I work, I was going down the hall with my friends Penelope and Virginia. We were going to the cafeteria for lunch. In reality I frequently have lunch with them. We were walking down the hall when suddenly Virginia and I ended up in her car. Penelope wasn't with us. Virginia and I were suddenly up in her car and she said "Lets not go to the cafeteria, lets go out for lunch." And I said "fine." We were driving somewhere to go to lunch and this song came on the radio, it was not a song I had ever heard before, it was an instrumental, it was very strange, it almost sounded like sitar music, like Indian type music. She liked it but I didn't, but I was in her car so I couldn't say a whole lot and I said "oh" and then it paused and I thought it was over and she said, "oh no, its changing, it'll do a variation, you'll see what it does." And the tune it was playing, when it first came on the radio, it was in a major key and then they did the same thing over but it was in a minor key. The same sort of tune but it was in a minor, it was very strange, and I woke up before the song ended, I was still riding in her car. The senses I used were hearing of course, and touch, I could feel myself sitting in the seat and walking in the hall earlier in the cafeteria I could feel my shoes on the hard floor.
