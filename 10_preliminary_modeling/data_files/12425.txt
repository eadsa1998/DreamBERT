I was at school and talking to some people. At first, Year 11 and Year 12 people took the bench, I sat down with them, and then Evelyn did. Calvin came over and he called Dmitri over and some others. A girl there was talking about someone called Eugene and she said to me "Not Eugene Pritchard" and I said "I don't care" They asked me if I would go on a team for my "boyfriend" etc.
