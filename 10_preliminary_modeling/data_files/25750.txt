 I'm at Fishing Haven in my truck with a load in the bed. I am on a dirt road. There is a female teacher with a class of grade school kids there. They are sliding down the road. There is a trickle of water running over the rood that they use to slide on. I see a slide and hit her head on a big rock. A boy gets hurt too. Later, I learn the final injuries are a girl with a broken arm and a boy with a broken thigh. I think that a broken thigh has got to take a long time to heal. I park my truck and put on the parking brake. The truck starts to roll back towards the class, which is behind the truck! I press the brake but I can't stop the truck from rolling. I bump into the kids behind me. The hill I was rolling down starts to go up, so I stop rolling and settle into the bottom of the valley. I look down at my bright yellow sleeve and see it is soaked with oil. I am next to a lake, which is on the side of the road. I jump into the lake, yelling, to distract people from the fact that I just bumped kids with my truck. I wash my sleeve and all the oil comes out. I dunk my head under the water. I get out of the water and apologize to the teacher and the class for bumping them. I'm the in the woods, and the class is going away. I have an erection that won't go away, even though I just masturbated. I walk with some logs to get rid of them. I see a cute chubby baby boy who is one or two years old. He is standing. I go over and take his hand and walk with him. I realize that he must be a part of me. I pick him up carefully, so as not to make him cry. I realize I am dreaming and am cautious about waking up. I fly with the boy. I go through a small part of our garage at home, and then make it out into the open. I go high in the sky, in the clouds. I can't see far below because of the clouds. I think I might scare the baby if I go too high.
