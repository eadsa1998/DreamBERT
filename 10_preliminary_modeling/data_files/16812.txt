My dad grabbed me and kissed me hard on the mouth. It was a passionate kiss, though his tongue did not enter my mouth. After he kissed me I looked at him kind of shocked, in amazement. He said, "Just remember, a kiss is never what it seems." There were other people in the room. Some of them were cousins of mine. They all burst into laughter. Then Gerri, one of my dad's ex-wives and my cousin, Mary, were going to the store and they wanted me to go with them. I realized I needed money. I asked my dad for some. He said, "What about those quarters I gave you, don't you have enough?" I counted the quarters, I had one more than I needed. I said, "Yeah, you're right. Actually, I'm fine."
