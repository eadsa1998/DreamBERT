I asked two fellows the name of the two winners of first and second races today. He called and gave me the names. I was in a dark cave and was it dark. I could see only a little thru some cracks to daylight in the roof. I saw a big tall horse and a tall man leading him to the racetrack. I saw Tom Mix and his Tony. We hauled a racehorse in a trailer and we also carried one to the track. I saw female horses in a field. They were big and the horses were built like women. They were nude and did they have big rumps. The male horses were on our side. I saw a fellow chopping with a hatchet and he chopped into his foot several times. I could see that he chopped his foot up.
