There was a man in his late 5Os to early 60s. He had just gone to the doctor and gotten this special medication called Cornico. It was a very secret drug, or so he thought. When he walked outside he saw a midget that apparently was taking the drug too. The old man expressed that he was resentful about the midget getting the drug, to some younger woman. She explained that it didn't seem fair that he could be the only one who deserved the special drug.
