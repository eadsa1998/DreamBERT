I was in a room. I had a bed, TV and I was lying on the floor with a pillow. I was dating a guy who looked like a young Rupert Everett. I thought he was gay but he came in and we started flirting and kissing and we had sex. I was then at Nana's. I was rolling around on the floor with a pillow, thinking about him. Nana walked by the window and I thought it was zombies at first. It got to 2pm and I said that I had to go home because I had a test. Dad and Ezra were like ok. I asked Nana if the internet was fast enough for Youtube (it wasn't) or if the scanner worked (it didn't). I panicked and said we had to leave. It got to 2:50pm and I said I'd just have to do the test here.
