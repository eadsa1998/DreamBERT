 I'm traveling on train tracks. I'm riding a huge thick (4" in diameter) black, cable-like structure. I'm bringing my power source with me to get far enough, as if I'm dragging an endless supercharged extension cord. An electric cable is my main power source. I ride up and down on this huge cable, in a sine-wave path. There is some rebound, some slack, when I go off the top of the peaks of the cable. This is not good, I know. It results in a ripple-like effect as I descend into the downward portion of the wave. It would be easy to get off the track, and all the loose track-like wooden structures would pile up like in a rear-end car accident. I realize I'm going to be late. I worry about getting all my reading done. I'm going to be tested at 3:22pm, on the article I'm reading. It is written on a long, white piece of calculator-like paper. I skim the article, not retaining its contents. I go to the end of it, which is page 103, and see that I have finished it. I think maybe I should go back and read it over. I need to hurry to make the test. I go to a house. They give me a ride from the house to the place where I think I'll be tested, which is a town 11 miles away. We drive. The house I'm looking for is three down from the one I went to. It is number _ _ 23 (maybe 4223). I get out of the car and ring the doorbell. I man answers the door. His teeth are clamped together. He had surgery and has braces. He got drunk last night, and he's sick. They have a dog. The man is expecting all the people to be tested. I say I've come alone.
