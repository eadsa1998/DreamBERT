At this point all I can remember of my dream last night is that we were all sitting around in the living room naked, like we do talking (?). And there were these people outside kind of milling around. A little later on when we put our clothes on, they ding-donged the doorbell. They kind of said that they were looking at us and that, I don't know, one guy was kind of real sarcastic and said, "I made __________ over there." And then they got a little more serious and said like, "Well, you guys just ought to keep your pants on," or something like that. When we were out in the back yard and Dad wanted me to carry pepper spray when I go places, and I said, "There's got to be a better way to defend myself." And, I don't know, he said something crazy like, "You'll scream and you'll get maimed and killed." And I think that I woke up.
