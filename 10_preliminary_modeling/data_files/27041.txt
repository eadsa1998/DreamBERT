I was apparently visiting another college. I don't know which one or why. For some reason I was in one of the dormitories, trying to find out what the rules were regarding late nights. Nobody seemed to be around. Finally, I found a girl who was sleeping but who awakened as soon as I came into her room. I apologized for waking her and asked her about the late nights. I don't remember what her answer was, but somehow it came out that this dorm was named M. H., at which I was very pleased, since that is the dorm I live in. As I was leaving her room, I remembered that I had her scissors in my hand (I don't remember why). I took them back, assured her I hadn't meant to steal them, and went out. (I think that this was only a small part of a much longer dream, but I can't remember the rest of it.
