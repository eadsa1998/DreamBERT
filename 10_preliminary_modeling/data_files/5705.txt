I dreamt that I was typing medical reports at work which is what I do. Sitting at the desk listening to the doctor's dictation, with the headphones in my ears. I was typing a report about a woman who had twins. The woman's first name was Tina and she had a cesarean section and she had twins. I was talking to my friend Louise whom I work with, I was mentioning that this lady had twins and I was typing, and all of a sudden, somehow, and don't ask me how it happened, I ended up upstairs in the hospital bed, and I was the one who had had the twins! Twin boys and I named them Kyle and Kevin. I don't know how I got to typing at my desk to being the one who had the twins, but that's what happened in the dream. The senses I used in this dream were primarily hearing; I could hear the typewriter typing, the dictation, Tina talking to me, and upstairs I could hear the babies crying, and the nurse talking to me. I was laying in bed, I could feel the bed, earlier I felt myself sitting at my desk, and typing. It was strange but pleasant.
