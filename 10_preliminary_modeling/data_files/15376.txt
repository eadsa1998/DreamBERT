I killed someone and the news people swarmed the house which was tiny and like a caravan. Mom made a lasagne for people but we had something else instead. I left at one point and ended up at a school. I had to go in and it was 3pm so everyone was leaving and everyone recognised me so I ran trying to get out. I had a pocketknife thing and I used it to make people get away from me. There was a guy and we ran through a dark tunnel. I used a LED light and my phone to help me follow him. At the end, he believed I didn't do it.
