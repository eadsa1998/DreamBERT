I was on a train and I found out that I was going the wrong direction. I went outside between the cars to get ready to leave the train at the next station. A girl about 7 greeted me from a running board about 3 feet above the floor. She seemed very sophisticated. I was afraid she would fall when the train jerked. I had a desire to hug her, but I thought how fragile she was, how a piece of iron from above her could crush her. When the train stopped, I had a desire to stay on with her, but I decided to get off as I had planned. She seemed a little disappointed that I was leaving. I walked through a dark street. I saw a shadow move and I thought it was a child. But when I came closer, I saw what appeared to be a pair of wings.
