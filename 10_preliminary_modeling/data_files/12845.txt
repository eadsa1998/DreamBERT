I was watching the first episode of Sister Sister with Ezra. The 'new' twin was changing the house around. The 'Dad' (all the characters weren't the real ones) was a principal. The new twin told him to chuck a party at the house. The old twin was saying how big her mother's bed was. Then we were playing a game in this dark room. We had to catch the bad guy. Then it was real and someone said that the "killer was already inside". Later, Ezra and I were playing. He caught me, but he thought I was Nicolas.
