I am privy to being around the President of the United States. He has selected a new cabinet, new things are going to happen, or there is a potential for it to happen. I am introduced to them. They are powerful and I'm not sure if they'll be good powerful or bad powerful. The First Lady comes in and greets a man, one of the new cabinet members, in a old friends kind of way. She waves at his wife, also her good friend. The President introduces her jokingly as the Last Lady. I sit on the floor, cross legged and informal, watching all this and aware that although I am not really a part of it, because I am being permitted to hang around, eventually I'll make my place among them. A woman comes up. I see she has placed a wrinkled brown paper bag on the table near my place setting. I open it and take out a pretty brown and olive green wool suit. I know she is taking me under her wing and is trying to spruce me up, I say, "Thanks," and then say, "but be warned, sometimes I deliberately wear polyester!" To make a statement, I'll dress "inappropriately."
