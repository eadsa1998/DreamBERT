I was at this Spanish class like take in Westport High School, except it was at this dingy old house and I was coloring in a color book, and it was a coloring book of like Bible stories and stuff. And I had been there for like three or four hours just doing nothing, and I was going to call home, but for whatever reason, I couldn't really dial the cell phone. It had all this like Spanish instruction stuff on the display and we couldn't really, I don't know, you couldn't really get out. And then I realized that I had to go 1 and 7, 2, 7 and then 8212610, and then I was able to get out of all that messy Spanish stuff, and I can't remember if I actually got to talk to anybody, but then I woke up.
