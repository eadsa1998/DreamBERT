I gave birth. It was painful, but not as bad nor did it take as long as I expected. My baby was about 5 inches long, tops. Pocketsize!  I feel like it was a boy, though I don't remember anything in the dream specifically telling me so. It was mostly just really tiny like a hamster. It had my boyfriend Jeremy's skin tone.  I swaddled up the baby and stuck it in my pocket. Never did name the little thing. Went somewhere- not sure if it was school related or what, but we were in a place first with bunk beds, then stadium seating. I was sitting next to my godmother Melinda Swenson.  At some point a while later someone said something that reminded me- I had forgotten about the baby! At some point I remembered and hurriedly pulled him out of my pocket, and unswaddled him to make sure he could breathe. I think he was swaddled to a tortilla chip, actually.
