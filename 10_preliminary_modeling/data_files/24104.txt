I am at my parents' house and I have been gone for a while. I am excited to see my parents and dogs and I walk into the open garage. My dad is there and I say hello, but he just ignores me and looks angry. I walk inside to see my mother and she is sitting on the couch, looking very worried. I ask her why she is worried and she never really answers the question. I go back into the garage and there is now a pool table in the garage. It is covered with papers and other bits and pieces of things. Around the table are both my parents, my girlfriend, a few friends, my brother, and my professor. Everyone is talking about something and no one is telling me what the hell is going on . Finally someone tells me that one of my other professors has accused me of cheating on some test of hers. I remember the test clearly and I know it was easy and that I did not cheat. I get very pissed off because I will not graduate if this goes against me. I demand that I should get to take the test right now, telling my professor to, "Give me the fucking test now and I will fucking ace it again." Mostly I am pissed off, not that I am accused of cheating, but that there is always some way the school has screwed me over because of someone else's mistake. I was bothered that no one would tell me the facts of the matter. Everything people said was so cryptic and consisted of half-truths and B.S. It was frustrating because I felt like I have enough things to deal with beside false accusations and other nonsense.
