I dreamt I was in Dunkin Donuts with my boyfriend and my friend who had just come back from the Marines. Only I thought my friend from the Marines was my boyfriend. Then it switched to me lying in my bed, thinking that the phone was ringing. It was my friend Jen and I thought it was 7:00 in the morning. I was asking her why she called me so early in the morning. Then I really woke up and the phone was really ringing. It was 1:30 am.
