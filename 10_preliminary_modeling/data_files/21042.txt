I drove to the gas station for a recharge of my battery. I put a silver dollar in my readier just to hold in the water, but it slipped out of my fingers and I dropped it into the bottom. I saw a case of beer. It was to be a party for my wife's shop. Chipka had a wash machine. He had a register for registering the rental fee and he watched how the price went up to what he paid for it, then he would be happy to see that he was gaining money. He was waiting for $24 to pop up. We walked by for presents. I got 2 popcorn balls, then the man called me back and took the popcorn back and gave me a poppyseed roll instead. I was eating it as I walked back. I went into St. Andrew's Church. People were going to confession. Steve came in and got in line of confession. I had the car in the garage for some new parts.
