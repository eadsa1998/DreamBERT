I had a paint brush and painted Kogler's legs with iodine. He said it burned, so he went into a small pool in the yard and was swimming around it. I was watching a manager of the Cts. He was planning on how to save some time for the company. He bent some sheet metal by his desk and made the platform shorter. This he planned was saving the company a fraction of a minute an hour. He looked at his watch and asked me what time I had. I said 15 minutes to the hour and he had 12 minutes to the hour. I met Charlie Charvat. We got some paint and were going to paint a concession stand. I saw water squirt up out of a down drain of a building. It did that for a few times. There was a house on the ground that was blocked. I picked it up and it was moving me around from the pressure. I hit the nozzle on the ground to free the object that was blocking the hose. The nozzle came off, but the hose was still blocked. I laid it out on the ground and ran away because I knew that it would break from the pressure. It started to spring leaks and we ran away. Tony Marlot was selling bread. He was talking with Carter. Carter hit her on the wrist. I said, "Cut that out. Someone will blame me for that." Then Ann laid down on her belly and Carter put his hand under her and felt her breasts. I had enough. I came up to Carter and said, "This is the last straw. I am through with you. So long." I said, "Ann, you come along or I will be through with you also." I was walking with Frank Kogler.
