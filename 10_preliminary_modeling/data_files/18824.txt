I dreamt I was at some kind of a fascist rally, and it was being conducted by the author Ayn Rand. It was a very similar setting to these old film clips where there are rows and rows of men in perfect unison in some kind of stadium or big open theater, and this Ayn Rand was conducting the rally. I believe I was just an observer; I don't believe I was taking part in it ... that I was just watching all of it.
