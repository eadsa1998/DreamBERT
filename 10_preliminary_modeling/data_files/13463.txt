Mom, Darren and I were in a car. There was one of those things which go down to stop people going through. It hit the back of our car and screwed it up. It landed on the side of the road. This other car came past and got chopped in half. I realized what was going to happen and cried out. The people died and this other drove by and ignored us. Later, we were hanging around. Mom left but Darren stayed. I went to get a cord out of the car.
