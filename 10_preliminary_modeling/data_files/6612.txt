Before the oral English exam I was to help give, I am on my way to take language requirement exam for Ph.D. Come to open door and start to go in but say, "Oh, we shouldn't pass through there", but a man says, "Yes, you can pass through." We stop and talk and he shows us things. I keep thinking that we'll be late but keep on...We should be there by 9. At last we leave and do arrive late in empty classroom. The examiner (my dean?) comes in and I ask if I shall withdraw while he tests S but he says no, he'll take both of us together. I had been looking at her Japanese books and had planned to cram while she was being tested and so am disturbed. I have done no reviewing and can think of only one Japanese word, "Sayonara." He goes out and a number of Caucasian students begin to straggle in for class. When he returns I protest that I don't think I should be required to take the exam as I already have my Ph.D. He says he has nothing to say about it but did the office insist? I say the office had not ordered me but they had told me to go and try the exam at the station. He suggests I might find out at the office. Then I see Stoddard and say, "I haven't seen you for months."
