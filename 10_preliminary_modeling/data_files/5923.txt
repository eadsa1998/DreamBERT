Am in a crowded room of some woman's house along with other people, all strangers. Center of floor is piled high with used, old, damaged items, such as furniture, all property apparently of a former occupant. I suggest to a woman that she clean it up and give her a hand. I pick up a small toy, like a child's tank on treads and wind it up and set it on floor where it chugs away towards a man sitting on a carpet. I see two guitars, both broken and useless, but I hand them to some people laughingly telling them to go ahead and play a song.
