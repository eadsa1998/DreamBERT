I was in the car with Mom. It was night and it was windy and rainy. We parked outside of North Midvale as there was an ATM on the other side of the road (it was right at the corner before that bush thing). Mom went out to it and I locked the doors and it was really creepy. She finally came back but there were some dodgy people nearby. She got in and we quickly locked the doors again. We both then imagined all this stuff that could happen.
