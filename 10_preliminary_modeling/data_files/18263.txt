I had a fragment of a dream that was fairly interesting. There was a large cathedral that I was going thru. It was part of a monastery. And the monk in the cathedral pointed to this round stained glass window and wanted to know if it would be alright if he put his own image up there. And I thought it would be. So he caused, just by standing there looking at it or pointing at it or something, the window to -- the design that was on the window -- to disappear, and his face to appear there. And there were two very bright blue eyes on the, in the window. It was still in stained glass style; it wasn't just an exact reproduction of his face. And as we watched these eyes and looked at the window, they got larger. There were round and of a very vivid blue. And they started winking at us. And you could tell both by the -- well, by the very quality of the blue, you could tell that outside it must be a very beautiful day, because of this great light that was coming thru them.
