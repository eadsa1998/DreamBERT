[2nd dream] I came to the table set up on the lanai Sunday eve. The rest had eaten and complained that I hadn't told them I'd not be there. I said I had told Mrs. M. and the waitresses but then I saw my orange and sandwich in a white bowl and said I must have forgotten for I took my supper. Then I found that they had been at my things opening cans etc. From one I took a cookie. I complained they had no right to do so and tried to fit lids on again. Asked about a can of tea on my shelves which was not mine.
