We're in Europe, I'm tired, and Mr. Dell is reading off his plan of everything we're going to do that day. We're leaving one hotel to go to another, but I think it's ok to leave my luggage there, for some reason. The next thing I know, we're on what I think is a bus, and in the back they tell me that I left my cats at the hotel. I think Mr. Dell gave them to me, but they were all tied up so they couldn't go anywhere, like one of their legs was attached to the face by rope. It looked very uncomfortable and I felt bad for them. Then I think I put them in a bathtub that was there, and Mr. Rosetti comes walking by. All of a sudden the cats are little insects (one of them was a small pig), but I didn't think anything of this change. So Mr. Rosetti walks into the bathroom, sees the insects, and I know exactly what he's about to do. I shout "NO!!!" but it's too late and I start screaming and crying hysterically, "You killed my cat!!! You don't understand that was my cat!!!" So I'm crying and walking up toward the front of the bus telling everybody what happened, and Monica hugs me and I suddenly feel better, not even sure if I remember what had just happened, and I say, "You comfort me."
