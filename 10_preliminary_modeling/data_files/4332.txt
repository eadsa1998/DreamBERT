["Conference time."] I am at a conference. A man tells me everything is free. The meals, snacks, whatever I want. He explains it is free because he had an old high school buddy make the arrangements so we get a special deal. I am helping him shuffle the papers of the accommodations. I notice I shuffle two different piles of papers. I say oops. Shuffling is a great skill, unless you mess up and put different things together. Then you have to take extra time to undo the mistake. He helps me as I tediously go through the pile and pull out the incorrect papers, receipts and so on.
