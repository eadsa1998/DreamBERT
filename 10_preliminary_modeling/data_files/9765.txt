I am moving furniture in a strange apartment: at Angie Steele's (?) (Marissa C's sister) - we move the couch to a different wall; the stove and eating area are at far end; we sit and talk and I explain why we have to move.... - Then write letter: ending with "MAY YOU FIND JOY &amp; RENEWAL OF CHRIST'S GRACE.... In His Name we ask it...."
