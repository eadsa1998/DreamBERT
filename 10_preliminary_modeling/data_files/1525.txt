An Uncle is going to end it all by blowing himself up. I feel sad and then nonchalantly decide to do it myself and set the bomb for 12:00. At about 8 minutes before it's to blow up, I am quite calm but decide to not die. I am talking to my "mother-in-law" on the phone and leave her mid-sentence to stop the timer. Now I am safe. I go to see my Uncle to convince him to live. He (now my Cousin Abner) agrees and says he'll move in with me. I am delighted, although even as I'm saying there is plenty of room, I see all the beds full. Now I'm on a huge carnival ride on the top of a tall building. I am terrified. It slings me about as I cling as hard as I can. I feel sick with fear and think, "If this is adventure and fun, I don't want it."
