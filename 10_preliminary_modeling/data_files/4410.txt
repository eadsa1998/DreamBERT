["Howard and Hawaii."] Ellie is in the room with me. I am needlepointing stitches on a canvas. Howard comes in. Ellie asks where in the whole world I would like to live. I say Hawaii. It is warm and nice there. I notice the yarn I am using to needlepoint with is not set right. So I begin to pull it out to fix the stitch. But it frays and so I am going to snap it apart and do that part over again. I am amazed how hard it is to break. It stretches and stretches until it is one tiny thread, hanging on. Howard offers to help. I say, stubbornly, I can do it. Finally, after struggle, I break it. Ellie is talking about going back with a previous boyfriend. I am upset with her for even thinking it. She mentions a man's name. I say don't you remember what he was like? It would be stupid for you to go back to him. She has curly short hair. She is adamant she will go back to him. I disapprove.
