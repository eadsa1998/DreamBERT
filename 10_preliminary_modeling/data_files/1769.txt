I'm in a group of people, and I am explaining to them how disabled people don't like it when people rush up to open the door for them. I see lots of the people raise their hands to add comments and I say, "Yeah, I know what you're going to say. You are just being courteous and would do it for anyone, not just the disabled. But I'm talking about beyond normal enthusiasm." I decide I need to go to the bathroom. I ask the way. I go down a long hall, in a sports department or a gymnasium at a college. A man shows me the way. I'm walking and wonder if I'll have enough energy. He opens a door and I see a basketball game in progress. The man points to across the room. We walk right through the middle of the game and get to the other side. We go down a dark dingy hall to the women's room. I go in. It's a huge room with one toilet. I sit. A woman came in and I wondered where she came from. I see a stairway up to the "real" bathroom.
