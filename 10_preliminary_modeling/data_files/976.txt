Eating dinner at M City house. I'm eating a hot dog. My father yells at me to sit down and eat right. I am standing and freeze mid-bite. I refuse to knuckle under. He says, "If you plan on living here, you'd better do as you're told." I just glare at him and take another bite. Then I get up, go upstairs, pack some things into a few boxes, and stalk out of the house. I am righteous. He's amused; he thinks I'll be back soon. I'm scared. I have no money, no place to go, and I have heavy boxes, but I am determined. I see a motel. Some guy comes out of a room and sees me. He says, "Running away, eh? Well, I'm leaving for the night. You can sleep here." I'm tempted but decide not to because I could get caught if they get a new customer for the room. I go down the elevator. I feel brave because they might ask me what I'm going there. I see the word "lights" in the elevator. I walk all night, carrying my boxes of things. The next day is a school day (M City High). Apparently, I remember I have a car. I put my things in the car and go to school. I get a newspaper between classes to look for a place to stay.
