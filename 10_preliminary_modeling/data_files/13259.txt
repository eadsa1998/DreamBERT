Ezra, Mom and I were at this place which was a sort of train station platform. There was water in the place where tracks would have been and it was green. I fell in, but got out. Uncle Gabriel was there too at one stage. I had some sort of disease-y type thing like vertigo. I was telling someone that I got it after watching Vertigo. Clayton was then there and we ended up at 'school'. Then we were at the platform again and the water was gone. I accidentally left my bag down there and I went to get it. There were puddles of water still there which was this green stuff. It was like poison ivy. There was a place where you slide into water. Mom and I were there. Then it was a spa and a pool. You could change it to different water. Isabel was there. Calvin was in the spa. He said "someone actually likes Jared Leto". He said he was going to call him Corbin. My leg kept going 'behind' me. There was a strange video of this fat girl's friend's mother.
