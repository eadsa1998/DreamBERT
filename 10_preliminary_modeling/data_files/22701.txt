I dreamt that I was in an artistic festival, and a boy I like was dancing in one of the groups. I was very excited and I asked my friends if he was interested in me, if he looked at me, etc., etc. I dreamt about a friend of mine who was getting married. Generally, I don't remember dreams and if I remember now, it's because I am making a mental effort. The people were all young, the place was a movie theater, there were many people (artists). Then a group came out and danced an extravagant modern dance, a strange one. I was with girlfriends, but I don't' know who they were. It ended and I don't remember more.
