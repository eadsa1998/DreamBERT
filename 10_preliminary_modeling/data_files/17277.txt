Looking across a lake at a very small castle.  A blink and it would change...the memorial building, some other castle...The problem was how to get across and 'finish' it.  My core teacher Sylvia's version was the front of a castle and a roller coaster.  It was created from having drawn the front, though, and when seen up close, only the drawn parts were complete.  We needed other views to finish it so it could be whole in 3 dimensions.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I and some others, the family, I guess, started walking around on it.  Into the forest.  There were occasionally some run down huts that we walked through, and as we tried to make our way out, there were snakes.  I was in the lead, going fast and unable to stop, and having to avoid the snakes on short notice.  There were some colorful lizards as well, like a monitor.  I was worried about Jeremy because he doesn't like snakes but I was going fast and had to keep my eyes in front of me to look out; I couldn't look behind.  I just hoped that everyone behind me was watching where I jumped or skirted.  We crossed a little run down bridge and ended up somewhere with some people who knew what was going on.  Then we had to go back part of the way we'd come, back around the snakes.  Finally we were out.
