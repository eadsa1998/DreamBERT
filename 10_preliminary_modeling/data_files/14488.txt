I was at Nana's. There was a girl talking to a guy to get a movie part in the dining room. He told her to take her clothes off and I told her not too. Later, we were out the back and I can't remember but he got something and was trying to attack me with it. I got this "triple fly swat" and hit him with it. We ended up on the ground and to save him another whack, I hit his eye and it turned white and he was then blind. I was like "I'm sorry!". But he got up with his weapon and I ran in and told Nana to lock the doors. I asked for the car keys so we could try and leave.
