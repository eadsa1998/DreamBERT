[1997-06-18] I was outside, walking with my cordless phone talking to somebody on the phone and suddenly it stopped and I was wondering, why did it stop? I called the operator somehow, even though it stopped. I asked why my cordless wasn't working and the operator asked me what kind of music I liked listening to and that was it.
