I saw four fires and all were started by two firebugs, two of them by each firebug. I was unraveling a salesman's traveling coat. I ran and flew to each fire and also yelled fire each time. I was a soldier and we were being trained. I was watching a man work. He was sitting on a chair. I looked at his legs. His calves were shriveled and so thin. He had nothing but bone and skin. He got up and when he tried to move, he had a hard time moving his feet. He got tangled up with his shoes. He fell down on his chair. Ann tried to adjust his chair, but couldn't. She called for Mike to come and help her. I was working at White's again. We finished our job for the day, then I went to see one of the personnel men and he said he would put me on a job on premium. I said, "It's okay, just so it isn't a punch press." I went downstairs to change my clothes. I walked thru a hallway and I came to a school room where boys were being schooled. Then there was a torture room and I was one who was going to be tortured. I was waiting for my turn. I went outside and the lake was frozen over. People were skating. I saw Whitey Volker and another man. I talked to them. I had a stick and it was candy. I licked it.
