I was in Canada at our summer home. I was riding a bicycle through the mountain roads to Montreal, which was about 60 miles away. When I began riding, all was fine, but I came to a steep hill and I had a hard time to ride to the top. I had to get off my bicycle and walk. At the top of the hill were some people and a big dog, a German shepherd. I had a towel in one hand throughout the dream. I couldn't find my wallet because my back pocket was ripped off. I finally found my wallet, which was in the cuff of my pants. I remained on top of the hill and the people and the dog were gone. I began to keep riding, but then my bicycle fell apart, and the pieces looked like a broken lawn chair with pieces of aluminum, bars, wheels all over the ground.
