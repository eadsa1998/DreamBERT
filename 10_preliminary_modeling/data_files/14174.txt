I was with Sam and Dean (both Supernatural). Something was killing these people and we went to investigate. We were talking to some people, all girls. Sam and I kept giggling. They gave us this rainbow coloured band and I put my finger on it and pulled and it was squishy and we laughed. The killer thing was a blob. I think it was killing people who had a disrupted childhood and I thought that Sam and Dean would qualify. It started chasing us and so we ran off in the opposite direction to the people it was chasing and then it disappeared. Sam started making faces (like in the bloopers) and that model pose. Then I was playing a game in the sky. You had to make words out of the letters but it was going too fast. At the top of the screen (and the top of the 'word tree') was fruit.
