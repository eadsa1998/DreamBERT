I was babysitting for Matthew and Michael A, but I had to prepare for a show. The show or meeting was to be held at my mother's hometown at a VFW hall. I was having trouble getting ready while babysitting. I asked Aunt P and Aunt H to babysit at their house. They agreed. A short time later, they showed up with Michael A. They were having a difficult time with him. He said he wanted to see me for a little while. A short time later, I went outside to take him back and they were sitting in the driveway waiting. Later, when I left to check on them, they were in the driveway again. This time Aunt J was with them and a fourth person I can't identify. They were having a lot of trouble with Michael A. The fourth person was finally able to pacify him. She gave me directions to the meeting. I went to my meeting. Theresa Ah had made some suggestions for my meeting and the signs. The meeting room was much smaller than I had expected. There were no signs, but the room was full of people. I was supposed to dress as a man. I was only half dressed. I took Michael A back to Theresa Ah and didn't tell her what a problem he was.
