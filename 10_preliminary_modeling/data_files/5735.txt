[1997-05-19] I am with my son at some school activity and we were supposed to meet with some important person, maybe the principal, I'm not sure who, but she wanted to meet with us in 5 minutes and she said it was very important that we be on time, but I had to stop and go to the bathroom, and my son wanted to stop and do a few other things, and I kept thinking we've got to hurry up.
