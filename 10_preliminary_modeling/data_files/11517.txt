I was climbing up a very steep hill trying to get a hold of a tree when I lost my footing. The next thing I remember is holding onto a stone dangling from a very high cliff. I looked down to see how far it was. It was so far down that I couldn't see bottom. I knew I would fall eventually. It was just a matter of how long I could hang on to the stone. I became very frightened when my arms started to get weaker and weaker. I finally let loose of the stone and I fell through space. I had a dizzy feeling as I was falling. I was awakened just before hitting bottom.
