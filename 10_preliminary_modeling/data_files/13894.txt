Ezra, Mom and I were in a car. I found out that Michael C. Hall was at some place, so I went there with a friend of mine, who was actually Katherine Heigl. This black guy was guarding the entrance. When I got in, she wanted to meet Michael straight away but he wasn't there yet. I was thinking of Comic-Con and Jewel Staite. My eye started itching and it got bad. There was random furniture around. I looked in a mirror and my eye was all red and there were all these pimples on my face. Michael got there but he was also sick, as were some others. People who weren't showing symptoms got tested. Katherine walked past me and I told her off. This Indian woman was with us. I was talking to her and she looked up at the ceiling behind me, so I looked and then looked down and Michael was standing there. I jumped and said "you scared me!". Then the place was actually in the water and they were testing different areas of the water for poisonous areas. The Indian thought she had been bitten by something.
