I was on a bus at the university and it was waiting for people to get on. Calvin came on first and was covered in spider webs because of something that he was doing. Alejandro was also there and had to speak another language. He put his bag on the top shelf (shelves were in the bus, like on planes). My class was huge. The girl sitting next to me was Matilda. Classmate-F-20 came in and she was jumping around and did a spin and fell and people laughed. There was an interview thing on TV with Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Mom was admiring him and I was like 'yay there's information on John Winchester' and 'yay Winchester'. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki were in the audience and he called them his family (jokingly).
