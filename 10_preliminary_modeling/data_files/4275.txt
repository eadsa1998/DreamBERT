["Beautiful me and no dance partner."] I am at a dance. I am young, slim and beautiful I am wearing a velvet black evening gown, very form fitting. A diagonal line of spangles across the midriff from breast to hip. My hair is lovely. A touch of red velvet in the form of a small evening purse completes the outfit. I stand and watch the people, looking for the man that will come claim me. Several rather ugly men come near and look but turn and leave me standing there. I am relieved they didn't choose me and feel a bit lonely and rejected. I conjure up a man who looks like Robert Downey, very handsome. He begins to look at me possibly interested. In the dream I wanted a touch of red and thought up the purse, and I wanted a man who looked like Robert Downey to be there and he appeared.
