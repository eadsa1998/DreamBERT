I was called back to work to White's and I went down to see about it. This time I had to go or it was quits with White's. I met Ed Larson in the office. He sat there doing nothing, disgusted. I shook hands with him and said, "Well, I have to come back this time, and I had 5 years or half of the pension at Dill's and now I must lose it." He said his wife had to do the same thing. Then I saw girls come by with dress designs parading by. The last two girls were, to my surprise, the tallest people I ever did see or dream of. They were about 12 ft. tall. I looked back, amazed at their height.
