I was watching Prison Break. T-Bag had a lot of different disguises and voices to use for different identities. He went to a hospital and there were some kids. He was pretending to be an Indian doctor and he called them to help them and was speaking in an Indian accent. The kid recognized the voice though. Eugene had had a dream (while he was in prison) about an assassination attempt on the president and it mentioned the dream on the news. There was a bloody dude called Billy in the dream. Later, Mahone dreamt of it too. He was on a rooftop or something. He was with Sucre, but then it wasn't Sucre and he turned around and Mahone shot him four times in the back. Later the president, who looked like/was Mahone, shot a friend four times in the back and then laid him down and shot him in the head. Three kids nearby saw and one ended up dying. Mahone and Eugene had a gun fight. Mahone pushed the other two kids in the way and Eugene shot them accidentally and they died. The president was involved with this girl, but he didn't trust her anymore.
