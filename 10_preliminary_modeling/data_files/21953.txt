I saw the double in tropical and fairgrounds, but I can't recall them now. At fairgrounds the names were supposed to be like plastic or something of plastic. It was a present or gift in a package for the first horse. There was a changing of the names to tropical. My car radiator was leaking. I filled it and ran it for a while and then looked into the radiator and the water was gone. I filled it again and ran the engine again and it was empty again. I looked under the car and didn't notice any leaks. In the other part of the garage there was a water leak out of a faucet or a valve disk like. I tightened the disk and the water stopped from leaking. It was not hooked up with the car water system and I was puzzled how the water from the radiator disappeared through that disk in the garage.
