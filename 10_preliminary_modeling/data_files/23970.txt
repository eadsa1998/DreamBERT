I am looking at a slide, holding it up to the sky for light. It's a picture of Serena sitting on the ground. She's wearing a bandana on her head and she's facing away from me. She's wearing a shirt with a design on it that is strange. Somehow I can see through the design and I can look into outerspace. It is pitch black through the shirt with little stars twinkling. I can see right through her into another dimension. The cool thing is, is when I move the slide to a different angle - I can see Serena change angles. It's as if it is a movie instead of a slide. But the image only moves as far as I move it. When I move to a different spot I can actually walk around in the world of the image. I think of how I want to have a picture like this of Walter. I would walk around and the image would adjust and I would be able to see him in San Francisco even though I was in New York. [Serena = friend; Walter = long distance boyfriend]
