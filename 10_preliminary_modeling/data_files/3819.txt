["Addicted to meds."] I am upstairs only its not a full building. Rochelle gives me some chewable tablets. Licorice in flavor. When I have them, I am OK. I can walk around and function, but I run out. I try to walk downstairs to find Rochelle, but I can barely walk. I am trapped and desperately addicted to those tablets. She gives me some more and I rush back upstairs. Rochelle pushes my hand and makes me drop the bottle they are in. I desperately try to retrieve them from the floor and cut myself on the broken glass. Rochelle looks at the wound because I say there are bits of glass in it. She probes deeply and I see the muscles under the skin. I tell her to stop. She is cruelly being too thorough. I beg for more. She has cut me off.
