Ann and I were walking thru the slums. I was leery of being robbed. I had money on my person. Then I was with my brother Steve. We came to a manhole or some hold in a grating. We looked thru it and there were two men down there. We wanted to go down there. I yelled down and one man didn't want to move. I was going to drop in a rock. There were a lot of weeds on the grating, so we made a fire and burned the weeds. Then we were down in the hold. It was like a cave and there was a cafe there. I saw a door down there. It seemed to lead outside. Steve washed the dishes and then went out. He had a rifle in his hand and we walked bravely.
