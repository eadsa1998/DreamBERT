 Groups are forming based on dream content. My friend Tom Napper forms a group for people whose parents have been involved in gambling. I reluctantly get into a group that is based on sex. My classmate from Brimson Annette Trantor may be in the group. I think my sexual dreams are very revealing of me, which is why I'm reluctant to be in the group.
