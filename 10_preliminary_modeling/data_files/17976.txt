I was at the observatory, getting ready for bed at 5 in the morning right after work.  I was just getting ready to get into bed when I noticed movement in the room across the hall.  Someone else was staying there.  I went to close the door to keep the noise out when I realized the room was open- I had roommates and couldn't shut out the noise.  The walls were blue.  There were two kids and two women I think.  The boy blackmailed the girl for her toy.  I tried explaining to him that I had worked all night and needed it quiet so I could sleep, but he couldn't seem to grasp the idea that some people work at night.  There were four origami flowers in an arrangement on a small table.  I left the room and walked around a courtyard with a fountain in the middle.  It was still dark.  I had my retainers in.  A golden retriever was peeing on a pump of some sort.  Some drunken men start to question my authority.  I think they were standing near a convenience store even though we were still up on the mountain.  I reminded the men of the laws they were breaking: "public inebriety, causing a disturbance," and I was still trying to remember the technical term for another.  I walked down a couple of steps on the other side of the fountain from my room.  There was a gated driveway like to an apartment complex.  My lunch cooler was sitting on a step.  As I stepped down, Alan Alda approached me from behind, coming onto me.  He mumbled something to me explaining his actions for coming onto someone so much younger than him, and part of it had to do something with being in Korea.
