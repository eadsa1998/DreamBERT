 A man has captured a girl, and maybe others. I fire shots at a vehicle with a handgun that they are driving in. People are all around. I yell for someone to call 911! There is a young girl there. Being captured has hurt her, but she will be okay. Her name is Jasmine. She has dark skin and eyes. She is very innocent looking. Lots of other people are there to help. We sit the girl down on my backpack, as a cushion, and instruct her not to move so she'll be safe while we look for the man. He legs seem to have been sliced off and reattached, like in the movie Gattaca. The girl tries to move, and I tell her not to move! I know the man drives a light blue car, like a hatchback. He may have a hostage and is nearby. I yell this information out to the other people there. Jasmine hears me and yells back, "Oh, thanks Kenneth!", very sarcastically, implying that she doesn't want the man to be captured, that the capture of this man somehow has negative consequences for her, or that his escape is in her best interest, as if they are partners. I have my old classmate Jeff Grace stay with Jasmine.
