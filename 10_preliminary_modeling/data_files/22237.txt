Today I dreamed about Mary again. I dreamed I was sitting on a park bench around the Alcazar movie theater and then she came over to me. Then I blushed and didn't know what to do, until a friend of mine arrived and he told me several things that made me change. I told Mary that I loved her and she told me she would think about it. Then several minutes went by (I don't know exactly) and I realized I was alone.
