A man, dark-complected and rather stocky, (probably an Italian) enters a building and goes immediately to certain law offices (or to a court room) regarding some estate money belonging to a 13 year old girl. He seems to be a capable lawyer, and experienced in business, for he has everything settled in a few minutes. The girl is now sure to receive her just share of an estate. He comes into the lobby and, near a doorway, greets the girl who is accompanied by another girl of the same age, and by a boy of about 6; both with some kind or problem (i.e., money from estate). The meeting is held in the lobby rather than in the girl's rooms, as one of her relatives is ill there, and meeting the dark complected man is deemed inadvisable. The little boy has his head thrown far back and looks almost straight up.
