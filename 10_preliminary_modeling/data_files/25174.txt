 I'm near train tracks. Metal posts or beams run along the tracks. I am moving along the tracks. The beams seem to shift in and out. I need to get through their fence-like structure, but I'm afraid to get hit by one when I jump through. I avoid the jump and go down some subway-like stairs to the left of the tracks. There is a mirror in the room at the bottom of the stairs. I go back up another staircase, and see men sitting on cement blocks. It is the Olympics, I think. I realize I'm dreaming. I am going to shoot the people. I reach the top of the stairs and am going to shoot them but have no gun. I run and leap off the castle wall-like structure the men were sitting on. I fly. Looking down, it's thousands of feet to the ground. I'm really high up. The wind is strong. It gives me a bad feeling to fly over places like England, Japan, and Springfield. It is windy there. Some places are okay.
