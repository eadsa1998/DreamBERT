We (the family) were sitting on the first floor. My father, sitting at the head of the dining room table suddenly rose, shrieked, and collapsed onto the floor. He turned completely white. When I reached the scene my mother and sister were bending over him. I pushed them away and kneeled down beside him. It seems as if he was suffering a heart attack and I took it for granted he was dying. My mother and sister were crying and I was pleading for him to be all right when I woke.
