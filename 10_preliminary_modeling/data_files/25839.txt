 I'm at my Grandparents Redding's Farm. There is a horse/dinosaur beast. It is huge and gray and black in color. It looks thick skinned and strong. I go to pet it, thinking of it as a horse. It's huge neck and head knock me back. I'm lucky I don't get hurt. It hurls things towards me: large objects that I avoid. One object crashes where the barn used to be. I run through the chicken coop, as if I am being chased. There is a thin wire, taut, at the end of the coop that is basely visible. I see it and turn. My friend Tom Napper is there. We give each other a high five. Someone else from Brimson is there. I'm driving a van along the dirt road that leads to the Redding farm, as if I'm going to town. There is a gap in the road that I jump. It was there unexpectedly, after rounding a corner. I'm climbing in a sand dune area. There is a pool there. My uncle Dannie Redding is there. One of us has a yellow and green drink with pineapple served to us by a waitress. I argue with my mom about drinking alcohol at parties. My sister Ramona takes part in the argument.
