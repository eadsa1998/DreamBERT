I ended up at this place where they were doing an Absolutely Fabulous live show. Jennifer Saunders and another woman were there, along with their husbands. Adrian Edmondson didn't look like himself at all -- he had hair, which was grey, and a beard thing. Rik Mayall joined them and he looked very Rik like. There weren't many people in the audience. I left and Mr Ripley was outside. He said I should ask for some detective to 'partner' up with for work experience. I was like 'ok...' and I figured someone had told him I was doing forensics, but I couldn't be bothered telling him I wasn't anymore. Mom called him asking whether I wanted her to pick me up and I said that I drove here myself. We went to a bakery and I wanted some hedgehog slice or a brownie but there weren't any. There were a lot of chocolate-y things though, including mudcakes.
