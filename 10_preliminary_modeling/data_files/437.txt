I was at my house in my home town and I saw the guy I had been dating. I was sitting down tying my shoelace and he turned to me and smiled. He came over and started to talk to me. Then I was inside a boat, trying on an old formal dress. There were other people with me helping me with the dress. One of them, a male, was looking me up and down. He wouldn't take his eyes off me. It felt good after being rejected.
