I call a TV repair service to fix the TV. It took a long time but the service man showed up. After considerable time he was done and he presented the bill. It was outrageous to me. There were three items and two seemed reasonable but the third was excessive. I talked to the repair man about this. He showed me a part that seemed like a simple plug. I did not pay the bill but said I would contact the owners. I asked if labor was included and he said no. The repair man had been to the house before.
