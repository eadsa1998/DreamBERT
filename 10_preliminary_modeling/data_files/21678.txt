Audrey was in the dentist's. She had a stem or branch of her teeth growing out about an inch and about 1/16 in diameter. She had two in the front upper teeth. I told Dr. Cooperman about them and he looked it over and said from her baby teeth. I said that would have to be cut off. We were riding in a streetcar and Bob left his shoes in the car. So I went back to the streetcar which was small about 8 passengers and I got his shoes. I was looking at a drawing of the city CTS railway. I told Audrey to go to route 306 and drive on it to her designation.
