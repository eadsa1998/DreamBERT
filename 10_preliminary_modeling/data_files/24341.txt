We found ourselves captured by natives. Or captured, and we had just escaped. It was in a swampy area near the shore. We were pushed up against the water. Me and perhaps two others. They were coming out of the forest all around as we were on the shore, which was covered with seaweed, leaves and sticks over the sand, all of it heavily matted, like on the edge of a mangrove thicket. My first impulse was to stand and fight. But the captain said watch out -- they had poison darts! Indeed, the darts were flying. He picked one up off the ground and showed me. There were perhaps hundreds of darts flying from the thicket toward us. They all missed. If I was hit, I didn't notice. I couldn't see the shooters, but I knew they were there, just beyond the tree line. I picked up a long, hollow bamboo reed, and picked up one of the darts from the ground, loaded it through the spongy back cover of the bamboo, and fired it back in the direction of the attackers. It hit him, and he reacted in disbelief. He emerged from the brush and fired back at me. I didn't know how long it would take for the poison to take hold, or if it had been washed off when it stuck into the ground before I picked it up.  I dodged multiple darts. Then another warrior came out of the brush, this time with a spear. I ran at him, from the side, and wrestled his spear away and turned it on him. With this weapon, I attacked perhaps two more who came from the trees, stabbing and slashing. They went away and we were ok, for the time being. I looked at my fellows with a sort of, I told you so -- we could fight them off, see?
