I am driving with friends in a desert like place, come to a very steep place, a narrow wall, sheer drop, no road, therefore must turn around, ask God's help "You can do it." I turn around and take the plunge and come down safely!! Later dream of Pedro in a bathtub at his house, like the whirlpool at the Y. no special ending.
