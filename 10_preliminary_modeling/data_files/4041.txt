["Buddha Belly"]  I am riding a small short stool on wheels. I am outside going down a street. I see Merle in his wheelchair slightly behind me. I wave and smile. I round a corner and now am using two short metal things to push myself along. It is going well. I look to my left and see another man in a wheelchair and we smile and wave. I look ahead and see two women friends, college age. They are seated in an outdoor restaurant. They wave. I nod and go to where they are. Now I am inside a restaurant and passing a long bar with men seated at it. I am wearing a very short mini-skirt. The waist has moved down to  reveal my fat Buddha belly. A man whistles appreciatively. I am pleased. I get to the big booth my friends are at and slide on to the bench. I pull up the waist of my skirt and whisper happily to one woman that I got whistled at. Now three young good looking men crawl past me to sit with the other men  in our booth. I comment on how cute they are. Two other women try to sit on my left. Now the group is moving back toward me and I slide back to the edge of the bench, making the two new women move. It is all very friendly.
