Some crazy guy came over looking for Mom. Her car was here, but she wasn't. I told him this and he threatened me with a knife and I told him again. Then he drove off and Mom came back. Mom and I went to the shop, a deli, and they had Blade costumes. There was Blade and some fat lady one. Mom got Blade for me, size 69, which was really small, though it was a large/medium. Anyway, it was too small and I wanted to go back but she didn't. Then I was at school wearing it and then I scared some evil spider off. Jayson was writing something about his birthday and I said I forgot to do that this year and he thought I was just copying him so I got on the computer, but could only find prev [can't read, starts with a p, and is possibly 'previous']. This happened at a cemetery? The crazy dude came back. Someone had a baby. Johnny Knoxville was there, but he was some "Apple" guy. Then the father of the baby got killed. Johnny put his clothes on and sat in his truck. It had a big playground area for an animal on the back. I saw him and he motioned for me not to tell anyone so I didn't. I got another costume, which was size 71, and it fit. Some people came and we said the baby was dead. They thought it was a joke and we made them run through the house to get out and then I found out that the baby was alive.
