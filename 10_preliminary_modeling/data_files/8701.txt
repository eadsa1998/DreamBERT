Darren had taken a shower and broken either the inner shower rod or torn the inner shower curtain. He didn't say anything about it or do anything about it. He just left it that way for me to find and take care of. When I went to take a shower I found it and had to take care of it before I could take a shower. I had to take both curtains and rods down and put the inner curtain on the outer rod and just leave the outer curtain down completely. I was very aggravated with him for doing this, for not saying anything and for just leaving it for me to take care of. It was so like him. I went to bed for the night, not wearing anything as usual. It was so hot, even though I had the air conditioning on and a fan on that I didn't cover myself even with a sheet. I saw Darren at my bedroom door. He paused for a moment and then I thought he was coming in to get in bed with me. I was extremely upset but when I tried to move or speak to prevent it I couldn't. This happened two or three times.
