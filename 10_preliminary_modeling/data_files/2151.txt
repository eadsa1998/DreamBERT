I get in a small row boat and go out to sea to climb aboard a yacht. My hands have a hard time getting up the hand holds and I nearly give up and fall into the sea, but I persist and get on board. I'm a stowaway bound for Europe. I hide in a cabinet and listen in to conversations. Finally I have enough information I can blackmail the captain so he won't toss me over board and I get a free ride to Europe. He likes me, but does power play games with me like putting another woman seated between him and me and watching my reaction. I smile. I know I have him.
