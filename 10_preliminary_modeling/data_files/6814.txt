We were outdoors and want to find a house to rent. 3400 and 38000 are for rent. We are at about 3200. I say I think we can walk there. (Yesterday looking for3450.) We start off at the level but soon are in a big building. Going upstairs on an open plank staircase. We have gone back too far. It must be further front. Retracing steps.
