 I'm riding a motorcycle and being chased. I ride on top of buildings and jump off roofs as well as on the ground. I end up in down town Wilmerton. There is snow on the ground. The person that is following me is there too. We pick up an item of glass off the ground form the alley we are in. We go to a gathering. I am with two others walking into a gymnasium. My friend Gino Teavor and his parents are there. They say good job to us. We are football players, and are like high school heroes. I shake people's hands. I talk with my dad and my brother Wally about fishing. My dad has a lake map of a new lake. He wants to go fishing at about 6pm. The lake is 50 minutes away.
