I was Seabird and the cabins were like huts and really stingy. There were chickens wandering around. I was at school and it was in a shop or something. I was in class and I had just finished drawing a picture of an ad with Calvin. I went to the desk and Isabel sat in front. She started drawing in one my Logic Problems books. I got angry and chucked a spaz and Jayson was there. Then I saw that my drawing was ruined. Isabel said "Is it late?" and I was like "What?" I was wearing a skirt and I had my period. In the classroom, a phone rang.
