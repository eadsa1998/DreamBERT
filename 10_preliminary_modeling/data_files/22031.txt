I was on the Southern highway, on the side of the road, hitchhiking to the North. A motorcyclist who had not wanted to stop for two people who were ahead of me, stopped at my signal. I had three sticks of cane of about 4 yards each, and at first it was difficult to get settled on the motorcycle, which was a Honda 50, of light blue color. We stopped a while to rest, but we were going from North to South, and when we went to a ditch in order to urinate, people from up on the hill started to throw lumps of clay hardened with stones on us, telling us that this was their property. The guy on the motorcycle was able to do it, but I had to get close to a house from where they couldn't see me in order to do it. I don't remember any more.
