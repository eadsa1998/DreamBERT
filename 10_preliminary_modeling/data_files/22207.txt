It was nighttime. Everybody was sleeping. When I heard a noise, I got up and went to the dining room. There, on the floor, I saw my cat covered with blood. I went out to the street and there I saw a bigger cat. Then a boy came over to me. He was Chinese and the son of a woman who has a store on the corner. He asked me whether I had seen his big cat and told me it was a very fine one. The big cat went into my house and beat my cat again. At all this, I felt great fear. I don't remember any more details, except that a candle was lit in my room.
