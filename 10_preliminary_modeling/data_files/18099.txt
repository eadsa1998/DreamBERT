I had a dream last night too, and it was that I was in the mall and I was walking around, and my friend Kirsti popped out, out of nowhere, and she lives in another city, and so she came back. And it was a really good thing, so we walked around together and we talked and we hugged, and then the people in our whole class came -- the girls and the boys -- and then we went shopping. The boys went shopping too. And so the girls, and that was pretty weird. And yeah, it was pretty fun; it was a good dream, especially when Kirsti came.
