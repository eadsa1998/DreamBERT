I was on a train. I had to get some information. Policemen were looking for something that had been smuggled. I left the train, and I saw a man get arrested in a building when he tried to get the smuggled goods inside. later I was on an elevator, then a conveyor belt, and then I was on a steel structure resembling a tower.
