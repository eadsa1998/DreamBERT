Mom and I went on a train because Austin got two girls to go on it and she thought he was going to do something to them, so she gave the girls her keys to her car. Then she went to this car and jumpstarted it. I asked her why not use your car and she said she gave her keys to those girls. I got angry because my bag was in it. I walked around looking for the car but we didn't find it.
