I dreamed about a young lady who was a very close friend of my daughter's when they were in elementary school together, her name is L. L subsequently moved to Florida and is gay. However I dreamed that L was getting married and I don't know if I was the organist or part of the wedding party or just a guest, but all the brides maid were absolutely beautiful and L came out of the dressing room in a gorgeous bright blue wedding gown.
