I was on a train and I had been on it for weeks it seems. I was not upset about it but I was constantly telling all the people that I should be home washing dishes. Then I temporarily forgot about home and was enjoying myself with these people, none of whom I knew, in a big game of cards. What we were playing I can't remember, but I remember I was winning large sums of money and the strange part of it I was very sad and kept trying to give it to the people sitting near me but none of them would take, they just laughed and said I had to keep it. Finally I burst out crying and left the crowd.
