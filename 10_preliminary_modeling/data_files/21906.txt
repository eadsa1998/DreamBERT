A fellow came into the shop with big balloons like a life preserver float on water. I asked him for one and he gave it to me. I blew air into it and the air was coming out of the many shut or cork plugs. It had caps like on a beach ball tube shut off. There were about 5 or 6 of them. When I got all of them closed, the air stayed in the float or balloon. A fellow was parking his car. He drove away and I saw 22 pellets on the street. I picked them up. I also found a bb bullet, a tiny one. I pulled one pellet out of one of the bullets and then threw it down and it exploded. The boss told us to take some kind of material. It was paper or wood. I can' recall now. We delivered it to the woodwork. Later I found out it was delivered to the wrong dept. I met Cecilia, an old friend of my sister Mary from White Sewing Machine. She talked to me and wanted to get the address of some firm that sold 22 rifles. Then she wanted my phone number and I knew why she wanted my number so she could call me for a date.
