Susie S and I are walking along a road talking. I am feeling a bit defensive and hurt as she is saying we have a problem because I begrudged her two hours of work that she felt I still owed her. I say, "No, wait. Begrudged? I don't begrudge you those two hours." I feel a bit dishonest because I do feel I gave her what was required. I try to speak honestly. I say, "It's the sarcasm. I don't deal well with sarcasm, and I thought I had done the work well and gave you all that was required, so I felt hurt." She says, "Then you'd be willing to meet me tomorrow morning to talk this all out?" I think to myself, "I hope not too early," then I say, "Yes, of course. I just don't do well with sarcasm and feeling attacked. I admire and respect you and your work and if you feel I shorted you in hours, I will give you the hours." She seems to understand and says she's sorry she was sarcastic; it is a bad habit of hers. We continue to work it on out.
