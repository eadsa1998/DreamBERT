I was in a small boat and thought that I was in the bay called Guanabara Bay on which Rio de Janeiro is located. The boat was accompanying a larger boat and seemed to have a work to do. But we on the little boat would ask those on the big boat if we might not have those of other little boats do the work for us whenever we met other little boats. Then the weather became too rough for us and we went into the landing. There we got on a truck and rode along the bay which seemed then to be Biscayne Bay at Miami, Florida. There were some other thoughts or actions in the dream that don't seem at all clear now.
