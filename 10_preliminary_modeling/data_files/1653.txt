Merle and I are wheeling up a hilly road. We're going to go swimming. We go into a glass building and see a pool. I tell Merle I don't have a suit or a cap. He looks a little annoyed and says, "How did you expect us to swim?" I shrugged my shoulders. He says, "Maybe there is a suit in the locker room." Three drunk men walk into the pool fully clothed. The owner comes and chases them out. He fires them. I realize that a good job is now vacant, an executive position. I decide to apply. I go into the secretary (Judy) and put in my application. The guy recognizes me and says "Now here's the best expert!" I feel pleasure. It's a vocational rehab job near the University and I'm good at DIS awareness. I whisper to Judy to be sure to tell me as soon as she knows, no special favors, but we are friends. She kind of snickers. Then I go to a room to wait. It's like a spare bedroom in Ginny and Ernie's house. Ernie's old desk, with his name on it. Ellie and the baby are there. I hold Charla. I yell, "Shut up," once and feel guilty. I change her. We decide to go downstairs and have to sit on the desk, which is an elevator. I hold Charla.
