I went outside the apartment. It was night and had started to snow shortly before. The ground was already covered. I was thinking about going somewhere so I had gone out to clean off the car and see how bad it was to decide if I really wanted to drive in that weather. As I got close to my car, it was parked to the left of the sidewalk, one of my neighbors across the street and to the right yelled out to me. I didn't understand her so I started walking towards her saying sorry I didn't understand you. She said it again but I still don't know what she said. As I got close to her I asked her if she was going out in this weather. She said she was going, to a family member or something to see the____. I'm going to say eclipse but it wasn't eclipse because it was night. I looked up into the sky and said I don't know enough about astronomy to know where to look. She said something like you can't see it from everywhere that's why she was going to this other person's house. It was something like you would be able to look into the sky and be able to see something like I'm trying to figure out how to describe it. I can picture it in my mind because when I was looking in the sky for it I knew what I was looking for. I knew what it would look like. It would look like a partial eclipse with a partial arc of light in the night sky. It wouldn't be moving like an eclipse either because it would be in one place for most of the night.
