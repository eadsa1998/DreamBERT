 There is an offer of some kind for a free tin of kiwi or cherry flavored chewing tobacco. My coworker Tom says I should get the offer. Many people are working to dig paths. The snow on the ground is deep everywhere, 5 feet in many places. My high school classmate Binky Ahmed has a snow/ice saw he uses to cut and lift blocks of ice and snow. I shovel part of a path. It is as if we need a base camp in the snow to be able to shovel more snow, so we're shoveling snow for the base camp.
