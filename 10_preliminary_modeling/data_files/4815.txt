I am watching a man, a spy going through tunnels which are like travel portals. He is rescuing a small black girl, a toddler. However, he becomes more concerned about the book he is reading and loses track of the girl and her safety. He calls me and my unit over and gives us instruction for what we need to do to get info back safely. The enemy spies are hot on our trails. We must use a number 2 pencil. We do the info exchange practically under the enemy spies noses. It is tricky. As we are changing our clothes the spies are knocking on our door. It is important we get all these clothes changed before the spies see us. I rush to the door and push them back outside talking fast to give the other woman spy time to change. Then I let them in. They ask to see my computer. I let them. Then another woman comes in and eats a piece of cheese. We secretly shake hands as that was the final part of the sequence. We were successful. The enemy spy, thinking we had mailed something shows us his secret mail device which finds secret mail. We pretend concern. He thinks he's on the right trail.
