I'm having a few friends over - my father, Arvonne, some others. We might run out of chairs. I suggest we move the white couch stored in the hall into the living room so three more can sit. My father and Arvonne, but do it. I go to the dining table to help set up a game and get involved in struggling with the pieces, getting them set up right. Someone comes into the kitchen to get the food stuff out and complain to me.
