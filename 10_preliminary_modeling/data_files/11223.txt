The first thing I remember is that I was on a boat. There didn't seem to be any people on it but me. The boat was moving through a fog, and I was a little anxious about the strange situation in which I found myself. Then I found myself in a strange place, walking down an unfamiliar street. There didn't seem to be anything or anyone that I recognized. Then I saw a man walking down the opposite side of the street who I recognized vaguely as an actor who had played the part of a gangster on TV production a few nights before. This man, when he saw me, took out a gun and began shooting at me. I dodged the bullets and started to run through alleys to elude him. Then I woke up in a sweat.
