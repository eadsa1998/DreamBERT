A young sexy woman (Carole Baker or Marilyn Monroe type) is walking down a city street. She sees lots of buildings, shoe stores, only shoe stores. She looks up one block to the left and sees a bookstore and walks toward it. Then she can't find it but sees very ornate and unusual buildings. This must be the old, historical section of the city. She sees several churches with round designs on them. The church bells ring and she sees a whole line of different sized bells across the street and watches them ring. A small one accidentally pops out of the line and over by her. She picks it up and wants to keep it for a souvenir. She knows she should return it. Then a policeman comes by and she gives her some American money in coins for a tip for being so good. She tries to refuse the tip. He leaves it for her. She also sees some foreign coins and wants to take them too. Some other woman takes them. Now she decides to go into the building across the street. She does. Now an older, sexy woman joins her. They are both the women of this old farmer guy. The younger one is upset and wants to kill herself. She holds a spoon/knife to her throat. The older woman doesn't want her to kill herself so she tries to trick her. She flips the circuit breaker so all the outside lights go out. The farmer and his pals are out there and will come in to investigate. Meanwhile, the older one holds her spoon/knife to her own throat and says, "I know what you mean, let's do it together. I'll kill you and you'll kill me." She looks out the window and sees the guy sauntering in. He makes it there in time. Now a daughter of the farmer is there too. She's a quarter "roon" and lovely. The two other women go out to help her.
