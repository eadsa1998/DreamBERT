I was watching Chuck and a girl asked Sarah and Chuck why they weren't together. Sarah said they were exes so the girl would leave them alone. We had to swim far underwater. There were two others and Bradley was there. There was a graph of emotions for Bill (True Blood). His emotions were all low and he was called something different but because he was so old, it had made his emotions go down which was why he rarely smiled.
