I was out at the local university.  Some kind of meeting was just ending,  It was dark, the campus was labyrinthine, and I couldn't find Mother or Daddy.  I did see Lizabeth Mandle, however, and she gave me a ride.  I thought Lizabeth would be going toward town, but instead she was driving away from it.  Therefore when she asked me where I wanted to get off, I told her she could let me off on the next street over.  The streets were kind of narrow.
