I dreamed I was asleep in my house, and I heard sounds, or woke up and noticed things had been moved in the house.  [Lately I have had little dreams of my things being taken or stolen from this house.  For instance the dream this or last week about finding my antique hats (the pink one, that I have had since high school) stolen and for sale in a store.  I was furious and took them back.  It is disturbing, feeling this threat to my safety.]  I got up from bed and looked over the bedroom half-wall, expecting to see someone coming in the house, and feeling apprehension.  Instead I saw Jean (the landlord), he was putting in three new windows in the front wall, where you cannot see out at all unless the front door is open.  I was so glad for these windows, they were beautiful, three different shapes and sizes, nicely placed, and now I could see out front and not feel so cut off and hidden from the world.  I was really happy about them.  Also I noticed he had put in a front closet in the wall by the bedroom half-wall.  I was glad for this too, I needed another closet to be organized, without my clothes out in the open, to feel really whole and moved into this house.  I woke up feeling like I need to get out more, to open myself up more to the outside world, like those three new windows, to be part of the world here.  I went hiking the next day.
