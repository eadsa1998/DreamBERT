 I'm in a group of people. A woman is in the group. We have just starting seeing each other. She may be a woman I'm now seeing in Melbourne: Jane Gracie. There are bicycles there. I say something about how we're in disagreement: I'm not going to budge, I simply need time for myself and am not willing to compromise. She gets angry and demands attention. I say a few short, blunt words and walk away. I see my friend Jill Banks as I leave. My friend Stephen Ramos may have been in the group.
