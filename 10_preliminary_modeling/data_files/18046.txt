One day a lot of dogs came into our backyard and one of the dogs wasn't nice. So one of the little dogs came up to the fence and sniffed his nose, and the big dog bit his little nose, so I took the little dog inside and I put a little bandage on his nose. Then the big dog bit another one on the eye. Then it was night time and three bears came into our front yard. Then I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the bears so I said "Shoo, shoo."
