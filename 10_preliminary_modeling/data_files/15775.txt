There were zombies. They were fast and dangerous and had been around for a while. I ended up at this building, which was possibly a big school/college and realised there were people there, but they were bad. I heard them coming and quickly hid under this table. A zombie came in growling and I was trying to remember whether they sensed by smell or hearing, but a person came and took it away (it was like a 'pet'). I was sneaking around for some reason or another, but eventually they saw me and started going after me and shooting at me. I was running and climbing over fences and got back inside the building and ended up in this large gym area. There were lots of bits of furniture around (like bookshelves and such) and shelves along the top. I climbed up so that I was up high away from the zombies that began to pile in. A few people got bit and then I had a friend with me and we managed to climb down and sneak out and I pulled them into the toilet that was just next door. The door didn't close properly so I got her to sit against it and keep it closed. I found a button or something and pressed it and it flooded the place with water. Some bits of water leaked into the toilet, but it didn't flood. When it had finished, we got out and climbed along pipes and such to get out. Outside was all flooded as well - the streets were filled with cars and the water came up about halfway, there were also lots of hills and such to walk on. There were still plenty of zombies around and lots of animals. I remember seeing two animals running past us. We wondered what to do next.
