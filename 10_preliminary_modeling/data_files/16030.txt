Tristan was telling me about Floyd's brother who was called Mark and said he was just like him. He was coming over and he was fat and ugly with a weird face. Frederick and Emmanuel were also there. We went to this fair place and I went on this ride and then a guy with a kid ride asked me to go on it to test something so I did. Some little girl also went on a ride but didn't put the safety thing on and it started and they saw she was still standing and not sitting and quickly shut it down. I went past McDonald's with someone and got a chicken aioli wrap.
