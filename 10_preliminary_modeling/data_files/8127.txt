There were two miniature elephants. They were probably not more than two inches high. They were alive. I was in my bedroom and talking to someone about the elephants. I put them down on the floor and they walked over to a small area rug. I saw them entwine themselves in a rosary. They managed to get the area rug so it was covering them up and then they began mating. [Date of dream unknown].
