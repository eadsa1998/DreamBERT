Mom, Ezra and I went through the drive thru at McDonald's except I got a barbeque roller (from KFC). It was going to take 30 minutes and Mom wasn't going to wait so I jumped out of the car and went in. Then I thought I saw Eugene's father Abraham and looked up and saw it was his father and he and his brother were also there. They ordered and sat down to wait. I kept looking at Eugene. His father mentioned his mother and Eugene said "I liked it when she wasn't dead". This ugly freckled girl who worked there asked me if I was going to order or if I was waiting. I said "I've got an order" and she said "Well, you look like a type A, would-," and I stopped her and said I've already ordered and the girl who took my order was holding the bag and gave it to me.
