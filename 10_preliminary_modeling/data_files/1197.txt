I'm at a party. Doug is there. He asks me my opinion on a speech. I had him his written opinion and say, "I agree with you." I notice there are two parties. I become interested in a member of the other party. That's not kosher. Then it's a war. I swim a long way to an island looking for my soldier friend. We meet. I am a general. Their general follows us with the intent of blowing us up. My soldier turns out to have joined us. He finds bullet packs left by their general. He puts them in deep water. We are followed by their soldier. He (mine) says to me, "Wait here. You are safe." I do so, even though I'm visible and in the path, but he is right. The guy doesn't see me. My friend kills him.
