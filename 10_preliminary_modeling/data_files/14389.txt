There was some young kid at a table. Her mother and father were sitting there too, I think with others. Her mother asked her something and something about 'what she loved' and then asked her something else, to which she replied 'you', and her mother thought the daughter was saying she loved her most. But, she actually meant her father. He was molesting her. I think she enjoyed it? When she was a teenager, they were still 'close'.
