I was working with Red. We were cleaning and piling up in a junkyard. I was kicking football with another man. Red and I walked around a pond and there were a lot of snakes around it. I got a razor sharp dagger and I went around and cut the snakes in two. One of them was ready to bite me when I cut him in two. I was in the country. I looked at the beautiful trees and fields. A fellow told me, "I'm going to give you the best selection today, Evans."
