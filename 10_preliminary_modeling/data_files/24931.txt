I went to a huge store with my dad and my brother. We were shopping and I saw a bunch of nail polish. Some of it was hard candy, a brand of nail polish that has a ring on it and it's really expensive. There was a color exactly like the color of my new shirt. There was also protector. I got both of those. Setting: A store. Characters: My brother - 9 years old. Dad - tall. I don't know the other people in the store. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I've been looking for a hard candy color that matches my shirt and protector. It was a great dream.
