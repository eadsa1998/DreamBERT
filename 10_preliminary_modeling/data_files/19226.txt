At home getting ready for my uncle's (who is living) funeral. I can't miss school so am reluctant to go. Then am in a big hall with uncle's casket in front. I go give my grandma a hug and say good-bye to uncle. Am suddenly going up the staircase of the chapel with a friend, telling her I know how she felt when she lost her dad. We are close to a hot fluorescent light fixture. We limbo under it. In a new school I say I don't know where to go, but surprisingly familiar. I go to my locker.
