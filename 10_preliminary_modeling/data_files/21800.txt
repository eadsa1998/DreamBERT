I was on St. Claire Ave. in Big City. I looked up and a storm was coming. I saw a couple clouds that were black as black paint. I never saw such black clouds. I walked into a room of the shop to look at something that I thought was not functioning right. All at once I heard a shot like a gun. I looked on the floor and there was a safety belt across the aisle to signal anyone who stepped by it to be cautious of dangers. I walked out of there and when I got outside, I saw a colored boy running by with some building material in his hands. Frank Lasko was running after him, so I took after them. It was night. I had a flashlight. I put on the light and its light gave a good glow on the schoolhouse where the boy ran. Later he came back with his dad. He surrendered and was going to bring it back. As we walked back, the street was muddy. I looked at a tree which the leaves and part of the branches were falling off and there was a pile of black leaves about three feet high under the tree.
