Rob and I - we each feel the fertilized seed inside me.  It doesn't dawn on me that I'm pregnant til later.  Then I'm very upset.  He is calm.  I thought I could give it away somehow before it starts development.  After stressing about the impending abortion, it suddenly hits me:  I don't have to give it away.  This is Rob's baby, I've wanted this.  I'd be stupid to give it up.  I can keep it.  In this dream, Rob was thinking about other women, there was this impending future separation, when I would give the embryo to his new girl (or old girlfriend).  [Rob was a major love interest of mine, met him while fighting a fire in California, fell head over heels for him, but he was always 'unattainable'.]
