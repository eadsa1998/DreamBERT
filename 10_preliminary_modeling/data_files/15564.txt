I was at some restaurant place and this room was part of a big building. People from the forum were there and a bunch of us were told to wait outside. I knew bal3x was there and I wondered which one he was. I sat on a chair and there was a wall in the cinema in front of me with a mirror on it, and I could see Benjamin sitting down behind me. He looked into the mirror too and I looked away. I put my feet on the wall and this lady yelled at me, like 'don't put your feet on my belongings'. I moved to a chair so that I was facing the other way. Benjamin was moved and told to sit next to me and he sat 2 seats away. His friend came and was Neil from The Inbetweeners. They joked about us not talking. Benjamin and said Neil didn't like my profile picture and that 'he liked the one with sin' and sin was some Scottish word. Neil said Benjamin and said 'she looks so normal'. Benjamin said 'then I met you and thought you were the most not-normal person!'. We laughed and continued talking.
