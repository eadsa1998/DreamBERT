There was a party in a large room with few people. I was dancing with my boyfriend, and suddenly I was about to leave. I was going up some stairs and I thought that he would be angry, but it didn't matter to me. Later on I was with a girlfriend in a place with lots of light (at the beginning of the dream it was nighttime and now it was day) and he arrived, laughing. I was surprised to see him like this and that he would not say anything to me.
