I walked into a small apartment lighted with a dim yellow light. It is well furnished and the most conspicuous thing is a maroon davenport. On this sits a short dark-haired slender girl. She is very pretty and stimulates me sexually immediately. She stretches and says something to me in a foreign tongue which I answer but I did not understand it. I remove my coat and throw it on a chair and sit down next to her. Suddenly I feel very sorry for her and begin to cry and say, "It's all my fault. They'll pay for this." I take her in my arms and stroke her hair at the same time, muttering, "You poor unknowing, unseeing little creature -- what a damned filthy trick." She then says in a very sweet voice with a slight French accent (I once was quite familiar with a French-Canadian girl with a French accent), "It is all right, Jimmy. Soon we will be up in the sky again." I woke up, feeling very blue.
