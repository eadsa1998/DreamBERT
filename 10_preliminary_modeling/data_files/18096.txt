I had a really bad dream last night that we were at a house that we actually lived in and it was right next to the beach. And there were lifeguards everywhere because people swam at the beach. And my mother was sick and she died, and I don't know what it was from -- dysentery, I think. And so we went outside to get the lifeguard because I wanted her to do something, but I didn't get her soon enough because my little friend, her name was Nori, she was in the road; she was going to get hit by a car. So I picked her up and I put her in the house, and then I went to a store and bought food.
