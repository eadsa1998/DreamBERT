There were these three or four older teenage boys that were kind of hanging around my house, and later I learned they were band members. And this one -- I can't remember if he was Derek or Justin or something -- but whenever I would see him in the yard, he would always want to like pat me and shake me around, and not really beat me up, but pretend to. And then I would kind of elbow him off and pretend to punch him or something, and he would just, he would not give up, no matter what. He was a pretend fighter. And I was in the yard, and I didn't want him to get me, so I went in the garage and I closed the door, and I was in there with the chickens for a while. [laugh] And the next morning I was with him and all his friends and we were happy as can be. We were sitting around on the picnic table listening to some rap song on the garage outside system that we used to have. And we were like writing songs and stuff for this band, and I was like ready to play the drums [laugh] on the picnic table. And I don't know, but some time before that I was working in the kitchen and I lost my thumb, my left thumb got just sliced off by a knife, and it didn't hurt me too bad or anything. I was just going around without a thumb, without a left thumb. And they called me the thumbless tin smith [laugh]. That was pretty cool, I thought.
