There were two girls walking behind me. They were talking about me. It didn't register, though one thought I had overheard. She came up to me. She said I'm sorry for my friend. She's like that. Though she was hitting on me too. I said I didn't mind, and asked them how things were going. The taller one (first girl to talk) asked if that happened to me a lot. A little embarrassed, I said, yeah, this is the third time this week. We kept walking and made small talk.
