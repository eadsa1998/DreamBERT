 I'm driving a vehicle. It is winter, and is snowing and icy. There is a bad car accident that we drive past. Police officers are there. I stop. An officer tells me to help by cutting off the leg of a rabbit-deer that is partially frozen into the ground but it still alive. I get a saw from someone nearby. I cut a leg off. It is still alive and it squirms. There is a man frozen into the ground that someone tries to rescue by kicking the ice around his head. This seems like a direct but dangerous way to go about rescuing him. <br/
