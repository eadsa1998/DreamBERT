I am in a movie. I play one part in the morning and go to another set to play another part in the afternoon. I dress up real sexy. Three guys follow me into the elevator. I avoid eye contact to let them know I'm not interested. One guy opts to get out because I'm so cold. That's the same floor I'm getting off on, the 3rd floor. I flash my wrist to tell them I'm OK and supposed to be there. A woman says, "Go get your name band. Tell her (the secretary) your name (character name) is Pandemonium." She makes a wrist band for me. I think this is all a lot of fun, playing different parts and lots of people around me.
