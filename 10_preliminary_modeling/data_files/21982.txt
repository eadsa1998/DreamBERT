I saw a dog digging around a hole in the ground. Something happened. I can't recall not, but the hole was blown up or it caved in on the squirrels. The ground was black like coal dust. One squirrel got out of the black stuff. He was all black. He ran in flight from the dog we could see him run down the trail he usually took. I figured there was another squirrel in the black stuff. The dog grabbed a mouthful of it and I could see a squirrel wiggle in his mouth. He released it and a black squirrel dropped to the ground and started to run away, but his speed was slow because the dog hurt him when he had him in his mouth. So the dog went after him and instead of grabbing him in his mouth, he caught him by the tail with his paw and held him up.
