I'm in an old elementary school, in England, I think. I'm with a friend (Afro-American) and it's late at night. We're sneaking around hiding from this man who's walking around with a scalpel. There are other people in the building and he's rounding them up and telling them to go into the main hall. My friend and I are looking for ways to escape. We hide in a close for awhile and then run out some french doors into the woods. As soon as we get behind the trees the man steps out of the building and flicks on these spotlights which are in all of the trees. We can't hide, he knows where we are. (We're also wearing school uniforms.) He's now walking into the woods towards us with this silly thin Exacto blade scalpel -- it seems scary.
