I am a beautiful fold singer singing for a very colorful crowd of 90 people all crowded, standing around me. At first they look like colorful cloth objects. Then I see they are people. I have dark slightly curly long hair. I play a mandolin. My playing is intricate and beautiful. I manage to get unusual melodic complex sounds out of this simple folk instrument. The audience loves me. I sing song after song. I see the scene now from behind me. I see a cloth spread out with cassette tapes of my music to sell and food and a big glass bowl of water for the audience. Now a tall good looking man comes behind me and opens a hinged window, like a hatch back car window. This changes the dynamics of the sound and makes it a bit harder to sing. I keep on, compensating for the change. He is interested in me. I am attracted to him. I say I'll sing two more songs. Lots of applause. I sing one of my "favorite" tunes. "Gold Rings." It's about a man offering a gold ring and relationship and I am interested, but then I am glad I refused the gold ring because then I'm free of doing the dishes and helping him and losing my music and freedom. Now the concert is over. A young woman comes up to talk. She wears a large plastic shopping bag over her head. She has a question. Can I tell her how to sing a particular note? I ask her to take off the bag so when we talk I can see her eyes. She shyly takes it off slowly. She mentions a boyfriend. I say, it is possible to have both your music and a boyfriend but you have to decide which one is priority. My music comes first, I say this so the attractive man can hear. He seems to understand. He waits for the woman to go and we walk off together pleasantly getting acquainted.
