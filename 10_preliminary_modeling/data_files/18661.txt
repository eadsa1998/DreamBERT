We were at the beach. I went for a walk with 2 strangers--a guy and a woman. The guy had recently discovered a work habit of Schumann. Movies were playing at the north end of the beach. Playing in the water--scenes projected of houses became real. The girl started whining. Children needed time to learn. We were walking in the shallow, shallow water coming up around out ankles when the girl she understood. The girl threatened and needed to know and told her, "I don't care if you go live in that purple house and never came back." It was over. The waves kept lapping up on ???
