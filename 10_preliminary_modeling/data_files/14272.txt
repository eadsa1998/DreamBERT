I was in the backseat of my car in the carpark at Midvale shops. This guy got in the drivers seat and a girl got in the passengers side. I was like "Hey! Get out of my car!", but the ignored me and drove away. I asked them to drop me off home and they thought this was a good idea and started driving up the road behind the shop and turning the next left. We missed it first and they turned and went down it. When we got there I took out this little hammer and hit him over the head with it, he was just like "Ow!" and I kept hitting him but nothing much happened. Mom came out and I asked her for a bigger hammer and she asked why, but gave me one and I started bashing him with it.
