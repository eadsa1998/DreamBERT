I'm at some sort of public pool. I feel a little out of place. I remember Diana being there and Miranda and her friends. Miranda tells me about a party she's going to that night, that I should come and that everyone will be taking this certain drug. I'm really hesitant. Miranda and her friends go over to a copy machine and pluck one of their hairs, Miranda pulls one of mine. They take the photocopied hair and tear a square off it and eat it and save the rest for later. They say each square lasts a 1/2 hour. <br/
