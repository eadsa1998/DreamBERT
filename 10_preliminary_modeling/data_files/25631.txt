 I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. This area seems like Australia. We're on a lake next to Trout Lake. A couple is there and asks us how to get out of the lake. I say, "The only way out is to portage. It's a hard portage but you'll like it." We have a choice of buying coyote or Squirt pop. We are in a little bay. There is a river flowing in. There is a beautiful pond and a stream flowing in. A person can see their reflection in them. The water is very cold. Kevin and I walk in the stream. I have on my Nike cross-trainers. In the pond I see what I think is a school of eels. It turns out to be a school of suckers. I have been sucking on leeches. I spit them out of my mouth. <br/
