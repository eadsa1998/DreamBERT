Ernie is seated at my computer and working on something to help me get things straightened out. I am at the back of the computer looking at the connections. Something needs to be plugged in again and he says he will do it for me and I say, "No, I need to learn to do it." I plug a yellow round wire end into a tiny yellow hole, and the same with a black one and then I hesitate with the pink one and Ernie says, "Yes, that's right, you've got it." I grin and say, "I only watched it being done before. It's hard to remember how to do things unless you do them yourself." He agrees. I then find my wheelchair, which is sort of folded up like a manual. I struggle to unfold it myself. The backpack, or recharger, is stuck and Ernie reaches over and unhooks it so I can continue.
