These guys were going to breed buffalo or something with chickens for a competition. There was going to be a "buffalo chicken" race or like "best quality" competition. To get them to breed, the buffalo had to run at a certain speed and hit the chicken, rupture the side of it and lay an egg. They were the hardest thing to breed. The first chicken they tried got flung over and died. The next one was successful. People got hit too. One of their mates got hit and impregnated. One guy said "You guys didn't even try to go down on him" and they laughed and said that wasn't the first thing to come to their minds and the guy said "No, like CPR".
