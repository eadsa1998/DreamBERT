The dream takes place at some sort of dance hall which I had never seen before and I was dancing with a girl from my hometown who I had only seen once in my life before. I am dancing with her at one moment and the scene suddenly switches and I am being married to her. I seemed to be very happy in the dream but when I awoke I couldn't figure out why.
