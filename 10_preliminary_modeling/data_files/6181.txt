In the middle of the afternoon one Sunday I fell asleep covered with a comforter in the middle of my bed. Between sleep and wake I felt something walking on the bed. I tried opening my eyes and saw a tail run across my face. It was a [illegible]. I don't have a cat. I was asleep but struggling to be awake. I just felt the bed sinking in wherever it went. It did a full circle around crossing over my stomach. Then it ended up at my right side jumping on my chest in an attempt it seemed to wake me up. The legs were black except for the white [illegible] paws. It kept jumping on me until I put my hand up to stop it. Then I jumped up looked around my bed and didn't go back to sleep.
