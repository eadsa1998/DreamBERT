I was in flight from somebody. I escaped and then ran and flew away from my captors. I came to a cave. It had a door on the entrance and the doorway was full of cobwebs. I brushed them aside and went inside. I looked down a stairway and it was dim, but I saw a figure of man. He was supposed to be a hermit or spook. He yelled up at me, "Now that you came in, you are not going to get out." I started to go out and all at once I was like in a shop and Ed, the coal miner, was trying to keep me from escaping. I pushed him and he fell down, but he held onto me. So I took one of his arms and hooked ist on one of the rotating turrets. He begged me to free him that he would help me to escape. So I freed his arm and he showed me the way to the escape door. I gave him a cigar and when I got outside, I flew over the valley and was repeating, "I'm coming home to my Ann."
