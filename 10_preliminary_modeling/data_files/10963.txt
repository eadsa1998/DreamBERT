I was at school getting ready to go home for vacation. My sister, 17, who lives at home in Michigan was somehow at school in the dorm with me. We had our family car at school but we were going to take the bus to Detroit as I usually do when I go home and we were to drive from there. We raced around making plans, buying bus tickets and checking schedules. Then we went down to the bus station and checked our suitcases through. The only trouble was that we didn't know how to get the car from school to Detroit. All of a sudden I realized how silly we were and said we can drive all the way home. With relief we went down and claimed our baggage.
