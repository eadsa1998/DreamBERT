I am getting young children ready for a hike in the mountains at the Retreat Center: Marissa Camden comes to us and asks "what can I do?" and I tell her: "How about the dish team?" -- shift: in a restaurant With Frank and WALLY, but I don't eat; I only want to get home again. See a widow from Church in M. City who tells me how she cried when her husband died. I leave and find myself in a strange, dangerous neighborhood.
