I was in Accounting, but the class was different. I was sitting at the back next to Jeremiah, who was next to Eugene. It was squishy, and my arm was touching Jeremiah's. I got up and when I went back to my seat, Classmate-F-21 was there and I said "that's my seat" and she didn't want to move. I yelled at her so she got up. I sat down and was trying not to laugh.
