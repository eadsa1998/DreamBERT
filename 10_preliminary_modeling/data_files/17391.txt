I dreamt of cuddling with a big gorilla.  Later it was my old online friend Marty in a costume.  I accidentally left some records there, behind the one-way mirror where he stayed most of the time.  There was a fountain, and Nathan Lane came out and did magic tricks with glasses and eggs.  There was a flame, and my father was impressed by the last trick.  We left.  Colorful cylinders connected to make a big tube we traveled through.  Sparkly and glittery lights.  I said it was like the Small World ride, or more like ET in Universal Studios.
