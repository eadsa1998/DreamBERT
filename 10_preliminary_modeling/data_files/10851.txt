I was at Harvy Cafeteria (at Lakeside Hospital) with two of my girlfriends and we were there in hopes of seeing a certain intern whom I have an incipient interest in. The cafeteria, however, was very dark and gloomy and did not look at all as it actually does. We placed ourselves in various spots, hoping that he might walk past. He failed to appear and later I walked out of this building and down three or four steps very dejected.
