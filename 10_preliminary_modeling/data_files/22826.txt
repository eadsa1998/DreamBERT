This dream has the atmosphere of foreign intrigue.  I meet some girl at a beach, not Bayview Beach, though.  We get along pretty well, but I then I see her smoking, with some older bald-headed man.  It turns out that they are spies, or criminals, or something.  We know that they have taken a cab.  I ask Daddy if it was a Yellow Cab, or what kind it was.  He says it was just a plain drab colored kind of cab.  He, Jimmy Duggan, some other people, and I station ourselves at various points in the city, and feel almost sure of finding them.  Frustratingly, I have a lot of trouble seeing-everything is fuzzy or cloudy.  Finally we go home and wait for something to turn up.  I look at a rack of my clothes and wonder what to put on.  I don't want to wear the same blue shirt with the black squares.  I catch sight of a really pretty blue one that I have forgotten about having.  I look closer and it is two notebook paper wrappers with the name of my hometown newspaper written on them.  Inside each is a small pad of blank paper.
