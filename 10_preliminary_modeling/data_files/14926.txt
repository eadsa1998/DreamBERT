I was watching a local movie called Razor [Something]. Dad had recommended it to me. I had seen previews for it. It was actually American though. Katie Cassidy was in it. Some people were divided into three groups and were all given a needle thing that had different effects. One made the group jealous. A flying insect came. Then it was sort of like real life. Dad left. The other people either died or left too. When they came we had to do something. I was annoyed because Comic-Con was on. I ended up going anyway and I saw Jared Padalecki there. Then Jensen Ackles was somewhere else. There was a nervous guy with a guy called Justin Comics. I saw Ms Eckert in the car park. I was with Dad and Ezra. She came to talk. Daryl came past. There was a movie thing and these things were coming to life randomly and there was no control over them.
