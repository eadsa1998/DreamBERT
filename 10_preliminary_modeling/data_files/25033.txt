 I have a machine gun. The sights on the gun are uneven, so that if I try to aim the way one usually does, I shoot high. I have to point the gun somewhat downward to shoot straight. I am shooting different object, including cars. Then I drop then gun down and shoot from the hip. I shoot a horse, many times, blowing it away. A girl is with me. (See sketches in notebook)
