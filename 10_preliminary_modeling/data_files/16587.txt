First of all, I dreamt that it was kind of like the middle of summer and I sort of had the notion that I had graduated from Modern Media College, but then again other aspects seemed to indicate that I was back in high school. So I really don't know where I was. And I had the keyboard set up on TV trays in the bedroom because Mom had handed me a piece of sheet music and wanted me to sight read it. She was sitting down on the floor and she found this page under the bed, and it was all full of dust. I don't even remember what song it was, but I was all set to go, I had it in my hands and I was ready to go. And Dad came home. [laugh] And he was going to come in the bedroom and read or something or do his taxes I think. And I was going, "Ahhhhhhhhh," but I tried to stay calm and I said, "Could you please go outside? I have to do something yet." And he went outside, yet he seemed to know all along what was going on. He seemed to know that I had something up my sleeve and all, and the thing had turned a greenish color while all that was going on, a light yellowish green and still kind of shiny. I don't know; that was messed up, man. And then I don't remember what happened. I think I quick shoved it under the bed or something.
