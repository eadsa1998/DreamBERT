I found a poster for Frozen 2 -- which had ice, someone hanging from a chairlift and Rover standing on the ice. I showed it to Mom and she was like 'oh yeah, he was shy' etc. I wondered how Rover got involved but didn't end up asking. The cast included James Van Der Beek and Joshua Jackson and Mom said I should get them to sign it and I said 'just because our dog is on the poster doesn't mean we're going to get invited to cast parties'. But then I was in the movie. There was a farmhouse type of thing in the middle of nowhere. I was there with James and Joshua and this girl. We were in a bedroom chatting and laughing. They had found me and we had already known each other but they were helping me out or something. The place was attached to a clothes shop. I heard bad people coming. They told me to put my shoes on so I did. I asked if anyone had a spare coat or something because I had none. I looked around the store for something, but I couldn't find anything and we had to leave. I ran out and ended up at this church thing. Mom and Dad were there. Dad was in the 'pews' (it wasn't a real church but looked like it, with the pews and the thing at the front). Mom was at the front and she was showing everyone how to wash this shower. I think she was bluffing to trick the bad guys or something. I was sitting with Dad. Mom made hamburgers but gave me one with a bun. George Clooney came in and joked around with me for some reason (his voice was very distinct and clear) and when he came back around he gently kicked my leg and I grabbed his leg with my legs and pretended to wrestle. He laughed and then said we should get a meal later. Dad was like you should do it and I was confused.
