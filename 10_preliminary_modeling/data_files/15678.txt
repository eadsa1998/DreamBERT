This guy and I had some friends. I was going down a path at some point and Ezra and some others pretended they were zombies and then I was like 'you're slow', 'you can't touch the pavement' 'you can't climb' etc as we walked away from them. I climbed these ropes which were stretchy. One felt weak and it was really high so I got off. The some girl friend of ours went crazy and all these people were after us. The guy was now Leonard (The Big Bang Theory) and we ran. We ended up in this house with cats, kittens and this fat, hard cat in a wardrobe and I think they were sick. We got to this place and Leonard said we had to find this game called something like 'huku fuku hakka nad' and it was a GameBoy game. We found it and it had a picture of the Hulk on it. We had to assemble the player and win the game to defeat the bad guys. They attacked us and I ran into a small room with was like a safe room and emptied all the parts onto the floor. Leonard defeated them and then came to the room and I told him to get in and we assembled it together. It was a very tight fit. We finished assembling it and I tried to Google how to win the game but then they came again. They got us and I hid the game between my butt cheeks. Then it was some time later and we were in their community. At the beginning, Leonard had written a shorthand message to me but I couldn't read it. It kept expanding on a blackboard until it basically spelt out the entire plan before I understood. We pretended to fit in with them. They were a similar race to Macedonian and I pointed out that I was too. Someone asked if Leonard was my boyfriend and I hesitated wondering what the best response would be and then I said no, but she said 'so he is' and winked. I asked a security guy for a smoke and he gave me an extra butt and it made me choke and it tasted horrible and made my mouth dry.
