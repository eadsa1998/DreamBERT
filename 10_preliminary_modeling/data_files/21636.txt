I saw bimballet as winner. We were in the country and one of the boys had a 22 pistol. Bob shot at a garage door. I said, "Give me a that pistol don't shoot at doors." Later a fellow was looking for empty cartridges. Someone gave Lattomer a double shotgun and we were hunting for pheasants. He gave me the gun. It was very heavy. I saw a pheasant on the ground. He started to come towards me and there buildings were around me. I waited for him to go by me and when he was ready to go around the building, I shot at him and it was a dud. I looked at a baby a lady was holding and it had blue eyes. A friend of mine was near me and I looked at him and his eyes were exactly blue as the baby's. I said, "Look, your eyes are like the baby's." He didn't like that because he walked away.
