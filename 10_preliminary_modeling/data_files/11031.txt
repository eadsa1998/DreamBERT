I was ushering someplace with a girl from the dorm. I thought it was at Severance, only I was in Buffalo. I wanted to go to some hangout where all the kids were, but somehow I thought my mother wouldn't like it. I felt sort of sneaky doing it, and I was relieved when I succeeded in getting away with it. At some related time I excused myself from going somewhere with my mother. I gave such an excuse that she allowed me to leave. But I wanted to go to this place again. I got home sooner than I should have, considering where I told my mother I was going. So I pretended I had been sleeping at home all the while. I didn't think she'd fall for it.
