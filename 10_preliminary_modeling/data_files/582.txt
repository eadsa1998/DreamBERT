I am babysitting for my parents. I don't see any kids but they are around. the house is a mess and I can't get it clean. The rooms I notice are the living room, bedroom and closet. My parents come home and yell about the mess. Jeff, a local banker, is there and evidently he was supposed to be watching the kids with me. He says he's had enough and is leaving. I insist he take some money before he leaves.
