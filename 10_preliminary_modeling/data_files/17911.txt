My boyfriend Jeremy wanted to have sex.  He started pulling to get my shirt off when we had to stop- someone was at the door.  It was our online friend Starla and Carol from the dorm.  They sat on the couch and Jeremy and I were on the floor of the warm tan room.  Then my good online friend Del showed up.  I was surprised to see him as he hadn't mentioned anything about visiting, and I didn't know he knew where the apartment is, but I supposed he'd remembered from the last time he was over despite not having directions.  Jeremy and I went into the bathroom for a moment and Jeremy still wanted to have sex.  I told him we couldn't with guests in the next room.  I went back out and commented how it was kind of funny for Del and Starla to meet again here in our home state when they both live in the same state.  Then Del and I were alone in the room, and he was naked for some reason.  He was laying on something on his back.  From the angle I was sitting at next to him, I couldn't see anything.  I thought about shifting and sitting up to get more comfortable, but thought that then I might see his penis, so I decided to stay where I was.  It didn't feel right seeing him completely naked.
