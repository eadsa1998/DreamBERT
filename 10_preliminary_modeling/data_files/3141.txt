Merle calls and says that he's scared and asks if I will be home on Sunday. He asks me not to go anywhere because if he gets overwhelmed and scared about his new job, then he can call me. I say, "OK, but I might be at a meeting where you are." He says, "Are you sure?" I say, "I'll call Gather and find out for sure." I call and a man answers and I ask, "Am I going to be at the meeting?" He says, "I'll check." I say, "Check now because I'm long distance." He asks, "Where?" I say, "Wilsonville." He asks, "Where's that?" I say, "Way down the river from there." "There" is New N City, on the river. Now I'm traveling there and riding a horse and the baby burros are frisking behind. It's a good thing I can't look behind and see them or I'd feel afraid. I'm not afraid if I don't look.
