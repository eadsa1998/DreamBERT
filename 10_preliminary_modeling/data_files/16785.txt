My father shoots a gun through the ceiling in my bedroom, and he goes into his room with my brother to pick up the bullet. My parents' room is really on the same level as my own, but my father tells me that because of the way the house is built, this is possible. Then I remember seeing a girl who looks extremely familiar. She tells me her brother is Jeff Porter, and half-knowing I'm asleep I repeat the name several times so I'll remember it when I wake up. (I realize I don't know anyone by the name of Jeff Porter). She says she still has "a period to go through with [me]". I don't know what she means, and then for some reason, she touches her finger to my tongue.
