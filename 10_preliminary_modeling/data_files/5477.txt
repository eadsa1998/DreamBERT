[1997-05-09] I had a dream I was in a mall and I was shopping with my friend X from S [the club] and this guy who was with X but I don't think it was her husband. I was in a wheel chair and so was she and we were going through this store. A section of the store with lots of clothes. It wasn't all a clothes store and it had sort of the usual mall kind of lighting. And it was quiet, not too quiet, like the store was carpeted so it was not too echoey in there. For some reason I decided to walk to the next store, I was walking with my sister and we were in the next store and walking around and I realized that I left my wheel chair in the last store and someone went back to get it and then somehow we ended up, X and I were parked next to the front of the store where it goes into the mall, like this really wide area, we were just parked there in our wheelchairs and this guy who was with X, and so was my sister, said something to X and she said something back like "we'll talk about it later" and she sounded like a little kid. And I said "okay". And the guy said something to us like, "you know, you two used to be so normal until you started hanging out together." And I realized I was sucking on my hand like a little kid and I took my hand out of my mouth and felt really stupid. And X said "You should be glad, at least we survived".
