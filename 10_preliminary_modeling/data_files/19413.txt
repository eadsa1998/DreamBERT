Cindy went to the store with my dad. I was worried, and wanted them to get back. When they drove up, my dad was yelling with his hands waving in the air, "Shut the fuck up!" I ran to the car and saw that baby Cindy was not even in her car seat. She was seat-belted to the big seat and the strap was against her face. She was screaming and crying frantically. I got her out of the car and turned to my dad. "Don't you ever talk to my baby like that again, you asshole. Why don't you go have another beer, you fucking loser!" Then I turned to my aunt Nina and said, "I feel like beating the hell out of him for talking to poor little Cindy like that. He has no right." I calmed the baby down. Zack drove up and she ran to him, so happy to see him. I was happy too.
