The place was unfamiliar. It was nice, like a place for adventure, but dangerous. The characters were familiar - me, my uncle and a friend (M). We were trying to climb up a very steep place in a coastal town towards the mountains. The climbing was very dangerous because as we got higher up, it became steeper. We were completely exhausted, and were able to reach a flat part, where we could rest. We felt like having something to drink or some fruit, but we realized that we hadn't brought anything with us. My friend and I had to decide who was going to have to go back into town, but were not able to do it.
