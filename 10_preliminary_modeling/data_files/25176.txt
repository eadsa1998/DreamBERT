 I'm at a rodeo. We're all in a small barn-like structure. The rodeo itself is probably only 20 feet squared. I see one guy ride. He gets bucked off the steer right away. Another guy then tries. He is bigger and stronger. He rides well, and gets a good time. He is a beast, just like the bull. The arena is small and made of wood. I am leery of it being able to hold the bull, so I seek higher ground. My friend Stephen is there, as is the short fat bouncer from my high school. Stephen drags me on the dirt floor, jokingly. The bouncer gets us all to come and look at a wooden box-like structure that holds a couple of jugs of soda pop, one on each end of the inside of the box. One is ginger ale. The other may be 7-Up. In the middle is a glass where the two are mixed and the bouncer wants us to use this as a television ad. I say that it is dumb, and it won't work.
