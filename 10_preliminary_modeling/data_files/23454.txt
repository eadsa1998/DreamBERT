I'm sitting in a bathroom in what is supposed to be my parent's house and I'm having a watery and bloody discharge. It's quite persistent, not getting worse but not going away either. I leave the bathroom to enter into a convenience store type place and there's a guy who works there watching TV -- the TV is on the wall -- hanging above the cash register area. I'm thinking about how boring his job must be -- it's early in the morning hours -- like 2-4 am and I don't know what I'm doing there and I'm pregnant and everything is fine again.
