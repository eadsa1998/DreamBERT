Another agency dream.  I was craftier this time, figuring out a way to slip in and out without a badge without being apprehended.  I don't remember now exactly how I did it, but leaving depended on my being in a big crowd.  While inside, I confided in Jim Plummer, and possibly in Bill Clay, that I was inside without a badge, but that I wanted to help them out with their work.  That seemed like an awfully flimsy excuse, but no one reported me.  The morning of the second day, I came across Norma Grimson playing tennis with a neighbor girl before going to work.  I tried to drop enough hints to get her to give me a ride to the agency, but apparently it never occurred to her that I would want to go there, and she didn't take the hint.  I went anyway, on my own.  I had more trouble this time, too, getting trapped in places where I had to pass a guard alone either way I went, and experienced considerably more anxiety.
