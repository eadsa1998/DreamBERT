I was walking with CF (fraternity brother, 22) out in the country about 10 in the morning. I wanted to turn, back but he said we could walk further and still be back in time to get Jones. We then suddenly arrived at West Point and CF turned into GM (fraternity brother who had gone to military school) and I asked GM about the outfits of the officers and cadets. I then saw it was 12:20 and I ran for a while to a phone but I couldn't got my number. I finally called the operator and got the number of the fraternity. I told the brothers I was at West Point and couldn't take Jones over to the house. They said he was there and having a good time so I had nothing to worry about.
