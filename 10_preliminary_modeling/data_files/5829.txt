[c. 1983] We were at camp Harkness. We had an absolutely wicked, violent thunder storm, one of the worse I can remember being at camp, at 2 or 3 in the morning. I was awaked by a tremendous peal of thunder. I dreamed that the walls of the cabin were falling in on us. I was screaming in my sleep (according to witnesses) for everyone to get up and wake up and get out of the cabin because the walls were falling in. And no one wanted to go out in the rain. I remember trying to hold up the walls with my hands, but it was only the thunder making me dream that way I guess.
