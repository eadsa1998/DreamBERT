I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. It was night. There was a car behind us but I could only see the silhouette of a 4WD. It followed us. I went through this coop thing to lose it, but it found us. Then we had a few dogs and one was rare. He was after it. I was at this place near the sea. I had just watched my clothes but had to jump over the water and I fell in. When I put pressure on a bit where the clothes were they went into the water and I complained about it. I pretended this guy threatened us because he thought we would turn him in. There was a place which was the first place to let women drink alcohol. Dad got me a drink. I drank it quickly and felt weird. Ezra's mate asked me how to get rid of some drug. It was bright orange and gave you a sensation in your elbow. I just hid it. Then the drug people came asking for it. I renamed the label on it to cough syrup. There was a cinema which was circular and had one screen up high.
