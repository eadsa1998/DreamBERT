Samantha had a party somewhere. It was supposed to be a dress up party or you had to "go to the toilet and then brush your teeth". Calvin was there. It was not Samantha's party all the time. There was a girl and she wrote me a poem thing. I was then dressed as Betty (Ugly Betty). There were some photos from the party and I was looking for ones with Eugene but there weren't any. Daryl was there too. We had to leave. This guy we came with killed someone. This girl I with got in a car in the backseat and I said "who's driving?" and she said "you are" and pulled a gun out, so I drove. Then there was me, some other people and Kevin Dillon. This guy explained something, proving we were bad guys. "He's wearing a necklace on his neck, this symbolizes..." etc. Police came after us. We got out of the car and I went into this area surrounded by dogs. I had to climb over the fences and distract the dogs long enough. I got trapped in the middle, but managed to run to the next area and there was a little dog. It was eating ears. I got out and it was gone, instead there was a little turtle.
