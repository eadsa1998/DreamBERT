Bill (True Blood) and I were going out for some reason. Also, vampires weren't known about. We went to this house. There was a couple there. Hitler was there too. Bill and I were speaking German to each other. Hitler said to me that people liked him and they even had this mask thing of his face on the wall and there was a fish plaque thing as well. I said "There's one of a fish too. I prefer the fish, you might taste funny". He got angry and came after me to kill me, but Bill got rid of him. We were then at another house, which was Mom's, but not. We had actually gone back in time before. Ezra, Mom, Bill and I were at the table. Bill left and I said that he'd remembered that at 2.47am he had to save me. They didn't know what I was talking about. I went out into the lounge room and words appeared on the window saying 'ghost is here'.
