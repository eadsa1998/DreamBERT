[1997-08-10] This dream had more reality about it than anything else because what I dreamt about was our daughter having her first baby, our first grandchild, and I can remember going to the hospital with her and we stayed a while and then my oldest son, Elroy left and came home with me and I remember waiting quite a while for the phone call saying that she had had the baby. Just like in real life, we received the phone call, left the house going down there, walking into the room and seeing the baby, holding the baby, it was a wonderful experience.
