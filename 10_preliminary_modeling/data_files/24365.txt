I was in a part of a nearby city with a train yard and some bodegas and run down houses. I was there scouting for a movie that I was writing. The project was uncertain at first, but later I got a preview of a press release from Columbia Pictures with my name on it announcing the upcoming film, which I hadn't even written in full yet. This bothered me. There were movie industry people all around me telling me it would be fine and I shouldn't worry about the deadlines. I took their word for it, but was still worrying I wouldn't be able to turn out a good enough product in time. They had script doctors, though, I'm sure. But I didn't want them. I could get it right. This was my first movie. I got onto a bus that would take me to a new location. It was night when I got off. Chantalle (a friend I sleep with from time to time) was there. I hadn't seen her in a while. People were sitting inside drinking. It felt like a bar I know on a vacation island. It had that gritty sweet smell, like fried conch fritters and honey dressing. I went over to her and we began talking. She wrapped her arm around my neck. We went to a more private area, like a couch in the dark yard at night, and we began kissing. I remember my hand on her bare thigh. She was wearing a dress. Her skin was so soft and white. I went down on her, and she began moaning. Then, suddenly, she got up and said I can't do this with you. She ran off to her car. I didn't know why.
