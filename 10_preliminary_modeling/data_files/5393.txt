I dreamed that I was in English class again with Mason and Julian. They were chasing me around London, and I didn't know where to go. Next, I dreamed I was shopping in the designer stores near our apartment in Rome. I didn't realize they were designer stores until I checked the prices. Alexis and I were going to go out to lunch, but we didn't know if it was a fancy restaurant, so we didn't know what to wear.
