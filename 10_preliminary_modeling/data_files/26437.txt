 I'm in a group of people on the Carter School playground, east of the jungle-gym equipment in the open area. People get into smaller groups to make fires. It seems almost to be a competition for wood. I pick up some branches for a fire that I'm making with another man. There are two large fallen tree trunks, and we put twigs and branches around these trunks to get our fire started. We light it. In a short while it has gone out and is smoldering. I think some of the wood may be green. Someone lifts up one of the huge tree trunks and we find four or six cardboard boxes, which look like the Henry Weinhards boxes we have at the Whitman House, crushed underneath it. We try to get the fire started again using books of matches. I try to light it, but I run around the felled tree to light the fire after I have lit the matches. The matchbook flares up and goes out before I can light anything. There is a breeze, which makes things a lot more difficult. It is getting dark. A person tries to light some of the cardboard with a match. A group of us crowd around to block out the wind. I use my hands to cup around the match. It works, and we light a piece of cardboard right in its center, and a hold burns through the cardboard.
