During and after a war, fleeing from enemy near the mountains and seaside; I get away by running downhill through the woods; come to a hideout: I change identity: advice great care: pull down shades &amp; close doors; caretakers to buy food in small quantities cut off from world. After what seems like years, I emerge, when I see Donna. I allow her to recognize me (we are suddenly in a busy city street). She accepts me: she tells me I was gone only 1 week. I come home and see neighbors painting their house blue.
