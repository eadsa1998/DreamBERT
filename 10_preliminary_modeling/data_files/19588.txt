My car is parked in 2 places. One is just through, and to right of, a via duct, under a railroad. The other is .... Commerce Bldg. I wonder if this hole will ever be filled, but decide not, because of the great expense. All the central portion of hole is soft mud into which a car would soon sink from sight. I feel doubtful that my car can be run out, and would be willing to have chains fastened around the body, even if paint were spoiled, and the car yanked out by a crane operating from dry ground above. Someone remarks my car was parked in farther end because all other spaces were occupied by other cars. There seems to be a railroad station near edge of hole. This station partakes of certain characteristics of the stations at Elm City and my hometown, but tracks were more as in Nearby City. James (my nephew) and I are standing on platform when we notice a Mallet type locomotive (lone) approaching from the right (east), evidently coming through yards to hook on to a train. The engine is too far off to see plainly and is headed toward another set of tracks some distance from us. I say I want to see that engine, and James and I start across tracks to intercept it. I now seem to be hanging on edge of deep hole, and struggling to pull myself up. I am handicapped by numerous "station trucks" which stand close to each other and within 2 or 3 inches of edge. Apparently I succeed in getting up, as I next am hurrying after James who has gone on ahead. I finally catch up, but the engine has already passed far from sight. I ask how many drivers the locomotive had and am both surprised and amused to learn that James didn't notice this point -- something I would never fail to note.
