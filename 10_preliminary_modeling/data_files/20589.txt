I was employed in an office. I had arrived for work, and I went to the room where the time clock was located so I could punch in. But the room was locked. Someone said the room was being renovated. I was worried about there being trouble about my pay. I told a woman about 30 about it. She was reassuring, and said there wouldn't be any trouble. As she spoke, I had a sudden urge to put my hand up her dress. I did so, and she had no underwear on. She resented what I had done, and I felt badly about it, so I apologized to her. (A few days ago, I overheard a patient relate to some other patient how he had put his hand up a woman's dress.)
