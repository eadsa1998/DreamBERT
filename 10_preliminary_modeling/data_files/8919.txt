Dorothea D was getting remarried. Susan J was there. I had forgotten that I was supposed to get 42 raw silk, white beads. Dorothea D was upset with me for forgetting about them. BJ was going to go get them for me. They were going to cost $200. I didn't want to tell Dorothea D that I really didn't have $200 to spare. I didn't want to ask her for the money in advance instead of paying me back later. She did intend to reimburse me.
