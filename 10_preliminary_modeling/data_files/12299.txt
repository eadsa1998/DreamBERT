We were somewhere inside sitting on chairs. Calvin was sitting next to Elijah and Dmitri was on his other side. I wanted to sit next to Dmitri but I thought it would seem weird so I sat next to Calvin. Samantha, two others and I had a race. I came second. We were then sitting around and I hadn't shaved and I was worried what Dmitri would think.
