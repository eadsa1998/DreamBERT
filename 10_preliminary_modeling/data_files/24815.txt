I was at my friend Arlie's house and her mom suggested that we take their dog for a walk. I know that Joey lived down the street and we might see him. So I convinced her to go with me. We were heading out the door with her dog, when all of a sudden these grownups (maybe friends of her parents) showed up and Arlie's parents and them decided to come with us. We were trying to get away from them so we wouldn't be seen together. Finally, all the adults except one who had a little two year old girl. When we got to Joey's house, we noticed that we were wearing our ugly My school sweats and T shirts (which are from our school that we have to wear every morning and on trips sometimes - when Arlie and I went on a school "midyear retreat" and we had to wear our school clothes it was really embarrassing). This is especially embarrassing but we realized it didn't matter because Joey wasn't there. Also, I forgot earlier, there were two fine guys walking around who we saw and briefly talked to. I don't remember what we said. Setting: On Arlie's street and in her house, then at Joey's. Characters: Joey - I have the biggest crush on him that I've had for about six months, but I only see him every Tuesday for about two hours. He's in my religion class. Arlie's just my good friend. (Yesterday when Arlie and I went shopping at the mall, her two parents came with us which was really embarrassing.) Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, embarrassed. The embarrassing parts about clothes and adults was sort of reliving yesterday, and I always beg Arlie to walk down to Joey's house with me because I love him so much.
