I was watching Cast Away except it was Gladiator, except it wasn't. Dad was in it, and I was sure that I was also in it, but everyone said that I wasn't. Then I was there. There was a king and he was sick of his fat wife and was looking for a new one. I encouraged this poor friend of mine to 'apply'. The king was getting her to read something, but she couldn't read. I was helping her and saying that reading was easy (I was from now, but they were from the past and most people couldn't read). The king ended up putting me down on his list and choosing me because I could read. There was an attack. I was hiding behind this gate and a dinosaur came up and took some guy in his mouth and I said "George!" and the dinosaur said in a creepy raspy voice "George?" and let him go. All the people in the village or whatever it was surrendered. All the important people were giving themselves up. I managed to sneak away. There were road signs in the village. Some guy said that the village was fake (like in The Village).
