I was on a walking trip through green rolIing hllls. The weather was warm but I was wearing a winter suit and bedroom slippers. The slippers are the white furry kind and they belong to my mother. Suddenly I came upon a deserted village in a sandy dusty valley. The houses were of adobe. In the village I met my mother and she greeted me as she would after a long absence. I went with her to have dinner. We went to a house that was crowded with people. Dinner was served buffet style. I looked at the table and it was beautiful, adorned with every kind of food, but when I went to take some everythlng was gone except hard boiled eggs which I took but did not eat.
