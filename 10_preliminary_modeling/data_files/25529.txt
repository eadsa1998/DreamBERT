 I go down a snow covered hill and off a jump, which isn't too big. I watch little kids come down from the bottom of the hill. My friend Kevin Simpson and roommate Stephen Ramos are there and we build up the snow jump so it's big. Kids are going off the jump. The jump becomes so big that I don't want to go off it. I'm at the top of the hill with two other people. Someone is trying to force another person and I to go down the hill. Guns are being used. There is a crowd at the base of the hill. People there are like police. Something happens involving my friends Emerald Reinhold, Tina Totts, Esther Thurman, and Emily Zates.
