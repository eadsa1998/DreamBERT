Water park. Friends went off; place was like an amusement park. Chantalle (a friend I sleep with from time to time) was there. I was reporting on a story. I was struggling to get all the information I needed. I was surprised I was so far in. Trying to write this all from the field. It had 7 sections. I was struggling to finish the last section. I needed a quote.
