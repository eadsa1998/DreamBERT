Jennifer H and I are traveling in her car. We are on a gravel road and she's concerned because she can't see well on that kind of road. Now its dark and we can't see the road at all, just bumpy fields. We turn and go back. I get out and walk. I'm going to her house. I go in, glad to be somewhere to rest after this long journey/vacation but her house is very neat and has pretty objects in it, sort of like a House Beautiful picture and I can't get comfortable. I want to leave.
