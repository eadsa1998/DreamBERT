["Van parked in the dark."] I am a young dark haired woman, a teen really, that lives at a small residential school. An out of the way place. I request a small model of the school be place at a perspective where I can draw it. I am in an open field. A woman places it. I keep asking her to move it here and there, because it is so far away I can hardly see it. It has classical designs with columns and a domes ceiling. Finally I apologize to her and say I'll just walk over to it and see it there. I must walk into the dark wooded bushy area to go past my van parked there. I feel a moment of fear at the dark wooded area and then muster up my courage and walk in there. The scene shifts and I am preparing a meal in the cottage where I live with the other young teen women. It is a beautiful kitchen with many interesting wine kind of bottles. Someone keeps asking me how long I've known this one student who is famous for some reason. I can't remember but I think it was before I was sixteen, perhaps when I was thirteen. The principle comes in to have dinner with us. A man teacher is plotting to tie him up. The teacher gets these teen boys and while the principle is seated on a open canopy thing with a web of ropes, he jokingly ties one arm to the ropes. The principal thinks its a joke, but before he knows it, he is tied up and can't escape. The teacher says to someone You probably wonder why I chose to teach in such an obscure place. Now I must get recognition.
