I am being asked to sing. I say, "I'm afraid." My friend (maybe Ginny) says, "Here, wear this," and hands me a pretty black, lacy scarf. She looks at me and says, "You are a lady! Act like one!" I feel proud of my new image. It feels "new born." I look lovely. We walk out, hand in hand to the stage. Ginny then cries out, "Oh! I'll cry if Rachel loves you." Her feelings are hurt because Rachel loves her. I say, "Now, I don't think she's in love with me." Ginny says impatiently, "Oh, one never knows. Only the person in love knows. You can't control that." [BL]
