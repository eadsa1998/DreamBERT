Lots of people at my house, maybe as many as fifty. I had told Jody S that she and her family could sleep in my bedroom. At first they protested but finally agreed. When they got up there was another family in there so they went back downstairs. When I saw them back downstairs I asked why and they said someone else was in my room. I pretended to have made a mistake and said I was sorry, that I meant they could sleep in my mom and dad's room. So they went up to that room and went to bed. I was playing with one of the twins prior to that. I see the two twins laying in my bed asleep. Instead of laying side-by-side they are laying head-to-toe. Charlie and Allen from the TV show Two and a Half Men. There was something about me helping Charlie. IT seems that he was sick and I was doing something to care for him. I was going to sleep next to him for this reason. Another woman offered. I thanked her but said I was going to do it. There was something about some of the people there engaging in some kind of sexual activity. There was a large platform with sides that came up maybe twelve inches. The platform was raised about four feet off of the floor. People were getting ready to lay in it, related to the sexual activity. Charlie told them wait a minute and he ran off. When he came back and he started dumping bags of sweets, mostly candy, in it. Everything somehow stayed neatly separated in twelve inch squares. He dumped large bags of sprinkles and colored sugar. I was thinking that was kind of odd, as it meant people would be covered with sprinkles and colored sugar. The rest of what he poured in was many different kinds of candy. Red licorice bits was one of the things. I was leaning on one of the sides talking with someone standing on the other side. We kept reaching in and trying different pieces of the candy.
