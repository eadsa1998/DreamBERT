 There is a meat commercial advertising a steak. The commercial says that one can even put the steak in the dishwasher. It then shows a dishwasher being opened up with a steak in it. Putting the steak in the dishwasher is not recommended, though. A person, who may be me, tries to trim the fat off of the lukewarm half-cooked steak. The steak is tough. Something happens with boils (the sores) or fat pockets.
