We still lived at the old house. We took Ratatouille's cage out into the family room and left it there for a bit. When I went back to it, there were another mice in it. Some big, some small, all kinds of colours. I remember some with coffee colour patches, a white one, some like Ratatouille, grey ones and there was one with red eyes. I was grabbing them and chucking them away, but they never seemed to all be gone. So I grabbed Ratatouille and put him in another cage that they couldn't get into and put it in my room. But when I went back to it, it was full of ants. I was trying to shake the ants out and Ratatouille fell over and seemed dazed, I was like 'omg sorry' and then I went to grab him but this big spider walked up to him and looked like it was going to sting him and I squished its head. It spurted out this green stuff and covered Ratatouille in it, and then he rolled over and died. I started crying and then I woke up in the dream and was telling Mom about the dream but started crying telling it. I then woke up in real life crying.
