I and some other Americans are on the cliff face trying to find a treasure or something valuable. The Russian crew is following us, watching, perhaps video taping us. We pretend the treasure isn't there and go on looking at another spot. Then we rush back to the original spot. Now a Russian team on the opposite canyon wall throws a basketball. This is a challenge. I manage to catch it and say to the Russians near us, on our side of the cliff, "See! ONE! One point." I am being victorious because the score is being kept in American language, not Russian. I now try to throw the ball. It is heavy and I don't get it airborne very much. It falls, I see a poof of smoke and then someone else on my side almost catches it.
