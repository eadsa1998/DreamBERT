Mom, Ezra and I were at a shop but it looked like an airport. There was a shop called "I hate buns" except it was sometimes "I love hate". At first the shop was outside, but then we were inside. Ezra was looking for a shop and we ended up in this sound studio like the one near the Science Museum with this old-ish woman teaching. She had a program open on her computer and showed us a music file and asked us to work out how to get all the music into "one stream" -- which we did by pouring water onto sand and making these thick rods made of sand and water. Ezra had spelled out "hobgoblin" and I wrote "Hello" and then "Izzy" in the sand. The lady had a glass and broke it and I called it a glass and she started rambling angrily that it was actually called something else and that it was mainly for 'bigger' people to commit suicide with and then she calmed down and said she was meeting some pedophile guy next and she was going to be late but couldn't contact him. One of us suggested we could go and show him this game to stall him. Then I was in a car with a guy friend. It was night and we drove past this shop, which he had broken into earlier. The door was open and someone was inside. He pulled up outside and was going to go in to stop it and I told him not to, and he hesitated but eventually drove off. Then we picked up a drunk friend and he said he lived in "New Jersey" and my friend said "that's a nice place to live" and I said "unless you're in this country".
