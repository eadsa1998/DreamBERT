This is either January 31st or February 1st. I think it's January 31st. I don't remember too much about my dream last night because I let myself sleep in until like 8:30 this morning, off and on. And so I was kind of dozing and having different little scenes going on. But the one that I can remember most is that we had, I was back in Westport, of course, and we had this thing going on where we had chickens, of course, I think we had three of them. We haven't had three in a few years. And we also had this cow, this mini, mini, mini, miniature cow that was like the size of a Chihuahua dog that kind of was there to keep an eye on the chickens and stuff like that. She would run her dogs off because the chickens were just too chicken. [laugh] I can't really remember any kind of situation except I picked her up once, holding her and showing her to the kids on the porch, just like a Chihuahua person would pick up their Chihuahua dog. And then I went around to the front gate and put her in the yard and she ran over and kind of made friends with the chickens, and that's all. And then I woke up.
