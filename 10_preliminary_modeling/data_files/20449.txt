I was in a hospital dining room as a patient. Patients were getting discharged. A patient named Reynolds nodded to me and I nodded back. An officer named Lambski (I am not sure of that name, but I remember him as "Frankie" which everyone called him. He always tried to be amusing.) As I went onto a porch, I said to him, "Vive la calarooso!" I said it to be amusing, though I did not know if "calarooso" was a Spanish word. I used it because it sounded Spanish. Some nearby Puerto Ricans smiled, so I thought perhaps it was a Spanish word. The officer hollered something back to me as I walked across the porch. It was in Spanish, but I did not hear the words clearly.
