I am dreaming, I am aware I am working through that old question of am I a latent lesbian. In the dream I am very sexually hungry and I present an image of a naked woman and I feel sexually excited. Then as an experiment, I present an image of a cat and I feel equally excited. So the conclusion is that when I'm sexually awake, any image will be colored in the sexual feeling. Maybe I shouldn't let myself get so needy and hungry.
