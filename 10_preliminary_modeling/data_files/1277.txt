A woman, a man, and I are trying to decide what day to get together. We decide on the 14th. Then the woman wants to change it to the 3rd. I say, "It's possible, but I have other commitments and wouldn't be able to give as much time." The man is disappointed. He wanted more time with me. I get annoyed at the woman for thoughtlessly creating problems for the man. We all agree to change the date back to the 14th. Then we go out into the city; there is some danger and we must flee. We see a crowd. It is waiting to see a famous dance troupe. I ask how long we'll wait. The woman says, "An hour." I say, "They'd better be good then." She says, "They are the best in Mexico, just like you are the best in the U.S." I am modest and say, "Oh! tat!" The man is sitting on the same bench. I go over to him and kiss him. He and I cuddle. It's nice.
