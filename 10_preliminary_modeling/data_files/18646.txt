The new chef was a preacher too. He was gay. When they asked him to say the blessing he said, "Dear God, Please let me get to know the guy next to me, as a friend." People opened their eyes and shut them back and wanted for him to say a meaningful prayer. The silence was thick. People kept their eyes closed except to peek. Finally, when nobody would move, he added in desperation, "I said as friends." A girl threw a school lunch tray with straws in white paper wrappers at him. Straws were everywhere. It was the 15th floor. A man was on the highway overpass cutting chain link fences with a chainsaw. It was dangerous work, he said. A passage way ??? overpass ???
