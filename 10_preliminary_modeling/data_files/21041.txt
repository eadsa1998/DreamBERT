I was playing cards with Ray, Walter, and Julia, deceased tavern owner. I had a piece of wood in my hand for luck. We sat on a log. I was drawing coke out of a coke oven. There were wraps standing in a corner. A man walked into the hot oven. I went in to pick up the coat. It was like a cleaners. A man came in and wanted his coat cleaned and pressed. The lady said "We're closed." He pulled out a gun and took his coat to press. I walked into the other oven and there was a small window. I decided to get out. There was some glass in the corner of the window frame. I knocked it out and started to get thru the small window. I was getting thru head down the wall. Bob was in bed. I was going to go to the next room and he awoke and kicked because he didn't want to be left alone. I saw three women around a giant tree. One crawled thru a trunk of the tree and then they all ran. I laughed and said, "They call them old buzzards." We all laughed and I think she heard it. I started on my way and she followed me. I came to a barn. I flew at the locked door, but it didn't open. The old lady waited by another door. I opened it and said, "Look behind you. There is something." She looked and I got out. Trixie got hold of her broom and I grabbed it and threw it away, then went on my way. I put up a kite. It went straight up. Then it came down and flew right in front of a window and stood up. It was a beautiful dress. I was loving up and kissing Julia. Her kiss was so soft, her lips seemed to melt.
