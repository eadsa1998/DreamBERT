I was in Purity Supreme. In one of the vegetable trays were these mini-mini Christmas trees. I felt like I was a home decorator. There were only about ten. They were $50 each. I think I bought four. I knew they were expensive, but I got them anyway. I was imagining a little town being built in between them. They were all decorated with snow.
