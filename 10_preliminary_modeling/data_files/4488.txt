["Looking for MY room."] I am in a house and am walking from room to room looking for the room I will move into. The rooms are small and ordinary. I see a front bedroom, which someone else already has moved into. I walk to the next room. I see a nice large kitchen. The biggest room there. Some of the appliances are duplicated. Two stoves. I open the next door and see the back of a man in a bathtub. I like this room. Wish I could have it. I tip toe out so as not to disturb the man. I only find one empty room. It is a large closet with plain plywood walls and no windows. I am disappointed, but this seems to be the only room available to me.
