There had been some kind of disaster or something and we couldn't go outside. We lived in this apartment block type of thing and I lived with Dad and Ezra in one of the nicer and bigger rooms. We looked out the window one day and saw some cars, and then saw a bunch of military looking vehicles carrying people. Everyone was angry and upset about this because it would mean they would have to share their rooms with other people since we were already at capacity. After processing them they told us we would get a few people and I suggested to these people we were friends with that we combine instead.
