I was at Mother and Daddy's house and I was over in the side yard where we used to play ball. I was flying. There were these big square beams every few feet. I was flying under them I think and kind of hitting them as I flew under them. At the last one, there were two of them close together and they had a platform between them. I was crawling on that platform eating salad like a dog as I went along. Then I came to this baby. I realized it was a homeless baby. I saw this woman sitting down below so I took the baby to her. I asked her if she wanted a baby. She was so happy. She kept asking me if I was sure. Are you sure this is okay? She didn't want to take it if it was someone else's baby. I said, no, someone else deserted it, so you may have it. Then the baby started crying and I went to get it some milk. There was a handicapped young man sitting there and he was putting something in the baby bottle that he shouldn't. I told him, don't ever, ever put that in the bottle again because that will really, really hurt the baby. I took a bottle and cleaned it out really good. Then I made some formula, put it in, and took it to Ross [unknown].
