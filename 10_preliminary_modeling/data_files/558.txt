I am at a church service and there is a kids play going on. I am with two of my "best friends" from grade school, Barbara and Joan. The kids are good but the boy cries and coughs and spits up a gob of mucous and it is disgusting. Next the priest is giving away stuff that belongs to Len, a neighbor of mine, who died several years ago. Len has left me a stethoscope. Other items will be on display in a nearby town but they don't belong to Len. I now have three cards with items I am to receive but I don't know what they are. My son says he has a pogo stick coming and asks if I have seen it. The only one I have seen is a brand new one in a toy box at the church and I know that isn't it. I get this mental picture of our foster son and suddenly realize he is actually there. I say hi and he smiles and I see he has had surgery on his mouth and his two front teeth are gone and the space where they were is bandaged.
