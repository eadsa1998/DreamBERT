I saw a lady and a man play some kind of golf on a boat. The lady was better than the man. Ann played with some rich man. Boy, could she hit the ball. She kind of fell for the guy and did he for her. I got mad at her for it. I could see her face light up when she saw him. I slapped her face, then walked away, expecting her to come after me, but she didn't and I walked away sadly.
