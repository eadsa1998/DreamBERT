It felt like we were in the past, in Italy, yet the area was similar to that of my maternal Grandma Jane's neighborhood.  I walked up a hillside to my grandparents' house.  There were a lot of red flowers out front, and a birdcage in the kitchen.  Some of my maternal grandpa Gerald's siblings were there.  Grandpa Gerald was dying.
