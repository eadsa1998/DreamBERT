It's a kissing contest. The guys are lined up. I decide to get in the women's line, the only one in a wheelchair. There is some surprise and a little jeering. I come up to the first guy in line, William Shatner. He sticks out his hand and I shake it. I say, "This is a kissing contest!" So I start to kiss him and he turns his cheek. I feel hurt. I go to the next guy. He kisses me honestly and sweetly. I am a good kisser and he sighs and says, "Wow." William Shatner realizes he's missed something good and wants to kiss me now. I am very angry and yell at him and hit him, "What a jerk. You thought I was just an uninteresting cripple and go to the next one." It's a package and I try to unwrap it. I have trouble cutting the strings, but finally open it and see a folded up yellow shirt. I look for a face where the head of a man should be. I lift up the collar and see an identical shirt and laugh. Then I see a name card behind that, "Robin Williams." I say I'd like to kiss him! I go to the next one, Burt Lancaster. He is eloquent and classy. He picks me up and with each long kiss he puts me in a Fred Astaire dip. Everyone oohs and ahhhs and applauds. I love it. I'm such a good kisser, he doesn't want to stop. I go on to others. I vote Burt the best male kisser. They vote me the best female kisser.
