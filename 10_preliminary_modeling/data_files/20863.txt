I was being held prisoner with some others by a slim man and woman. I was not allowed to converse with the others. I wanted to discuss something intellectual with a man, so instead of speaking, I drew diagrams to describe my theories. The slim man saw me, and was angry at me. Later I obtained information about cancer cells, and how they are destroyed. There are three areas. The first is attacked, then the third, and then the center area is closed in upon. I drew a diagram of the strategy. Later I walked past a stage. A boy was standing on it. He had been at our house annoying my mother. I told him he'd better stay away from the house. He laughed and said, "Did your mother tell you to say that?" I replied that my mother does not tell me to do things. I said he will have to deal with me as well as my mother if he persists in annoying us. Then he left, and reappeared dressed as a girl. At first I did not recognize him, and I said to tell the boy that I am watching him. Then he laughed and I recognized his voice. He was acting as a girl in a play.
