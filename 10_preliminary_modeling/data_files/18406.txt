I was walking down a street in Topeka, Kansas. And I noticed on the wall of a post office on my right a wanted poster. And I looked up as I walked on down the street, and here was the man whose picture had been on the poster. And there was a $10,000 reward for him. So I dashed across the street to where a mail truck had stopped, and said to the mailman, "There's so and so who's wanted, let's capture him. I've found him." And we went across and captured him. And I think the postman took him into the post office or something. And then I said, "I'd like to get my reward." He said I wasn't entitled to any reward, because the man had really been captured by a federal employee. and then he went off somewhere. And now in the dream my recollection of him changed. He was the driver of a milk truck who helped me capture him, and I was very incensed because I hadn't gotten my reward even though I provided the information and helped to capture this guy. And there was a long involved series of incidents which I don't remember too well, which involved me going into the general store and asking who the driver of the milk truck was. And they told me his name, but I forget it a little while later, and then sitting in a little seminar room somewhere where a trial was going on about some complicated legal thing, but talking to the judge about how could I get my reward in the meantime.
