 People are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms. A man takes mushrooms, which are for sale for six dollars each, out of a glass case. He eats for of them at once: all that were in the glass case. This is too much: an overdose. The mushrooms are large, like Fig Newtons. This is too much for one for one person to eat without a groove, without a channel to eat them, which is the exception for the overdose. I'm chewing the mushrooms, and I think I'm chewing them okay: they are being masticated. I may be the man who took the overdose.
