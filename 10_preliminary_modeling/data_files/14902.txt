I was doing some course (MUPC or school or something). Raquel was also doing it and she was sitting next to me. We were told we were going to watch Das Boot. I was talking to Raquel about it. I said the ending was awesome, "when he dies". She looked at me blankly and she hadn't seen it. There was a scene with some guy swimming. He reached for a coin and this shark bit him. Raquel asked the teacher if she had to watch it. The teacher was Ms Solomon sometimes. She said "you haven't seen anything like that before". I said "I have" and she was like 'you think you're cool because you've seen it'. She took us to a room. She asked if we'd seen a bit of this cartoon and I said "I don't do cartoons". She showed us one and it was porn. I left. Later, they brought two guys in as it was ending. It changed into something else. Later I was with Mom in the car. I was supposed to be going to university or something but Mom wanted to go get something. I thought I'd just message Raquel for the notes later. There was a cupboard at the old house. There was special stuff and Das Boot "extra [something]". There was a slang sheet.
