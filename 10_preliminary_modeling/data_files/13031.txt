I was at Nana's and they had a Playstation 3 so I was having a look at it. There was some game that was like Age of Empires. Dad wanted to see the game. I started it and it was Battle Royale like. I realized and threw my bag off my bag looking for my weapon. It was a machine gun. Then it was real. I grabbed all my stuff and I was near a wood shed so I hid in there. This guy came along and hid there too. This other guy said this guy was coming to check out the shed so we all left. Shinji Mimura (Battle Royale) was there so I hung with him. This guy was around the corner with a gun and we managed to calm him and take his gun. Someone was threatening us and we shot them and the bullet was slow. Shinji ran to it and put in the other guys neck. Then these people were at this shop. This guy said "I hope my wife isn't on that list". People were discussing the best fashion of spring etc. Jason Lee was there. There was a basketball and he said that he could do lots of tricks.
