I dreamed that Mom died.  Dad and me and one sister were in the front seat of a car, looking through the windshield, into the windows of a restaurant, and Mom had slumped over in the restaurant.  We knew that she had died.  We were all upset looking at her.  A little later this doctor came and he said he had to cut Mom's stomach out, like a liposuction or something, because she was too heavy to bury.  And I was looking at him start to cut into her, and I was thinking, "She's not that heavy!" and it certainly didn't warrant surgery or anything.
