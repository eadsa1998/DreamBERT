I am at a conference, looking for my NLP group. I peek into a side room, one step up and ask a man if this is the group (maybe dream group). He says no, they are in the main room. I look for them. I find some computers that belong to some other organization, a commercial something, and I decide to use their computer to write up my dreams. I do that, feeling a little guilty and hope they don't catch me. I get a little greedy and want to print out the stuff I typed in, or all that work would go to waste since I'd have to go home and type them in again. So I try to print it out and I see it is spitting out envelopes with small portions of the dreams on each envelope. What a waste of paper. So I stop the operation and look at all the buttons trying to get the printer to use the paper instead of the envelopes. There are lots of buttons. Nothing seems to work. It's 10 to 5:00 and I have an hour's drive home and I have to be there by 7:00 for the women's Merton's meeting at my house. I feel rushed and yet stubborn, yet I keep trying. Finally I ask two Asian students (one male, one female) if they can help. She tries to help, but doesn't know much! She does point out the tractor buttons on the side and I push the holes of the paper over the buttons. It still doesn't work. I ask a general question to aid the students, "Can anyone help me work this?" A man offers to help. He says I'm trying to print on the wrong layer of paper. It should be the paper on the bottom. I try it and it starts printing. We walk away and he likes a book I have in my hand and wants it in exchange for his help. I am annoyed. I just got that book at a used book store. It's about education and parenting children. I don't want to give up, the book and don't really want to pay him.
