I dreamt about putting ketchup in a bag full of it.  I missed my American History class (?) because my mother wanted to visit.  There was an oppressor, selling trees for firewood because there was 'no good furniture'.  People had to trade in, and it was completely unfair.  I took a long pine tree and put it in his mouth, as I was directed.  But I pushed it far, because I hated him, yet had to work for him.  There was an unloading zone that looked like the elementary school parking lot and a family bringing a bed to unload.
