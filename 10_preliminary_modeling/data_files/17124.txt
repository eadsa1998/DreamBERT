I remember a red fire consuming a city you could see beyond the retaining wall, far off in the distance.   Buildings collapsed.  There was blazing red fire, chaos, and billowing smoke.  It looked like Judgment Day.  I was with someone on the porch, and the helicopters came after us, or me, as if they knew I somehow had something to do with it.  Somehow in the dream I was injured, and I awoke with a large bruise covering the whole left side of my back.
