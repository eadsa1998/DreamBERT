I am in the middle of gang warfare somewhere.  It kept going on, everywhere I went there was shooting and scary violence.  I was hiding upstairs in a house at one point, looking out into a dark neighborhood, watching this go on.  I came downstairs and two guys came in and one told me to get on the couch.  At first I just hesitated.  He kept demanding over and over, finally I squeaked out this little "no" and turned, to go upstairs.  The two guys laughed at my wimpy refusal.  I got my gun and came down and shot him in the chest.  He was blond.  He seemed surprised, indignant.  Then I said - "you were going to rape me on the couch, weren't you?"  He said yes and I told him, "Well, I'm glad I shot you then" or "you should be shot then."
