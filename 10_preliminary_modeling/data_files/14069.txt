I was somewhere with Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush. Sophia was the daughter of a guy Mom was friends with. Someone said there was a photo of her on the fridge with two girls and Chad. We were on a rooftop and we were doing some in-joke thing, where he would put his arm around her and then he'd do the same thing to me and we laughed.
