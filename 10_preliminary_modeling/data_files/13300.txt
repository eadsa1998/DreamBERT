Calvin and I went to this lecture place. We had gone there the day before. We had the sheets so we were getting them out. The lady asked a question and I wasn't listening because I was getting the sheets so she told me to move away from Calvin. Today's task was the same as yesterday. The guy next to me was annoying me and he found out that I didn't like being a girl so continued to annoy me. Calvin started singing a song and I was laughing and everyone was looking at him. When the class finished Calvin hung around for a while. Somehow me and the annoying guy ended up at a motel and had sex. When we first arrived there, I was thinking that I'd lost my virginity already to Michael Cera. The next day, we were there again. Calvin was closing these blinds and some girls were complaining. The annoying guy was making out with some girl.
