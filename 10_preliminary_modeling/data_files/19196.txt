It all seems rather vague and strange because I can't remember or identify or associate a dream with any of my actions. My feeling was in general bewilderment. There was some sort of action in this dream as in a sport. I don't know what the action was or why. The setting was very limited. It was just a few pieces of furniture and myself and that's all. An indoor rather than an outdoor activity. No, I wasn't the sole character. There was another person in it also. The only way I can identify this other person is as my partner. We were playing a game in which both of us were equal. The dream seemed to be a very active dream. I can't recall the basis of the action. I can recall that it was an active dream like playing tennis. In fact, it may have been playing tennis. Setting not clear. It may have been an arena or any place I have been before. It could have been a grove, an exit. The dream wasn't clear enough to decide whether there were any spectators, intangible, vague idea.
