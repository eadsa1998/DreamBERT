A large city with all its funny noises was the setting of this dream. I guess the city's name was Cleveland although I could notice no familiar things. Suddenly a large black truck loomed before me. As I jumped its front fender caught my foot. The truck immediately stopped and from the car the driver appeared. He began asking if I was all right. After I assured him that I wasn't badly hurt, he told me that I should have jumped up in the air instead of ducking to avoid the car (truck). After this I got up off the street and walked away as if it had not ever happened.
