I was working in the shop and Grandpas, Steve and I were sleeping at Margie's. It seemed like in Rivertown upstairs and still Prince was her landlord. I was downstairs, heard a knock on the door and told Marg, "If it's Prince, tell him I am sleeping." I got on top of the stairs. I looked down and saw Prince look up at me. I got in bed with Grandpas. Steve and Marg came up and said Prince wanted to see us. I looked at the winning paper and one came in second and I didn't see one and the other ran out.
