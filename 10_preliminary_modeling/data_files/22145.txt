I dreamed that of all the thousands of things that had happened in the world to me, the best thing I had dreamed about was about my childhood. I dreamed that when I was 3 years old, I married my writing teacher and I had seven little girls by her. At that moment some dirt from something that was floating in the sky fell. My dream stopped then.
