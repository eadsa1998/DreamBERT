Am in Florida walking down a street in St. Pete and apparently carrying some luggage or packages in my hand. Pass a girl going in same direction. We walk together and I tell her there is a good restaurant up ahead on the left. As we walk, some sections of sidewalk ahead seem covered with water, but as we get nearer they are always wet, but not covered. Then suddenly to the right I see a motor yacht heading into the sidewalk. We slow down and then the yacht turns parallel to the sidewalk and parks and I see a fat old man in an armchair on the stern. He looks German. On the door heading into a cabin, I see a German word, like "Schwarzbuch." The girl and I walk on to restaurant, but I am disappointed to see it is no longer there. As we pass under a tree, some water flicks on us as a young guy shakes a branch at us. I ignore him, but he does it twice more. Then I put packages down slowly and grab him and hold him on the ground by forcing his head into the dirt with one hand. With the other, I shake a branch and wet him thoroughly. I release him and the girl and I continue walking.
