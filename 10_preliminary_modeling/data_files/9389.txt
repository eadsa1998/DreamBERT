I am in a swimming pool and feel the water slide by me as I swim with long even strokes the whole length of the pool; very pleasant. I am practicing to become a world champion and succeed in doing 16 laps. My trainer says that is pretty good, but I still have a long way to go. I watch two teams compete in a swim meet; one is cooperative, the other individualistic. The first team wins!
