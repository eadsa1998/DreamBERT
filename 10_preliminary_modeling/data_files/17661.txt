I was with my parents looking at apartments. One place looked like a palace. The swimming pool surrounded it with little stream-like waterways and there were pathways crossing over these, and fountains, it was gorgeous. I went inside a room asking if they had a single, but they misunderstood me because it wasn't the main office, it was the fitness center. They thought I wanted a karate belt. Somehow I got separated from my parents and was going through a storage room, seemingly with someone else, and trying to escape something.
