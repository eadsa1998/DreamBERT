["Will I or won't I?"] I am at some festival. There is a platform with a roof but only one wall. It is where lots of people are sleeping, in sleeping bags and blankets. No furniture. I am curled up with a bunch of people. There are lots of us. We wake up. It is morning. Lots of people get up and leave. I am still sleepy. Others move away to give more room. I am all alone now at my spot against the end wall. I am lazy, enjoying the sleepy time. I roll over and lay on my tummy. My feet facing the wall. On my left, a lovely dark skinned man comes over. He is attracted to me. I notice I am bare breasted. Wearing only a short pair of cutoffs. I look sexy. He comes over and looks. I am aware he is attracted. I like that and I am concerned. I don't know if I want him or not. He is good looking, but I hesitate. I roll over on my back, exposing myself to him. I curl my arms over my breasts shyly. He comes closer and slowly kisses me. I like it, but I still hesitate. I don't kiss him back much. I think well now he will probably go away since I didn't respond well. He stays. He kisses me again and then I begin to be sexually warm and excited. Then another man, a white man comes over. He also is attracted to me. Which one shall I choose? I am unsure. It feels nice to be so good looking and to have these men attracted to me. Because I can't decide, I move away from the one dark skinned man, whose skin is now only lightly tan. I decide to get up and see the festival. I put on a white sexy halter top with the cutoffs. I am looking good. I walk leisurely out to the festival. This is fun.
