I am downtown and a man is raking leaves. I am hoping he will offer me a ride home. He does but then something happens so he can't and I am disappointed. I try to come up with something that will make him need to give me a ride but can't do it. I try to stand in this person's shadow but there isn't enough room so I step out. I figure he doesn't know what he is doing and he will be sorry. Something about going to the doctor and having tests taken for heartbeat being different when taking different substances. The heartbeat is "squishy" with some thing but I don't know what thing that is. I am wanting my brother and my old clothes from the attic but I can't find them. In particular I want the leather jacket I bought him when I had my first job.
