I was at Brookland High School, except it was different. Ramona enrolled there too, and there was a ghost. People ate cat litter. I was supposed to do some speech, but I got out of it and I was allowed to go to West Whitehall Primary School. There were people there from Year 7. As I walked back, 50 odd other people from my school were there too. It was windy. I was watching KPAX which was completely different. Kevin Spacey was saving these people, two kids and a woman from a fire. He was crying.
