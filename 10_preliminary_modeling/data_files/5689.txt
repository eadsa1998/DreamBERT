[1997-07-11] Here I am again with clothes. I was pulling clothes, linen and clothing, this time not dirty, they were clean, I knew it, I was not pulling them straight up out of a laundry basket, Instead I was pulling them toward me. It was comparable to a very, very large glove compartment, it was very deep. I am saying glove compartment so you will understand how I was pulling out that way, and I'm pulling and pulling these sheets and pieces of clothing that need to be folded and put away. By the time the dream ended, I had made a very large dent in this mess of clean laundry.
