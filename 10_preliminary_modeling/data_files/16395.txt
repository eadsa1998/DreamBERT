Man, I seem to be having really neat dreams every day these days. I don't know what's up, but I dreamt that I was with this performing group. I don't know if it was a chorus of singers or a dance group, or just a group of friends, but it was some kind of group. And I had a notion that we were either going to perform or have some kind of fun that looked like performing. But we were at this big hall, like the Bayfront Center, and there was an ice rink, and I wanted to get on the ice rink so that I could dance and ice skate with the others. But there were these, all these things around the perimeter, like cover things or grate things that I was afraid of and I was afraid of stepping on. And I was bare foot and I was trying to navigate between them, and more of them kept popping up, and so I had to just back out and not go near the ice rink. And I know there were more scenes, but this is what I get for waiting this late in the day. I don't remember any more.
