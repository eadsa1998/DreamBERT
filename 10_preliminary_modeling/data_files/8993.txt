Myself and one other person are working on something at a computer. It's a list of some kind. What I'm seeing is at least two columns that are divided into blocks. Each block contains information, a lot of text, but also some numbers. There is something wrong with the formatting that on one of the items I keep entering the numbers that I want and the way I want them to display but as soon as I hit enter it changes. I keep trying it over and over and doing different things to try to stop that from happening but I'm having no luck and getting incredibly frustrated.
