I was taking this crucial test that mattered for my outcome as an adult, even though I'm 10. My time was running out and I was nowhere near finishing. I thought I was doing terribly, and gave up for a bit. That was the wrong choice. I don't know what happened next. Setting: In my 1st and 2nd grade classroom! Characters: The test-giver, who was only there in the beginning, and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. Today, in real life, my brother is taking a test and my dad was telling him last night how the outcome didn't matter at all.
