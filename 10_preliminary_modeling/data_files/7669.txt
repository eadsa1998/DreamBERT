I was a Eucharistic Minister at 10:30 am Mass. I told someone I wasn't sure what to do because I don't usually do 10:30 Mass. Father Nick was the presiding priest but there was another priest there as well. It was the main actor from the recent movie about the tobacco industry. My view was obstructed and I looked around whatever the obstruction was to see that priest. I had a sense that the other priest wasn't there or was upset. When I did see him, there didn't seem to be anything wrong. I thought he might be slouching in his seat but he wasn't. After Mass, I was speaking with Rosalie C. I used the wrong cloth to wipe out a wine cup and left a wet spot on it. Rosalie C pointed out the right cloth to use. She picked up the one I had used and noticed the wet spot. I could tell by her facial expression that she was perturbed. I stayed for Noon Mass. Shortly after Mass began I wondered why I had stayed and made plans to leave the next time everyone was standing
