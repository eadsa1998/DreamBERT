Doing an IGA. I was stickering and people were scanning. I was in a room with Esther and Hugo, and Esther was taking to Hector -- who was in another room. She asked him how much he trusted me with running his IGA job and he said 'not very much. She misses locations, wanders off' etc and Esther and I were confused and she said 'Izzy's right here, Hector' and went to talk to him saying I'd done it a million times and I was fine. Hugo said, to no-one in particular, that he 'trusted me completely'. Hector came in with the laptop with proof and Hugo complained that he was embarrassing me. There were pictures of some problems -- eg, not separating old guns with new guns because I didn't know, 8 pictures of a movie I watched and one video of me and Mikhail mucking around but it was actually because Mikhail took something from me and didn't give it back.
