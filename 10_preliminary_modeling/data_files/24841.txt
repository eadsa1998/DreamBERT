I had just spent the night over at my best friend's house and we were waking up on a gorgeous spring morning. She had to go to school, but I didn't, so I wanted to go with her. She lives less than a block away from her school, and I was jealous that she could wake up at 7:30 and make it to school by 8. I was shaving my legs with her electric razor and then we went into her back yard and went swimming in the cool water. Setting: At my friend's house. Characters: My best friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, relaxed, refreshed. I think I want all this rain to stop and I want it to be spring. I LOVE spring!
