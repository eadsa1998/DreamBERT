I dreamed that I was walking along when all of a sudden I saw Joan. I have been dating Joan regularly for over a year. She is 19. I started to run to her and when I had run halfway I stopped to see how much further I would have to run. Joan was still halfway away. I kept on running but she was always the same halfway away. I thought to myself that I had been trapped in Xeno's paradox. I continued to run but I could never get any closer.
