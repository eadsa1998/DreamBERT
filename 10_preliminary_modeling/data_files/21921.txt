I was drawing coke when I was thru I looked at myself and I had big muscles and a nice suntan. I felt young, strong and healthy. I was at a race track. The fellows were playing some sort of game. I can't recall if it was tag or football or bowling, etc. The manager of the track called me Evans. I was surprised he knew my name. We walked away from the track. Bob Gibson was at our house. He was doing something on our wall. Ann was admiring him. He was tall and had a young face.
