My parents took in a male boarder, and we were attracted to each other, although we never said anything. We just exchanged glances. Then we had to move and I would have to transfer colleges or board at school which I didn't like. We were going to move to Willoughby, I believe. We went to look for a house and found one on the next street. It was pink and cost $75.00 a month for rent. We went to look at it and liked the big backyard. When we came back to our house, my father was sitting on the porch talking to 2 elderly men. It was summertime. I remember realizing that my father was getting old because he never takes time out to relax long enough to sit on the porch. It made me a little sad. But I was glad we had found a house here so I wouldn't have to transfer schools.
