I found all these old video games. Some of them were ones I used to play when I was little. One was a dinosaur game and I was like "Oh and you can change things into dinosaurs". They were sorted by console and some were 'paper'. It had that fortune teller paper thing. This other dinosaur game was the "saddest" game. It was made in 1972. This other game was this one where you race along a road and pick stuff up and dodge obstacles. I said "I used to play this with Uncle Vic".
