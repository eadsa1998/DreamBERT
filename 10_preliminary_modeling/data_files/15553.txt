I was watching Grey's Anatomy. Izzie was wheeling this closed off thing with a patient in it, who turned out to be Karev. He stopped it though and got out and kissed her and they were happy. Then it was real life and I was her and he was the guy I liked. He got out and Mom and Darren were in the room which was like a big warehouse shed with nothing in it. He kissed me and then did a 'drop' thing and kissed me hard. We kissed for ages and then Mom said 'cake' and there was a weird yellow cake with icing. Then I was on Facebook or something and Benjamin mentioned "his small son" had added some favourite movie to his list. He had mentioned the kid before, but I said that I thought he had been joking. I was upset.
