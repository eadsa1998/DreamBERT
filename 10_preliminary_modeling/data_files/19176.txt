I was out in the country and lived next door to Dr. Paff. The entrance to his house was unusual. There were these two short converging brick walls with a white concrete plaque in between. This led by a short open space to a six-sided open affair with a brick floor (gazebo-like). The house had a library (the books were similar to the ones here upstairs. In fact, the library looked the same as the central room upstairs). I was outside sitting on the curb when a car pulled up and a doctor (M.D.) rushed into the house. When he came out, Dr. Paff had arrived (on foot) and the doctor said, "George, your wife is dead of a heart attack." George said no crude instrument could determine that--and he went into the house to see for himself. He came out and agreed with the doctor and they both thought it was quite funny that his wife was dead. In fact, they were both laughing. Then the doctor said, "Too bad, no more $300.00 a month and it was a nice library she had purchased for you, even if it was used."
