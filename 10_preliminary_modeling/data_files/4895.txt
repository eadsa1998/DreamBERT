I am visiting my "ex-husband" Robin Williams, I want to visit with my son. I am arranging he visiting times and will take my son with me for a few days. I can't seem to get Robin to talk about it with me. In addition, his second wife is cool to me. She and two other women, presumably her sister and friend are wearing the exact same blouse, a grey and white design with soft gauzy material. Finally someone agrees I can take my son for awhile. I pick him up and then stop to choose some chocolates from my "ex husband's" stash. Nestle's crunchy bars and so on. I gleefully choose some to take with me.
