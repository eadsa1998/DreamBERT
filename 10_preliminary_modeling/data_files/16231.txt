I was in this store called Anderson Audio, like Derek works at, and it had audio stuff in it. And I was walking around and looking at different stuff, but I saw a bunch of furniture and stuff in addition to that. Then I went up to the front counter, and the lady at the front was so impressed with me and she was showing me these things that she had in her display case. First she showed me a porcelain music box rocking horse with this saddle that was made out of this really, really soft material, and it was ornate and stuff. And then she showed me this snow globe that was in the shape of a Santa face. It was flat and it was plastic, and when you tip it upside down, the lyrics to "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" -- each word was on a little black piece of plastic and they would all just kind of fall into place and be suspended in the water, and you'd tip it upright again. And then lastly she showed me this show globe that had a cardinal in it, and it was like the one with two cardinals from M____ that ________. And it was part of that collection. And she gave me the rocking horse and the cardinal for half price, but I wasn't really interested in the snow globe. And then I woke up.
