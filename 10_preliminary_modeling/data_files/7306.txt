He asked why do not all of us live in small apartments? I said, "Too many children. If a baby cries, it disturbs at least one person; and if another baby hears it, it will cry too." He tries to tell me about the railroad but I have lived here a long time and know the way. So I start out. Look out one door; that's not right, then go out the other and down narrow streets between high walls turning to the left and ahead until the last turn brings me to a street and house I recognize and I go in. It is nearly 11 a.m. and I must get back by noon. I've had no breakfast and the waiters are setting tables, only raisin bread. I take a piece and spread it lightly explaining I had had nothing to eat and was hungry.
