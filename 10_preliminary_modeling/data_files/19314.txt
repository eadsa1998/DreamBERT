I was in my school walking down the B-wing hallway, crying. I had just found out that my dad was having an affair (which would never happen). I heard a plane flying in the air, looked out the window, and saw it trying to land. But there were too many cars in the parking lot, so it crashed into the A-wing side of the school. I heard a big boom and lots of screams. Then I saw my Spanish teacher, Mr. Miller, yelling at people to get moving out of the school as fast as possible. The A-wing was in complete flames.
