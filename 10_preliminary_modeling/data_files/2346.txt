A young man wants to go on a date with me and I am interested but still have the old fears, but I agree to go. I get into the little red car. I'm in the passenger seat. It's a tiny, foreign car. He drives right on the edge of the road which is a dropoff to a river. I peer over the edge and say how pretty it is, the water eddying like that, but get scared because he's driving so close to the edge. So I can see that we are in danger. I glare at him. Then he makes the car jump over a gap over the river, like the car is a horse. We are successful; then he does it again only we don't quite make it and the car hits the water right at the edge. We crawl out and he's embarrassed. I kneel down and sit beside him, amazed I can do that. He moves away from me, embarrassed. I wish to comfort him. Two men come over to get info on what happened. I call him Charlie/Howard
