I was a little boy, well maybe 8 years old, and I was holding one of those model rockets that really blasts off. The rocket was tattered. My clothes, which was a suit, was tattered, and my mom's expensive dress was tattered. My mom was really sad, and she kept saying, "You blew up 100 thousand acres! A 6th of the property!" I was embarrassed. Evidently I had wrecked a lot of stuff with my rocket. In the dream I think I really ruined my house. Setting: In a room that once was in a mansion, but now looks like a bomb went off in it. Characters: Me, a rich little boy, and his mom. I was watching "Richie Ray" (the poor little rich boy) yesterday, and I think I was Richie and the woman was his mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, shame. My little brother is very interested in model rockets. I was watching Richie Ray yesterday.
