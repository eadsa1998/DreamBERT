I am a member of a woman's club. The president of the club and another woman get into a scandal thing with one woman supposedly moving in on the other's husband. There are two teen boys as well that kind of do the same kind of thing, one taking something the other has. Now the president doesn't come to meetings. I guess she is ashamed. Time passes, and at a meeting I watch as the two women start talking it all through and now the whole thing is understood and accepted and behind them. The president resumes her duties. Now I am at a woman's house. I am admiring a special tree where she has grafted different fruits on it. There are grapes and cantaloupes and bananas on it. I am very impressed. How neat to grow your own fresh fruit, all on one convenient tree. I look at a series of glass tubes with liquid stuff bubbling around in them. I ask some questions. These tubes are the special acid/ph factor balance stuff for this special tree. Now I am eating a cantaloupe from the tree, only as much as I say, Ummm, how tasty," it really isn't. I keep scraping out these masses of black seeds, like watermelon seeds. It never seems to end. The bites are stringy and pulpy. I finally realize this isn't good fruit. Now I go inside to help the woman decide to leave her husband. She hasn't opened her mind to what misery she is really experiencing in the relationship. Now she sees it.
