I had a dream last night that there was a second rink at my college and that all these guys were playing a new kind of hockey. They weren't skating, but instead they ran around with large oversized crayons, whacking a ball around on the floor. Sam had brought me, but I didn't want to play. I just wanted to watch. Philip was there, but I can't remember why. At one point, Sam tried to get me a crayon so I could play, and I think Philip was jealous. The rink was the deepest shade of green I have ever seen (or imagined). And the "ice" was yellow. And the rink was a sort of dank and deserted place, but there were secret rooms and an elaborate system of staircases. But this shade of green just seemed too dark to be real, but I remember knowing that it was green.
