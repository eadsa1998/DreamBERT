I had attended a movie at 105th Street and was sitting next to some other girls from school, although I did not seem to recognize their identity otherwise. However, I left them and was walking along Euclid Avenue alone. Just after I had passed 107th Street, I saw a police cruiser and the thought came to my mind of the safety it implied. However, soon afterwards, a man started to follow me. He seemed to walk just a step or so behind me and talk to me continually. He told me that his wife was out with a colored man, but that after she had attended a funeral, and would be home again. At first I did not seem to fear him, but as he continued to follow me, my fear grew. I was about to throw an egg at him which I realized I had in my hand (where I got it I do not know) when I woke.
