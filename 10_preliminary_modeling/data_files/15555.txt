I was at the old house. Benjamin and Ezra were there. Benjamin was staying for a bit and it was awkward. We were dating though. Mom's car was in the driveway and it was dark red. I had trouble locking up. I tried to call Mom but there was no answer. I said I was going there to get my car. Benjamin was in the passenger seat. We went to this cinema place. There were horror movies with different themes, one of them was food. There were appetizers in the shape of rings and I was happy that no-one got them. Then it was a movie about World War 3. These bombs were aimed at this island where the main characters were. It was a little bomb and they ran. They survived, along with one other person and had just been far enough away to avoid getting burnt. One of them had a kid.
