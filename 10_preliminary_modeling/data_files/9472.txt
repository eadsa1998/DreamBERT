A handsome man comes to the house to repair something others leave; he embraces me and invites me to sleep with him "but you better protect yourself; I say this to all my women." "I know how to do it" I say and skip out. -- Just then Reynaldo has a nightmare and I call the doctor: Dr. Lowry comes over right away, I tell her I rent a room to the man next door; she stays a long time. Frank, sullen, comes home and then we all go on a very fast, exciting boat ride to a grand eating place.
