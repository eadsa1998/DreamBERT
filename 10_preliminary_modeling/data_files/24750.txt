Everyone gathered in the ballroom for seminars (which is strange, because usually we go to different places). For some reason the only seminar going on was what's on your mind. A few people would have to go out and collect trash and mud and weeds. I was one of the first people to go. When we came back we were in an outside ditch. Then I had to go out again and when I came back, this time we were in the ballroom again. My friend Jerry, well he kept running around and tapping everyone on the head. Setting: The ballroom, and outside in a ditch - someplace I've never been. Characters: Jerry, Devin, Courtlyn, Sophie, Sandy, Lynne, my best buds. Aviva - a girl I really don't like. Faceless teachers. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, funny. It made me feel weird and happy - kind of airy.
