Melinda and I were sitting out in the courtyard and we kind of lost track of what time it is, and I told her it was like 12:02 and it was the middle of the English class. So her and I went up the elevator, and the elevator was dark and I kind of lost her in the elevator, and then I proceeded to English class, but it was so late I didn't want to go in without her. So I kind of ducked around down a flight of stairs and I kind of hid in a corner somewhere. And I was kind of like waiting for her, and she never came. And then I somehow made my way out to behind the gym and I was kind of walking back and forth out on the field while the people were having P.E. And then I made my way in into the girls' locker room so I could get out. And I was getting ready to go out the front of the gym when I realized that the doors had Christmas decorations on them and they were all taped shut. They had like artificial pine bows with those crystal angels we saw at Fletchers, and I got tangled in a bunch of wires because they had a TV and a VCR and stuff over there. And I dreamt that I was kind of like really skipping the last period too, so that it would look like I went home. And that's all.
