I was shining my car and someone came and said if I used a banana on the car and buff it out, I would get a gloss that would hold up for months. I was cleaning out snow. I broke out a hole where there was a fire, red hot ashes. I walked up the creek and there was a steam pipe letting out steam. I saw fish in the creek. I had a stick and pushed out a big fish. He landed on the shore. Wiatrak came near looking at him and the fish snapped at his nose. I was cleaning a store and there were chocolate bars on the walls. I was eating some of them. A lady was driving my Pontiac. I looked at the results. I saw a lot of names that were familiar, but I can't recall them now. One track had fancy printing of the names and a sort of decoration. One name was Espopo or it seemed like that and it was 92, the win, and we looked at this to see if it was 92 cents or $92. Then another track had numbers stamped on metal plate. I was riding streetcars.
