I was at some sort of exploratory museum.  I went to the ATM for something.  I put my card in and was about to put in my PIN but there were no numerical buttons on the keypad, and the machine didn't ask for it.  Instead I had to answer a bunch of different questions like on an intelligence test.  I started going through it with a bunch of people around me before I figured out it would continue to go on- it wasn't a real ATM, it was some sort of exhibit.  I was mad to be fooled and have my time wasted.  I wandered back out into the main room.  One of my mother's old Bunko buddies was there, and she made an announcement about a sausage exhibit.  Someone else said, "soycon".  I got excited and wanted to see this exhibit, where we could make our own sausage, even vegetarian sausage.  So I started looking for my boyfriend Jeremy so he could see the exhibit too, even though I didn't know exactly where it was.  The place was crowded and I went searching for him, continually getting delayed and pulled into group photos.  One had my old classmate Jim Schumann.
