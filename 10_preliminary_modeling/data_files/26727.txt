 I'm in a stadium-like place or temple. There are four upside-down pillars. The stadium works in one specific way. We are trying to figure it out. There are four chair bottoms, with wheels on them, turned upside down at the top of four metal poles. It's as if when the temple is flipped over it will roll on the chair bottoms. The four pillars are in a square arrangement, with an entrance of some sort between two of them. Bill Cosby is around the temple. We are to rub the pillars for help, maybe while being beaten up. Something happens with gang-related violence, and instructions for being beaten up. One is to go by a pillar and yell out loud to get someone in specific to see you. I feel as though I'm in a wok, spinning around the edges of the inside. Something happens with my Van Diemen's Land class examination. There is an average score of about 12, which gives a total of 72 (I think there are six people there). My classmate Fiona Ulness is there. We spin or are whirled around in a circular formation. There are four of something, or four parts. We're above a large stadium in Los Angeles in a ferris wheel-like structure. I sit in a bowl-shaped metal structure four feet wide and several feet deep. We're moving in a circular motion. I'm very afraid of the height we're at. I think I may have to jump out of the bowl when I get near the upper deck of the stadium: jumping and landing on the seats, which would be frightening.
