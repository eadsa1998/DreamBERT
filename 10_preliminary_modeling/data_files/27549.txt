In my dream, I awoke to go to classes. I went to get dressed and found that all my clothes were gone. I searched the house and finally found my clothes on the third floor. I dressed and went downstairs to eat breakfast and found the refrigerator bare. I looked around for something to eat but found nothing. Then I went to get m~ coat and books and found them only after a long search. Finally I got out of the house and just as I got to the bus stop, the bus pulled away. When I got to school, all of my classes for the day were over.
