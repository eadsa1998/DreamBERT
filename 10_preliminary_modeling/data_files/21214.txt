Grandpa, Bob and I were going to Herman Marolt's wedding. We parked the car and were waiting for a streetcar. It was night and we let one go by us and watched it go down the track. Something broke on my car and I was to charge it up to Marolt. I looked in on the selections and picked some winners, but I forgot the names when I awoke.
