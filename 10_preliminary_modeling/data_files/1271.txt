There were two baby boys. One of them had his penis on his head. The mother was a little upset. She asked, "Is this normal?" I assured her it was. That as the baby grew, the penis moved down where it was supposed to be. Later, I was aware of uneasiness because I realized that I was wrong. The kid was definitely abnormal! My baby's name was Fred. I found a babysitter, I didn't really care who, just so I could leave for a while. I drove down town, looking for music. I saw groups of people, musicians playing. I weaved between and around them. I came back home to my swimming pool. I was a school teacher. Some movie star type gave me the pool. The water was deep and warm.
