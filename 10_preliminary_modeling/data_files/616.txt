I am with a friend who is a lesbian and we are at a bar and have been drinking. I am acting stupid. Later I am at a church and the friend and two other women are among the crowd. Some woman I don't know tells me she saw me last night and I was disgusting. She either thinks I am a lesbian or I assume she thinks this because of whom I am with. I tell the friend I feel bad about being told I was disgusting. She suggests counseling in an indirect w ay and next thing I know a male minister is there to see me. We try to find a room to go to but can't. In one room there is an old woman. Another is just a closet but I can't get there because furniture is blocking my way. There is also something about a house set in a hillside and a crooked foundation.
