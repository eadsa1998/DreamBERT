 I'm going on a camping trip which is going to last 10 days. There will be 10 people on the trip. It is the night before we leave and I am up late (10:00pm) and haven't packed. Matt Yams, Gino Teavor, Rita, and Kari Otis, who are all grade school classmates, are going on the trip. I wonder if it will be cold. I get a pair of hiking boots and sweat pants, and a sleeping bag. I eat a lot of food before leaving, including noodles and fish.
