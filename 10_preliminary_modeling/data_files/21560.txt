I saw and heard Weight. I am in Japan and riding on some kind of saucer. We had no wheels, but I piloted it by leaning to one side and scooted along the ground at a high rate of speed, about 80 miles per hour. I was with another Japanese who was in one and we sort of raced. I beat him. Then I saw another saucer. We dragged it off the street onto the sidewalk and opened the top cover and there were people inside. The Japanese ridiculed our religion that we swore and prayed at the same time. I said, "We say, 'I am sorry God that I swore' and we are forgiven," which made sense to the Japanese woman who was ridiculing us. I had a handful of pennies and other coins. I was counting them. When I saw an Indianhead penny, I picked it up and it was not an Indian head penny, but a foreign coin. In my sleep I seemed to hear in the clouds and cloud eight.
