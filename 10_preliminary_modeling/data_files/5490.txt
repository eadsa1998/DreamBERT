Last night I dreamt that my daughter M gave me a mothers day gift, and it was a basket or a bowl, I don't remember now filled with fresh shelled peanuts and I couldn't eat them for some reason I wasn't allowed to eat them and down in the center of the peanuts, in a box, nicely wrapped, in white paper tied with a blue ribbon. And she told me to open my gift and I did and there were 2 place mats. I don't know how they fit into that small box but there they were. One end of the place mats was beautifully cross-stitched, they were Irish linen and the cross stitching was green and black, the linen was an unbleached color like a muslin, they were not very pretty but she was so pleased that I told her they were just lovely.
