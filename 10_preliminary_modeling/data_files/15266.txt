Mom, Ezra and I went to Aunt Sally's, but they weren't home. Mom and I went out the back and I threw a towel in the pool and then remembered this wasn't our place. We snuck out as they got home. Bryson saw us and asked what we were doing and Aunt Sally said 'mind telling me why there's a towel in the pool?' and I said it was like that when we got there. Then we lived there. Dad just got home and Ezra forgot to put the dishwasher on (so Dad could make dinner). We walked out the front and my car was in the middle of the road. This cop looking car drove 'over' it and pulled up across the road. I angrily shouted and the guy got out and just smirked at me. I went over and kicked his car. The other neighbours just went in and told Dad, so he came up to the car and yelled out and then went out. He said he was trying to fix it and it was totally screwed. I started crying and said I was a university student and wouldn't be able to attend now. I asked when I could get a new car. There was a musical called 'Uberletzen'.
