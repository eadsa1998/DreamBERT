 I'm on the sidewalk at the southeast corner of the intersection of 2nd Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley. I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We kiss and touch each other. Her hair blows in my mouth. She has to buy underwear. I say that "this makes me want to bend her over". We talk and it is clear that any physical contact that occurs between us is simply because we're physically attracted to each other. There are no other expectations or commitments. This is made clear. We are somewhere near Curve or Last Avenue in Oak Valley, somewhat near the Olson's house but also near the yellow house on the end of Last Avenue next to the railroad tracks. She asks me, "What did you get from that day?", referring to the day I wrote the brutally honest letter to her. [I awaken here due to my alarm clock, but I know that what I was about to reply was, "A feeling". It was a feeling of relief, of freedom, of honesty. A very good feeling.]
