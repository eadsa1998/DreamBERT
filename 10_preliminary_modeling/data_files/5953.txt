A group of friends and I are standing in a long line of people waiting to enter a patriotic shrine or public monument. The group is in a rowdy mood and there is much joking and kidding. As we walk single file through an underground hallway at the entrance we notice that there are signs hanging on the walls spelling out the rules for the monument. They state, "No Smoking", "No Eating", "No Drinking", and so on. When we see a sign that says, "No Onions", everyone laughs at how ridiculous this is. "I guess carrots are okay", I joke sarcastically, "just no onions." Someone ahead in the line calls down, "No salad." "No salad?", I respond. "What about vegetable oil?" "No vegetable oil", comes the reply. Sure enough, just then I pass under a doorway where the two lines "No Salad, No Vegetable Oil" are painted overhead.
