I arrived late at a party in what seemed like a community center of an apartment complex.  Seemed like there was a live band there.  I was dressed up, high heels.  I went to get my lunch, everyone was making sandwiches.  I built my sandwich, and the lettuce leaves were huge, unwieldy, awkward to handle.  I was trying to fold one over while holding my plate.  I was aware of men looking at me.  I knew my figure looked nice, and thought they might be wondering how I could eat so much and stay thin.  I finally got the lettuce handled and folded over, and took my plate to an area I wanted to sit.  The particular place I chose was not meant for a chair, it was a small formica counter by a wall, so I moved one over there and sat, or maybe someone helped me get a chair there.  I did not want to sit toward the front or out in the middle.
