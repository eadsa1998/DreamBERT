I was at some kind of flea market that had a bunch of really cool jewelry shops, and it had a calendar shop. So then my mom introduces me to this lady, a very strange looking lady. After the lady goes to one of the shops, my mom whispers to my grandma that she is a rapist. I heard that and was scared. So I look around at one jewelry shop when I have to go to the bathroom. The strange lady came by and I told her I had to go. She said, "I'll take you," and grinned at me. I screamed for my grandma and when she came I said to both of them, "Will you both take me?" because I didn't want to be alone with the lady. My grandma told me she would be delighted to take me to the bathroom. The bathroom is all set up like a stable and I go in one of the stalls. Then my grandma said she had to leave and I was going to have to walk alone with this lady. When I get into the stall, it's not a stall. There's a rodeo going on. My friend Diana was there and I asked her if she could walk me back, but she couldn't. All of a sudden I remember it's my dad's birthday, so I leave the rodeo and the strange lady tugged me around and I started yelling. Then I woke up. Setting: In a flea market in some kind of cowboy place.
