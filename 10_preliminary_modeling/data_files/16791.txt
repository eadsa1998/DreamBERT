I was at a campground where a seminar was being held. I was talking with Eliza. A group of people were gathering around the stairs in front of a building to have their picture taken. Eliza said, "Hurry, don't you want to be in the picture?" I ran towards the group but it was like I was running in slow motion. When I reached the group everyone was leaving.
