I dreamt that I was a spectator in the Cleveland stadium. There were many people there. We watched a baseball game. The pitcher was my brother (10). In the game the pitcher called balls and strikes because there were no umpires. The first pitch was a good one and my brother called it a strike. The next three pitches were wide of the plate and designated balls. That made the count three balls and one strike. The next pitch was bad but my brother called it a strike. This made me feel anxious.
