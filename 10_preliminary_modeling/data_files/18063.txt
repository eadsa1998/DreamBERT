Donald Duck, Mickey, Goofy and other animals were on a ship getting ready to go on a ride on another land. They got caught in a storm and a thing like a cocker spaniel puppy was on a little thing-boat, but all by himself with just a teddy bear. Donald Duck wanted to get to shore so he pulled on a little wooden thing that the puppy thought was going to be his food because he was fishing. The puppy said, "what are you doing" and Donald said, "pulling to shore" and the puppy said, "no, not that" and started to cry because that was all he had. Well a seal came along and said "hop on our ship, yours is little and is going to fall over". The seal said gather up your things and come on our ship. The seal fell off and she was in the water somewhere and she got another home. They got to shore and it was the next day that day a big fat walrus decided to make the ship his home so when they started floating along the ocean floor the walrus made the ship tip and tip and Donald Duck saw it and said, "get off, ,get off, get off our ship." The walrus off and the animals found the seal on the way back home and got home safely and the puppy found its mother.
