I can't remember the beginning, but Dad, a young boy, Darren, Mom and I were at this pool thing. I don't remember what happened there. Anyway, we were driving down a road and there were lots of really different sections of scenery. There was a lake thing with a chair ride that was old and faded. There were other rides there. There was a field with these tall purple flowers. They were creepy and I said they looked like they were from "lollipop land". There was a small section of water that was beach like (over sand). It was a very light blue. I said it was kind of pretty. We then ended up at this hotel and it had a big pool. I said it was 'luxurious', although it was actually kind of cheap looking. They we were in there and Mom was waiting for Darren, "in case he's dead"? She tried calling him. No-one else was here, by the way. There was a plate that had biscuits in the shape of us with bacon and other stuff in them. I took a bit of one then a lady and Darren were at the table in there. Then it was Dad there with the lady. They were acting weird and they said he'd eaten breakfast. They gave us food and said to eat. I asked what it was and they wouldn't tell me so I chucked it back on the plate and said "I'm done" and walked off. I went into a room which had a big garden. Dad and the lady came in and she was angry at me ad Dad kept her off. He said, in this deep booming voice, "I am Sing Tha, son of Urie" or something. Then he said "I am God". I was like 'yeah right, ok'. He said he was looking for "Eve" who was a lady who had married into our family.
