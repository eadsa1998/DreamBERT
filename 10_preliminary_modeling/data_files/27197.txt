I dreamed of a girl, who is just a casual acquaintance of mine. This girl was insane. I was in a bar with some friends of mine. This insane girl came in with her two sisters. The minute she saw me, she started to run towards me. I was terrified &amp; started to run around the circular bar. The sisters tried to get her under control but seemed to be having a difficult time with her. I ran upstairs hoping that the sisters would take her home. I thought they had gone, so I came downstairs again &amp; was quite calm when I saw her again. She had managed to free herself from her sisters &amp; returned to the bar. When she saw me, she laughed hysterically &amp; started to approach me. Her sisters were right behind her and immediately grabbed her arms &amp; again tried to take her home.
