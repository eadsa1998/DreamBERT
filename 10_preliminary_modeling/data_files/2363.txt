I was chosen to be interviewed by S, the college president, but it's unclear if my papers were approved in time, so I clutch my briefcase with my acceptance letter in it and try to find the building. A woman student and Ellie help guide me to the building. I find a sign saying "504," the room. I rush to the room, hoping, feeling late and uncertain. I am there in the nick of time. I am calm and handle it well.
