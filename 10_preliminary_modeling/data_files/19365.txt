I was a teacher of some sort, with a bunch of little kids, waiting for a ride out in the rain. It started to really come down. The children gathered closely, then we walked into a house. There I remember taking off my shoes and walking into the basement of the house. I laid in a bed and my girl friend was also in the bed. We were listening to a band that in real life we both like, and then she left. I looked all around the basement for her, and when I walked to the bottom of the stairs, a glare came through the window at the top, and then she was standing on the stairs.
