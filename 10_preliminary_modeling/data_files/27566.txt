I was walking down a path, out in the country. The path led thru an athletic field. On one side of me there were tennis courts with men playing; on the other side, a group of men were playing catch. I didn't  know any of them. One of the boys playing ball had red hair. We caught each others eye several times. As I kept on walking thru and away from the scene I kept looking back at him. Then I found my self in a dark spot (forest maybe) but I was lying down on a blanket trying to go to sleep. All the while I could still see the boy with the red hair playing catch.
