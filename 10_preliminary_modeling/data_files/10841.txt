I was looking at a picture in a magazine of parallel lines of dead women floating upon a river, when suddenly the picture came to life. I remember thinking to myself that somehow I knew all these women were German peasantry and all approximately 50 years of age identically resembling each other. As I looked upon the scene, one of the women returned to life by opening her eyes. Then I awoke.
