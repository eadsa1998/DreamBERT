I've been at a large glamorous motel, it's night, the place is all lit up and glittery, festive. [Something dramatic happens, and I end up leaving the scene in a hurry in a van with somebody else, being driven by a young boy.] We seem to be driving away from the motel, but it's much bigger than I thought, and the buildings keep on looking alike as we drive through. We've already turned right twice. The buildings are less glamorous now, but you'd suppose they would be. We make another right turn, and come into another neighborhood, and drive along a fence which is down an alley; or at least the fence is between two blocks of houses back-to-back; it doesn't seem like an alley, really. We come to where the fence stops, and get out. For some reason we're reluctant to go to the other side of the fence, because we're not sure what's there. So we walk around rather than take the van. On the other side it's daylight. It looks just like the side we were on, houses and all just the way it should be, but it's daylight instead of night. (Actually it's not pitch dark anyway - you might think of it as more dawn, you can see a bit - but not dusk, it's definitely been night.) We look back again to see, and by George it's still night over there, and day here. There's something suspicious about this and uncomfortable, like this daylight is not the way it's supposed to be, and we're going to get into big trouble if we stay here.
