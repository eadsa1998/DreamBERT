I am working with a sensitive male actor. I am rolling his hair into curls on small rollers. People keep making remarks about him being gay. He keeps saying he is NOT gay. I make the comment I am tired of people assuming man is gay because he is effeminate or emotionally sensitive. I feel very tender toward him and protective. I try to finish rolling his hair. He doesn't want to do this any more. I coax him into it.
