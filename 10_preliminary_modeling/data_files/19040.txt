I had an impression when I was awakened that I had been driving on a high cliff in an automobile, the kind they have in Southern California. I thought for a minute that was all I could remember, and then I remembered that I had been dreaming of eating a Chinese meal, a very elaborate Chinese meal. I think there are four people there, that is four spaces at the table. I'm not sure who the others were. It was like two couples I guess, and there's something, I just got the idea of a compass. Someone pointing out the directions of the compass. I can see this waiter serving white rice and pieces of pineapple, and I guess asparagus. Sounds awful now, but it looked awfully good in the dream. Something about the waiter. He was I guess a kind of surly character. I wasn't sure I trusted him. There was some question of whether this wasone of the courses in the meal or whether what we were going to get. For some reason I have a thought of Hawaii and Pearl Harbor and airplanes bombing. I don't see any connection in the dream. Maybe the pineapples.
