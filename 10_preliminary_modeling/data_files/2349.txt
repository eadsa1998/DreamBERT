Bad guys upstairs in my house are killing everyone and I must hide! I'm in the basement. I crawl into a hidden hole, pulling the phone in with me. I call 911 and report them and then I wait. They come down the stairs and I wait, hoping the police get here before these guys find me. The police arrive and I'm safe, but desolate because my people are all dead.
