We are visiting Patrick &amp; Margaret: I help pull out the table, as we do at our home. After the meeting, as Margaret leaves, she gives me a long cardboard box with lots of "stuff" in it. (Song talked about "too much stuff.") I hear that Margaret's eldest daughter is divorced, as is the youngest. (not sure) As we leave Patrick waves good-bye in a friendly manner. (Feeling of loss and alienation from the Book Cafe.)
