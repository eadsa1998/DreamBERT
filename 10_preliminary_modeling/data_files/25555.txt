 I'm at the Tom Thumb that is on Main Street and 2nd Avenue in Oak Valley. We have a big van. A man and I are getting dropped off. We are going to my house. Two other people are guests in the van. There is a woman who is the driver of the van. I pay $140 for gas! It is expensive: we didn't get much gas for our money. There is a new young woman employee working at the cash register. A person I know from the neighborhood, Mack Slick, is also getting gas. We exit the Tom Thumb parking lot and turn right, going north on 2nd Avenue. I am driving, and I drive fast. I have trouble getting the vehicle into second gear. I am in a small red car that isn't mine. There is a car turning left in front of me. I swerve to the right. There is a car in front of me after I swerve, and I swerve back to the left into two lanes of oncoming traffic. There is car coming straight towards me. I try to swerve back to the right, but don't make it. The car skids and slides sideways. I think the driver (i.e., me) is going to get smashed by the oncoming car. This doesn't happen. We slide along the edge of the road through trees and lawns. We avoid hitting parked cars and people. We make it to a side street and swerve back on the main road.
