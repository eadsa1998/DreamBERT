The 2 oak trees in Sutbury that are partially burned are in the dream, and 2 hemlocks that have been partially sawed thru. Somehow George Jacobs, a boy up the road, who is in my employ, either arranges or allows them to be cut down completely. I'm very angry and I'm censoring him for not asking my permission before going through with it.
