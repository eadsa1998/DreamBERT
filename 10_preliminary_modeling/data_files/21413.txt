We were in the house. A storm came up. The wind came in heavy blasts and I noticed the sky was reddish. I said, "I'm going outside to see if there is a tornado coming." I looked up at the sky. The clouds were flying fast and the wind blew hard. Then I noticed different objects forming in the sky. Bricks formed and built like a wall up in the sky and the wind died down. I was standing on the banks of Lake Erie and there were cars going by below. I threw out an object at random and it landed near one of the cars. The fellows in the car looked up at me and started after me. I flew across the park and home. To my surprise, they followed me home. They came into the house and I noticed it was Alex Rambox, an old boyhood friend of mine I hadn't seen in more than 40 years. He was going to beat me up because he thought I threw the object at him. I said, "I'm not afraid of you, but I will tell you I didn't throw the object at you. I just threw it into the lake and you happened to come by and it landed near you." They wouldn't believe me. Alex picked up my bread knife. I said, "Put it down." But he said no. I said, "I'll fight you fair, but put the knife down." So he put the knife down and came for me. I grabbed him and turned him upside down and raised him up and down and bounced his head on the floor till he gave up. Then we talked about other boys in the family as to where they were now and we became friendly. I saw some pigs. One of them got on the back of another and the female's vagina enlarged and opened up. I pointed the rifle and shot at him two times and missed.
