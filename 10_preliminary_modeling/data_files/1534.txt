I am in a house setting, but it is a hospital of some kind. I am going back in and am wondering why I am. A nurse comes up to me and starts yelling. She's cold and mean, calling the patients bastards. I start yelling at her, calling her a "son of a bitch." She's coming at me with medication. She says, "If you don't take the pill, I'll give you a shot." I fight her, holding off her hand with the needle. I run, escaping. I grab slices of roast beef as I leave and eat them because I haven't eaten in awhile and will not be able to eat for awhile longer. I hop on a horse and gallop away up into the hills. We walk in the stream for awhile to cover our tracks. We find a tree. I build a hide-out of boards and moss.
