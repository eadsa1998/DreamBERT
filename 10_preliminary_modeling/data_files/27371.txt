I had a job in some sort of plant (factory) and I worked at a machine which resembled a cream separator used on small farms. I cannot recall the operation of this machine at all. The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act.
