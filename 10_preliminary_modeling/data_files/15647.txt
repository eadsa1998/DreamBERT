I went to this P90X boot camp thing. It was free, though you were expected to have already bought the DVDs. There was a free package which had weighted gloves and resistance bands and I couldn't lift level 2/3. Tony Horton came near me while I was looking through the package. Later a group of new people asked a girl to get something so they could measure their weight. She refused to show them and Tony called to me. It weighed you and showed everyone your weight, but I did it anyway.
