The girls and I are at a track meet. We are high in the stands and I can't see too well over the crowd. They start running. I go across to see them as they leave the stadium. Some of the runners are good looking, some are M.R.'s and are very uncoordinated. I see one in trouble and go down to help. An older man, sort of like Ray Milland, likes me and flirts. I flirt back and then go back to the top of the stadium. I watch more runners. A cow with horns threatens them. I take my German book down there. A woman official is very pleased with me and walks back up with me, encouraging me to join their elite group, with the guy too. She says, "How do you say it in German?," and I say, "Du bist muy wonderful," and laugh and say, "It's a joke because the last two words aren't German." I remember my German book down by the cow. We go down to get it. She is very pleased with me. When we come backup, Ray Milland is walking with me arm in arm and we are laughing and enjoying each other's company.
