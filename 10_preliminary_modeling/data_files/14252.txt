I was at home except it had a lot of windows. We were leaving for school. I was outside and the car was on the grass. The window for my room was on that side of the house and I realized I left my light on. I asked Dad, who was inside, to turn it off. He complained under his breath. When he came out I said I'd get in the car when it was off the lawn so I didn't get prickles. Then we were all playing Warcraft, except it was totally different. Swarms would come towards you, but you had to protect houses on the streets from them. Mom and someone were taking the next spawn. I told them not to worry about it because the last guy would get them, but then I realized this spawn were 'elephants' (which were big blue elephant balloons) and they were coming towards our house (they bounced on the houses and smashed them). I looked in through the window and saw my computer and I was freaking out. I could see I was halfway through typing up a dream as well. They got them all though.
