There were either two groups of people or two people that represented two groups. Each group lived in very different cultures. We were trying over and over to come to some compromise that would allow us to respect each other's cultural differences and yet feel respected ourselves. I was determined that we could find something that both groups would be okay with. We did not find a resolution before I woke up.
