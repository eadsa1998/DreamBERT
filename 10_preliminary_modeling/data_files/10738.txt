Last night I dreamt that I received a phone call at the dorm and it was my father telling me that I shouldn't get excited, but my mother was killed. It seems she and my father were fishing on the lake, which they never do, and some sort of electric current from the motor electrocuted her. My father and little sister didn't seem to be terribly upset about the whole thing and I just couldn't understand it because I was crying and crying and kept calling home to find out if it were really so. I can remember walking in a cemetery which seemed like Forest Lawn Cemetery in Los Angeles and again I was crying. That's about all I remember except that I kept seeing my mother's face in front of me. I woke up in the middle of the night and felt as though I had been crying all night and I felt very upset.
