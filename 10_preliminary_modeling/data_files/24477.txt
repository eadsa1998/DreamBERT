I am one of only several white people caught up in a large group of black people who treat us well but whose aim is to kill us. I am with a woman who is either my daughter or my wife. Depressed and stoop shouldered, she is un-insightful, quiet and stubborn. We are running, being herded up steps and through hallways. At one point there is a chance to escape. The woman hesitates and I tell her to follow me or let go of my hand. I break free and run down a stairwell, which leads to an Asian man with a mop and bucket. The area is fenced off. I implore him to let me pass. He is friendly but suspicious, but then tells me where to go and what to avoid. Recollection ends here.
