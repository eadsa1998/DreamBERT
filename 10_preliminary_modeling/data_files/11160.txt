I found myself standing on the corner of W. 48th and Bridge Ave. On the corner stood a dilapidated old house. There was no door and I walked in. The house was being remodeled. The interior was very beautiful. I noticed one very large wall near an archway; it was completely bare. Adjacent to it was another wall. This wall was very narrow and cluttered with lamps. I walked down a corridor and came upon 4 bedrooms, then I heard footsteps and quickly hid behind a door. A young man walked in looking for whoever had been making the noises. All of a sudden I discovered that I was unclad. I then realized it was twice as important for him not to see me. Then all of a sudden he found me, but I was fully clad when he did. We walked to the front part of the house and there I noticed his wife. She was pregnant. They were both friendly to me; they explained that they were looking for a place to live and found this house. The lady who owned the house was against renting to young couples, but changed her mind when she saw how beautiful the interior was. I remember very well that the man's wife was very sweet and smiled constantly.
