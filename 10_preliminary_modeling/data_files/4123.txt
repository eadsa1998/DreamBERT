I am at some outdoor rodeo festival. I am walking around. Two men are riding horses. One man is attracted to me and me to him, but he is married and has a family. We talk pleasantly for awhile. I ask him where he lives and he points off in a direction. I am confused and ask him again where? He says right there on the shelf with the cans of Pork and Beans, right next to the school. I then see another can of beans being placed there and nod. The other man gets off his horse and I get on. The horse suddenly becomes a bucking bronco. I struggle to remain on the horse wondering at the irony that my regular horse (or ride) is a bronco. Now I am off the horse and writing a message for the man I like in a platter of fried eggs. The message is, "The present contains the past and the future and sometime is a place." As I am hurriedly trying to finish the message for him to read, he is talking with someone else and slowly leaving. I realize he will not see the message.
