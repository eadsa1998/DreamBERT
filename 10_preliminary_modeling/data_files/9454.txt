There is darkness at noon. Sun can't come through. Don't know if I am with Frank or with Edward. Go to a nearby beach with friends from B. City. Walk through the woods and come to a sunny place. See lots of people, eat supper, then go out into a garden. War has been declared. All lights go out and we are ordered to stay where we are. Shift: An old man, a postman, brings me three passports so we can drive to a safe place. I lose one passport but go back to find it in the sand. See M. cautioning me that there is a big explosion up in the sky, like stars exploding. I am scared.
