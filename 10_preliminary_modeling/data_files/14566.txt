I was on the computer and it was yesterday. I was on IMDb and there was a guy called 'random_guy'. In his reviews, he mentioned having seen 3309 movies. I had caught 10-15 minutes of this movie earlier. I can't really remember it, but something fell from the sky. It was a baby and it was raised by these wise Asian guys. I said it would've been better if it had been more suspenseful, mainly complaining about the music. I was then watching South Park and Kyle and Cartman were playing the piano and were in sync and sounded good. I went to comment on it, but then couldn't be bothered. I realized it was nearly 2am and I had to get 6am. I went to the kitchen and was filling my water bottle up. I said to Mom "you need to do my hair" and she said it was already done and then I remembered. I got another water bottle and went to go to bed.
