I was a sort of narrator to the story of Dabney and Nancy W. It was a saga. Dabney went off across America. He knew how to fix things. He met a farmer and offered to chop wood. The farmer got mean and tried to run him off the farm. He got his own axe and they had a "chopping" contest. The table they were chopping on was a beautiful dining room table. Then the farmer was outraged. Dabney fixed the table as if it hadn't been chopped. I was explaining to the farmer that he was very good and could do this. Another farmer came by and saw this. He asked me if Dabney could make a display case for his lintings (like lithographs). I said, "Sure he can." By now, Dabney was a baby about 10 months old. I carried him around but he was still capable of doing all these craft things. Now we were in the farmer's house. The baby had grown up. Now he was a younger brother and he was sort of me. I was also the sister and his older brother. The younger brother came to me and told us that he was in love. He had met this nice girl. We laughed and teased him. "How long have you known her?" "Oh, 2 days." We laughed. He went and got his tools to make the display case. A kitten slipped in the door. He scooted it out. Then a skunk came in. He carefully tried to get it out. It squirted him. 2 more skunks got in. He kicked them out. He complained to the farmer. The farmer got upset. The screen door was broken. A puppy got in. I got him back out. There were now kittens, mice, puppies and skunks out on the porch. A sea gull, wings spread, tried to soar in. I was fighting them off. A hummingbird got in. It threatened my face.
