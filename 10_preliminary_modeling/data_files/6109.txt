Thursday night, 1/28/93 I'm in my bedroom and I hear a scratching noise. I turn and see a brown paper grocery bag which is in front of my shelves where my stereo is. I walk over to the bag. I know there is a lobster inside only I can't see him. I remember thinking that this situation was familiar as if I were thinking, "Oh, yeah, I remember that there is a lobster in the bag in my room that has been there for two days, going on three. I don't want to eat the lobster (I don't like lobster), but I know I am going to cook (boil) it. I have to cook it. I feel badly because it is suffering by being stuck in the bag trying to scratch its way out. I want to let him out but I resist. I'm not sure if I should. For the life of me I can't make a decision on how to end his suffering. I know what the answer is. All I have to do is let him go, but I can't bring myself to do it. I know I can't cook him yet, but I need to end his suffering and sadness. So I go upstairs to my brother's room (my older brother, Dave) in the attic and I ask him how can I end the lobster's suffering. I have no idea what Dave said. End.
