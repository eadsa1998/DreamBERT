A small baby is handed to me to breast feed. She's tired and listless and barely shows interest. I'm amazed that I have milk. She gets the taste and then sucks in the whole nipple and feeds. I feel glad, then I hand her back to the man who gave her to me. The baby is now a rambunctious little animal that frisks and is hard to hold on to.
