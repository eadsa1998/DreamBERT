I was in the pet shop and I was choosing out a cat. And I saw a cat that looked nice, but it was mean. I saw this little girl and she was holding this tiny little nice little kitten. And she was leaving and I said to her "can I see the kitten?" and she said "sure," so she threw it into my hands and my mom paid for it. Then a year later the kitten grew up to be a nice healthy cat and then a few weeks later it had kittens of her own. Well that was a nice thing to see, so put her in this large large cage so she could raise her young there. Then one day I decided to go on an adventure with the mother cat and we did. But there was a lot of danger and we went through a lot of things of danger like falling in water, going across wobbly bridges, and everything dangerous. When I got home with the cat my mom said "we have to give the kittens to a pet shop," so we did and the same with the kittens--they grew into healthy cats like their mother.
