Payton discovered a way to clone yourself. He called it flexing. There were two of him and they were trying to market the flexing machine, but no-one would buy it. I was at a park and the school was there. This guy said "hey Izzy" and he said he was from my class in Year 1 and was called Archie. I had no idea who he was. I was playing on the playground. Someone said something which meant that we had to pay to use the park. The slide had a cigarette on it. This guy took it off and put it in his mouth to put it out.
