I am seated either in the driver's seat, or in the back seat behind it. Dwight was driving and he gets out to adjust something and doesn't put the brakes on. We start rolling and I call out to Dwight. Either I can't reach the brakes, or I don't think to do so, and we roll down a hill and finally crash into someone's garage wall. There was only minor damage to the wall and the red pickup. The man and his wife come out of the house. I recognize him as a local celebrity, perhaps a lecturer, author, or storyteller. Dwight offers to pay and hands him a fist full of change. He almost chooses an old silver dollar and then chooses two old and valuable pennies. We leave, walking. I tell Dwight he gave up too much. The damage was mild but the pennies were worth millions. I insist he go back and renegotiate. I think I'll help teach Dwight how to be assertive. Instead, I just take over and do it myself. I do it well, asking that he give back the pennies and receive recompense more at the level of the damage. He agrees. Then, a weird creature slithers up. It is a human male, but in the form and posture of an alligator. His human eyes are sort of on top of his head like a 'gator. We are introduced to this pet. He then hops on his tail and is now standing like a man on his feet.
