Mom found this guy who looked after animals to look after my mice. I went over there to see them and the guy was really hot. He had black hair and blue eyes, and sort of 'masculine' and not my type, but still very charismatic (though fairly soft-spoken and quiet) and attractive. His house was full of animals and clothing racks [possibly due to stocktaking so many clothing stores lately] with lots of 'sexy' women's clothes of all different sizes - implying that he had many lovers. I remember his last name was Willett, and I think his first name was Dean. We began sleeping together - his 'rule' was that he would pretty much sleep with anyone he wanted to and never got into a relationship with anyone. This carried on for a while. One day I went over to do something with the mice and he had another girl there (hispanic looking). I was unfazed and carried on with the mice and left. Some time later he started getting possessive and told me to not see anyone else (which I wasn't anyway). Then it was a movie and he was less attractive and had a weird, deep and ugly voice. There was a girl called Ivy who owned a bakery (or something like that) who he was now 'my character'. He also had this silver/metal mark on his face and was a loud, fast talker (salesman-like). There were a few ensemble characters as well. It turned out that this guy was disturbed and a murderer and all the other characters had issues too. Ivy's bakery had actually been in an explosion some time ago, but in her mind it was still flourishing. So she was still working and serving imaginary customers (and the other customers who still believed it was fine), though it was abandoned and covered with dust and there was a broken mirror.
