I got to Seabird somehow, but it was totally different and was actually in the middle of a city near a main road. I went to where our caravan was supposed to be, but it wasn't there. This guy who also used it was there and he said his was now in 'The Mercury'. I went to leave and was standing at the side of the main road, which was two lanes but they were both going towards me. The lane furthest away was busy but the other was empty. I walked out to the middle of the road and then realized it was too busy and went back. Then the guy pointed out The Mercury, which was hotel like and the windows all looked like they had blankets and towels on them. I remembered we had number 12 and I went into the lobby. Then this guy, who was me, had sex with these three girls. Two of them were called Eve and Gwen and Eve was black. He was lying with them.
