I was working at Dill's. I was moving a long board back and forth. Otto was with a girl. She was quite small. I went to a school like, but I was nervous like or shy of people, so I walked by and away. I was spitting up slime. It was so sticky and hard that I was taking pieces out of my mouth and throwing it on the ground. Then I got hold of something like string and I pulled it out. I could feel it coming out down from my throat.
