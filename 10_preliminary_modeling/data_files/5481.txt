I dreamed that a friend of mine gave me 500 dollars and took me shopping. We went into a department store and I picked out a pair of jeans and a pair of pajamas which were really fleecy the dream immediately switched over to my community chorus where one of the members told me that an older member had recently been committed to a nursing home, this is someone who is lively and fun to be with and I said 'oh that's too bad!'
