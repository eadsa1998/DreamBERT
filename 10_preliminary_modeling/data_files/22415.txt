It was a place which looked very much like the school I go to, first in a place where there was a stepladder and stairs going up to the second floor. Everything was painted white (the walls), the stepladder was dirty, and the stairs going to the second floor were painted green, but old and discolored; a door and a window on each side, dirty planks, etc. There was a woman who was trying on dresses. It was like a fashion show, but the place didn't seem appropriate; I observed this. There was a man of about 35 who was talking to a group of boys of about 10 to 17 years. Then it was another place. It was a classroom in school, very similar to the previous setting. In class we were talking to the teacher (I do know her and she teaches me Family Education, she is about 38) and I recognized several classmates. We were talking about dresses, materials and patterns, since we wanted to make them. I described a dress in a white material, with a zipper in the front and  a collar, sleeveless and with colored pockets. I said it was a dress for the beach. The people I recognized were the teacher and 2 or 3 classmates of about 15 or 16 years.
