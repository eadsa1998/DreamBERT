I walk into a public park that has an unusual path that leads into a brick passage which is lit by narrow high up windows - too high to see out of. The path slopes upwards and around in a large spiral. There are a few other people there. There are some girls who are laughing as they walk past the other way. Eventually the path takes me down - down so far I assume we must be deep underground. But eventually the passage opens out and reveals grassy banks - I can see we are high up still, with views across the hills to houses in a rich suburb on the top of a hill. I end up leaving the passage and the park, and head up to the suburb on the hill. I'm trying to find my way home. I bump into one of my clients - Julian - who gives me a lift home.
