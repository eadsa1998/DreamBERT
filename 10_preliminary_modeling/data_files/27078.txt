I was in the basement of the Church of the Covenant where a number of young people were gathered. They were planning to go to the ball game. All the girls seem to have dates except me, and I was hoping that perhaps some one might ask me. I went upstairs and there a boy asked me if this was where he was suppose to meet for the ball game. I said it was &amp; asked him if he was going. He said that he wasn't sure at this time. I don't recall that I knew him, he had red hair - and was a clean cut nice looking fellow. He was reading a book - I asked him what is was about and he told me it was about philosophy. We seemed to stand there talking for quite some time. I kept thinking and hoping that perhaps he would ask me to the game - I don't remember how it ended, but I don't think he ever did ask me.
