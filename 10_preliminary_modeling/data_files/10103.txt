Frank and I are invited to Father Andrew'S HOUSE. Frank gets along fine with Father Andrew. Marissa Camden shows me around the house and I see a portrait of her painted in blues and it reminds me of the Virgin Mary since it kind of shimmers.... Marissa and I are very close and she tells me where she gathered tomatoes "where my tears fell" and they were so sweet. As we are about to leave, I have to crawl through a NARROW slat in the door, while Frank goes out the backdoor; I can't seem to find him and get quite upset; Then we are called back and sit down together: Father Andrew says: "It really was not necessary to get so upset, Emma." "I could not help myself, Father." Then he shakes my hand warmly and kisses me gently, and Marissa kisses me warmly. Frank and I leave together. He insists on walking on a high NARROW ledge; I cannot keep up with him. and when we get home, I get angry at him because he ignores me and concentrates on his work.
