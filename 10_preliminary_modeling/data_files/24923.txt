We were having some sort of Wee Care drive. We were collecting clothes, except people would come by, take off their clothes, throw them in the collection pile, and walk off. That's all I remember. Setting: We were sitting on a counter, but I think it was outside. Characters: The people from my gymnastics class: the teacher, Billy, and the two other girls, Kelly and Leticia. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, cheerful. We've been collecting for Wee Care at school. Nina and I just had gymnastics last night.
