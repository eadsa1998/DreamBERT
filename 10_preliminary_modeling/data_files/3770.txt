I am moving from a many-roomed house. There are back rooms I've not even been in. The moving is becoming more and more disorganized. Now people are picking up things and taking them outside, not even in boxes, and sitting them out there. I don't even have the truck thing set up to take things to the new place. I ask someone, maybe my father, to wait and let's get things organized before it starts raining and ruining everything. Now I am supposed to move to the water world of my lover. I put on the bride dress and then Dovre, my daughter, helps me wrap up good so I'll stay warm and dry in the transition, with many layers of black, warm cloth wrapped around my legs and so on, a stocking hat on my head. I come out and my lover sees me, the king of the water world. He is a bit upset to see me so plain and ugly dressed. He discreetly leaves into a building to wait as Dovre helps me unwrap. I am aware that I am supposedly underwater, yet there are bright-colored flowers on the hillside and I can breathe just fine. I get unwrapped down to the bride dress and I call out to my lover that he can come out and greet me.
