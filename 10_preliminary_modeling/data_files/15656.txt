I was doing an errand for Matthew Inman. I had to go into this shop and write how much he bought one of their comics for. I didn't know so I wrote £1000, then I went back and changed it to £2300, then I found out it was actually £30. Ezra called to ask about some mail which was something to do with first aid from Fruche. I told him to keep it and he said Poppa opened it thinking it was a scam. Mom was watching something on TV. It had Jason Segel in it when he was young and I said that he was quite slim when he was young, then he got chubby, then suddenly got slim again. I was walking on a pier with Kit Harington, but his name was something like Tom Woczyk. The air tasted weird and it started getting stronger. The water looked weird. I choked and passed out. He said that he knew CPR, but he just opened my mouth and blew into it; then he did it properly. We went away from that area and some bottles of Sriarcha had leaked. Two friends walked into a closet and saw something. A lady held them back and they said "I didn't see anything" and she said "you can go". Arnold Schwarzenegger was there and he said to me "You must be Phil" and then I said "... Izzy". We shook hands and swapped something.
