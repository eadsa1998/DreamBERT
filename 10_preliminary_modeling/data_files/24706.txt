I was at school and Jerry decided that he wanted to have a birthday party, so we all walked into a tape recorder (this seemed perfectly normal), and we ate blue cake and brown ice cream sandwiches. They didn't have any taste at all, but somehow, they were all delicious. Setting: In school, and in a tape recorder. Characters: Jerry, Lisa, Devin, Sophie, Sandy. Jerry is weird, but very generous and nice. Lisa is my best friend. Devin is exclusive. Sophie and Sandy are really nice. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, excited. I didn't think anything was weird about having a birthday party in a tape recorder, and I was happy and excited to be celebrating.
