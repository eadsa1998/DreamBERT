I dreamt that I ran out into the street. I heard a fire engine, a sirens. This huge, bright red fire truck came into view and apparently stopped. It was empty in back, it was just like a dumptruck in back. No hoses, no ladders, no Indian tanks, no equipment at all, but there were 3 or 4 men in the back of it. The cab was immense, it was like the truckers' rigs that you see now, like they're carrying a living room with them. One of the men said, "I bet there are no peanuts on the floor in the front." I don't know what he meant but that's what he said. And the rescue unit went by and when it did, by now I was sitting down, and when it went by it rattled whatever I was sitting on so badly that my head got bumped several times.
