Lucy and I are going to be working together and we each write up our schedule. Different instruments will be learned. Room in the morning to go out for a yummy breakfast. Then hard to work. I enjoy looking forward to the work. It is creative. Then it's time for me to sing a song. Jennifer H. gets up to do the accompaniment. I tell her no, I have a new song. A solo. I wrote it. She is upset with me. I stand in front of the people at this cafe. I belt out this beautiful and sweet song. They love it. I'm a hit. Now I'm in a car. We are traveling. My brother Dwight is somewhere. Maybe we are traveling to see him. It's a city street and then a dirt track. Twice we see burnt wood (logs) across the road. What is it with people burning up spare wood. We seem to be near S City.
