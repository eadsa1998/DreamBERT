I was the son of a knight. Suddenly about ten ornamental balls topped with birds fell from the balcony I was on. A woman came and said that because of that accident, my father would lose his knighthood. I was angry. I said, "Woman, I will see that you don't take away his knighthood. I have something to say about that."
