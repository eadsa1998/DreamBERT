I dreamed that I was home for a vacation. I was demanding from my mother that she tell me what a certain $80 was for. I was very puzzled about it and wanted to know its source. I remember then seeing my mother and father grinning at each other and right away I realized that it was they who had given me the money. It took me a while to accept the fact, but I finally did.
