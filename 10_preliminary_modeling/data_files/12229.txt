It was Monday, 10/4/06. Ezra went to school but I didn't. That night, Mom dropped me off at this house where Ezra was. The 'father' was crazy and kept threatening to kill us. We tried to escape over this lake thing, but he was there. We made brownies. I kept calling Mom to pick us up and she finally said ok. Valerie and her kids were there. There was something about Disney. There was something at a beach.
