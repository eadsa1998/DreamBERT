Dreamt about getting some cats.  A gray one I was particularly fond of.  A polydactyly.  It curled up like our cat Nina does on the couch next to me.  Our cats Buster and Nina surprisingly got along with them.  I went to lunch with my classmate Gina.  I had to walk across a board into the middle of a green pond to get the ticket for lunch.  Some sparkly drinks that I mixed.  I asked her how France was.
