I was sitting on a ledge overlooking a part of ocean.  My old obnoxious dorm roommate Chelsea was also on the ledge.  Someone in the water was working with a very small man- about a foot tall.  The idea was that the man would surf, and the little man would 'surf' on the guy's back, I guess.  Their practices were going very well.  Somehow there was a very tanned woman also involved in the stunt.  I made a comment about history.  The woman made some snide remark, and I said she didn't know what she was talking about.  I got in the water and swam over to the man to tell him what I was thinking.  I don't know why I had said history- my concern was that they weren't accounting for inertia and that the little man could easily slide off.  The guy brushed off my concern.  He made some comment about being in love with the woman.  We swam out a little ways to the left, and I realized how unusually warm the water was- like bathwater.  And for some reason, the man kissed me.
