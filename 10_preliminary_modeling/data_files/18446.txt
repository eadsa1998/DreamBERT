Much forgotten, but rest like this: An army unit, of which I am part, has bivouacked in the lower stories of this huge mansion which belongs to a witch. I am trying to investigate the witch and discover whether she is really evil. Some woman has gotten involved with me, and we are in a room necking and petting very heavily, in a tight embrace. I don't recall whether the woman was another guest in the house, unaware of the witch and what was going on, or whether she was an agent of the witches, distracting me. At any rate, embracing her was very sexy and exciting, and we wanted to make love, but I don't think we got around to it. Next thing I  recall I have watched the Oriental servant of the witches drug two soldiers, both of whom are dressed in pajamas and robes. He then unzips a blue curtain off the main hall and pushes them out, so they will stumble back in past the sergeant's desk as if they were AWOL and drunk. They do this, but as the servant is watching them, I jump him and, with the help of soldiers I call for, finally subdue him. His arm breaks in the process and as he is in too much pain to be questioned, I rub some anesthetic liquid on it, but threaten him not to renew the treatment if he doesn't talk. He tells us something (I don't recall what) about how to capture the witch, so a group of us set off. Upstairs someone glimpses the witch climbing some spiral stairs into a tower. The group runs up, but I stay behind because I fear it may be a trap. I lean against the wall in the hall and a secret door opens, but I don't go into the dark passageway alone because I want to watch the stairs. Sure enough, the stairs swivel around so that my men can't get down them.
