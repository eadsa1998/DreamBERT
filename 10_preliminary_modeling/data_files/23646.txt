The whole village is chasing us. It is very bitter. It feels like the same village that I ran through when I was chased with the motorbike. We outrun the villagers and narrowly escape. They are especially angry with a woman traveling with us who has returned to her childhood home. They try to trick her but fail. Then we get to a house. Suddenly someone's mother gets a heart attack. She is a very religious woman and asks to have a Bible put on her chest. She will die at 6:37 and we sit around keeping her last wishes. In the end we begin to sing "Amazing Grace." She is very relaxed about it and feels that it is good like this. It is at a farm. She says: "They say it is like going to another room, and that's where I'm going." We wish her a good trip. Good journey. We are very sad but it is not bad. The moment before she fell into cardiac arrest I said to her daughter: "Be careful now because your mother is going to die." During her last moments she is young. Somewhere in her thirties. We are sitting in a circle. There is a long coffee table. It is a darkish kind of room. Dying is easy when they have faith.
