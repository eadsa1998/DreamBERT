I am at a house at the beach. There is a cute litter of black and white puppies, curly soft fur, like poodles. I pick up a white one and hold him on my lap. I say, "Oh, oh, he's peed on me." Then I look at my hand and see soft, green puppy shit. Ugh. I show it to a man seated on my left. I try to wipe it off. The man puts up his hand to mine and we clasp hands with the puppy shit smooshed up all over both our hands. He smiles. My mother is around somewhere. I say, "Too bad I can't have a puppy at my apartment. But I know I'll take one, only I hesitate, because I'm afraid I'll lose my temper and scream and hit when he makes a mess or is whiny. I don't want to do that ever again and realize this is a way to learn how to do it differently. I decide to go upstairs and look for the stairs. Someone says, "There's this ladder that goes up." I sigh and say, "I can't go up that. Why aren't there stairs where I want to go?" Maybe I'll not go up until I have to, but only, I really want to go up now. So I will do the extra trouble to get there. I go up. Someone has a beautiful bird/butterfly, multi-colored, that flies around my head and sings. She's very pretty. Now I go to the edge of the room and look down, like a counter. The top half of the wall isn't there. I am going to jump down into a box of water. People are laughing; this is just for fun. I have a long skirt and a white long slip on and wonder how I'll make the jump without the skirt flying up and revealing that I don't wear underpants. The girls get in the box and splash around and now the water is all out of it. I scold them and say, "Fill it up again and this time stay out of my water." It is filled up again and I am ready to jump, only I hesitate, because it seems so high up and the water so shallow. Will I get hurt?
