The captain and the two others with us, lost and low on fuel, pulled into a vast swamp. It was a settlement, or used to be. He had known it as a port in years past, but hadn't come back in a long while. The way he came upon it was suspect -- I wasn't sure if he had actually been to this place before, or had simply heard of it, and traveled toward it based on where he guessed we were in the ocean. Or, he had simply ventured away from our stranded location with no destination in mind, and found this place by accident, only recognizing it from lore. Regardless, it was not what anyone wanted or expected. The row of buildings were still standing, but since they were made from wood, they were rotten inside and out. While the shell of wooden slats, almost black from decay, stood in the rough shape of multi-story dwellings, upon closer examination, it appeared that they would crumble if I touched any of them -- like the guts of a dead animal spills out when its tissue-thin carcass is disturbed. I get the feeling that the people who once inhabited this place suffered the same fate as the buildings. We were able to pull the boat, which looked more weathered than before, right up to the squishy bank where the houses stood. I was surprised they were built on land at all. The swamp was thick and impenetrable in every direction. It was closing in. However, there was a dog, like a Chihuahua, running around. I wondered how it got there, and how low on supplies we were -- I was willing to catch and kill it for food. But we let it go. The horse was eating from the foliage around. I was glad it was eating -- it would be difficult to keep it healthy any longer at sea. Hints that a horrible disease killed the people came into my mind.
