I dreamed that I was waiting for a street car on E___ Ave. None was coming so I got discouraged &amp; started to walk. (Some people were with me but I can't identify them). As I was walking down the sidewalk I noticed that I didn't have my black purse. I glanced towards the safety zone &amp; there was my purse. There were no people standing on the zone at the time but some road construction workers were fixing the avenue near the safety zone. One man saw my purse about the same time that I had begun walking back to get it. Immediately he opened it &amp; began taking the things he wanted, including my wallet. The person who was with me made him return all the things that he had taken.
