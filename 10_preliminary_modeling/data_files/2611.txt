I am playing my father's trumpet (no keys), no fingering holes; just use your lips, throat and wind to create notes. I do it very well and impress my parents. They go into a bedroom and make love (my parents). I am in a swimming pool. I go to a far corner in the shallow end and masturbate. It's not much fun or satisfying. I dive into the deep end of the swimming pool and go deep. I am concerned and struggle to the surface. I then go for the shallow end where I'll be safe. The bottom of the shallow end is sandy. A man/creature threatens me. I hit it and it falls unconscious to the bottom. Now I have to rescue it. It will drown like that. I pull it out. Andrea has a male client who is perverted in some way (perhaps sexual). She's being tested with lots of interruptions. She tries hard to be there for him. He even says it's OK to attend to the other things. A group of women come in. One woman (Rebecca?) says of the man, "Oh, I knew you when you were a boy." I see them standing in a circle holding a boy in the Sea of Galilee. They are helping him float.
