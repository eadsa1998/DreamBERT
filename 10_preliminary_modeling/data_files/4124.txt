I am looking down into the water. Deep down there is a huge fish with a wide open mouth coming up to eat me in one bite. I get up and run. I am afraid. I go into a square cement building. One large room. The creature is now a fire breathing dragon. It flames the building. I am being cooked alive. I grab an acetylene torch and fire back. I feel fear.
