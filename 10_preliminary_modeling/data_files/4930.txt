["I am Dad's bridesmaid."] I am involved with some secret spy business where I am trying to steal secrets or get business information. A man on a couch has large dark eyes and is gasping for air. He is having a heart attack. I am trying to get a signature from someone to take over the business. A man is escaping in a car. As he drives down the narrow steep mountain road a white substance appears on the road whenever he uses his brakes. He tries not to use his brakes so he won't be detected, but the road is dangerous, so he must, on the curves. Now my father is getting married and I am the bridesmaid. I wear a pretty long dress. The bride isn't there, but we do the wedding anyway.
