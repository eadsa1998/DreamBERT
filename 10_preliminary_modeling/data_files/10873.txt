I dreamed that I was in a hospital waiting for the bandages to be removed from my father's eyes (he is 65) to see if he would be able to see. I cannot remember actually seeing any details. I just seemed to sense that all this was going on and that my father had bandages on his eyes. (In the same way I seemed to know that he was able to see once the bandages were removed. No one else was in the dream. Before they were removed, I was very, very anxious and afterwards I felt very happy.
