I had been working at my sewing machine. It was in my bedroom at my birth home. I walked away from the sewing machine to find Matthew. I went in to various rooms looking for him. I found four radios and lights that he had left on but he wasn't around. I went out to the porch. There were five or six small children playing with the water hose on the driveway. They were sprinkling each other and had a makeshift water slide. I thought Matthew was with them but when I approached, they dropped the hose and ran away. Matthew wasn't there. There was a pipe protruding from the ground. It had a plastic piece on the end with a kind of screen/filter in it. The diameter was about the size of a quarter. I heard Matthew's voice coming from the pipe. I cupped my hands around the pipe and spoke into it saying, Matthew H, you need to come home right now. I knew he would be embarrassed in front of his friends. I didn't know how else to tell him to come home. I went back inside and lay down on the bed. The radio was on. I felt guilty because there was so much I needed to do. I thought about my prior conversation with Matthew, about how he spends so much time lying around watching TV or playing video games instead of doing other things that he would enjoy more.
