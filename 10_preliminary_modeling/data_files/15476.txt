I was in my room and Mom came in with some muffin things. They were long and rectangular. I ate it and Ezra said they were stronger than his ones and I asked if they were space cakes and she said yes. I said that I had work later and she was like 'so' and I said that I couldn't drive high. She told me to take the bus and I said that wasn't the point. I started to feel hot and my heart started racing fast and I kept shivering. Some time later I was at work. I was there a few hours early, so I had a different job to do. I was cooking in the back area, which was different and bigger and had a second storey. I had to go to the toilet and it was in the middle of the floor. Isaak told me to use the other one on the stairs which had this see-through sheet which you had to lower. I couldn't work out how to go safely so I left. When I came back it had been taken down. I used the middle one instead and I had my period so I put a cup there and then peed.
