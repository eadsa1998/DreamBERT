This was about computer files. Some of the ones I was working with were on my flash drive. I was moving them to my hard drive. There were others that I wanted to delete so I was opening them to see what they were to make sure I wanted to delete or if I needed to save them. Some of them, when I opened them, the text was really messed up. I began trying to clean it up. I realized that it was going to take a long time so I was trying to figure out a much more time efficient way to do that.
