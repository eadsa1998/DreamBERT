Ezra went into this guy's backyard to say a joke to this dog. It got angry and bit my thumb. The owner came out and was like "What are you doing in my yard!". The dog kept chasing us and the guy said he couldn't get it and we had to get out ourselves. I was looking for somewhere to hide. I found a big hole in the fence. I continued running from it. Then I was in a building and I swung from this rope and the dog did too. It started watching ballet. It was then a girl and she had to learn ballet. Then it was Sims 2 and the Sim's hobby was music but she liked ballet. I was trying to explain it to Dad.
