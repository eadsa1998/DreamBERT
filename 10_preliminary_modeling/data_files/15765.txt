There was a movie or video game with zombies that I'd used to somehow accidentally create zombies. I was filming a film using the real zombies as the zombies. There was a small room with shelves of DVDs and food and stuff and we had to get people from both ends to push so they'd come together, but we were having trouble getting it to fall properly. Then a group of zombies were coming near the door, so I tried to close the door but the wood door didn't even fit and close. I shut the other one, but they were already on it. Lots of little baby ones at the door too. We just ran and eventually got to a car. Outside this building there were military people and stuff.
