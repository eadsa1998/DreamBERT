I am at a conference backstage with Mirabelle. She is going out to the front of the stage to give a message or speech. I agree to hold up a printed message for her so the audience can see the points she makes. I walk out following her. Someone whispers, B's standing up. Mary wanders down the aisle and I follow, feeling the strain of standing. I call a girl over and ask her to bring me one of the step ladder stools that had been set up for the presenters. She says Ginny or Karen McDonald had put those out for the speakers. I say, "Well, I'm one of them, so go get one." She does. Meanwhile Mary has picked up a sweet, little dark-haired baby and is holding it up for everyone to see. She's going to massage it. I reach out and touch the baby as Mary walks past me holding it up for everyone to see. I point where I want the stool to be placed, and then someone moves it down a center aisle. I sit on top of the upside down plastic Melmac plate on the stool. It's a bit wobbly. A woman brings me a blanket and whispers she also has a pillow if I need one. It's too warm and I say, "Here, thanks, but I don't need it now. I'll let you know when I do." Someone calls my name. I turn and see a woman in a manual wheelchair, dark short hair. She says, "Hi, seems the same people as last year are here again." I say, "Yeah, but we're trying to make it more consumer-oriented this year." She agrees this is good.
