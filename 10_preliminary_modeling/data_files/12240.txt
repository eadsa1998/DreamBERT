I had a sleepover at Mom's. Evelyn was there. We were going to play a game. The lights were out and a streaker ran past. There was a girl there that I didn't like. We went to this place and she couldn't eat fruit or lettuce because of something that I did to her. We couldn't leave until we made her a drink. There was an axe through the thermos. She was trying to give Evelyn drugs. This game we played had different rules than she was used to.
