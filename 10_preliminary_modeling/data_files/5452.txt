I had a dream that I was back at my high school and someone was painting a portrait of me, so I had to lie on this couch for a long time while I was being drawn. I could see a tiny scorpion walking around on the coffee table adjacent to me and became worried that it would walk up towards me! I was then somewhere with Alondra and was getting married to Channing Tatum. I was confused as to why we were getting married, when Alondra and Andre had been dating for 9 months and weren't even engaged yet. Alondra assured me that this was a good decision. I was wearing a veil and up at the altar. Alondra was behind me, pushing me along. Channing Tatum kissed me, which was fine, but I just didn't understand why I was getting married. Next, he and I were in some really nice boutique. I was picking out different lingerie slips and dresses. I didn't realize they were lingerie until I tried them on and they were completely transparent. I was horrified and ran home, where my dad was purchasing the portrait of me. It wasn't an oil portrait; rather it was some kind of moving lithograph print. My figure comprised of the Benday dots used by Lichtenstein, but I moved within the picture. It was actually one of the coolest things I have "seen." Anyway, then I woke up.
