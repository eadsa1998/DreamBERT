All the students of Cleveland (high school and college) were to have a peace meeting in a stadium outside Cleveland. The procession was led by Dr. Millis and all the major theological leaders of town. We all wore white robes and marched down Euclid Ave. in a formation resembling a large cross. We met at Adelbert Rd. and Euclid at 4 in the morning and were to arrive at he stadium about 12 noon. We had a good time on the way telling jokes and kidding. When we reached the stadium, it was bounded by three churches, Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant. We ate the lunches that we had packed and then we listened to very interesting speeches by prominent theologians and the presidents of the colleges. Afterwards we came back in trucks and slept the rest of the afternoon. Of the speeches the best was given by a young intelligent looking priest. (I am protestant.)
