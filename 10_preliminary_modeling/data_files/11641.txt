I seemed to join up with a man who was starting a revolution. It was just to be a small thing and began in a little village. My friend was older, perhaps 40. We had other male followers also. As the revolution proceeded we became more powerful until we were sweeping the country and world. I was in charge of fueling our vehicles although I only had a few barrels of gas and oil. We had huge stores of war surplus weapons and a few new [illegible]. Our ace in the hole was a huge ape about 30 feet tall and very powerful. As we were transporting him to a new scene of battle his specially built truck went over a cliff and the ape broke loose and became uncontrollable. He chased another friend (a pal in real life, 20, who just now comes into the dream) and me. We began climbing a huge tree. My friend was tired and kept slipping. We finally got to the top but my friend slipped and fell to his apparent death below. I descended and with a few friends performed an operation on the ape and restored him to his former human form. He became our friend. He had been previously turned into this monster by someone we knew nothing of.
