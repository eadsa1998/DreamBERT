I was watching some TV show with Ryan Cartwright dressed up as a girl to work somewhere. I was at home and Mom had put my stuff in a different room. We died and this dead dude chopped off our left hands, but they grew back. There were ships like in the game Navigatris. We could teleport and I was peed off that I was dead. I was at a shop. I was friends with this girl whose little sister called Ashley, had died 8 years ago. She also had a brother. I went with her to a destruction derby with toy cars. Then she died. My brother was this dude called Mike and there was some guy looking for him. Harris (Seriously Weird) was at an assembly. There were cameras in the corner. There was rice in our pool.
