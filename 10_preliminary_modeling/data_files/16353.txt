I was setting up the Peavey system in the back yard because we were going to have some kind of Father's Day party, and I said I was going to test it out. So I played "Pink" and Dad kind of left. And Mom and Dad were sitting on the picnic table, but Dad left because he didn't know _________ for the song that ________ was in, and then while he was gone we thought he just left because he didn't want to be at the party. So we continued with the party. Nobody else came over, but we had kind of a party ourselves, but it was in the middle of the day, and I don't know why I would do a party in the middle of the hottest part of the day outside. And then I dreamt that I was at this like class in this portable classroom, and they were doing this stuff and somebody was telling this story about how, if you were in the military and then you leave, you wear your armor home and then you take it off, and then it jumps under your skin and you can never get ride of it, essentially a symbolistic thing. And that was kind of odd.
