In a boat on Lake Columbus - very choppy water; in a sped boat: very narrowly miss airplanes as they take off from the water; the boat glides into a gas station: remember sitting there and wondering about trip over the water. - Hillary has a new sink: she points out that I too have a new sink: Frank had moved the sink and stove on Thanksgiving Day; I had never noticed it.
