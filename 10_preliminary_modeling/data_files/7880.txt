I was on a teleconference call with Darren and someone from the child support office. She was asking questions about the status of our child support agreement. As usual, I was getting more and more angry with Darren and found myself yelling at him. I was flipping through my file cabinets while I was talking to try to have the exact numbers in front of me when I spoke. I said, you make $56,000. Then I hesitated and changed it to $74,000 a year and still think that $70 a week in child support is adequate. He then told the other person on the phone that he wanted to file a petition for the child support to go directly to Matthew. While I was talking on the phone BJ's family arrived, suitcases in hand, and Matthew was taking them into his bedroom to get settled. I'm not sure why they were here, especially to spend the night. I noticed that Mike A was with them and I couldn't believe it. Then I thought I don't know where I am going to put all these people as other members of my family were going to be arriving as well.
