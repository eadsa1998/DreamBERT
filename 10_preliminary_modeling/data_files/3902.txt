["I don't belong here."] I am directing a play and Burt Lancaster is one of the student actors. Then, somehow I become one of the actors but since I haven't been memorizing lines, I don't do very well, trying to follow the others lines. Some of the lines are spoken in unison. The male director, a good looking man is negative about me and I get angry and say I don't need this. I need to be on my own, learning at my own pace, this school stuff slows me down.
