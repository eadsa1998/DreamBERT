Grilled Cheeses in pita. Hal made a grilled cheese with wood. We were running from the law. I don't know why. We were travelling by car along old country roads and kept on having run-ins with this same cop. We were also running on foot. Running away from a different group of people. Ended up in this weird abandoned hallway with all these empty stalls. There were twins in one of the stalls who tried to help us trick the other group by wearing wigs. They were going to talk and we were going to pounce on the other group and steal their new clothes that they were giving out. Well, I think it ended up being a trick because all the clothes we stole were red. I remember Julia had red shoes and I had a red short dress. We booked off and planned to hide in the woods but saw that a storm was coming. The image of the storm that I remember was amazing - very fast moving swirls in the distance. We decided to build a fire in what was similar to the empty classrooms in Z. City. I said I knew the best room to build one in but it ended up being occupied by the group chasing after us which now included the headmaster of Z. City school. In another good room there was a guy sitting on a couch watching TV. I can't remember anymore. [Hal = friend; Julia = my sister; Z. City = town I lived in overseas]
