A boy and a guy climbed up the wall of this building to break in somewhere. They were good guys but needed to do it. It was day. The cops came and all went around the outside of the fence. One went inside the fence. The guy from before was now Seth Rogen and he pretended to be retarded (the area was known for retards) and watched the cops and then walked off around the corner. I was watching from his point of view and I could feel the adrenaline as he walked away and then when he was out of sight, he ran.
