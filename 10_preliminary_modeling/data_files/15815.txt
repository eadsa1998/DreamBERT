I was part of a unit trying to kill these aliens. I think we were on their planet, but I'm not sure. We were battling outside in a rocky kind of landscape, shooting with these big futuristic looking guns. Some time later I was at this house (it could've been mine, but I'm not sure). There were muffins on the bench. I got a call from Weiss (Alias) asking if there were muffins and I said yes. Some of the stuff he was asking sounded weird and I suspected him of being a bad guy. I started eating a bunch of muffins. They returned and I remember seeing Jack, Vaughn and Weiss. Weiss went straight to the muffins and I went up to Jack and mouthed that Weiss was bad (not sure of exact thing I said). He took me outside and we went down the side of the house, in the shadows (it was night, btw). He said "really, Vaughn?" and I said "no, Weiss!" I explained what I'd heard, but heard noises nearby and they'd come outside. Jack started shouting about the neighbour to cover up our conversation and we walked back to the group. Then I was at at home and Mom and Darren got home at like 3am and the neighbour across the road (who was a fat, 50-ish guy) was mowing the lawn. It was very loud and Darren went over to complain.
