I was watching television in my house in my living room, with three of my friends. The show we were watching ended so we decided to play with my hamster in my room. My mom had fallen asleep on the couch in the living room. We had the back door open. When we were playing with my hamster, we saw a humming bird fly past my window. Then we saw one fly into my room. It started to try to pick at us with his long beak. Each time hetouched us it made a hole. Setting: My house, in the living room and in my room. Characters: My mom, and my three friends Marisa, Sandy and Helen. I have no clue who the hummingbird was. My pet hamster. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was really scared when the hummingbird started to try to poke us. I was also worried about my mom and if she was alright.
