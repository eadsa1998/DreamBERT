I had this fat octopus thing (except it was a jellyfish). I was at home. I had read that I should put it on a hot stove and then onto the fridge. I did and when it was on the fridge, some of its legs fell off and it shivered. I put it on the breakfast bar and then this orange ball of light appeared inside of it. Then this circular light (surrounding it, like a force field thing) came out of it. I dodged it and asked Dad what it was. He didn't know and told me not to touch it. Ezra came home and walked into it and it said "Danger" and that's all that happened. It was some self-defence thing.
