I was in chemistry and it was different. My desk was next to the teacher's desk and there was a glass sliding door. It was then a house. I went back to class after and Ms Hayward's file was open and it had the class list so I read it. It had notes at the bottom. Most of them were about me, such as "Izzy scored 97%", "Izzy was away". There was something about me getting into some 'fast track' course. I decided to take a photo of them all. I heard Mom talking to her in another room and she said that I had taken a photo of the class list and she came to check on me and I left. There was some water outside and I went into it to hide, but it was weird so I got out. I asked Mom if the water was safe. I wasn't wet when I got out. She confronted me later and I was saying I was only looking at my name. I had a score of 700/800. We argued for a while and then she told me to rewrite them all.
