I was driving in a car with a friend and stopped at a big house on a hill. I was not welcomed and the people there started throwing snowballs at us. I turned around and left. I left so fast I almost hit another car. A police officer stopped me. He yelled in my face and treated me like a serious criminal. This continued for some time. I felt like I needed an attorney, although I didn't feel like it was as serious as the police officer made it out to be.
