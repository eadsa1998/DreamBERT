I'm driving down the M City main street. Icy streets. I start to brake gently blocks away, to the turn corner. I'm very careful. I go to a corner restaurant. An older fellow is there named Charlie Charisma. Sometimes he ignores me. I order French toast, omelet, etc., hot chocolate. Dark woods in tables, rich place.
