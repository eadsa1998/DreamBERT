I'm in a small room that has dirt and debris and bugs in it. I see a tiny (Alice in Wonderland) door and, curious, I open it. I see an ugly man there and say, "Uh oh, guess I shouldn't have opened the door." I shut it quickly. I decide I don't want this room to be so bad, so I marshal my forces and change things. (I am aware I'm dreaming) and command the bugs to straighten things up. They march around in lines and I walk carefully so as not to smash any of them. I am repelled by them and grateful to them. They do miraculous work. In fact it is lovely and has opened up into more rooms, including the room the man had been in. I go down a hallway toward the bedrooms. I see video games. Then I see a 3-D video behind glass of real people enacting ordinary human activities. I'm like a voyager watching them. I feel sad that I'm reduced to such a lowly act. I see sexual activity and feel an orgasm. [BL]
