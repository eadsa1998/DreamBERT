Bonnie thinks I would look pretty if I wore some jewelry. She goes in and finds two rings for me to wear, a pearl cluster and the large nay ring (mother of pearl) of Darryl's. I start to put it on the left hand, and change it to the right hand. They look OK. Brian, a young blonde man, follows Bonnie around because he loves her. She doesn't take him seriously. He's far too young. She laughs at him gently. Then he shifts his attentions and loves me. He stands behind me and cuddles me and puts one hand near my crotch. I am shocked a bit and try to get him to move his hand. After awhile, I start to accept that he loves me and start to like it and respond.
