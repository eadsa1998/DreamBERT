I dreamt I was at my friend's house. We were about to go to the Pink Floyd concert. I read my ticket and it said 8:00 pm. We left (well, actually, all of a sudden I was somewhere else). I felt the need to smoke pot, because everyone was tripping. We smoked pot for a while. Then I remember walking through the place where the show was to be held. I remember specifically two doors. One door went into this hallway that was really trippy. There were all types of objects hanging from the ceiling. I really liked it but after I saw this I left the hallway. Then I am not sure of the sequence but I think I looked at my ticket and it said: 12:24 pm. Which is an increment of 4 hours and 24 minutes. Then I walked to the other door in which I saw a bunch of people working on control boards. I knew they were preparing for the show or something so I left. I then remember seeing the other hallway again, but I could not enter. This is all that I recalled.
