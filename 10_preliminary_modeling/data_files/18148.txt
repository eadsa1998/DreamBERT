We went to look at some kittens last night and this is probably the reason. It seems there was a big room which seemed to be a room inside some cheap hotel, but at the same time it seemed to be a display room for a pet shop because lined up along the sides of this were boxes where you were supposed to keep cats in, where they were supposed to live, a cozy little box in which to live in. The advertisement was slanted toward the cats and I don't exactly know how they accomplished this, but it was written in cat language although I could read it. According to their prices, these boxes were outfitted in various ways. For instance each of them had a little heater and air circulator and a little light that worked on the inside and had a little motor. Many of them had additional devices. They had a record of various things that ran continuously. One of them had a record of a mouse squeaking. One had a record of a contented cat purring or washing its face or something so that the cat would feel right at home there. After I looked at these for a while I went into another room for a while I believe and upside down standing on the ceiling somehow some cats and some mice were getting ready to have a boxing contest. They looked like cats and mice from a Tom and Jerry cartoon. There were quite a few real cats sitting down around me watching it. Of course, they were all confident that the cats were going to win. They were very surprised when the cats didn't win. Then as part of this dream, but entirely different in tone from it, came a series of incidents which I can't remember the connecting thread of now. It was a scene in some little eating place. It was some sort of a gangster type mystery in which there were all these little secret signs and things going on.
