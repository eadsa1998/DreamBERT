In this dream I am with two girlfriends who study with me. One of them in real life is very well off. In my dream this friend had gone to school in her car, which was bright blue, and I was there with the other friend. The one who drove didn't do it well, and when I saw that we were going to climb the sidewalk or have an accident, I steered the wheel. So the three of us arrived at a very poor neighborhood. There were extremely poor houses around, and then a train was coming just when the car was on the tracks, but nothing happened. The girl with the car left us there, and the two of us had to go through some very ugly places, and even swim to cross a river. Suddenly I was in a big house with a big gate and with a boy who was flirting with me and many others. But when I realized that he was fresh, I hit him. And there my dream, which seemed rather silly, ended. I didn't understand it.
