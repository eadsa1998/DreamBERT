I am at Bob Fox's house.  I don't remember exactly why-I think it has something to do with picking up some clothes or changing clothes or something.  The house is nothing like his house in New England, more like the one near the university, except much bigger.  I can't find my way around and I stumble into two different rooms which are being rented out, and am very embarrassed about being in someone else's room.  In one of them, the guy is just going to the bathroom to take a bath, and when he goes in, he knocks some kind of electrical fixture into the bathtub, and sparks begin flying everywhere.  I tell him to stay away from it, but instead he gets in the tub to get it out.  I run to try to find Bob, finally finding a wooden staircase that takes me to a downstairs living room.  I call to him as I go down the stairs, and he answers.  I'm not sure he knows it is me.
