 I'm going to a college German class. One of my grade school teachers, Helen Hunter, is the teacher. I'm not in the class, but I am attending today. I walk down a hallway. German classes are in the classrooms on the left side of the hallway, and geology is on the right side. There is food and drinks in the hallway. I talk to another teacher outside the room, and then go in the German room, which is on the right side of the hallway. There is a final exam. My friend Gino Teavor and roommate Stephen Ramos are taking the exam also. During part of the oral exam Gino comes up to me and asks me to sign something to support him. I quickly agree to do so. Gino knows all the test material really well. That is why he can walk around during the exam. [Note: I saw a photo of Helen Hunter the day before this dream. Prior to that I hadn't seen her face of consciously thought of her for 5 years.]
