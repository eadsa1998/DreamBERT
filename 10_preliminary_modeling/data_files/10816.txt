I dreamt I went swimming in an indoor pool with several girls in my sorority. They had a special movie to see at some eye doctor's office. I went up to get dressed with one of the girls. We didn't care to see the movie, somehow we had to go outdoors to get to the dressing room, but we were already dressed. This required crossing a street. The traffic was terrible. Then we had to climb a fire escape. I hate fire escapes. Halfway up I got cold feet and came down again. It wasn't worth climbing.
