This dream was long and complicated. It starts at 'home' which in the dream is a cluttered, open-plan rather long house. It seems european and modern, and features a lot of warn-in timber. There are large patio doors that lead out to a decking area. I'm at home alone, I've just got up, and I'm wearing a dressing gown. A girl from my distant past arrives unexpectedly. This girl is an amalgamation of 2 or 3 people including old girlfriends from the past. I find the situation awkward, not being dressed properly, and I try to secure my dressing gown more tightly as it is coming loose . My guest finds this amusing, and makes it more uncomfortable for me by flirting. She seems to have an agenda for being there. In another part of the dream, the girl has gone, and I'm watching tv on the internet with my brother and possibly a friend. We are watching some apparently recently discovered footage of the Sex Pistols (a punk band). Next we watch a very disturbing short film about some rats that live in a network of burrows, with a central underground chamber that contains hundreds or thousands of them. The camera follows a line of rats along a narrow tunnel and films them dropping into the chamber from above. Following these rats (interspersed between them) are some sort of bugs - like cockroaches, which are stinging or biting the backsides of the rats. The rats are swelling up where they have been bitten.
