I am in some huge parking lot and I am riding a freestyle bike. This bike is made for tricks and I know I am really good at riding it. There are people watching me, but not obviously. It is like I know people are paying attention to me, but they are not just sitting there staring. They are off in the distance watching me because there is nothing else going on anywhere. Basically I am just having a good time and I am showing off a little bit. I feel like I know that I am really talented at this and that the people watching are probably impressed. At least that is what I am thinking. I do not  really know if anyone is paying attention at all. All I really know is that I am happy and having fun.
