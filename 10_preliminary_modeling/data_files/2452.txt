I am outdoors and there is a fireplace with a fire going in it. I realize that my play scripts are in there, and I am frantic to get them out. I try to move the screen but it is locked. Peter B has the key, but he won't give it to me; he just doesn't care. I explain how important it is, but he's not impressed. I'm upset with myself that I put these valuable scripts in a potentially dangerous place. Finally Peter opens the screen and I beat out the flames. There is some damage, but essentially they are OK. Then Peter starts to kiss me. I am surprised. He's so young and good-looking. He undoes my blouse and I wait, aware that I've decided to make love to him. He lays me down and is kissing me when I open my eyes and see a woman on a ski-boat, upside down in the sky, hanging on by only a finger or two. She's having fun "hot dogging" and I am amazed and concerned she'll fall and hurt herself. I say, "Peter, look!" He's not interested. Now there are lots of students up there doing the same thing. Peter said this happens all the time. He takes my hand and pulls me up, we walk across the grass to a building and go in. It's like a radio station. I see a man in a glassed in booth. We go into a room where they store equipment. Peter introduces me to an employee there so he'll know it's OK I'm there. It's clear that Peter is looking for a place for us to make love. The employee is surprised. We locate a room and save it for later. We go out to the lawn area which is now filled with students rocking out to music. A party. I laugh and say to Peter, "There's no people here, even you and me. No people."
