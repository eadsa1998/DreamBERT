I was at the Santa Rosa resort (where I spend my vacations) and we were in front of the beach in a very high place that looked like a cliff. I was with my father and mother and all my brothers and sisters. I wanted to go and swim, but my father didn't want me to. There was a transverse wave that was going to become very strong in the spot where I was going to swim. Suddenly I looked at the hill which we call Santa Rosa Refuge from the front, and we were already at the beach. From there one could see a white cloud and an avalanche of very white snow was coming down. I almost started to run, but I thought it would be better to die with my whole family. We all huddled together and the snow came on top of us. It ended.
