I dreamt that Dovre was drowning in a raging body of water. I'm standing on the road/bridge next to her. I am looking down at her. There's rain and storm all around us, raging. I know I must dive in and save her but I'm afraid to because to do so will be my certain death. I walk on, leaving her to drown, feeling sick about it.
