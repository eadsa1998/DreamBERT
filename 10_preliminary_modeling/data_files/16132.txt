I had a dream about Halloween. I dreamt that we had just been to the Cracker Barrel and that Mom and Dad bought three mechanical things. One was a black dinosaur that walked and shook its head, kind of like a Disney mechanical thing. Another was this laughing witch that was this doll thing. And other was a skull, a plastic skull that did things. And I dreamt that I was setting things up, and the kids from down the street were helping me. And before I knew it, they had four tables around me that like boxed me in, like a sound booth person would downtown. And I don't know, there was really no point to that one.
