I had a dream last night that I was at work and a man came in and wanted a sandwich. (I work at a deli.) He asked for a hamburg sub, like the one at DeAngelo's. We don't sell those. I found a little bit of hamburger anyway. So I then started to cook it in the microwave. We usually only cook pastrami in the microwave. I put pastrami in with the hamburg. The weird thing was that when everything was still cold and before I put it in the microwave the cheese that I put on it was melted already. Then I asked the guy, who looked like he was part of the Hell's Angels, if he liked the cheese melted and he wanted to know why it was melted before I cooked it. Then he asked me how much hamburg I put in. I showed him the little bit I had put in. (We put things in a dish when we cook in microwave.) Then he said that I should charge him less. I told him I put pastrami in it also so it would be the same price. Then he got upset. I was nervous when getting everything ready and I took out a hot dog roll to put the sandwich in but he said he wanted a sub roll. Then another customer wanted something at the lottery so I went over to take care of that person. There were all these people at the counter. My cousin, who does not work there, was behind the counter and I could not squeeze by him because he was too fat. Then I started panicking and getting real nervous. Then I woke up.
