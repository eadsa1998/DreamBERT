I am in a long room with a row of windows. I hear a noise and look out the window. A huge wave is rushing down the street. I slam the shutters to the window closed and the wave smacks up, getting us wet. This happens 2 or 3 more times. We'd hear the hissing sound and then the wave would smash on the window. Between waves I (without a body) go over to see the streets. I notice high water and see the red glowing lights from the nuclear reactor that went out, but is still hot. I hear a wave coming and rush back inside. Dylan and I run downstairs to better safety. We find a room with beds in it like a dormitory. I lay on top of him and we cling to each other. At first it is out of fear, but then a sexual feeling starts to build. He apologizes and I say, "No, it's o.k." I ask him if he's feeling bad for his wife. He looks sad and gently pushes me away. He suggests we just sit together.
