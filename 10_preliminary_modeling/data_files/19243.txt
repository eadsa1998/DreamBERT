I was at my apartment building but it was on the beach on the Pacific Ocean. My brother, dad, and I went to the shore and had a picnic. There was a lot of green foam washing up on our food. My dad went for a swim and my brother and I stayed on share to talk to an old man. The man told us a story about the lions that lived on the beach. The lions ate humans. Then everyone on the beach was running and screaming because the lions were running behind them. My brother ran into the building but I didn't make it on time so I pulled out my building key and got in the first door before the lions could get me.
