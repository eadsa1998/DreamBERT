Ezra was still in school -- at Koondoola, but it was different and like a boarding school. Mom and I went there and there was an underground carpark. There was a guy putting white square stickers on cars, like parking tickets. We went in and the rooms were all scattered. Ezra's was in a room with around 6 other beds -- 2 of them were bunks and he was in one of the lower ones. They had lots of chocolate and stuff. They were rocky road with nuts and they tasted cheap. I had to get permission to leave. There was a walkway outside and each side had a bench. Some people were playing 'soccer' and you had to throw the ball under the bench. People kept trying to catch them. I was playing as well and a guy on our team could stop time so we were doing well. Then it was the olden days and there was a 'race'. They wouldn't let Ezra in for some reason but he could come in at 11 if he got permission. There were timers with big numbers on them. I asked "This is the 20s right?" and said they looked the same. There was a big Jesus statue underneath the city of Bangkok. Then I went to a school and my room had photos from Comic-Con there. I paused the TV and it was a scene with Mal (Firefly). There was a guy with makeup on his face and someone said he looked "paler than normal". Everyone looked tired. It made me think of SG (?).
