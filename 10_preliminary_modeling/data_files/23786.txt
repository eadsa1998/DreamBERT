Something about strands of dark curly long hair.  It looked almost wet.  It was like those locks of corkscrew curls that Robert P said he liked.  He told me once his former girlfriend had immediately gone out and got that type of perm, just for him, after he told her he liked that type of hair.  The dream was like I was going to get a perm and have dark curly long hair, or I was looking at it, admiring it, imagining it on me.
