I was staying away somewhere, like in these cabins but we weren't supposed to go out after dark or something and keep our doors locked. I think there was something dangerous going on, but I'm not sure. There were 4 girls (including myself) and 4 guys. One of them was kind of hot and we kept catching each other's eye. We flirted for a bit and then ended up having sex, but it was a little bit rapey. We kept having sex though. I posted a vague post on the forum that I'd had sex with someone but shouldn't have and the posts were all 'helpful advice' type of posts, but saying like 'if it's consensual sex then it's ok', and they hadn't really gotten the gist that it was only partly consensual. Benjamin posted my FilmForum activity and like 'how can you fit anything else in when you're working 44 hours a week and watching this many films' but it was only like 1 film a week. Something happened and someone else and I were outside somewhere (during the day), not sure what was going on, and there was a pond thing with passports in it. I joked that we were actually dead and these are our passports. They were our passports and she freaked out like 'how did you know' and I said it was a guess 'you know how many movies I've seen, this happens all the time'. Everyone had then forgotten their memory (except for me), but no-one really knew and we all bundled into this room and sat at this long table - girls on one side, guys on the other. I still found myself attracted to the guy from before and I caught him staring at me again. I wondered if he'd still be the same as before.
