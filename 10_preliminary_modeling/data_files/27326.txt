I dreamed I was in the room of an old house which over looked a wide river. The river was very high almost to the edge of the wide windows facing the water. I went out of the house and got into a boat and sailed back and forth in front of the wide windows. Suddenly there was thunder and rain. The house melted away. The woman who owned the house--(the mother of one of my friends) drove her car to the river's edge and I got in. There was another clap of thunder and I awoke.
