I dreamt that my boyfriend and I went to the house of a girlfriend who lives nearby. We started to plan what we were going to do that day, and two of my friends (girls) could not go to the concert because they had to go look at clothes. I told them that they should forget about such frivolities and try to become more cultured. We all laughed and went out, some to the concert and they to the store. Then I dreamt that my sister had gone to the concert (which in reality had happened, but I had not gone) with me and that we met a lot of friends of ours and that after the concert we went to a coffee shop to drink some coffee. By pure coincidence, my father came in to buy cigars and he stayed there talking to us.
