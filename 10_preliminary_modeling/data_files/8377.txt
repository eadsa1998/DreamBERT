I was with some of my family, Bev and BJ for sure. There were others but I don't know who. We were in a gift store that sold religious and spiritual items. We were standing there talking and Bev made the comment that she had just recently made her first P E Circle. I thought to myself, P E Circle? What is that? At first I hesitated to say anything because I feel that they expect me to know a lot about spiritual life. I finally decided to go ahead and ask in such a way that maybe they would think I was just interested in knowing more about her experience or that I just didn't understand what she said. Bev looked at me and kind of laughed and in a critical tone of voice said, you don't know what a PE Circle is? It had something to do with something vocal and yet there were four things and maybe there were two options of groups of four things. I say things because I have no idea what these things were. Somehow these things impacted the vocal quality of whatever this was. I had chosen between these two groups of four. I had chosen the four that gave the lesser quality. This sounds extremely weird but it almost seems as though they were chairs. I had decided to paint the backs of these chairs black. But they looked like, I can't even visualize the whole chair just something that looks like the back of a straight back chair or the kind of chair that we have in our training room at work except that they had a pattern with little holes all over it. There was something about spraying them black.
