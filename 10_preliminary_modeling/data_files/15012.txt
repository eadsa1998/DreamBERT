I was at a shop and this guy was wearing a black Alliance shirt. I was holding my blue one. I left with Mom. I was driving. I was still in the carpark and there was lots of stuff in the way to the exit. I had to drive in an exact position but I kept missing it. Mom complained but I got out finally. I was driving at 60km/h. The lights were green but they turned to red suddenly and I went through and I noticed there was a camera there. There were police with guns and there were people all over the road. I can't read the rest.
