False labor: I give birth by myself, but then have to go to lab, which kitchen. I give birth to the placenta by squatting; same sensation of breathing and pushing as in real birth. Blood on the floor; I see the placenta; "Has the pediatrician seen the baby?" someone asks. "Yes" I'm not concerned about baby, but then start to nurse on porch.
