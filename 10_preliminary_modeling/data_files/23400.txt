Me, my boyfriend, and old roommate Bob were eating in a Mexican restaurant, which was openly connected to a birthing center. Ted and Bob went and sat outside and I walked over to speak with a woman who was standing on stage with a guitar. Don't remember what was said. She then started singing and playing her guitar and I began to do stretches. The woman and I were discussing when I was due. I was still early in the pregnancy.
