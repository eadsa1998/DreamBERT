 I'm with, or am going to meet, my friend Bubba Hacker, who has a new phone number and a new residence. I meet my dad near Bob's Sports Arena in Wilmerton. He has taken a long time: he walked there. I was hoping my dad would get there sooner so I could get in touch with Bubba. There is a basketball game going on at the arena. It seems to be a B-squad game. I have a game that night against Nimen High School. There is a game tomorrow night too against Rival High School. My dad gives me two stamped envelopes with letters in them, addressed to me. I mail them to my house for me. I'm with a man and two women. I have just gotten out of the shower and I choose to put on boxers shorts. My towel falls off a little bit.
