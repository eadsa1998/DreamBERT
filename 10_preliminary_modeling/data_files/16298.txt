Mom was telling me about all the kinky things that people do to each other, like sometimes people throw darts at each other [laugh], and I don't know, just other crazy stuff. They take empty bottles and they pour beer all over each other and they throw beer caps at each other. And I don't know why, but I had the notion that people actually liked that. [laugh] That is far-fetched, man. And she was telling me about all these things because she was wanting to know if I had actually gone that crazy yet. [laugh] And I told her, "No way, Jose." And then I think there was more, but I think I just faded into consciousness after that.
