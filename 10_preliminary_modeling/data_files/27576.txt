I don't know where I was but I had picked up a "Holiday" magazine and had accidentally opened it well toward the back. There was a colored picture on that page. I decided to look through the magazine but wanted to begin at the page where the first colored picture appeared. I thought it would be just 4 or 5 pages back so I began leafing through the pages going toward the front of the book. However, the colored pictures never seemed to stop and I got all the way to the front cover without coming across a single black and white page. I thought it was so strange. Most of the pictures were landscapes and nature studies. The coloring was simply beautiful in all of them. One of them I remember pictured a young girl in a yellow dress lying in the grass on a hill top looking up at the puffy white clouds rolling by. I was sorry when I woke up because I wanted to see more of the pictures.
