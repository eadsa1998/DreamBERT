I am in the passenger side of the van. Dwight and maybe Ginny are with me. We go from gas station to gas station, looking for something to put air in the tires and a bathroom, but we don't find either. I look ahead and see a tiny board across a ditch and Ginny intends too drive over it to go on. I say, "Can't you see? This won't work. Absolutely, this van will not fit on that. It's too small. This absolutely won't work." Ginny seems intent on doing it anyway, so I get out and measure the width of the tires by my hands and say, "Look at this, and the back tires, it will not fit, absolutely." Ginny doesn't say a word, but simply pushes the car with Dwight's help over the board which barely fits. They get across. I feel a bit embarrassed but say, "Well, if you push it slowly, then it works, but not if you had driven it!" Now I'm in the back seat with lots of other people and I'm seated on a man's lap. I say, "...and you should have seen the Pope in that silly dress sitting on the lap of the secret service." I realize that there might be Catholics in the van and wonder if I've embarrassed myself by being bigoted. I see a man sitting alone in the passenger side up front and feel envy. I want to sit alone where it is not so crowded. Now we are in a church and someone, an older woman, is looking at the seating chart and directing where various groups (plays, or their actors, really) will sit. She seems pleased there are no big problems. Even the Pope is behaving himself and not embarrassing us.
