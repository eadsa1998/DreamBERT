I am in a residential area skateboarding down a narrow sidewalk. The energy to propel the board is obtained by clenching my toes or pushing down hard. There are many houses, which are big and made of wood. The people are friendly. I am a guest, renting a room. A block away a tree catches fire. A fierce wind whips the fire out of control. At one point the entire sky is whitened by heat and flame and it appears the house, which contains my belongings, will ignite. No one panics. I rush into the house to recover my back pack. I am confused. Which room is mine? My things have been moved. I find them in another room. It is large and half open to the elements. On the way out I watch a good-looking middle-aged woman undress. It is very erotic. Outside, things are calm. I meet a young man who is a veterinarian. He has a dog, which has sustained burns to its back. The dog appears aware of its injury but remains feisty. Somewhat humorously I say to the doctor, "So, you have casualties." I cannot recall his exact words but he is optimistic. The dream ends here.
