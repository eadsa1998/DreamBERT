["Shifting rooms and short circuit electronics."] I am asleep in a single bed. I wake up but I am tired. I see somehow a cup of water had been knocked over and water is pouring out over the black electronic boxes on the table. I get up, still tired and annoyed. I try to clean it up. Paulina and Caroline are there. We are talking. Now I want to move to another room. I go down a hall. My father and Uncle Willis are walking ahead of me. As they enter a bedroom, my father quickly pulls his pants down. I figured he was changing clothes, so I turn into a bathroom to take a pee. People keep wandering in and out, mostly relatives.
