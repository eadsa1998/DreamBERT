Bill C had asked me to come to the office. The reception area was laid out differently than in waking life. The door was where the filing cabinets are in waking life. As I walked in Jennifer C was standing at her desk. Everything was covered with something that looked like white sheets. She turned to me and must have noticed the look on my face. She explained that she had decided to start doing this every evening before she leaves work. She said it as though she thought it was a brilliant idea. I thought it looked very odd but wondered why she didn't do that while I was still there. Bill C came out to greet me and then told me I could follow him back to his office. As we walked, he said I would get to see his office now. They had made some major changes in the floor plan of the office suite. His office was now much larger and he had a conference table in it. As I sat down he was walking to another part of his office to get something. He said he had asked me to come in because he was going to be interviewing someone and he wanted me to sit in on the interview and give him my opinion afterwards.
