My father and I have a mountain "luety" (can't decipher my own handwriting in book) of mined-out gold in it and I must learn physics to get it out. I go to a bar where the class is held and I'm very annoyed because he's going slow for the others and I have lots to learn quickly and haven't time to waste. I learn much quicker than they do. (manr? man?) (see book)
