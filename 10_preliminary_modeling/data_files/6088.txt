I dreamed with this Irish guy that worked with me long time ago. He was surrounded with beautiful girls, while I'm at the corner eating my ice cream. He was making me so jealous that . . . suddenly the door opens and everybody comes in for a party. But there were no drinks and only nachos at the table . . . I was embarrassed somehow and I just wanted to leave. I don't know why. I woke up then.
