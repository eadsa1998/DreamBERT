["Mom's diaper."] My mother is driving a car and a man and I are trying to get her diaper on her. I am having trouble with getting the sticky tape in the right place. I hold the right sides of the diaper together at her waist and the man is trying to get the tape on it. We try several times with no luck. Then I notice we are taping the tape at one end on the diaper and then the other end to the outside of the car door. This won't work, I think, because she will want to get out of the car eventually. Then I see the front of the diaper isn't forward enough to protect, so I pull on the front. I see blood from her period on it but am happy I could successfully get it positioned correctly.
