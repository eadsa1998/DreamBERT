We are at a resort and I see my friend Ginger (M.'s wife) who is pregnant, swimming waist deep in the water; She gives birth to a very big baby and carries the new born up the hill to our resort hotel; I am worried that she will hemorrhage and tell her to take care of herself during the post-partum period. I follow her, carrying a PURPLE CABBAGE and a cauliflower in each hand, sort of balancing them. shift: inside the house, many people; notice that G.'s baby is already walking! He is very precocious and a man says: "We must watch him very carefully and anticipate his needs." We are again at the party, and Frank tries to plug in a light fixture, but it does not go on; he says it is burnt out. I go over and see that he has plugged in the wrong cord. I plug in the right one and say " DUMMKOPF" (dummy) to him but with a smile, "See how practical I am!"
