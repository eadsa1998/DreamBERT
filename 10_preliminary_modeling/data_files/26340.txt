 I fly into Australia, and the plane lands. I drive by my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, who is working. I stop for groceries, and spend a lot of money. I get brown sugar, eggs, toilet paper, and Kleenexes for my stay. The bill is about $20. I pull out my wallet. The man takes what I think is a $20, but it may be a $50 bill. He tricks me, and owes me money. He tells me to go look at ____ (maybe clothes racks or clothes trees). I go over to them. They are young fruit trees in my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard with only a few buds on them.
