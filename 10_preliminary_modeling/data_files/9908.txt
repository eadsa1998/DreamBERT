With Brenda Hichman driving out to a lake: we swim in a canal of orange-brown water: amazingly clear. Meet Stan (her husband). He also swims. I wait a while for Frank but can't meet him. At home we have jerbils. I see the little ones separated from their mother. I take them and put them on the tiny nipple which they grab avidly. For two of them I have to find a nipple. Go to a lot of trouble to set up food and water for them.
