I was on a steamer and couldn't find the way to the dining room. At first some one was with me, then I was alone. I went down two decks to sailors. I was told only way further was by a poor ladder so was directed astern. I went back up and again down and was again crew's quarters. I asked if I couldn't get to the kitchen without going up again and did so, passing women washing pile of soiled clothes, colored, a child's bib marked with his name. Passing through the gallery at least I see the dining room though a curtained doorway but when I get inside the counters are almost clear. I ask if I'm too late. "Yes." And the waiter begins to cover up leftovers. Two or three times I repeat, "But I lost my way, can't I have something? Begin to cry." The head steward leans over and speaks softly to the waiter. I think he's telling him to feed me.
