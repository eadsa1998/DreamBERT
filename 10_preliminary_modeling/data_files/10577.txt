With KEVIN and his wife Mabel - he has gray hair (sprayed on?): He leaves to see his "other wife"? Mabel starts to fix up her house, but windows are open, painting unfinished; ironing board left standing. I say: "How can your children learn to be orderly, if you yourself don't put things away?" Then I take the ironing board and set upright; "See it's easy."
