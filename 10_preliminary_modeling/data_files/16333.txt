My birthday. I had a kind of a strange dream last night. I dreamt that I was in the summer transition program for Wilcox Center and it was more like being at _______. Me and three other students were in this room and there was this big, huge synthesizer mixer board. It looks like a huge version of my Tascan (?) board, but it was this guy that was the instructor and he was showing us about how, he was showing us with an organ p____ sound and he wanted to change it, but he couldn't get any ______. And so when this other guy came in with another student, he asked the student to show him. And you had to mix automation and change it. Then I dreamt that we were in the car with Bonnie and Josie and Bobby and they were all kind of, you know how they're all kind of complainers. Well, for some reason Josie gave me a thing of milk and said, "Here, take this so we won't have to wrap it." And they took us home and then we were home and then I woke up.
