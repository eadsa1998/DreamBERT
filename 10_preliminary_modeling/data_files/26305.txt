 I'm at a store, which later seems to be Country Store. I buy some things, and ask a man working there if they carry a lightweight blaze orange facemask. There are large tables of blaze orange hats, and red hats and gloves. I ask for a lightweight mask because I think that the thick kind that I borrowed would cost $20, which is more than I want to spend. The man goes to look for me. I don't think he finds it. I pay for my items at the register. The register takes a long time to ring up everything I have. I have some cash, my Prime Option MasterCard, and some lottery tickets. The bill is $16, and I pay with cash and lottery tickets. I also pay $6 for six more lottery tickets, and turn in a winning ticket for two more tickets, so I get eight more tickets, some of which are silver. I leave. I scratch off the tickets, but don't understand how to play or what designates a winning ticket. There are three columns on the ticket with words in each column, and a title for each column. I don't understand how to play.
