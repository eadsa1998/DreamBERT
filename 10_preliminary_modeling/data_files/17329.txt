Dreamt something of a store.  I had a peach pink car.  One of the seats lifted up to be a trashcan.  On the side was a compartment that looked like a pie fridge.  We drove around in a sort of empty dunes.  Dewey from "Malcolm in the Middle" appeared, and told us the wood furniture was in the back.  On the way back we passed pits of death.  The sky was black and empty, the ground was dirt, the furniture was leather, and there was blood around.
