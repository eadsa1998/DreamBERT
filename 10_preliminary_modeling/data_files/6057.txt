In this dream, my mother was in the hospital. She had gotten sick and she was put in the hospital for emergency surgery. What I remember most about the dream is that I was feeling so helpless. I remember feeling like I wanted to just drag her out of the bed and take her home. The whole entire dream just involved me sitting in her darkened room with her after her surgery. I remember that I could not stop crying.
