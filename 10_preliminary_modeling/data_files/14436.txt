I think I had an apartment. There was a dodgy dude. I can't remember, but I recorded this small video of me and this girl talking. From it, I discovered she was having an affair. Later, I went back and the video had been altered. The dodgy dude had a coat and he was following me. I ran. I ran into some toilets, and there were lots of cubicles. I hid in the corner with a knife. He came in ages later and looked in every cubicle and then saw me in the corner. Then it went all black. This happened again and I was with someone, a girl I think. I hid. Someone said someone was coming. There was a small window in the toilet. I heard someone say "Basil" who was a big blonde dude. I decided to run. All these people were crowded around (there weren't that many). It was at university. There was an upstairs parking lot. I 'wished' for my car and when I turned around, it was there. I couldn't drive it very well and kept driving all over the curbs and I was going over the speed limit. I didn't know how to get out of the carpark. I went down the stairs and there was a McDonald's queue. There was a new ramp and I went back to leave.
