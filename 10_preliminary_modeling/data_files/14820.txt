I was at the old house on my computer. I got a text from Eugene and I was like 'Oh my God, Eugene!'. It said some random stuff and I realized it was spam. Ezra called me to show me something then I went to some place and they had a quiz (it was online first). The online quiz was 'what vehicle driver are you'. One question had pictures of B.A, Face and Westland (all from The A-Team). I got race car driver. I was then there and thought it was real so I went in but it was like Timezone and there were games. One was a skating rink. I was then back at the old place. Ezra's room was mine. It was cloudy and rainy outside. Dad came and I wanted to go back home but I couldn't take my computer out in the weather. I had a photo on Facebook of me naked but it was from WeightView and wasn't as freakishly [something I can't read, but it looks like 'finshy', but I don't know what it's supposed to say]. Ando, Hiro (both from Heroes) and I left this place and some bad guys chased us. This guy was fast with blades. I was trying to teleport and I grabbed his phone and this paper with [something I can't read again, looks like 'addnys']. I touched him and nothing happened and it was because the weather was dodgy. This other guy was there too and he sat down in the corner (which was outside but the corridor was also outside the building). The bad guy sat in front of me and he decided to try to kill us and he started going crazy with the blades and I protected against it with this sword/knife. I accidentally stabbed him and then did it a few more times on purpose. I think it says we both got a 'fail' percentage on the exam. He was 16. He said something about bleeding to death in 20 seconds, but he would take 2 minutes. I went into the toilet to not watch out of respect.
