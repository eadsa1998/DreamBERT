[1997-06-25] I was sitting at work and I reached down to see if Sammy was okay and I couldn't find her. I looked on the floor under my desk, I looked to the side, reaching around to see if I could touch her, I couldn't find her and I started to call her, "Sammy! Sammy! Where are you I can't find you!" And she didn't come back. My heart started beating real fast. I couldn't find her and the person who was supposed to be helping me with my driving, said "Sammy's around, don't worry about her." But I couldn't find her anywhere and so I started to go up and down the halls, thought it might be smart to take my white cane with me in case I happen to come across any obstacles. I was walking up and down the hall and no one had seen her. Then somebody told me that someone had scared her and she had run down the stairs and the front door was open and she had run out, so I ran down 3 flights of stairs from my office and out the front door and I was calling her and I couldn't find her and I was screaming for people to help me look for her and nobody was helping and everybody told me that she'd come back and the day went by and I was panicked and Sammy wasn't there and I finally woke up and I couldn't find Sammy and I started to scream for her and I guess I woke her up too and she touched me as if to indicate "why had I done that?"
