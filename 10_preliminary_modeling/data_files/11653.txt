This dream took place in a war surplus goods shop, one very much like the shop downtown. I was in the shop and had just won a contest which I thought entitled me to anything in the place. I went from counter to counter and picked out what I wanted, socks, gloves, etc. I remember very clearly that I picked out an army flying jacket. I had wanted a good leather jacket but they didn't have any. I had piled up a pretty large amount of merchandise and was about to leave when the clerk came over and told me that my prize amounted to only five dollars toward any purchase. I put most of the merchandise back where I had gotten it. At this point the dream ended.
