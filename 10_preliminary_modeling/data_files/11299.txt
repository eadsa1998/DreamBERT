A United States Army medical unit was in action on some sort of a level sandy battlefield. I was a member of the outfit and was tending to wounded men. I remember vividly the red and white crosses on the arms and helmets of the other medics and the redness of the blood of the wounded. It seemed that the outfit to which we were attached was being beaten and enemy (vague, formless shapes) was advancing. I remember seeing the figure of the commanding officer (a man whom I then recognized but cannot now remember) gave the news that we were beaten and could not retreat. I remember the feeling of terror and fear and the desire to run away battling within me with the desire to fulfill my duty.
