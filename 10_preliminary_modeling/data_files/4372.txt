["Not doing a good job."] I am at a committee meeting at a long table. I listen to the talk. The meeting dismisses and I am glad. I shake my head and say what a waste of time, all that talk and no action. Now we are going on a tour to see how things are going. I am in some building. I am talking with a woman who runs the committee. I am showing her the outfits and dresses I have been given to wear in the diplomatic parts of the job. She says they are out of date. I've had them for years. I explain some of them were given me by the original leaders of the committee. Antiques. I see a family pose of the king of this country which is like India. He is a very short man. He has left his wife for his girlfriend, and then she left him. I see the two of them walking. Dark sleek hair, traditional Indian dress. I am amazed how short they both are. The woman who runs the committee comes over to me. I am holding the Indian dress I might wear. She is disappointed in me. I am only doing minimal work. I am not helping the committee, but just riding along. She wants me to do a better job. I feel defensive. I thought I did an OK job.
