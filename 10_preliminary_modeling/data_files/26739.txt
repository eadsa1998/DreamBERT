 I walk into an apartment-like building as if I'm staying at a hostel. I walk upstairs to my room, which is at the top of a staircase that turns frequently and seems to get narrower as it climbs higher. I enter my room, number two, and see that it overlooks the center of a city, several stories up. I look into an adjacent room to see what's there. I unexpectedly disturb a woman that is sleeping. She then gets up. She has short blond hair. She talks to a man named Andre who also lives in our place. I know this is the Andre whom I know from the University of Wellington. I realize I'm moved in with Andre and Megan. I go into a different room where I awaken my flat mate Bittie Marton, who is napping. She rolls over, and I see she is wearing a lot of makeup, like she is going out. I notice the bright red lipstick she's wearing. I leave after asking her if I interrupted a REM period, which I did. I have a positive feeling of being in a new place that I find mildly pleasing, and have some old comforts. I'm happy to be living with Andre and Megan.
