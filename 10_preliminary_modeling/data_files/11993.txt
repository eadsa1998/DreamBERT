I was at school on the computers. It had Sims 2 on it. There was group of boys and they kept annoying Ramona, some girls and I. The teacher guy told us about this gay project we had to do, I only remember one part and we had to 'draw' ourselves, as babies. So I used Sims 2 bodyshop. I think later on in the dream we were running away from the boys and we got ice-creams, but I didn't get one.
