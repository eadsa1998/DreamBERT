Me and some school friends had a circus in my room but it was like real, because there was a huge swing that went round and round in my room. It was so high and scary. The people who came had these inventions in the back of their cars, but we never got to see them. Setting: It took place right in my room. Characters: Yes, I know them. Anna and Olive, two girls from school. A guy who's older but I play b-ball with him and some other people I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad, scared. I was happy because it was a circus. I was scared because I thought the swing would hit the wall. I don't know why I was sad.
