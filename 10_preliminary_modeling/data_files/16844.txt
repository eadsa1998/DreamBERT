In this dream I'm a part-time tutor on Jasper's art course, which in the dream has its premises in a large cluttered building. Jasper is stressed out and either about to be sacked or about to walk out. The office has huge high vaulted ceilings and a mezzanine floor. People come looking round, as if they were flat hunters or house buyers. Back at 'home' I find and release several small creatures around the house - I can't remember what they are - possibly sea creatures like crabs or small hybrids between mice and insects or oysters. The cats snap them up, which was not the plan. I return to the college building with a painting which I'm proud of, but everyone is distracted by a ritual taking place - something weird like 'marketing day' or something.
