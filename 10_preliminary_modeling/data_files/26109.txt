 I'm near College Liquor in Woodland. It's night. The store has closed early: before 10:00pm. It must be a Friday night. There is a cooler outside the store with neon signs that flickers on. Two younger men are rummaging through the cooler. They find an empty 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew and a cake. I think they're dumb for rummaging through the cooler. I walk home to the Whitman house. I cough up phlegm and blood. I cough really hard. I'm sick. I walk through the inside of a gas station on the west side of Brighton Avenue and go out the other side of it. There is a cute woman with short dark brown hair working at the counter. I walk outside the station. A man from Brimson crosses my path.
