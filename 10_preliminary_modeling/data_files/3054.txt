I write a play or story and then I experiment with a machine. I am in a small room. Some people come by and take the machine and are looking it over and exclaiming about how I've managed to improve it. I choose to hide beside a young woman in a wheelchair. I look up at her, asking her not to expose me. I say, "I won't let them hurt you." She hides me. I like being there to eavesdrop on their compliments. Then I rush away and they chase me. I go into the room just beside the one I was in originally and slam the door and try to hold it locked. They pound on the door. They start to come over the transom and I shoot them with my laser beam gun. It slows them down.
