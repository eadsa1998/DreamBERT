After four participants, he announced an extra speaker, but we, R, Jas. and I decided to leave since we wanted to be back before 9 and it was already 8:40. Two on the stage and some children also left. One child walked out very noisily. R. went to the rear but I by a door at the side of the stage. I noticed something had been left on our seat and concluded it must be my raincoat.
