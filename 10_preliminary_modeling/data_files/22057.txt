I dreamt that a bunch of birds were flying in the sky. And over the sea there was a boat in which several boys were playing with the water. Suddenly a fisherman jumped into the sea, shouting, "Help! my son has fallen in and he is drowning!" I and other onlookers went to help him, but nobody wanted to jump into the ocean for fear of the rough sea and the big waves. I awoke then.
