 I'm on a couch at home with Madonna and my friend Niles Zelling watching television. My feet and legs are resting on Madonna, and my head is resting on Niles. I am grabbing Ben's breast, which is larger, like a woman's breast. Dennis Rodman is on television. He is naked. His penis is more than a foot long, and it is limp. Madonna talks about Dennis Rodman's penis. Niles leaves. Madonna and I start to get it on. She is masturbating. I give her cunnilingus, and rub her clitoris with my finger. We kiss. We are clothed, and then are naked. She is going to perform fellatio on me, but I give her cunnilingus again instead. My sister Ramona, who was gone with my mom, comes into the room. She has a sheet of paper with a lot of caricatures on it. There are some sketches of her and of I. Madonna and I leave to get privacy. I say to Madonna that we can go to my room, and that she can stay the night. We are on the stairway. She says we can go to her house, which is 30 minutes away. We decide to go. I grab my jacket and my dream journal. My family knows I am going to Madonna's house for the night. It's winter outside. I go out the door. There is a limousine. I am headed for the back seat, when the driver gets out and tells me to drive. I say okay, and get in. I am sitting on a seat, and there is a bucket seat between the steering wheel and I. The limo driver gives me directions. I turn around near the Roman's house on Home Avenue, and go north on Home Avenue, past my house. My mom is on the side of the road. I slow down, but when I hear her saying that she doesn't think it's a good idea that I go, I speed away. My sister Ramona is venturing out in the street in front of me waving her arms. She doesn't think it's a good idea for me to go, either. I speed up and she has to dodge the limousine to avoid being hit. <br/
