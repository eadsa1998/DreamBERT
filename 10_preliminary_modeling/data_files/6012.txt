I am asked to serve on an advisory commission in Washington, D. C. and be made an Honorary Member of Congress as part of some government program. I am flattered by the honor and I accept. Someone tells me that there is an orientation meeting for my group at 9 a.m., but I miss it. I arrive at the Capitol Building, and I can't find anything. I am standing in a large hallway made entirely of marble when I recognize other people in my program walking about, seeming to know where they are going. I ask several of them for directions, and they answer with the names of departments that I have never heard of. "How was the meeting this morning?", I ask another. "Oh, it was funny", he answers, "They did a show. But you didn't miss anything important." I am still lost, but I get a copy of a map that says "Federal Triangle" on the cover. Inside is the layout of many of federal office buildings with each individual office marked. "Wow, this is a useful map!", I think to myself. Then it is time to make plans for the evening. I say, "Should I stay here or go home?" X. (a friend of mine on Long Island, originally from England), who is standing next to me, says, "Well, I went home from here, but you'll have to fly if you want to get back in time in the morning." "You flew back to Long Island?", I ask him. "No", he answers, "I flew back to LONDON." I decide to stay in a hotel in Washington.
