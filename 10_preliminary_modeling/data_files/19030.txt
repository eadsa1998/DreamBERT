The setting is a classroom and there's a class underway. It seems to be my dream class and we're reading from a textbook. However, we seem to be reading backwards from a certain chapter towards the front, and we stopped on page 41 when I was awakened. The teacher was making certain remarks to the effect that "You'll have to read this chapter." It has become vague. The class is a small group about the size of my regular class. Someone is dressed up real Jim dandy sort of with a light blue jacket and ascot and rolled up umbrella, just plays the role of a real sharpie. He seems to be looked down upon by the other classmates.
