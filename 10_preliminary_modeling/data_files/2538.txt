I am going to direct student actors doing a couple of pages of MacBeth. I recruit a black man and Warf. We find an empty classroom and I tell Warf to leap up to the black man's chest and push off with his feet, a spectacularly dramatic fight scene. As they are rehearsing, a professor comes to the door and is quite belligerent about us leaving. I walk right up to his face and argue eloquently about our right to be there. He is angry but goes away. Now it is opening night. I'm in a manual chair and have to pull myself up eight steps to get to the stage door. I go on stage to announce the piece. The mike is too high. I launch into a very moving speech describing each obstacle I had to deal with to get this piece on stage. The audience is far away and off to the right, but they are moved by my difficulties as I describe them. I tell them there was only one classroom accessible enough for rehearsal, then the professor discriminating against us. "He got in my face, well, actually, I got into his too." Everyone chuckled. I described how I had to pull myself and my chair hand over hand up the stairs and then the mike was set for a standing person. "Naturally you would do that because all your experience is your own able-bodied self, so how could you know what it's like to be in a chair? But dare to expand, take the challenge and enjoy our differences. Celebrate our diversity. Don't be afraid of it." They gave me a standing ovation. I was quite pleased.
