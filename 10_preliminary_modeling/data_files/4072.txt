["Burt's Manly Organ"]  Burt Lancaster works in the Old Queen's palace. He is peeking out a door into the hall to see the Old Queen. She sees him peeking and is annoyed. He goes into another room and gets the young beautiful red haired woman drunk and seduces her. A narrating voice points out that Burt has the biggest and best "manly organ" there is. He is a swashbuckling guy that can't be entirely trusted.
