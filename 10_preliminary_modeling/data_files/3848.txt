["Behind the scenes."] I am at a rehearsal but I am only an helper. It is an unusual position for me. The director is upset that the person in charge of maintenance isn't doing his job right and there is no toilet paper in the john. Also there is stuff left in the wrong places. Sparky is around somewhere. I have a notebook, maybe the scene lines, so I can help actors rehearse. I tell myself to try to stay in the background and not foist off my loud attention getting personality onto other people.
