I was in a movie house getting ready to leave the place. Just as I was about to leave, I heard a shot come from the men's lavatory. Immediately after the shot, I saw a well-built man of about 25 years leave the room hurriedly. Well, most of the crowd went after the men, and I and two other unidentifiable men went into the men's room to see what damage the shot did. When we got in there, we found a small baby (about 1 year) lying on the floor and bleeding profusely. We tried to do what we could to stop the bleeding; however, the baby died. We left the room to call the police, and just as we came out of the room we saw a crowd of men bringing back the man who fired the shot. Right after this I woke up.
