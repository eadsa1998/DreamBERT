We were at this party, and we were dancing and eating and stuff, and they even played one or two polkas and I did the polka a couple times. And Dad went to the bathroom and Mom said, "Do you think we should stay here a little while longer?" And I said, "Yeah, it's really fun here." And then she looked out the window, and said, "We'd better go. There's a big, black cloud of thunder," and it was raining out there. So we started out, and all of a sudden we were crossing the courtyard at school and these big claps of thunder were coming closer and closer, and I was like, I fell and then I was like crawling, and I got inside the building and there were like tons of people in there. But then I realized there were puddles of water all over and I didn't feel safer in there either. And before I knew it, Mom was having me go to the bathroom to change out of my bathing suit and Dad was supposed to be getting the bike to take us home. I never did, I never did get home. I woke up first. I had a bunch of other little dreams, but they're so fragmented, I don't remember them.
