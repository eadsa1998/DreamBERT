I am in some bar or cantina-like place, and it is crowded and loud. Music and people talking, like any bar. Outside of this place is a huge oval racetrack and thousands of spectators watching a stock car race. New races are beginning about every fifteen minutes and they are calling the names of people in the bar. The loudspeaker seems to only be calling names of people in the bar because after each name another person is patted on the back and heads out to the track. Pretty soon my name is called and everyone seems to know who I am even though I don't know them. I am not really surprised that my name is called, but I am excited to race as if I was not going to get the chance. They wish me luck and I walk out toward the race track. I do not remember actually racing, but I know that I did. I remember that I did not win first place, but that I had driven a good race. I wasn't too upset that I did not win (although I think I could in the future) because most of the other drivers were professionals. After the race I go back to the bar and the people in the bar are all stoked about my race and someone buys me a shot of something. I am just bantering with some people and my name is called again to go and race. I am happy to go again and I walk back toward the racetrack. This race is also a blur and I only remember coming back to the bar afterwards. Within five minutes my name is called to race once more. People are a little bit pissed off because they want to race and for some reason I keep getting chosen. I go race and when I come back, everyone at the bar is congratulating me for the good racing and they do not seem angry at all. For some reason I have the idea that the crowd was voting or choosing who they wanted to see race and they apparently thought I was a good driver or whatever.
