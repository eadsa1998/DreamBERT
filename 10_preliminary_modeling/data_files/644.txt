I am with an older woman friend near my hometown and we are in a restroom. The Governor is there fixing his hair. I recognize him and ask if he is the governor. He says yes, but he is referring to his wife as Nancy which is not her right name, and he says they just took a little trip to get away. He asks how I knew him. My friend and I are on our way home and the light on the car goes out. She panics and gets up and stands facing backward. I tell her it is okay. She knows this road. Just slow down and soon her eyes will adjust and she'll be able to see.
