I was with Ben D but I don't know where we were. He was telling me that he had gotten an attractive job offer in the city where I live and was planning to move here. Actually, he didn't say planning to; he said he was going to move here. My immediate reaction was just that I didn't know how I felt about that. There was part of me that was excited that I would have the opportunity to see him more. Because he implied that one of the reasons he was accepting the offer was the opportunity to spend more time with me. There was part of me that wasn't excited at all actually more fearful let's say, because of my own feelings about relationships of this type. I was concerned that he may want more from me in terms of my time, or even commitment that I feel prepared to give.
