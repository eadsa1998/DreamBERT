 I'm in a boat with my friend's father Franco Ramos and a man my age. Franco and I are fishing. We're trolling along with landing nets in the water, with the net handle attached to the boat. We catch trout and salmon like this. When the net bends back that means you've got a fish, so you jerk the net like one would set the hook and pull the net and the fish in. We catch many fish, some of which are big! We pull one in every few seconds, as fast as we can. I think Franco catches a walleye, and then I see it is a salmon. He lets the other man fish. The boat starts to veer off course. I turn the throttle down and keep it on course. The fish have dark eyes. Something happens to a stringer we are using. We come up to a 94-foot long semi truck trailer. The stringer is being attached to it. I am under the trailer by the middle wheels. Someone is by the back wheels too. I'm scared and nervous. I feel like I'm strapped to the bottom of the trailer. I feel the weight of the trailer on my back and legs as the driver hooks it up. We are hooking up another trailer, weighing 150 tons. I'm really anxious. I see the semi truck back up and the trailer creaks because of its immense weight and pressure. I get hooked up. I squeeze out of where I am and go around the back of the trailer where the driver is. There is a Greyhound bus there. People on the bus come out dressed in winter clothes like they are cold. The driver tells me he wants me to keep riding under the trailer. There is a set of wheels that he drops down a notch; they are closer to the ground now, almost touching. This will give me more room. He tells me I have to learn how to drive the bus that he is driving and that I'm under. He is in a bad mood: sick and tired of driving. I tell him no problem, if he'll teach I'll drive. I realize when I say this that I legally probably shouldn't' be driving a bus full of people. If anything happens, he'll be liable.
