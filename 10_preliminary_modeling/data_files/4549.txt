["Questing heart song."] I am in a classroom. The assignment is to write a song about the historical King John and his epic struggles. I am older than all the kids, as I am an adult. But I decide I'll try it too. They are all busy writing and indeed have started the project days ago. I play with it. I write something about William travels and I scratch out William's name and put in John. Then I write a bridge refrain about the questing heart as he falls in love with a beautiful maiden. It is very beautiful and moving. I sort of have a tune, but I really focus most on the words. It is time to present the songs. I don't feel ready as I am hurriedly pulling something together. It is coming along but will be only a rough draft at this point.
