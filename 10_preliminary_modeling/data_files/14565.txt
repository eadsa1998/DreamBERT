I was at a Dylan Moran thing. The place was small and the seats were lame (there weren't many, not layered and squished). He was on the side in a room, which was like where the people sit outside of a recording booth. He did music stuff sometimes. He was doing one now and all these people came up on the stage, including Eminem, Alejandro and other celebrities. People left for a break and I got up and sat on a seat in the middle. Audriana came and sat next to me and was talking to me. She said "Life is really hard right now. I'm doing George Clooney and Alejandro,". I said "What?!" in shock. She giggled and said they would say "silly things" to her and then she paused and said "You're kind of retarded", I said "not really". I presumed she said this because she was just joking, but I get the feeling she was telling the truth. Poppers wanted to steal from some company and blame it on Uncle Vic. Mom made me keep an eye on him while I was at University. She had a big file full of important files and timetables. My timetable for this trimester was in there and Ezra started at the Technical College this week too. I had nothing on Tuesday and Monday went from 9.30-11.30 and was 'science'. We were then in the car and we drove into a shop, which was half outside (like there were bits of roof missing, sort of market-like). We didn't know how to drive out. I was with Mom, Ezra and Dad. We had to walk up these stairs. We had cakes from Nana and Poppa and we were supposed to give them back, but we had forgotten so gave them back now. We were allowed to take some for ourselves, so I took some and ate a couple.
