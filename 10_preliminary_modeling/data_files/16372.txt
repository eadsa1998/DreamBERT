Well, it's not really goofy, but still.... I dreamt that I was back in Westport High School again, and I was there like on an extra day, an extra day like after school had ended or something. And I was at this luncheon with the Spanish Honor Society people. Can't remember what I was doing with them, but I was just having lunch, I think going to MacDonalds or something. Then I came back to the school and was helping out with the awards ceremony, and then we were out in the bus lane waiting for this city charter bus to come and pick us up and take us all home, kind of like when we were at the Wilcox Center waiting for our cabs. So we were all at this bus lane, this girl named Astrid was showing me her award and telling me about various things, and then the city bus comes and I get right in front for some reason, and it's going to take us all home just like a school bus would, except it's not. All of a sudden the cell phone rings and it's Mom and Dad wanting to know why it's 4:00 o'clock and we're not home yet, and I told them all the things I've been doing and it's impolite to make a call on the cell phone during the assembly. And so, of course, that didn't go over too well. So I got home and sitting at the dining table and Dad's asking me to explain why I didn't call sooner and all. And I'm sitting there and I'm at this placemat thing that ______ for papers and we ran out of them, sitting there typing with my fingers as though there were a keyboard there, but there wasn't, just a placemat. I'm sitting there typing away, but there's like nothing [laugh]. That was dumb. And Dad comes over and he's like, "I'm sorry, I can't read that draft." And so then I get the drift, and I start writing it all down. And before I can finish, I woke up.
