I went to Mom's. There were zombies. We decided to leave. I was putting my shoes on and told Mom to wait. She started going down the stairs and I asked if I could get my keys and she said yeah. I told her to wait again, but she opened the front door. When I went back to my room it was open to a balcony and there were two zombies. I bashed one of them, but the other wouldn't go down. Then I woke up.
