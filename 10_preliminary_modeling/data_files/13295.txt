Calvin and I went to some movie awards thing. First it was Dad and I, then Calvin, then a time traveling guy. He 'time traveled' with his clothes but couldn't bring anything else. When I first met him I wondered why he had no luggage. There was a guy and a girl behind the counter at the movie place and they were mean. They gave me a sheet to fill out stuff about the movies. Some teacher lady gave Samantha a tablet, so I asked for one.
