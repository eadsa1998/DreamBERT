I'm with two or three other people on the shoreline of a large lake or the ocean. We're here to fish. I climb up on a tall platform. I'm looking out to the horizon. It grows dark. I see something far away in the water. I shout to the others "Listen up! Listen up!" but my voice is not loud. I feel an ominous presence. I'm fearful. I wake up.
