Karl S. is wearing a funny outfit with capital letters spelling something in English (I never do find out). I have adopted a small Negro baby and we play with him. I keep asking him about a possible meeting. He is evasive. He tells me of his various plans; we talk music. I grope for subjects that might interest him. We talk of crossword puzzles and Frank comes up and tells us that there is a gas station that gives away crossword puzzles every time you buy gas! We are both surprised and we thank Frank. He smiles and says "That is interesting." He stands by the window as he is about to leave and I try to make conversation about yet another computer: "That was quite tragic about MAHLER," but I don't remember whether Mahler died young or not. I feel embarrassed. Then I try to "lure" him with a "friend," a pretty woman like ELSA SUTTER who says she wants very much to meet him because she had heard him conduct last summer! (a ruse) Finally I pick up the baby and say good-bye -- the baby is quite heavy; Karl leans forward and kisses the baby on the cheek and then gives me a peck on the cheek. We shake hands and say good-bye.
