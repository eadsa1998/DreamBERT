I was at "Nana's" and werewolves were around. I broke into a car to get my keys then I broke into my house. Then we were at Nana's and I was watching a werewolf movie. One of the werewolves looked like Bill Moseley and in the credits it said it was played by Staffy who, in the dream, was Bill Moseley. I went to bed and all the lights were turned off. An evil alien came. I was in Nana's bed and the aliens tongue was through the door and I can't remember.
