Sitting at my desk, I ask her if the bell has rung. She says yes, so I start down to breakfast but no one was walking in and a girl was clearing up in the dining room. Breakfast was over. I go to ask Miss M. for something to eat but she hurries off. Will see me later. A Chinese girl invites me to her room. I go in and she tells me she has been here only four days. A young man comes bringing a large package. I tell her I'm hungry. Must find Miss M. and get something to eat. Will visit her another time. I go in search of Miss M. thinking when she called me, if she did, she didn't notice I failed to answer.
