I was in a rainy city. I was inside a high building floor. There were some strange people there. Antagonists. They tried to jab me with a needle full of something to make me pass out so they could I don't know what. The makeup of the group was two ugly girls and their chubby gay cohorts. They jabbed me with the needle as I was resting in one of the rooms. I threw them away and I ran. I didn't know what they were trying to do that for or why. I fought my way passed them and felt the drugs beginning to take effect. I made it outside, like a rainy section of old part of the town where I work, with everything gray and the streets more isolated, with grassy planters and bridges and road archways. I got away.
