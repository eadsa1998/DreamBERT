I woke up with my tooth loose in my mouth. I ran my tongue over my teeth, but couldn't work out where it had come from. I looked in the mirror and half of my bottom teeth were missing -- on the right side, I had a back tooth and the first non-molar, and on the left side I had random gaps. I couldn't feel any difference with my tongue though. I went to Mom and was telling her and I broke down, crying. She hugged me and seemed visibly distressed for me.
