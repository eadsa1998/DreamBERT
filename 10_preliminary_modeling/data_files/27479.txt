I was in a shoe store. There were some empty seats, but I did not sit down. Instead, I walked near the rear of the store and waited for someone, the manager or a salesman to notice me. There were 4 seats, similar to the ones for giving shoe shines--There were 2 facing each way (in other words, they were back to back). There were 2 boys sitting in the 2 raised chairs facing me. I did not know the boy farthest from me. The closer one (approximate age 25), I recognized as a boy with whom I'd double dated several times. Then as I was about to say hello to him he stood up and his face changed. I recognized him as another fellow I know (approximate age 20) who had been badly burned in a fire about 5 weeks ago. I knew his face had been burned. When I remembered this fact, I noticed that his face changed. The hairline changed too and I noticed that near the face, the hair was thin and short. I thought that this was because it probably had been burned away and was just starting to grow back. I called his name and he smiled at me.
