Brown's party: leaving to pick up my shoes and mittens; find Zena's lost mittens. Also find some screws for electrical gadgets. I see Dave Brown standing barefooted: he looks down at me, and it happens I lick his foot a bit, it tastes salty; I remember how JESUS washed the disciples' feet and how ugly a task it must have been.
