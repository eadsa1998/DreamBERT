I was standing in line in a type of cafeteria. I was with a girl who seemed to be a combination of a girl who I like very much and another who I have seen at school but do not know but I do not like her (sentiment based only on appearance). She bought something and went into the next room which seemed to be the expected procedure. After some difficulty I ordered some pie and doughnuts and paid for a check which I was to use to obtain the food from the food counter. Instead they gave me the pie there and kept the check. When I passed the doughnuts I took two of them. When the waitress asked for my check the other explained that it was ok and I went to sit down.
