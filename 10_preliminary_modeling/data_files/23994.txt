I dreamed that I was on a raft in the middle of a big body of water. No one was around and I don't know how I got there. I was just there. Little bits of water splashed onto the raft, making me wet and cold. The wind was blowing and out of nowhere pots and pans started to float around my raft. I could hear them clang against each other. When I woke up, it was raining outside and the house was about 39 degrees. Also outside I heard a tin pan being blown around on the deck.
