Some guy gets me a 3 day job editing TV news. I'm very excited. This is a great honor. He gave me a book with a note written in it. The note was in Spanish. He asked if I needed help. I said no, even though I was unsure. I start to work. The guy is always around. He is romantically interested in me. We float to the Antarctica on Icebergs that melt as we go. We barely make it before they melt away. We rescue equipment and light a kerosene lamp to warm us up. We landed at a camp where shelter is already dug. We go in. It is necessary to throw out a small black and yellow bird that had traveled with us. I protest, " It will freeze." They'd throw him out and he'd fly back in. Once he landed on my hand, quite flat and exhausted. I felt sorry for him. They let him stay. My daughter drives too fast and I yell at her to slow down. She does. I tell her she is grounded for 24 hours because if I hadn't made her slow down, her passenger would have been squashed, nothing but her eyes bugging out, up in a corner. Then I'm told that people who are job partners have to sleep together -- all in one room. I am shocked.
