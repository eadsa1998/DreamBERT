I went into the bathroom at home. I had had a bath earlier and there was still water in it. My gloves were on the edge. One fell in and I got it out and was wringing it, but the water never seemed to stop coming out of it. I was going to Bali alone. Nana and Poppa suggested a hotel for me. It was cheap and just across the road from the airport, but was supposed to be really good.
