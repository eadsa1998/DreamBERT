I looked at a house number. It was 34010. A man was looking for it. I looked at it twice. A tennis ball rolled down the hill. I picked it up and threw it to a boy who missed it. I ran from my car down the street backwards. I saw two Brinks guards, one with a pistol, another with a rifle run on top of a hill and shoot once. The rifle man said it was a tight squeeze for the bullet to go thru the rifle barrel. Cecila and Bob came over to me and she was dressed nice. She tried to get my attention, then she did. I said, "Oh, hello." I was lying on the bed looking out the window.
