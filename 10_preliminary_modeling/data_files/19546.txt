Scene laid on X Ave., in X City in my homem state. Being hungry I am walking along looking for a store where a snack, or piece of candy, can be purchased. Several (about 3) small boys (7 or 8 years old) are following me. Most of the buildings are dark, but some distance down street is the fire house, dimly lighted, which may carry candy bars. When I reach this place, I can see through the window several firemen sitting at their ease in rocking chairs, reading; and on one side of room is a wooden stand on which are displayed various articles for sale -- the only one I can now remember being cans of tobacco. There seems to be no candy, so I do not enter. On way back I remember that Beth lives on this street, and I walk toward her house, thinking I might see her. Presently I meet her but she acts very shy and not disposed to stop and talk.
