Looking back in time: I see myself at age 18 years; on a ski slope--wearing a red sweater--and band--I take my own picture...I explain to Frank how I skied down a slope--walking along the edge of the sea--it is icy and very slippery. I am carrying Zena. She is very heavy. It is a big struggle: I call for Frank's help but he walks ahead and I manage by myself. Then I swim, and talk to Frank about eating in a restaurant with Frank; "Today is our Tuesday, you know," and he finally agrees.
