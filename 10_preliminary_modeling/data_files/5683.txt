[1997-06-30] I dreamed I was visiting a young couple, Carl and Brandy, they were just married in May so they're still young honeymooners and while I was visiting there they proceeded to have their first argument. I could tell they were beginning an argument so I decided to leave for a while and give them the privacy that I thought they should have to take care of whatever was troubling them but I fully intended to return later on because I had been invited to dinner and I was going to come back and eat dinner. I don't know how I stay so small with all the eating I do in my dreams.
