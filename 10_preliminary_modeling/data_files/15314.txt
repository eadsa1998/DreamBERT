Rover was jumping around being hyper. Ezra was on his knees and Rover scratched his back quite deeply and drew blood. Mom said 'everyone over 18 in 2 years can come to [somewhere] with me' and then said 'I meant just Darren'. Later I was waiting to get on the train with Dad and Ezra. A girl got our tickets, but forgot mine and we had to do something to get it. Then we were on the train. Ezra started to cry. He took his shirt off and showed Dad the scratches.
