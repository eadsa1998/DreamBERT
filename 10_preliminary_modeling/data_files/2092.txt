I am seated and look down at my toes. They are black. A toenail all black and blue had fallen off into my hand. I am disgusted by this. I turn to Hasani and say, "What do you suppose this means?" I say, "It looks like it represents that a part of me is dying." Hasani says, "I don't think any part of you is dying." She felt very positive about what it might symbolize.
