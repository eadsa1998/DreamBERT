I am sitting on a small back porch up a flight of stairs. From my place, I can safely watch the bull riding events. One Brahma bull is mad as hell and his hair knot on his back stands straight up. He's running through the crowd and nearly getting people. Now a bull rider is on him and a cowboy on a horse. I trying to rope him. I am amazed that two events are being done simultaneously. Now the bull rider, a very charming, good-looking man, is walking toward the house. He is talking with his pal. I watch as he almost decides to go up my back stairs, then turns and goes back around to the front door. I am going to make a pudding and ask my father to bring me a mixer. Now another good-looking cowboy comes up my back stairs. He is Rod Taylor. He stops to flirt and chat. He talks about his pain and I tell him I have RA. We talk happily, obviously flirting and liking each other. He asks me if I always stay up here, and I say mostly. I'm not stupid. If I was down in the crowd, I could get hurt and not see so well. He is mixing up some pain relief balm that smells good. We are very attracted to each other, a promising love affair.
