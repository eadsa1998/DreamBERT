I was talking to someone about the SDI program. The interns have to have a spiritual director while they are in the internship and they also must have at least one directee during the last year of their program. I was saying that I no longer see the directee that I had during my last year in the program. For each new group they would match up each intern with someone that had completed the previous internship. That person would be their spiritual director during their internship. I realized that this system worked out very well because they always had the same number of people in each internship - allowing for just enough directors for the interns. They wouldn't do this in waking life because it wouldn't be appropriate to dictate whom someone sees as a spiritual director and it wouldn't necessarily allow for the best match.
