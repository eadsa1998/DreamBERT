I remember a dream where I was in a Victorian blue satin ball gown, trying to seduce an older man with white hair, who was resisting my advances. We were at a party of some kind and there were a lot of people flirting with each other. I remember the man and I were dancing together. Then we stopped. I attempted to verbally seduce him. He counterargued against my advances and stubbornly refused to give in. He looked rather like a brief flirtation I had at the Ren. Faire years ago. He wore a pale poet shirt and dark slacks. That's it.
