We went to some old friend of ours' place. They had dark skin and a son my age. We had been friends when we were younger and he had liked me (at first he was white, and he was really hot). Suddenly we were somewhere and he was touching me. Then Ezra, Mom and I woke up in a field somewhere and this bloke was running to be King (it was the olden days). I was speaking English and he was like "You shouldn't be speaking English!" and I said "I don't know any other languages!". There was a map of the country there and it was wrong so I drew over it. Then I was at a place with some people and they had TV shows there (including Roswell) and also had Goosebumps books. They also had some other show I used to watch. I commented that I liked Goosebumps books. Then Ezra, Mom and I were doing some exercise thing in a forest place. We had to do it non-stop but we weren't. I had missed calls. Three of them were from some L-plate thing. One was from a guy saying I was scary on the road. Someone else said that my driving sucked.
