I am at some information booth and a woman is selling her wares. It is some new age group that sounds very good and intriguing and yet I have some doubts. Maybe they are a cult that starts invading your privacy and thoughts. I look at the children's books, a special device and some other things. I keep asking questions. I decide to buy some of the items to look at them in detail later. Now They show me an apartment I could rent, in Dover. It is a small one bedroom, with two double beds like in a motel room. A man and I are interested, but again, still unsure and hesitant. I ask the fat landlady what the rent would be she says it depends, ____ on down to 500 dollars. This sounds high to me, and the place isn't all that good a shape. but now she shows us it has a living room, a dining room and several more bedrooms. It is looking more like a good deal. The bed in the back bedroom is a narrow cot like thing. I test it and it turns out to be a flimsy hammock cloth. I ask if it is a hammock. She says no, that's not the bed. The bed would be brought in later and we'd have to sign a paper saying they removed the critters. It was some kind of an insurance scam. I don't feel good about it. She then hands me a brochure on the cheap computer they offer for sale. $13.95 and it does recipes and appointments and so on. I saw some strange contrivance in the bedroom that looked like a bathroom scale taped to a woodstove chimney that was that device. I look out the back windows to check out the neighborhood. Odd looking people, fat like a cow (and looked at first like he had an udder) and so on. We're not sure this is going to be good, but we are still interesting in finding out more.
