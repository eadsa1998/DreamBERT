I was riding on a big ship with some older ladies. I felt like they were people I knew, but I wasn't really sure who they were. And we were going someplace. I had a feeling that they didn't like to fly, so we were traveling by boat instead of by air. And I was inviting them to come and see me at home sometime. And they said, "Oh no, I couldn't really do that because my car would need to be washed," or something goofy like that. And then the next scene was that I was in the back yard and we had a pet goat. And we had six or seven baby chicks. It was a pretty nice dream. I dreamt that I had four yellow chicks. There were two that were kind of golden, like they'd grow up to be Golden Comets. And there was one with dark feathers, and I wasn't sure if it was a Rhode Island Red or a black chicken. But I was worried that the goat would eat them, and I was doing all kinds of things to try and keep them apart. I was out behind the garage in the alley and trying to feed the goat grass, and then the goat laid down and I laid down and I was kind of picking up handfuls of grass and dropping it over where the goat's head was. And I realized the goat was asleep. And then next thing I knew, the goat was laying down inside the fence by the back gate, and the chickies were walking and climbing over him, and I was trying to move them and get them away from him real fast. But then I noticed he was just laying there as they were climbing over him, and I realized that goats don't eat meat, that goats are herbivores, I think. And then I woke up.
