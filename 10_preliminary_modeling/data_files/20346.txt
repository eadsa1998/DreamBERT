I was helping to paint columns in a building. They were about 20 feet high and 60 inches in circumference. On the ladder a patient named Williams was painting the top of a column. (This is a colored patient who has been sexually attracted to me. He has acted like a masculine lover wanting me to be his "girl," but I have only felt annoyed at him; and I pity him, because he is illiterate.)
