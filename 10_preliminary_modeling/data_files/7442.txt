I have to get up to go to the bathroom (again?) for a drink of water. The dream bathroom is exactly the same as my real bathroom, except that it has a window in the wall opposite the doorway. But this dream is so real that I actually believe it is not a dream. As I am drinking, something (a presence?) begins shaking me. My entire body shakes from my head to my toes -- at first gently, but soon, more violently. When the shaking starts, I am surprised, and initially not frightened. I think I call out, "Is that you, Mary?" But when the shaking becomes more violent, I become very frightened. I know this is not Mary, but some terrifying and evil force. I must break away from this powerful grip. I think, if only I can escape its hold on me and scream, this will get Adam's attention and I'll be safe -- or saved. I don't know how I do it, but somehow I break from the grip of this force. Then, slowly, I back out of the bathroom, and out of the bedroom and into the hall. All this while I keep my eyes focused in the direction of where I think the evil force is located. I do not see "The Thing," but I am convinced that it is moving menacingly towards me. All this while I am convinced this is not a dream -- that it is real. I'm making a terrible noise that is coming from deep down in my throat. It is an anguished moan, and sounds like, "Ooo -- ooo --ooo," repeated over and over again. I'm desperately hoping to awaken Adam, whose bedroom is just next to mine. The door of his room is closed and I'm very upset that he's sleeping so soundly and not coming to my rescue. At no time do I think of Robert as my potential rescuer. His bedroom is just next to Adam's. All of my thoughts are only on waking up Adam. It is a terrifying ordeal and I'm extremely frightened.
