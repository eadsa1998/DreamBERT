I am late for an evening class (8:00), and I am not fully prepared.  I know what I am going to do-pairs of students will be assigned a short dialog to enact, with some follow-up activities based on the dialog.  But I have not yet decided which pair shall enact which dialog.  I could just assign them arbitrarily, but I have some reason for wanting to assign certain students certain dialogs.  I start to do it while the class is waiting, but it makes me feel pressured, so I give the class a break and go to another room, or to a cafeteria, to do it.  It takes me longer than I expect, and when I get back to class, it is after 8:30, and the students are hanging around in the hallway outside the classroom.  A number of them are grousing, as I feared they would, about my being so late, remarking to each other audibly what my lateness policy towards them was, and saying that I had been 51 minutes late for the last class, and now more than a half hour again.  I felt defensive about these remarks, but I knew they were justified, and I apologized to the class after it had assembled, but I told them they would find that this would happen in other classes they took in the university.  (I wanted to add "with worse teachers," but I decided against it.)  The first dialog I assigned was between two students named Schulte and Epstein.
