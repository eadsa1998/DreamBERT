[1997-05-05] I was on a big boat with my girlfriend. Nothing exciting happened there. Then I was with my parents on another, smaller boat, sailing down and we were entering these rock formations and I was scared, I didn't want us to hit them, I could see them clearly. Then the boat changed to a kind of inflatable canoe which was very strange, and we had problems, it sank and we took it back out and we sailed away and I woke up.
