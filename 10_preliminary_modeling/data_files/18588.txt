I was carrying the words behind me on a string (rope) up a hill. The hill was in the mountains. I'd been going up--slow, up higher--SLOW. I stopped to look at some music. A lady suggested I try to play the trumpet while I was playing the piano. She had already printed the programs with the write-up about trumpet playing with asterisked copy: *music stands available for $75.00. I didn't even try to explain to her that it was pointless, if not stupid, to try to play the piano and trumpet at the same time. You need both hands for each. And you can't look at 2 different sets of music and there'd be nowhere to put the music stand, much less have to pay $75.00 to get one. But I played some Mozart and went back to finish pulling my words up the hill. I was surprised to find that they were now riding along down the hill and even around curve by themselves. The brick that served as a weight to steady the load balanced the words when they got going too fast and the brick kept the words from flying off the edge of the mountain when they went around curves.
