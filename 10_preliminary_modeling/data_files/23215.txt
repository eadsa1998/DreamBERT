I come to Burtand Kelly's house.  They have a house with a fenced yard.  Our dog Roxie is there, and I go to see her.  She doesn't show much recognition of me, and I am disappointed.  I don't know whether she has forgotten me or she is sick.  I see that one eye is white and puffy and disgusting, and I am shocked.  I don't know if it is permanent or whether it is being treated and will return to normal.
