Co-worker Juliet is my older daughter and Paulina my youngest. I leave Paulina to deal with, whatever she's doing, and decide to go sit down where the guys are. I think I see Paul Newman and bravely decide to go sit next to him. Pretty soon I see it's not Paul and lots of other men come sit in a square with us. I comment that lots of people like the couch.
