 I'm skiing with my brother Wally, my mom, and others in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Near Corbet's Coulier there are some people. I show my mom the drop of that run. There is a 30-foot drop-off boarded up, and a couple of smaller drops. People are standing on their skis and snowboards near the top of the drop. I point this out to my mom. We ski down the hill. I do okay, and make a good turn. Wally comments on my good turn. People aren't supposed to ski in some areas that are snow covered. I am with other friends near a house. I know the people who live in the house: they are my female friend and her family. The light goes on in the house. It is late and the people were all sleeping before the light turned on. We didn't intend to disturb them. I am standing in a doorway listening to my friend and her father talking. She doesn't notice I am there for a while. I stand there and listen, waiting for attention. Then she notices me and comes over to greet me and let me in.
