I've got to get to work and am late for the bus so I've decided to run to work. I've dressed for it in shorts and no shoes and I'm running along Cedar where the Field bus goes but of course it's all different. I run up on a broken-off concrete strip for a bit, then get down, knowing it's dangerous - next to an apartment building, the ground rises from the sidewalk*. Every now and then I turn and look for a bus. I'm conscious of being late for work this way - if I do get a bus I may as well not bother running, but one doesn't come. I notice I'm running on my toes and try to concentrate on using my heels. I turn toward downtown as the bus does and start through a black neighborhood with a sort of honkytonk bit. I pass a brick shops-block and look inside a window of a place that's a bar, apparently, and it fits, there's stuff like beer ads on the wall but the room is empty. [It's still darkish outside.] Shortly I pick my way over a lot of broken beer-bottle glass in the parking lot, and turn right again; now I've got to get through a sleazier part before I get to where downtown starts being business. I run into an old man who wants me to stop and I sort of dance backwards to hear him. Then he brings out a knife and says he wants my money - I tell him I don't have any and he's not very good at this, he just looks a bit sad and dithers. I say I'm sorry and turn to run on and immediately run into a young man, blondish hair, jacket, jeans, who stops me the same way but gets up close to me. I grab his hands and try to hold them out, but he's stronger than me, he's already got a knife and he works it to point at the back of my thigh and I realize I can't stop him and he's mean. He asks left or right? I don't know what he means and he jabs it at (into?) my leg and says "shall I turn it to the left or right?" Apparently the damage done would be different. I'm scared and petrified.
