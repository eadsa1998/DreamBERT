["Playing the violin."] I am in a quartet of violin players. We are standing in a row on a lake beach, very near the water. Across the lake is a huge cliff which has seats or bleachers in them for the audience. To my right is the orchestra being directed by a famous director, a man. I work very hard to play as perfectly as I can. I can feel my little finger brushing against the other finger like it has a hangnail or a sore. This could throw off my playing but I concentrate very hard and manage to play very beautiful music that the director is pleased with. I win the contest.
