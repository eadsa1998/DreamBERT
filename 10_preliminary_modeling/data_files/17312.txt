Dreamt of a play performed on a boat.  It was not the first time.  I helped out, loading people onto the boat.  It went in cycles, so the whole bay land could be seen rather quickly.  There were many decaying hands- I finally figured it out.  The coast was laden with corpses of sea lions.  I was disgusted and went to wait to get off the boat at the next docking.
