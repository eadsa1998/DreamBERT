["Tidal waves."] A convict is being escorted by a policeman. We are at the beach at the ocean. He tries to escape the car. I am standing on the beach and I see parts of the sand flowing like lava to the ocean. People and cars are being swept out to sea. I scramble to get more inland. I have to cross the sands that are flowing and am nearly swept away into the ocean. I get across, just barely. I and a woman and the convict get into the car and try driving up to dry land. The woman says my little girl, I have to get her. I don't want to, because it is dangerous for her. But I must. She bites her red polished fingernails. We find her and drive up and up. The entire coast is being swallowed up by the ocean. We end up on a mountain. We see a map of the world. A globe. We mention how the sea by Alaska or (unknown) have a very shallow (unknown). I am afraid.
