[1997-05-26] I was late for work because my alarm clock never went off. I kept trying to fix it by pushing the button but it wouldn't speak. I checked it and I found that the batteries were out, but the batteries were not the kind that they actually are. Instead of the flat round coin batteries these were double A, penlight batteries.
