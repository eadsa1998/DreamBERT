I was driving through a parking lot that had huge piles of sand all over the place. People were coming and paying for and taking some of the sand. I don't know how they were taking it. The piles of sand made it very difficult to drive through the parking lot. Some of the areas seemed more like I was driving down a street where there had been snow and ice. Parts of it were melted and parts of it were very thick so where I was driving was very uneven and rough. The owner or whoever was responsible for maintenance needed to come in and reorganize the piles of sand and dirt so it was in neat piles and would clear out more of the driving space. I think Matthew is in the car with me. There was a woman there. I don't think she was in my car. Maybe in her own car. She didn't know how to get where she was going and she asked for directions. I said it depended on whether she took 465 north or south. She said, south I guess. So I told her which way to go. She asked again. I gave her the directions again. She told me where she wanted to go. I didn't know where that place was so I couldn't help her. Someone told Matthew to watch for a yellow, circle-shaped, inflatable something. We were driving around and saw several things that looked like they could be what we were looking for but somehow we knew that they weren't. We saw someone coming out of the hospital.
