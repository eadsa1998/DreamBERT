I was operating B and S at White's. I had 4 machines to operate. Then on a different day I had #59 to operate. I had a hard time finding it, but finally found it. The machine was in a big section where there were several machines on a panel. I only had a couple buttons to operate and the screws or bolts came out and I gauged the thread on a gauge.
