The world had been separated into cities. They were surrounded by 'bubbles'. A protector would walk around the outside, guarding them. Some guy wandered into this party. It was day time and was outside. Marlon Brando (like in The Godfather) was there and I was like "Ooh! Marlon Brando's gonna kick your butt!". I was thinking that I should watch On The Waterfront today. This tiger jumped to get something and then Marlon was petting it. This guy gave this girl an engagement ring and she was like "What does it mean, anyway?". Outside the bubble, it looked like Super Mario Galaxy. Someone said "you sleep at night, and hope you don't get killed".
