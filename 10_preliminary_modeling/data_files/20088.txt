I was in a room with my sister. There was a new refrigerator in the room. Looking out the window, I saw a great amount of smoke pouring from the smokestack belonging to a school building. I warned someone that there must be a fire there. Later my clothes were being moved. I noticed that my towel was sewed onto a laundry bag, and I complained to a man who resembled a patient on the ward named Gonzolez.
