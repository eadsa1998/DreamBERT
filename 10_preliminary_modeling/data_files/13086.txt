The Doctor Who episode of The Weakest Link was on TV. There was a bit before the show where a few days earlier, Noel Clarke, Masi Oka and James Kyson Lee had gone into the studio to mess around. They had pegs to put their picture up. James pegged his head instead. David Tennant and Anne Robinson also appeared. Later, I was in the car and they were going to play it on the radio. Dad and Ezra were waiting for it and got out. Dad got rid of the station.
