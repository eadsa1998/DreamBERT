Ezra and I got a kitten each. His was weird and was a girl. We could put them in this water and they would be ok. I was trying to think of a name for mine. I thought of Dean, but remembered that's what I wanted to call my dog, then David to reference David Lynch and Michael C. Hall's character in Six Feet Under, and Darren to reference John Lennon but couldn't use that since we already had a Darren in the house.
