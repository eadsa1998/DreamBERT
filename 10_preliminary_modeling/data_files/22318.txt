Setting: a record shop, any record shop. I was shopping and I remember looking at the covers of records, which were shining and colorful, especially one in which Nile green was the predominant color. I was looking for a record and humming its tune, because I didn't know the title. I don't remember whether I was alone or accompanied by some friend in the store. I felt satisfied and happy to be buying records. I don't remember if I bought any.
