I see an old friend, a warm, friendly man, one I met when I just started at the community college. His voice is warm and caring (like Nat V). I can't remember his name. He comes up to me and asks how I'm doing. I am interrupted by a boy doing some tricks with a small wagon/car. The wheel is turned and won't work right. He's on stage and is embarrassed and says, "What shall I do?" in a stage whisper. I walk around on stage being like a rodeo clown, a distraction. Then my friendly man comes back over and hugs me. We walk together for a block or so, his arm around my waist and mine around his. It felt so good and comforting. I missed it. We talked. I told him about my book. "Oh, still trying to get that published," he says. "You need a job!" He says, "I'm retired." I say, "But a few odd jobs to make extra money would be nice." I remember his name is Nat Cathran. I like him very much.
