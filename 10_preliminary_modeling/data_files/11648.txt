I walked into a bar and had a drink with a friend I had just met. He was in the service with me and I actually hadn't seen him for a year or more. But in the dream I met him as I would if I had seen him every day. When I was talking to my friend another fellow walked up and my friend introduced me saying this third man was a friend of his. Number 3 invited us in the back room for a drink. When number 3 opened the door I saw the room was full of men, who were quite hard to see through the dim light and smoke. They immediately began to advance and my friend and I, backed against a wall, and began knocking them down. Number 3 also turned on us. I couldn't seem to be harmed but I knocked man after man down as they would approach. It ended here.
