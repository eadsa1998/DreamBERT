We were in a cave or out in a dark field. I heard lions roaring. I think they were in a cage. Bob was a small boy. He had a skirt on and I was trying to pin it on his shirt so he would have cover for his sex organs. I was trying to hang something up by driving nails into good varnished wood. Seemed like a dresser or some kind of molding. I saw iii in the entries for the weight.
