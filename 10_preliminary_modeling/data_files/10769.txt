I dreamed that Dean Dolan was explaining the construction of some English sentences to me. I had them all correct except one which she switched around to make it the right construction. Then we walked out of the classroom since she a class and so did I. As we came out into the hall, I saw a friend of mine coming out of another classroom. He looked as though he just had a biology class of some sort because he had a white coat and a pair of white trousers on. He had a bandage on his hand and half way up his arm. I asked him what had happened and he said he was playing football and had broken his wrist. I waited until he put his coat on and then we went home together.
