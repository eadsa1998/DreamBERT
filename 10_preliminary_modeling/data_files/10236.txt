We are living in a small apartment and the kids are still toddlers; I hear a radio announcement that MT. ST. HELEN'S is about to erupt again and I notice that it is getting darker, though it is still daylight. Then I am sitting with Frank and a kitchen and he tells me that his sister has DIED. "when?" "Oh, a few days ago" I am angry and furious that he hadn't told me sooner and spoke so nonchalantly. "well, go an find me a Bible so I can write her name and the date below that of her parents" I look for the Bible, but only find 3 Bibles that are worm-eaten with yellowed pages; look in a closet and see floor littered with papers; I get furious at Frank again, and want him to clean up the closet; he wants to go for a walk; I say "Not until I find a Bible." - shift: Wendy tells me that Brenda (Polly's mother) has DIED. I am sad. Wendy tells me how Brenda folded her hands, and laid down quietly and died; only her feet showed any sign of struggle; shift: happily walking with a friend on whom I can lean; we talk and laugh. We go to buy a CANDLE, a BASKET and a BOWL: I remember putting the candle in a hole in the basket; I am so happy I don't want to go home....shift: we are on a TRAIN in a large train station; our kids get off to go to play; while the trains are switched back and forth. finally a conductor tells us the train is ready for boarding: it looks like CATTLE CARS and it is difficult to climb up a high step to board the train; I do not see the kids; I walk ;through the whole train and do not see them - PANIC. I get off the train and an official tells me they will be able to get on another train; But I am desolate. I finally jump on the train as it begins to move.
