I was listening to the radio in my home when a news broadcast came on. It stated that Kay Starr, the singer, had been killed in an auto crash in Hollywood, California. I seemed very shocked at this notice of her death. I turned to another station and the program was a record show. The first piece I heard was by Kay Starr. I turned the radio off.
