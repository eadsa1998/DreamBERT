I was with Mom in a car at night. I had chickens at Nana's but I hadn't fed them in a while. We went past and there dead ones. Her house was different. We went around the side, near her room and the light went on. I went to the front door. As it opened I said "it's Izzy" and Nana said "I was about to hit you on the head".
