I was at home. This model girl was in the games room and I drew her. She left when I finished. This other model girl, who was slightly Asian looking and really pretty was lying on a bed. I asked her to come here for a second and we walked to the living room and I asked her what she was doing and she said she was about to go to bed because she had to get up in 2 hours. It had something to do with her son and I remembered and told her not to worry and to go back to bed (I was going to draw her).
