[1997-05-22] People were setting up some sort of carnival right in front of our house in the street which was blocked off. There were going to be rides and games and it was going to be really neat. I thought about the noise that would be generated and then I thought no that's okay because it would be fun to have it real close by and I wouldn't have to worry about transportation to get there so that was okay.
