I went to Nana's. It must've been around Christmas because we were getting presents. I got these pink pajamas and this shirt but they were kid sizes. Ezra got the black and yellow notebooks. Uncle Wilbur said that he would have to start writing a journal. Ezra was like 'no'. Then Poppa came in with more presents. It was some stuff and this electronic thing which did something cool but you had to write a journal. Ezra was like 'oh'.
