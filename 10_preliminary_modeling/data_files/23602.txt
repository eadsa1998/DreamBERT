I'm asleep. I wake up and go behind our house where there is a hole in the ground (3 ft. diameter). Somebody sticks its head out of the hole and says, "Come on in." I do. The people are in the form of circles, or bubbles, all in a different color; or everybody is a different colored balloon. They show me around and I find they have a very beautiful, modern city. But they aren't happy. They want out. They want to get out of the hole and see what it is like where I live. So we make a car and I get as many balloon people in as I can. Some of he balloon people change into human form. I start driving. I drive faster and faster so we can get up enough speed to go up and out the entrance (hole behind my house), but just as we get up enough speed, we stopped at a bull fight. We stayed there for the show and left. We started driving again, but I wrecked the car and was thrown high in the sky. I started to fall, but awoke before I hit.
