At Church, lighting 4 sticks of incense for the Camden family. Nevena comes up to me from behind and says "I hardly recognized you with your short hair and new glasses." I see many people on campus and clearly see Frank and Pedro talking, quite friendly. I walk up to them and say: "I missed you, I can hardly stand it."
