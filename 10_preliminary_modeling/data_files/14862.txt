I was driving down Wanneroo Road and I had turned on from Newtown Drive. Then I realized I wasn't supposed to be driving alone and pulled up on the side of the road. I got out and went across the road for some reason. I went back and a guy was in the driver's seat. I opened the passenger door and said "Get out of my car" and I stuck something pointy into his gut and said "what did you take?". He had a sign and a bunch of other stuff. I told him to put it back and get out. He said I couldn't report him to the school because I was in the wrong and I said "suck my balls nub". I ended up somewhere miles away and I was trying to get back. I got a big stick and was walking along the train tracks. Two guys crossed over. I called Mom and waited at a shop for her. She came. I went to the shop and we stayed there for a while. There were tents in there. There were collections of stuff. There was some Beatles stuff. I saw Michael Palin's diaries and a picture of a guy who I thought was Terry Jones at first, but it was someone else. I started jumping and floating and I said I was full of energy. Mom downloaded a crack to protect from something. Ezra wrote something somewhere about her being a noob. We went to Darren's work nd Mom gave him some wallpaper I chose. When we first got there, Mom pretended to order burgers. We were then at some house. There was a McDonald's ad on TV with Selena, Samantha and Alejandro. Dad had some woman come over. I had heard them having sex before? He said "where did you hear that?".
