Fluffy has a kitten. It keeps trying to nurse and gets taken away and put back. Finally, it is announced that the baby isn't going to make it and I must see it and say cafe. At first it is a fibrous mass and then it is a huge hard-boiled egg, sans shell. I hold it in my hands. The smooth slippery surface feels slightly icky and yet I am fascinated or drawn to it. It is the size of an ostrich egg or uterus.
