I dreamt that I was a famous ballet dancer and was acclaimed by audiences all over the world. Every night I would dance, and at the end of the performance there would be a tremendous ovation and I would receive large bouquets of flowers. All of them carnations. One night I went out on the stage to do my solo and I saw no one in the audience or the orchestra pit. I began to dance anyhow and danced until I fell exhausted. There was a tremendous ovation--from where I didn't know.
