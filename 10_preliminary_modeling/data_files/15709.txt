I was at a cinema or bar thing. I might've worked there? But maybe not working at the moment. A group of four guys came in and stood in front of me, looking nervous. They had hats/sunnies on. I recognised them - one was Bradley Cooper, and the other three were famous friends of his. I waved and joked about them looking dodgy (though it was something witty). I chatted to them and said there was a little booth thing away from everyone else and showed them where. They started messing about in there. It was dark, but I tried to get a sneaky pic. Bradley Cooper got peed off at some point and stormed out. Someone suggested it was because I took a pic, but I showed them my phone which was on the forum and said I hadn't (they believed me - though I actually hadn't managed to get a pic). On the way out, I saw Richard Ayoade and a bunch of people said his name in this weird way as some kind of in-joke. I went outside. A lady was walking around and one side of her face looked weird, like she had a really sagging eye. Someone called out 'Deborah [something]' and she was an actress who had been in low-budget horror films, one was a cult favourite that I hadn't seen but had heard of. She was still young though. Someone asked if it was her and I said something about Dan Palmer having said something about her. Then Dan Palmer was there but I didn't recognise him at first because he was dressed up like a goth/tranny? It wasn't until he started talking that I realised it was him (the 'r' impediment). Also, I got a text from Kiersten saying the room had been booked and was really nice (we staying somewhere overnight/couple nights). There was one big bed and then on the other side of the room there were two smaller, but slightly bigger than single, beds. Lukas also text me about it.
