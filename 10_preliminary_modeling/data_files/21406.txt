I stopped over to see Jim. He was sitting playing cards. I slapped him on the bare back. A radish fell out of his hand on the table and he was looking for it. A small baby of his was standing on the table playing. He said, "I will check right away. I'll see if Distinguished won." He was a hot tip. I picked up a clock and watch attached one another and it lay on the road. A car must have run it over because they were flat as a pancake and still I heard it ticking. I was surprised. I was in Rivertown to draw ovens. The coke yard was smoky as it used to be years ago. I was in the basement and a couple of bees were flying around in the smoke that was there.
