I dreamt I was watching Larry and May with a baby on a bed. They left the baby alone and it was lying on its face and crying. I was worried it would suffocate. I went and held the baby. He was soaking wet so I took off his diapers. I thought Larry and May would come back with a fresh diaper. The baby was happy to be with me. I held him up in the air and swung him. He laughed. Then I held him and he started suckling my breast. I liked it but I thought May wouldn't like it because it's not hygienic to share nursing, so I pulled him off.
