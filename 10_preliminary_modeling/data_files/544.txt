I am taking care of some little girl. We are at first in a house trying to make a copy of a gas contract. I am with a friend who says she is going to work for the gas company. I question something about a "nice, gentle man or nice gentleman". The little girl is getting sick and I take her inside. Outside it is a wooded area with water. I have a large piece of wood and I am trying to place it somewhere in the water so it will stay. It is dark and I can't see. The piece of wood falls and an animal I didn't see, like a badger, snarls and comes out into the water and swims away. I go back inside.
