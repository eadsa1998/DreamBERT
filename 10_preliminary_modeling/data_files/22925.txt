My wife Bonita and I were on a raft or some other kind of small boat on a large bay which opened out into the ocean.  Somehow we ended up in the water.  I hung on to the boat, or something else which was afloat, but Bonita started to swim.  I was very worried, because the water was very choppy and it was a long, long way to shore.  However, she seemed to be making remarkably good progress, and since I was worried about her getting too far out of reach, I started swimming after her.  To my surprise, I too made good progress, swimming very fast.  She got the willies from feeling things brush against her under water, and at one point I saw a huge sea turtle pass just beneath her.  Once we got into a thick patch of tall reeds, which made me nervous because of what might be among them but was also somewhat reassuring because we had something to cling to in case we tired.  We continued to make good progress, though, and soon found ourselves in a long, narrow inlet lined with bushes and trees, whose branches interlocked overhead to form a sort of tunnel -- so much so, and so long was it, that the tunnel appeared to be closed at the far end, and at that end we actually saw a light -- the light at the end of the tunnel.  When we got there, the water became very shallow and just kind of petered out into a dirt street in a run-down section of town.
