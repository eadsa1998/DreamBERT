I signed up as being a fan of a show. Also Darren was on the news. I was watching a Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit episode and Darren watched it too. I pointed to Teller and he was like 'what the fuck?'. On that fan thing, Ishaan had a post, something about Supernatural. Someone got a 'lawful' email from Jensen Ackles and someone sent it to Mom's email. I was trying not to read it. I managed not to for a while. I downloaded some shows.
