I see a house that is for rent. It looks familiar to me like I might have looked at it before. I walk up to the front and peek in an open door to a made over garage that might be a large bathroom. I realize I have looked at this house before and liked it. I walk in the front door to see a group of men, who are showing the house. A man in a dolly for a wheelchair is looking at the house also. There is no furniture. The living room is large. I like it. I walk through the living room to a wide spacious hall with large windows on the left ad several doors off to the right. I walk down the hall into a bedroom, which has a double bed in it and a rectangle wooden box like cradle with a baby in it. An old man is there making the bed. I am quite excited. This is the house. I must have. And even the baby is there as I anticipated. He looks old and tired. Howard enters the room. I tell him this is the house I want. He says great We'll take it. I ask the man how much the rent is. He says $1500 a month. I wince, that is too much! Howard in his eagerness to have us back together is on bended knee if front of me wearing  white pants and shirt. He says It's OK. I'll work it out somehow. I am unsure and concerned by I ignore those feelings because I want the house so much. I agree and we follow the man out to his office to close the deal. Howard goes first, the man and I follow as we walk up an outside stairway upstairs. The walking is difficult, because the steps are loose and wobble under my feet. I struggle to climb the stairs. The man says and there is $1300 a month for the conserve, which I understood to mean the insurance. Now it is clearly too much for us to pay. I hesitate.
