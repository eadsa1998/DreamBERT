It was just before a softball game-with the agency team, probably.  When the coach began reading off the lineup, I was kind of surprised not to be the first or second batter.  At first I was afraid I wasn't starting, but then was equally surprised to hear my name called as clean-up hitter.  I had a lot of trouble finding a glove to fit me.  The fingers were too narrow in all of them, so I couldn't pull them down far enough on my hand for them to be of much use.
