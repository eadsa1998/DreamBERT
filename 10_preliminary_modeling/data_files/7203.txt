[2nd dream] So I went to the dining room barefooted carrying two pairs of shoes. Found my place at the table but no one brought me anything to eat although I was only a little bit late. I complained to Mrs. McC. "Could I go to the kitchen at the far end of the dining room and ask for food?" She said she had better go and started but some woman in white across the table stopped her to talk. I grew more and more impatient and again interrupted them to insist that I was hungry. I had come as quickly as I could, even barefooted and hadn't heard the bell. Would I have to go to the restaurant?
