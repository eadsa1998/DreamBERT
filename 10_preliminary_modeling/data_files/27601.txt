I was in the kitchen--company was coming or there was some important reason for success with an elaborate meal, which I was to make. Ever time I went for an ingredient I needed, I discovered we had none. At my wits end I settled on "tuna-fish souffle" &amp; some concoction of mixed vegetables. There were other things, because I kept dashing from one to the other. The souffle got done too soon, &amp; began to dry out &amp; to fall--the sauce for the vegetables bubbled over &amp; then began to evaporate before my eyes--that's all I remember.
