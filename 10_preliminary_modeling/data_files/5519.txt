I was working for an old friend of mine, named E in her florist shop, which I did in real life. We were having a really good time, laughing and talking and the shop was really lovely, there were many cut flowers in vases and in the cooler there were some lovely flower arrangements. Then E and I went into another room and E's husband came in with a beautiful, big dog, and I had with me a very small dog and there was instantaneous dislike between the 2 dogs and we had to control them. The other one was not a pretty one, not dingy but, it was brown, they were both brown, hers was an Irish Setter I think, and mine was some kind of poodle, I have no desire to own a poodle.
