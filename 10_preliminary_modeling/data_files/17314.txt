There was a crawlspace into my friend's dorm room.  I went to the bathroom.  After that I seemed to be at Chuck E Cheese with my mother.  There were games, some of which were free to play.  In the first one, my prize was a small zip cord for toy cows.  At another, a small plastic coin.  My mother played game that took the plastic coin for payment.  The goal was to virtually swing one coin on a string to hit coins floating around.  Her prize was some sort of dollar bill printout.  Some games progressed from one to the next like that as a sort of puzzle- you need to finish one game to go onto the next.  In the end, I proceeded down a long wide cavern- whatever was at the end was the ultimate prize I needed.  I was proud to obtain it.  I had also gotten a more permanent zip cord with a little light on it, a head kerchief, and the coins.
