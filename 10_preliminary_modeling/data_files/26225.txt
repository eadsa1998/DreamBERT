 I'm going to play football for Brimson. I sit down in a room with my classmate Will Brant and another man. I stretch my legs, sitting on the floor. I have several pairs of exercise-like pants on, which restrict my stretching movements, so I unzip the bottom of the pants and pull the legs up. I sit with my legs at a right angle, stretching my groin and hamstrings. The second man asks if I've ever done squats. I say not really. He says that strip sets are the most difficult. I understand that this is when weight is removed after each set and the person keeps doing repetitions. Football players are doing different things. I'm on a rehabilitation program, which makes my routine pretty lax. There is a lot of therapy, massage, baths, and such, and not too much work. I like this: I'm getting off easy.
