I was giving Justin Hobelson a ride home after class.  Where I let him out was supposed to be on Main Street, but it looked like a building instead.  It turned out to be a building just enclosing a long stretch of the street, maybe part of the subway system somehow.  People would come up the street to the door of the building and then come out of the door.
