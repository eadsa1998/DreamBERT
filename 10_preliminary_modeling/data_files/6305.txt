I had a dream that my father bought three cars for me and gave me a choice of which car I wanted. I could not make up my mind. They were all nice cars. They were three Lincoln LSC's. I took a black one for a ride and ended up in a beautiful field that had many flowers and lush green grass. I kept driving, and I never ended up anywhere. I kept seeing the same street sign over and over. It said next exit three miles ahead. Then I woke up. The dream was senseless.
