My mother - age 43 - and I were sitting in a theater waiting for the performance to start (I don't know what kind of show it was, it might have been a movie, a play or an opera) and we were the only ones sitting in the section of seats about half-way back close to the side. Then about 20 famous movie stars came in and sat all around us. They kept making all kinds of noises, laughing, singing, and talking and I couldn't keep my mind on the performance. So I told my mother I was leaving and I would be back in a few minutes. I don't know where I went or what I did but when I came back the movie stars were gone and my mother was sitting among ordinary people who were quietly enjoying the performance. Beside my mother was an over-sized chair in which I sat down. We sat there until the end of the show and I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of it but I can't remember what it was about.
