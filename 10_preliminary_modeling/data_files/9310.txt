I was on top of a tower or building with a young man. I see crows flying overhead. I turn up my lips and pretend to kiss them. They start to circle and come in close. I see they are carrion crows--dirty, smelly beaks. I fear they will kiss me. A big one--like a large eagle or condor--comes close and I see a young woman in its talons. I pull &amp; she is in my arms--young, about 16, pixie haircut, thin cotton dress--no underwear, small breasts (like Audrey Hepburn or Julie Harris). She kisses me and I am pleased. We eagerly kiss many times. We go down the hill or mountain to a house where she lives. I realize it is a whore house where she is held captive. I'm immediately bothered about the kisses since she may be infected from that house. I see the gangsters in the house and I wonder if I should endanger my life to protect her. She stands close to me, certain I can save her.
