I sat on the steps in Rivertown and I looked and saw thick pieces of paint. I asked Ann what that was after I got some gray paint on my hands. She had the paint six inches thick in some places on the steps. Ann was chasing me down an ice street. I would stop and she would slide right by. She was mad. A man came at me with a square steel bar. He was angry. I got hold of the bars and told him to put them down and fight, but he wouldn't.
