I'm going to a psychology conference and am in the city a day early, so I find another conference to go to so I can stay in a hotel. I go to the desk to get my room assignment and they tell me there's been a change. I owe $170 a night because they only had a "2 and 1/3" room, very elite, left. I say, "Sorry. Can't afford that. You must come up with a regular room." They discover they made a mistake and give me a key to a regular room. Mary Sexton is with me and we go find the elevator. We laugh at the unusualness of the elevator. It is roomy, ornate and has two porcelain bowls that at first look like toilets, and mirrors. We get to our floor and pass several alcoves where patrons of the hotel are lying or sitting in cute, ornate barbershop chairs and so on that vibrate, massage and make them laugh. I find my room and go in. It is filled with books, games, videos, and fun things to do. I go to the hall now because I hear the guide calling people to come to the next planned activity. We go outside to see a parade, which isn't much, and then I look up in the sky and see a beautiful spun glass star falling to the lawn. I rush to be the one to catch it and pounce on it like a football tackle, fighting off the hotel employees who want it too. I clutch it as they explain to me they have to have it back. The stars are for show and they cost a lot. But I won't let go. I want that star. It's attached to a fishing line and they try to reel it back, but I hang on doggedly! They finally give up because I have a "death" grip on it and won't let go. I take my star and go back toward the hotel. I haven't moved this much in years! I'll sure be sore tomorrow, but it was worth it.
