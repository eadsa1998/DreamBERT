[1997-06-12] I was in an airport, sitting, drinking a cup of coffee with friends from work and I tasted the coffee and I thought "boy, this stuff has grinds in it and everything, this is supposed to be good coffee but it tastes like old hobo coffee that you make by just pouring coffee in a pan and boiling it." Then I thought I was in an elevator lobby at work, standing, listening to some people talk. Then I recognized my female friend S's voice from New Jersey. She was saying that it costs $6000 dollars per semester to send her son to school. Someone else said "Boy, how do you come up with that much money?" And I just chimed in "Well S is rich and I'm rich too, sometimes I borrow money from her, some-times she borrows money from me, we have lots of it."
