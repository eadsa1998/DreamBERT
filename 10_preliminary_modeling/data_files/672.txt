I visit my friend, Marianne, in the hospital several times and each time we have to clear and re-arrange her room as it is always a mess. The floor is partly linoleum and partly carpet and it is almost impossible to arrange the room to keep the bed on the carpet. It seems like the room is more like a house and the linoleum part is the kitchen part. Marianne gets out of the hospital but still has the bed in a big vehicle. We are driving home and get so tired we pull into a yard to sleep. The owner, a woman, comes out and we follow her inside. My neighbor boy comes over to have the woman do something with an injury he has to his stomach. He also has a black eye and there is a little hole under the eye. I ask what happened and he says he doesn't remember. The woman's husband doesn't seem to mind that we are staying at their house.
