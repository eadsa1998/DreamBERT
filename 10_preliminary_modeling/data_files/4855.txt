["Lots of stuff and rules."] I am in some area where there is lots of things. I am trying to sort through them, cleaning up. Some man is around who has strict rules. He talks about them and I don't particularly agree. I just continue doing my thing. I am aware he can make things tough if he is crossed, but I don't worry about it too much. Just a slight concern.
