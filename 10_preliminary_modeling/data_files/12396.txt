We were lost somewhere on this island or something. Samantha was an expert boat person and we went on this boat and we were flying around it. I forgot why we eventually came back, but we came back to land in little cups. There was some guy called Sparks. I'd been saying to someone "Things we don't understand are covered", and this guy came, and I went "Like you". We'd seen him before and he ran this whole show. He unlocked this thing, and I saw that he was black. He was answering some questions.
