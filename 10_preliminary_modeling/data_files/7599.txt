It is summer. I'm still living as a single mom on Lakeland. My family lived on the same street. I saw Brian F go in their house dressed in his underwear and a man's pink negligee with a girl on each arm. He leaned out the window and invited me in but I said no. I was in my house looking out the window and could see one of the neighbor's home movies. It was a little boy by a fence learning to play baseball. He is batting but he keeps missing. The little boy was Connie's son. I then went to Connie B's house. Their whole family was there. One of the men said I was his. I was interested in his brother. We were all talking and laughing. I felt that they really liked me. I was the life of the party. We were discussing swimming pools and hot tubs. The man I was interested in was with two women. He said the image of me in a swimsuit was gross. I became very quiet and sad. I left and went to my family's house. I made a comment about them living on the same street and never coming to see me.
