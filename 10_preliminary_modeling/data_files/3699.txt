I am walking around a sort of track and field shaped area. It's a store. I need to go pee and find a bathroom. I sit and pee and pee, but can't get relief. I hear the loud sound of peeing and feel the pee going down my leg. I get up, a bit uncomfortable about all that urine all over my dress and in my moccasins. I walk on. I see a deli counter, sort of a Safeway Bakery. I find a bag of rolls or muffins and decide to get one. I read the ingredients to make sure there is no sugar in them. I continue strolling. As I walk, I nearly step on the end row boat of a string of boats. It is a rowing team. Justin, Lucy's husband, is learning to row and is lying down on his back in the last boat (like it's a train of them). I smile and apologize for nearly stepping on him. I think I embarrassed him and feel bad about that. I choose a sweater to buy. I put it on and notice it is quite huge, longer than my dress. I see Delores M and she has a sweater like it. It is pink knit, half sleeves. I notice I can see my dress underneath the sweater. Delores is telling me how she fought with the telephone company over a one thousand dollar bill and they agreed to remove 300 dollars of it. She was quite proud of that. I congratulate her. I say to Delores, "It looks like I'd better always wear a dress under this thing. After all, my boyfriend is disabled, but he's not blind." A group of young women burst out laughing at my amusing joke. I grin and stroll on. I still have to pee, so as I am walking, I pee down my leg. I am a bit embarrassed about the urine smell and being in public. I sit at a cafe table and three men join me; I continue peeing, hoping they don't notice.
