 I'm camping. There is a group that has made a big campsite. There is a huge tent and a fire. The group has three large heavy-duty lodges set up using some kind of contraption. I have a tent with no tarp underneath it. It is raining. I put on a rain poncho. My classmate Brad Chloe, from Brimson, is there. He helps me put a tarp underneath my tent.
