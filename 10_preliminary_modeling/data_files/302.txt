       Later (I think it's the same sequence) I'm going home, walking down a path - brick - through a pedestrian mall between some stores and offices. There are other people out strolling and visiting, very nice atmosphere. It's early evening, just beginning to get dark. I've got my purse under my arm, and something else with me (in a bag?). I stop for a minute to look at something, then go on my way. A short way further on, toward the street, having rounded a corner or two, I realize I've put my package down when I stopped, and left it. I'll have to go back for it. I hope it's still there. I go back, and there it is. I put my purse down to adjust how I'm holding the package, and go on again. I get almost to the street before I realize that now I've left my purse sitting right on the path. Anybody would see it - damn, I'm sure it won't be there now. Oh hell! I go back. As I round the corner near where I left it, I notice a sort of shelf on my right - the sort of thing you see in a restaurant or someplace "decorated", shoulder height, it might have plants on it. At the moment there are other things, personal things, on it, like a purse or two, and one of them resembles mine a bit. I pick it up and look at it, anxious, and of course realize my purse doesn't have a strap, and this one's rounded. I put it back down, thinking surely it belongs to somebody who's around and will think I'm stealing her purse. I turn around again and go a few more steps toward where I left my purse, and it's not on the ground, but I see on my left a table or stand with a woman behind it (large? black?) and by George it's a lost and found, and there's my purse on it! Hooray! I'm so grateful. I tell her it's mine - she listens to me explain and lets me have it back, and I go on back up the path, find the street at last and turn left, on my way home at last.
