I was working in some sort of hotel, me and two other girls I know from Santa Cruz, both surfers, going to be lifeguards. We were in a room (dark, non-descript) that was lower then the pool so you had to climb over an edge to get into the pool. We were then in the water, but I more clearly remember them in the water, really blue with a few life preservers around (red &amp; white). I think I was a little apprehensive about going into the water. We were all our age we are now and the building/hotel was unfamiliar. I know these girls know each other but the three of us have never all been together at the same time. In the dream we were not close to each other, not touching.
