First of all, I dreamt that somebody -- I think it was Terri -- was getting flooded out and we had to drive her up to higher ground. So she was in our car and we were taking her up to like __________. And then it kind of shifted to that I was going to do a second year at Westport College for some reason. And I had a music class with a woman that I went to, and she was having us like go around the room and sight read out loud, you know, like you read out of any other book. And this room was like big and open and it had tables with all kinds of stuff that we sat at. And the floor was yellow, kind of like linoleum, _________________, and let's see, she was having us paint these little rolls for some reason. I can't tell you what that had to do with it, other than it was a sort of melding into being an art class. And when that class was over, Mom had my schedule and she was waiting outside for me. And I didn't know what else I had to do in the day and I was kind of nervous because I knew I was just going to miss a class because that music class went over so long. And, let's see, oh, she read my schedule out loud to me, and I had that class first and then three personal fitness classes, and then something else. And I asked if she would take me around and show me where they all were, and she's like, "Well, I really don't have time; can we do it another day?" And I said, "Well, the least you could do is mark that paper for me." And she's like, "Well, there's not a copy machine here, so let's go home and maybe we'll get over to the hardware store sometime. And then I woke up.
