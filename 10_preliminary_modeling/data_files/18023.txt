I was at he Community Center camp (inside it looked like the downtown hospital) Me and my friend Melissa (but the person didn't really look like her) were sent out to get something. We went out and it was rainy. And we found a car and we drove in it. Melissa was driving and I was sitting next to her. I saw my mom outside so we stopped the car, but we crashed on the road next to a light post. And then we ran up to my mom and we walked up the Community Center stairs. We were wet.
