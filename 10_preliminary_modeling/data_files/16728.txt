I was walking through the woods, or at least on the edge of a forest. There were some people there, and some girl put her arm around my back and said hi- at that point, I knew who it was without even looking. I remembered her from "the previous year" but then I thought about how quickly a year went by.  I just knew I'd met her the year before, and then I realized how it didn't seem like a year since the last time I'd seen her. There were a bunch of people going whitewater rafting, and I was one of them- but this girl told me she had something better and to follow her. She started running, and I followed her. We went up on the rocks next to the river, and as soon as I saw whitewater people on the water catching up, I started running- I was afraid of what they'd do to us. I think I thought we were in some Asian communist country or something. The land reminded me of Asia, and they were trying to force us all to go whitewater rafting. I was afraid they'd catch us after we ran away from the rafting group. Then I think this girl either disappeared or turned into a boy. Anyway, I think "he" showed me a book written by a former Prep Academy student, so I started reading it, and I was very impressed with it. I wanted to show everyone what a great book it was. Then I felt like we were in a movie that was being taped about Prep Academy. I remember taping certain things about Prep Academy- for example, we were in the water and we were splashing the water saying THIS is Prep Academy, and laughing.
