I was at this shop. There were lots of lollies there. Seamus was there and he opened this thing and all these lollies spilled out. I was at the counter and Elijah was miming what the dude behind the counter was saying. I kept saying "Shut up Shiggan!". Silas and some people were in a pool. I was trying to get around and I thought I had my period.
