 I'm outside Wilmerton University on the back of a big truck. I grab two books. I try to compliment a black friend of mine who is there, buy my comment sounds racist. I'm in the cafeteria then. I'm going to take a calculus 2 class. The inside of the cafeteria is like a mall. The atmosphere at Brimson is friendlier and livelier than the one here. I sit in a booth by myself. My friend Jill Banks is across the cafeteria in a booth by herself. She returns her tray and walks past me. I call out to her. My friend Virginia Hamms is there. Two guys in a booth behind me show us around the school. I think the men are homosexual. My friends Emily Zates and Mya Rousing, from high school, are there. It is my birthday. They want to buy me something. There is a stand there that has a glass case in it which contains ceramic vases. They buy me some little vases. In one is written, "Krusty Kenneth", in glitter. It costs $50 for a shot glass, which is too much. The man selling the glass lowers his price to $10, and Mya buys it for me. She then drinks two shots of whiskey, not quite finishing the second shot. There is a video camera recording this. There are thick slices of orange on a tray at the counter. My uncle Rusty Redding is there. My mom is there, and is wearing her green sweater. I tell her that we're going to be in the video. I jump and wave at the camera. My mom goes up and puts her eye by the camera lens. I tell her not to.
