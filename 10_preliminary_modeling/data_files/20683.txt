I was in a department store looking for a certain floor. Later I was a patient in a hospital. Our ward was being moved to Ward 14. It had been a women's ward. (All of the wards with even numbers had been women's wards, and the ones with odd numbers had been men's wards. I saw a girl about 13 nearby. She was brunette with dark eyes (like the girl whose parents had me arrested five years ago when she was 8 years old). She stared steadily ahead. Some woman said about the girl that she gives the appearance of being polite, but she was really an indifferent person, and cared only for herself.
