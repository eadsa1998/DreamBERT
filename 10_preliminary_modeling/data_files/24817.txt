I was at the movies with Bill (a classmate) and then we got in some kind of a quarrel and he left. Then P. (I love him!) walked in and said, "Why are you here alone?" I replied, "Because my date left." Then he sat down next to me and we watched the movie together. Setting: At a movie theater that is pretty close to my house. Characters: Bill, a classmate who used to like me, but I have always hated. P., my best friend's cousin who I really love. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, joy, excited. Well, I was so extremely overjoyed when he showed, considering I like him. The weird thing is we're going to the movies on Monday. But I was so relaxed in the dream, not tense, just excited and happy. When I woke up I felt very refreshed and revived.
