I am in some kind of small western town.  There are horses in a field near a rail fence.  One horse glows purple in the setting sun, and the other orange; both have a kind of slick, shiny appearance.  I think it would be a great picture, but as I approach the fence, getting my camera ready, they turn slowly and walk off farther away.  By the time I am ready to take the picture, they are out of range, and clouds are passing over the sun.  There is a group of people in the field, and one of them, a young woman, holds a calf up.  I want to get a picture of that, too, but can't get there in time.  Then there are two guys standing on really tall stilts right beside a building with something like an open hay loft in it.  They are so tall that they are on the same level as the loft; the loft has people standing or sitting in it too.  Some people are taking pictures of that, but the sun is in my face, and when I go to get another angle, I have difficulty focusing my camera, and eventually I find that the men aren't there anymore.  It is a frustrating dream.
