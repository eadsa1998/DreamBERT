 I am riding a bicycle up and down big rolling hills. I slow down at the top of the hills and speed up at the bottom. There is a bicycle in front of me. I get close to it at times, and then slow down. There are people on the bicycle with me. The bicycle in front of me goes off the road. There are two bicycle jumps on the road: one smooth and one rigid. I want to go on the smooth route. A pool of water will be under the jump to land in.
