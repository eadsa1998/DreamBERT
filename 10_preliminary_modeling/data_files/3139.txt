I see a horde of black insects surround a person and feel terrible for them. As I walk on, they then come for me. I see them surround me and I look for help. I see the ocean and run for it; I lay down on my back in the wet sand and crawl backward trying to get into the surf. Finally I get in the water and swim. The insects are off me now and I realize I'm in big waves and deep water. I see a man, who comes to take my hand. I feel some fear because we're going under. He pulls me under and I wonder if I'll drown, and then take a breath and realize I am OK. He takes me deeper and deeper. I wonder to myself, "What I shall ask him for?" knowing this is a journey where I must ask for what I want. I decide to ask him for a relationship, someone to love and someone to love me (like wishing on a star). Now we are on the bottom and we are going past booths that sell all the junk that is tossed away into the ocean, litter. I see lots of plastic toys - interesting, but not anything I want to buy. I need to go back up to the surface and I swim up and up, finally breaking into the air, and discover I am in a deep pond and have traveled back to medieval times. A village is in a meadow and a castle up near the mountains. A prince lives there. I come out of the pond and two young men come by and think I'm a lost princess. They are giving me a tour of the place. I look over to the castle, knowing the prince will come out and maybe find me. I see a deep pit where some poor people are. I say, "What is this?" They say this is where the poor people live who don't have any home. I say, "Then I will stay here for now." They are appalled. I am too good for this place, but I feel it is the right thing for me to do at this point, while waiting for the prince to come.
