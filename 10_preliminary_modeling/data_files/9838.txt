I see Frank crying very hard about his mother; giving birth to him; he can hardly be consoled; he has to leave for Texas and then we go to visit Irene Schneider (aunt Irene??) who took her daily swim in a shallow pool of rain water near the house; very organized and very good looking; good visit. Also dreamt of being on show with Johnny Carson and telling him "I love you" next to my husband best.
