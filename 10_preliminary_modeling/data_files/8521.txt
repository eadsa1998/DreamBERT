There was a young woman with a very spirit-like quality to her. She wasn't frightening really, but could be described as evoking some sense of anxiety. There was also another person present, but I can't identify whether it was a man or a woman. The second person kept trying to approach the first, as they got near, the spirit-like woman would suddenly disappear and reappear a further distance away. This happened several times. Throughout, one of them, I think the spirit-like woman, kept calling, Tarkington. Tarkington. I think it was the name of the other person. It was somewhat dark and I believe they were outside. The last time the spirit-like woman moved she seemed to float through the wall of a building. The building was one of many along a street, side-by-side with no space between them, like you would see in a city where the business buildings are all connected. But the buildings seem to be much smaller than normal - not a size that an actual person could walk into, yet bigger than what I would describe as miniatures. The person who had been trying to approach the woman went up to the building that she seemed to float into and was peering inside, wishing they could go in.
