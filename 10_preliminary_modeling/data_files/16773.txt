I am in a building with other Academy students awaiting the beginning of the school year. Everybody has received packets of information about senior year. I was excited about taking classes at QRS. All of these really nice professors came in and talked to us. Then Mr. Stewart told me I needed to get going to tech university for my interview. I asked what he was talking about, and he said everyone who received a letter of recommendation was going to tech university for an interview in order to be eligible for some kind of award. I looked through my packets of information, and I didn't get one. (I also remember a scene where there are a lot of people in front of me, and they're all QRS professors, smiling and looking like really friendly people. I try to picture Mrs. Wright being in the crowd (for some reason) and then I see her, and she's smiling too).
