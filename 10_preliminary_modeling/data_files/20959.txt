A fellow told me after looking at race 7 that he played In Mind and he was going to win and play a bundle. They didn't care much for steel bull. The jockey's name was Frapka and a cross was in back of his name or rather following it. I was crabby at Ann and the kids, then I had some cake and milk and one of the boys said, "What a difference in you, now that after you ate," and we started to laugh.
