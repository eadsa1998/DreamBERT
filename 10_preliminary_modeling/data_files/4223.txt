["Weird bathroom again."] I am on some kind of journey. I need to pee badly. I walk down a hill, following some man, possibly black. I step down onto a cement platform covered thigh deep in snow. I pass a toilet, white with black toilet seat, hanging on a chain. I decide I'll keep looking. I am in snow up to my thighs. I wade through. Now the snow is merely a skiff on the ground. The toilet is a rectangle metal grid with a slot in the center on the cement platform. I stand over the slot, commenting I shall try and pee standing up. A rush of urine comes out and for the most part is going into the slot. But toward the end, it starts to dribble down my leg. I shift position, trying to not get it on me.
