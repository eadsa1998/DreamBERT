I'm with a group of people. Each of us lives in a carved-out cave area. A younger brother of Bob Lacote lives opposite me. A wall separates us. A bossy "mother" puts paneling (like in my office) over the lovely natural obsidian wall. I am appalled. The other brother "Bob" and I are attracted. When he visits his younger brother's cave, I can hear every word he says, and when I talk on the phone he hears me. That's how we communicate with each other.
