My wife Bonita and I were moving, or cleaning out a lot of stuff to throw away, or both.  We came across a lot of stuff I had forgotten about having and was very intrigued with, including some very large slides (about the size of newsmagazines.) of us on some vacation.  One or the other of us, or friends, were in canoes or other small boats in these pictures, alongside a sheer high bank or some manmade structure like a pavilion or monument located on the bank.  We hadn't finished going through this stuff when it was time to go to bed, or leave, or both, I'm not sure.  Anyway, that activity ceased, and I was down on the streets of the city.  It was dark, early in the morning-maybe 5 or 6 a.m.  I went into a large, almost empty first floor room in a building whose door was open, looking for breakfast.  Someone had had a party there the night before, but about the only thing left to eat was some cold pizza.  Some guy arrived just after I did, to open the place, but he didn't have anything to eat.
