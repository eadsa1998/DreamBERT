This alien girl had a container full of white powder. She had killed some people. There was a red pie with strawberries and the alien loved strawberries. The red bit was blood from some people including her mother. I told Mom about it and she was like 'meh, if this was your Mom's blood and you were eating it, it wouldn't bother you?' And I said "not really". The powder stuff was a portal to her planet? You had to put something else in it. It was all white, though some had red, but it hadn't mixed. The alien's skin came off and was scaley and hard and took the rest of it off. She went to her planet. It had those rock formations like in Enemy Mine. Then the portal was in a ship. I went there with the girl, who I think was Leilani (from chemistry) and Eugene, who was my boyfriend. They wanted alcohol but no-one had ID. I called Mom to bring some and tried to explain where the place was. There was ice-cream and one was like a giant pizza and then some single ones -- one was on a stick with chocolate 'balls'. There was a step going down and if you had the stick you would fall into another planet/world? The shop was called Greacy Bacon and the spelling annoyed me.
