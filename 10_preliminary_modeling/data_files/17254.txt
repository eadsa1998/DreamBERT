At first all I remembered was my high school friend/slight crush Bryan.  He was dressed up pretty nicely.  I remember going into the bathroom, and sitting on a motion ride.  I was supposed to go with the others, though, and got worried when it started before I could get off.  I did anyway.  It was some time after then when I saw Bryan.
