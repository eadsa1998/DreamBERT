I was in my room making outfits any everything, with some guy helping me, and the next thing I know I was in my yard at 9:00 a.m. drowning in the rain with my best friend. A car went by and my friend said that was her mom, so we better get inside and get ready to go. She started really shivering so I said fine. We tried to grab all the paper. She ran inside with a bunch of scraps of paper, well I tried to get the rest. Then my mom and dad pulled in so I ran inside and my sisters were on the couch and we started talking. Then I noticed there was muddy paw prints from my dog going up the stairs. So I thought I have to go clean it. Setting: At my house, and outside in my driveway at 9:00 in the rain. Characters: Some guy who was helping me with outfits, white, nice, I think he was my cousin. Then my best friend and me and my two sisters. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, I guess. Regular. It was very bizarre. I mean out in the rain with scraps of paper? It was so strange and it seemed so regular in the dream. It was just an out-there kind of dream.
