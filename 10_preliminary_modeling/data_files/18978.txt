I dreamt that I was with this girl that I know real well, and we were in the courthouse, downtown Miami, and we were on the elevator. We got on there, she wanted to go to a judge, this judge Tillman Pearson who I used to know during thigh school through a friend of mine. He was the guy's father. This girl, Diane, had to go see him for some reason, she didn't tell me why. We hit the top floor and looked around there, but I told her it wouldn't be the top floor because, or any other floor for that fact, because judges don't work on Saturdays.
