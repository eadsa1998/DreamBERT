Abner comes to visit me. I am sitting on my single bed. He comes and sits on it as we talk. Then he tries to come closer and I open the covers and say, "Come on in, it's OK." We lay together, still talking. We cuddle and as we talk, he lays down the opposite way and pulls me on top of him. I am sitting up looking down at him. We are talking about the V family. I say to him, "I'll probably spend the rest of my life thinking about how the V family has influenced me." The dysfunction and the ways they taught us we were not good enough through negativity. Then I say, "You don't agree with me, do you? You don't think they were bad?" He says no, he doesn't agree. I say, "I know they meant no harm. I love them and always will, but the style of communication was negative and nonsupportive." He shrugs and says he doesn't agree. Now he gets up. Somehow the nearly sexual postures we'd been in feel uncomfortable for him. He walks around.
