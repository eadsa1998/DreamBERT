I was at a shop for an excursion for school. Calvin and I were following Evelyn and Darius around and laughing. There was a machine with balls with fortune telling readings on them. They were all stuff to do with us and we got all of them out. One of them said "Eugene loves me" and there was one about Evelyn and Darius, and me and Eugene. I kept it. Barack Obama was in an aisle and someone said "Isn't that the president?". Ezra was talking to him. People were lining up and this ball shot out of the machine and this guy put them all in a bag and I was going to keep them, but he put them in a bin. We were waiting for him to leave, but he didn't (he didn't want us to get them), then when he thought we weren't looking he moved the bag. Later the guy turned the power off. Calvin and I quickly went through all the bins and I found the bag. Everyone started gathering outside and someone said Evelyn, Darius and Eugene were missing. I got a torch and said I'd find them. I heard breathing in a dark, quiet end of the store and found Tigger and Simba in a shelf. I told them to come out and I kept looking and found Gizmo, who was actually Eugene, and we all left.
