I go to a house. It is supposedly Jake's house. He's having a party. I take the opportunity to do a tour of the rooms: living room, a family room, two bedrooms. Jake comes in. He suggests we join the others in the boat. He and I get in a row boat with a small motor on it. I ask, "Are we going further out?" He says, "No. We're just going around the corner." We go around and head for a narrow cement chute that was filled with sand, not water. We slide down fast. I'm in the front. The front crashes on the cement barrier and curls the front of the boat up. This has improved the boat's capabilities. We get out and return to the house. Lots of people are there. Patricia is there with the Mexican Tony. They are kissing. I look around for Hector and can't find him. [BL]
