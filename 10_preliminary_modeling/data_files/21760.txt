Some big man punched Judy in the face. I was surprised he didn't knock her out or kill her, but he didn't. I ran after him, chasing him and at the same time throwing rocks and everything I got hold of. He climbed up on a small bank and lay there hiding. I was throwing at him and didn't seem to be able to hit him. Then he got up and came down and I was chasing him again and throwing at him. I heard or said "ancient." I parked my car on a steep grade, put on my brake and put the car in gear and the car rolled back down the grade. I couldn't hold it with the foot brake. I went on top of Swaney Lenarcic's house to fix the roof where there was a leak. I had two bolts running thru and the nuts were outside. I held the nut and Ann turned the bolt. I yelled down at her. She was turning the bolt the wrong way. I knocked on the roof to get her attention and then she turned it the right way. The roof was very dangerous. It seemed to give when it was walked on. There was a roofer laying a new tarpaper on the roof. Jack Lasko and another guy got into an argument. The other guy was a tall man. He said, "I will knock your block off". So they started to fight. Jack was jabbing him on the nose. The he gave the big guy a right on the nose and the big guy went down and the blood ran out of his nose. He got up and I thought he was going to fight more, but he said he had enough, so the fight was over. I saw snakes somehow. I can't recall now. When I parked my car, I was going to make a payment of some kind in the building.
