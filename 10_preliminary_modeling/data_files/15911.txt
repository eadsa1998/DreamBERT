I can't remember properly, but I had climbed down this almost vertical cliff side to get to this little 'beach'. I was taking photos of the water with the DSLR but the waves started coming in more violently and one knocked me down but I kept the camera in the air. I tried walking back to shore but it kept pulling me back. I made it eventually and had to climb back up with only one hand and it was really hard. I made it back up to the top after a long struggle.
