We took a walk on a farm and there were two bulls. I went around the back to avoid them, but somehow they knew, but we got acquainted and the bulls were friendly. I was finishing or helping on some work at White's. Then we were on a farm again and some policeman came around and wanted to arrest us, but I happened to be outside with my shotgun and they found out and tried to coax me to surrender, but I held my ground. Then Bob came down to where I was and rolled a big ball of string to me. I was going to throw it up and shoot at it, but it was too heavy. Barbara came by and wanted to shoot a 20 gauge gun at a target and she did. When she shot, a long flame came out of her gun and it flamed like a torch as she went to look at the target. I said, "Keep your gun up because the flame could ignite a fire." I went into the house, bit I took the mud off my shoes and I said, "I'm the only one who does that in our family."
