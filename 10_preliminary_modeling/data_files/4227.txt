["Momma is a man."] I am in a long hall in a building and I see a woman in an old fashioned black dress crawl in the window. I recognize her as my long lost mother. She had given me up at birth. I approach her, very happy to have her back. We are on a journey. Walking down hall after hall. We are looking for a restaurant. It seems that my "mother" is actually a man who loves me and he wishes to declare himself. In an appropriate place. We climb laboriously up ladders and get to a top floor to find out the restaurant is closed. I am upset and afraid of going back down. The man "mother" assists me down by a platform like elevator. We go quickly. Then we walk down more halls and find a woman in a shop. We ask her where another restaurant is because the one named "Legacy" was closed. She points down the street and says it is called "Treasure." We go outside and are not walking on the side of an Interstate freeway. Cars are coming at us and we move to get a safer path. We are approaching a bridge that crosses the California border.
