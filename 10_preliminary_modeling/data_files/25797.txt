 My high school classmate Persia Miko and some other women are doing a funny little production, including me. It is written out on a piece of paper like a personality profile, but not in content. It is all for fun. I play around and go along with it. My high school classmate Carmen Allure is there. She tells me she is now at University of Montana-Dillville for medical school, or that she planning to go to medical school after she gets out of the University of Montana. My high school classmate Anne Trapper is there. She tells me she is now at the University of Montana-Dillville and will graduate in a year. She went there because she can get it all done in a year and graduate. I see my classmate from Brimson Jimmy Youngman. He talks with me about Australia, and wants me to go with him. He says I'll have to pay the difference between my deposit for the study abroad program and the total cost of the trip. I tell him I'll already be in Australia on the study abroad program.
