["Cheating with Bill Clinton."] I am in a room with Bill Clinton. We are having an affair. I am telling him that he is cheating on his wife. He counters with and you?? I say. I'm not cheating. I am not married and if I didn't have the affair with him, he'd simply go get another woman. I am not breaking up their marriage. I'm not interested in having more of a relationship with him. I call my veterinarian for more pills for the cats. I then decide Bill could be helped with these pills. I am trying to get more for him. Then we get in a convertible, red car to drive somewhere. He is driving. I say quick, get in that middle lane. It's a freeway and we are on an entrance ramp. He makes the car leap over one lane to get there. I realize we left so quickly I forgot to pack. I left behind my pills and Bill's pills. Now we are out of the car, in a public parking garage, and walking down many steps. I suddenly realize we are going out together in public and this will cause a media frenzy. I stop and say Wait. Are you sure we should do this? He smiles and continues forward. I stop and watch. A very tall security person comes to Bill. Bill looks very short compared to him. Abnormally short. He is being escorted away, maybe even arrested. I turn and quickly go back the way we came. The police and the media are in hot pursuit. I am going against the walking traffic. I bump into people. I get to a cafe and sit. The waitress is very upset because she doesn't make much money. I offer to let them move to my town and live with me for awhile until they get a new job and get financially more secure. They hesitate and think about it.
