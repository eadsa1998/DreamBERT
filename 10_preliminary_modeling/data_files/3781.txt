I am setting the table which has an under box with dirt in it and a metal top like an old kitchen table I used to have. I have planted seeds in the dirt and I notice the plants are beginning to grow -- beans, corn, and so on. I am very impressed because I realize the plants had to have bored a hole through the metal to be there. I peek under and see that is so. Then the plants aren't plants but little boxes with labels on them to say what herbs or lotions are in them. They grow in groups of two or threes. I set a table setting on one edge and a glass of milk with a straw in it. This will be my place. Some people are helping me move stuff into the area. They hang clothes on a wire or string over the couch by the table, but the dresses are too long so I tell them to hang those across the table edge where my place setting is, knowing that will cover over my place. Now the dresses are dream images being hung up like pictures on paper. A row of people are at each edge of the table, like a square circle. It's a dream group and they are asking me about my dream images. I start to enthusiastically tell them of the fascinating dream where these dog and wolf images were in, but one interrupts me with a story about a dream of mine he remembers with those images in it, only the picture he shows me is the animals on the side of the road, injured or dead. I try to tell him that's the wrong dream, but he won't listen. Then there's another question, and I answer saying proudly that I hope someday to create a dream center here, and they interrupt me talking and talking. No one is listening to me at all. I feel frustrated.
