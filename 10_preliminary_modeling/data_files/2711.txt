I'm in a house. I go upstairs to find a place to sleep. I lay down on the floor and try to sleep. I am aware it is hard and uncomfortable. I have no blanket and know I'll get cold later. I feel sexual and encourage an orgasm. It feels good and I try to make it last. Then Nate walks in. We don't talk. We make love. He leaves. Then I decide to get up and go to the next room where there's a bed and covers where I can be comfortable. As I prepare to get in bed, Lydia's littlest girls all come running in wanting permission and money to go to the store and buy soda pop. I say, "No!" Then I notice they are all eating candy. One girl has a baby and holds her roughly by her hair. I rescue it and hold her in my arms. She's like a dolly, only alive. I realize it's 8 o'clock am and they haven't had breakfast yet. I'm tired because I haven't slept much. The radio had been playing loud and I'd tried to turn down the volume with no luck and so I'm tired, but the girls need a nutritious breakfast so I get up to fix it. Now I'm at Mary's house to visit. I hear her inside so I open the door and call to her. She's in the shower. I walk on in and see lots of women there. First I see Jennifer H. She's wearing a fake mustache like Groucho Marx or Charlie Chaplin. Then I see who all the women are. It's a dress-up party. They are all lesbians. Some women cut bits of their own hair and glued them to their mouths for their mustache. I look around, feeling out of place.
