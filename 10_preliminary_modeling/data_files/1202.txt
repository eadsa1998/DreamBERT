I am watching two young boys around ten years old, one white, one black. It's been a marathon struggle for hours. They are resisting merging. Then suddenly they both smile and I feel great joy because they'd become so weary they permitted the merger. They are sitting side by side on a bench and look at each other as they speak in unison because they now know each other's thoughts and operate as one. Then a woman sits beside me on my left. She reaches out and touches my shoulder. A dark haired woman suddenly sits between us and she touches my knee. There is a slight hint of sexual overtone, but not much. A disabled man, with short legs and small feet with his arm propped up on a brace, is sitting to my right. He's discussing his sexual problems. Mabel stands before us and says, "Just like that Dr. Virginia Lee. She takes uteruses out for no reason." I send the dark haired woman away because she grabs my big toe and pinches my sore spot. I scream with the pain. I am angry at her because there is no pain until she hurts me and she hurts me because I reject her. Then I'm crying and I feel so sad. I say, "I've lost Ellie because all I do is talk about my pain."
