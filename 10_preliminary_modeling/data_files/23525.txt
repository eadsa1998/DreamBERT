I was sharing an apartment with Candy. It was pretty sparsely furnished -- mostly with her stuff. Some other friends were visiting. Then we went to court -- it was crowded there -- because it turned out Donald was convicted of murder. We wanted to visit him in prison. Then we were outside in an industrial area. I was leading everyone else. I was riding a skateboard with bare feet. I figured out how to brake without hurting my feet. I went past a group of people and saw Ellen. I waved to her. She waved back but looked like she didn't recognize me. I was excited and when Candy caught up to me I told her about Ellen and how she weaves baskets. Candy was interested in learning basket weaving. Then I skateboarded ahead again. I was very proud of my skateboarding skill. I'd gotten so good at it and I'd never been able to do it before. I jumped over cracks in the sidewalk and sent the skateboard ahead of me and then caught it again. Then I almost got hit by two cars and the skateboard went down the gutter drain at the corner. I heard it rolling away. I saw a tunnel in the gutter drain and went in. There were obvious signs of habitation -- a brick floor had been made and there was some furnishings. Like a school or childcare center or some kind of office or meeting place. But the skateboard had gone down a passage with a low ceiling and fallen debris blocking the way. I had to crawl to get it. After I got the skateboard I found it was lodged in place and splintered. I got it dislodged but when I tried to go back, I found the passage even lower than before and it was going to be very difficult to get out.
