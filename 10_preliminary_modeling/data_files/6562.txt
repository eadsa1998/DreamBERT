G. and R. suddenly appear on small steamer in Chengtu. Leaving in a few hours. Miss C hurries to accompany them! I go up to dress for school but all her things are in my -------  so can't find mine and get dressed in time. Then a catholic service in our chapel. Chapel has a gallery and  adjourning rooms open into it. Rushing here and there after chairs. Crowds of foreign children present.
