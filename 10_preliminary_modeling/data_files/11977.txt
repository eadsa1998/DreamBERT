I was at a shop. At first I was at an internet cafe with Ezra and Jayson, but I had no time left, so Mom and I went to the shop. There was an ice-cream shop and I was having a look and my tooth started hurting. I found Mom and I pulled my tooth out and it was a baby tooth. Farrah was on the floor being annoying. I didn't get an ice-cream. I was then at home in the bathroom and the doors were closed. Farrah and people from school were there too and we were hiding. Someone knocked on the door, so one girl was trying to get him away, and then I had to get rid of someone else. Later, a vet came; he was odd and was wearing weird clothes. I tried to tell him I didn't think any of our animals were sick but he decided to have a look anyway.
