I have just gotten out of the car at the top of a long terrace, rather like the one in front of the Stermes' house in River City, only not quite as steep.  There is a river or stream or something at the foot of it, with a group of 8-10 people sitting at its edge and others milling around but rather scattered out.  Tyrone Bevels is at the top of the terrace, and as I pass him he throws a firecracker into the midst of the crowd of people and it goes off.  I turn around and lunge at him.  As we grapple, he says he meant to just throw it near them, but I feel that even that was a smart-aleck trick that could have hurt someone, and it doesn't appease me any.  Suddenly he lifts me in the air and throws me toward the river.  I feel the sensation of flying.  I don't know whether to land in the water and get wet, or on land and possibly get hurt.  I figure I will be humiliated, but I land in the water's edge and clamber back up the bank toward him.  This time, after a short scuffle, I have him high over my head and am just about ready to throw him with all my might (I am surprised by his lightness), but he apologizes and begs to be put down, so I just toss him down at my feet, rather heavily.
