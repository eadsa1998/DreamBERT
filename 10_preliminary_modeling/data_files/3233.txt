A group of women meet every Friday. It's a neat group, interesting, creative. Mabel is one of them. I bring a young woman in a manual wheelchair to be included in the group. I am impressed with her. She is intelligent, humane and creative. I had not asked them ahead of time, so she is with me at the meeting where I ask them to include her. The group seems unsure and resistant. Mabel suggests she go and join her own kind of group (disabled). I fire up in defense and point put how she is intelligent and so on and would be an asset to this group. Mabel asks me "Is she a lesbian?" I am surprised at the question and then ponder. I answer, "I don't know. I don't think so. She doesn't look or act like one."
