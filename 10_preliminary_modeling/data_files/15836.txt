I went to a cinema to see Kingsman again, just to rewatch the church scene [saw it yesterday, loved the church scene]. I was in the cinema, and a teenage girl was annoying me. I moved seats and she moved behind me and kicked the seat giggling and ran back up. She did something else and I maybe hit her, but we went to the cinema manager and I told him about something she'd done that she wasn't allowed to and she got a warning and that was the end of it. Then she was Farrah. We went outside and Valerie was there too. She was being friendly. My car was like this little bike with like helicopter blades and my car engine could be moved so my car engine was in it. I got in and flew up but then something went weird and it went back to the ground and then I saw fire, so I got out and it exploded, killing Valerie and setting fire to everything around it. It spread quickly to this bush area.
