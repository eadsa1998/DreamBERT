I was coloring cups golden color. There were steeples in the cups. Helen L. and another girl came to me in the shop and I made a donation for a cause. I had a large board leaning on the fence. It fell and I said, "It's lucky no kids were here." Then I leaned it on the fence so it wouldn't fall and it knocked the fence over down. A dog was barking at a butcher, so he threw a lot of meat on the ground for the dog. The dog smelled the meat and didn't harm the butcher. I saw a name ending in ette.
