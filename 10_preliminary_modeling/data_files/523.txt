The newspaper where I work is moving out of a building on the highway. We are getting things out and the new owners, a couple of gay guys, show up. One lights a cigarette and I lose my voice and get an asthma attack. I leave and hear one of them making nasty remarks about me. It is dark and I am alone. I walk down a hill and see a car coming. It is Ellen, an older friend, coming to check on the progress of the building but she can go no further because the road ends. Her daughter is with her. Apparently there had been a teen place near the road and it was shut off to keep them from going any further. Ellen remarks about "not wanting to let us go further." I try to talk and gradually my voice comes back. I begin to feel like I was faking it. Then some people show up and are concerned with why Ellen can't get to the building. One is the partner of the gay guy. He remarks about being concerned over my troubles and implies his partner is a bore. He says he hopes to do something to get Ellen on her way before the other guy shows up.
