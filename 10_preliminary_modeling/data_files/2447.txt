I am a woman athlete and go to the shower room. The men resent me. I try to ignore them. I am the only woman there. I go into a shower stall and look back out. I see a row of naked men, taking showers. I only see their back sides. I pull my plastic shower curtain closed, but it won't stay closed and I keep fiddling with it. I start to take off my clothes, some guy pulls open my curtain and I feel exposed and angry. A group of women march in, angry at me for being different. One woman says, "Some one has to get the dinner." I challenge her and say, "Dinner! Again, dinner. Do you have a food fetish?" I am snide. She takes offense and we walk toward each other, hands raised like boxers about to strike. We face each other and she backs down and walks away. Another woman says, "We'll march with you," and I say "Thanks, but let me take my trousers off first." I do so and we march for women's rights.
