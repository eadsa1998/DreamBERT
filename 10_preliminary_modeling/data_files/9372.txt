I'm at a lecture hall - a round room in a library near my house. There is a circle of chairs, all empty except me and an unknown woman. My books are under the chair. A thin, pretty woman about 30-40 comes by and invites me to the gym of the YWCA nearby. "I'm going to exercise." I walk onto the gym floor in my ordinary clothes and shoes and she slides by on her back in a bathing suit. It looks as if talcum powder is on her to make it slippery. I adore her energy and courage. "Let's have a test of strength by pushing against, hand to hand." Suddenly she is naked, almost as tall as I and I admire her nakedness. Suddenly another naked woman comes between us--short, plump. I see her back only. She turns slowly and it is a young man. I leave immediately to retrieve my books in the round room. It has filled with women about my age, 60 to 80. I can't find my books under the chair. Just as I see them, and wonder how to get them, the dream ends.
