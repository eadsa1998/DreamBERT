 I'm at a small airport. My sister Ramona and others are there. The occasion seems to be in Ramona's honor. I'm then at home with a group of people including my friend Nate Nelling, ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, Ramona, and others. This is a party for Ramona. Annie and Nate smoke a joint of marijuana. It's long and think: skinner than a pencil. I want to be included in this, and they pass me the joint after a little bit. I take a huge, long breath as I inhale through the joint. We're in the garage. They both react to the size of my hit. When we're done I run around and do something nutty, making Annie laugh. The reason I smoke is to be a part of their experience, and to nonchalantly show Annie that I partake in some vices. I say that we've got a couple hours, and should have some drinks and then just relax. We're being pretty loud. Ramona is upstairs, and yells down for us to be quiet, which puts a damper on our festivities, since it's her party and we'll listen to her.
