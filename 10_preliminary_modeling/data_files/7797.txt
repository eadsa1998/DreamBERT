I was driving through my mother's hometown. I had a young girl with me. I think she was African American. We came home and we were getting ready for bed. She ran into this bedroom a couple of times to this old woman to say goodnight. Where we were sleeping was surrounded by bookshelves. Some of the bookshelves formed like a square with just a little entryway. I was sleeping inside there and she was sleeping on the other side of one of the bookshelves. I gave her my blue sleeping bag and told her she could use it either as a sleeping bag or a comforter. She had hoped she would get to sleep on a bed and I told her no. I told her to go into the other bedroom and get a pillow off the bed to use. She brought those out and then she went into the older woman's bedroom again to say goodnight one more time. I kept telling her she had to be very quiet.
