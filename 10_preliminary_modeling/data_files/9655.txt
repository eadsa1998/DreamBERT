At a wedding: see Father Andrew chanting; then I leave the service to call for kids; then I return and I say, "he needs more choir boys... needs more help"... suddenly he gets pale and red and interrupts the service; he yells at kids: breaks out in cold sweat: Father Andrew reels and almost faints: I help him over to a bed, I fan him and give him a glass of water; my heart beats wildly; afraid; I listen to his heart: "You will be O.K." And then he recovers, and returns and finishes the wedding ceremony.
