I dreamed I was working for the FEC, and they had a little room like we're in now, and it was over the place where they put the trains. The reason the trains were blowing up was because once they messed with the trains, it was hard to put out the fire once they had been started. The station I was in got blown up. The explosion blew the, I was in bed and the bed underneath absorbed the explosion kind of and just almost blew me out of the building.
