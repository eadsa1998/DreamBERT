Mom was trying to wake me up and it took ages for me to wake up. I went to McDonald's and there weren't many parking sports. There was a wheelchair. I found a Sims 2 book. Dmitri was driving a motorized thing up the escalator. There were jewelry stacks piled up and positioned so that it was easy to knock them over, so when people knocked them over they had to pay for them. I dreamt I was waking up. Mom went in my bed and was hugging and kissing me, so I woke up. Calvin was there? Ezra was being annoying.
