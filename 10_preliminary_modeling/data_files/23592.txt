Nick, his wife, Linda, and I are sitting/lying on my bed. We're all on top of the covers. I'm in the center on my stomach, Nick is to my left, his wife is to my right and they are both lying on their sides facing me. Linda is sitting somewhat behind me. We are looking at their wedding photos. His wife is talking and is very nice. Nick keeps looking at me. He asks me if I have any children. I tell him no. "When do you plan on having kids?" he asks. "This is a good time, you would be a good mother." His wife begins to talk about it too. I'm looking at their wedding pictures. The reception was in this large glass hall overlooking the night scene in LA. Nick is wearing a blue suit. My hand is underneath the photos and Nick puts his hand there and touches mine. I didn't move away. I look at him. His face has changed so much from the last time we met. His eyes are smaller and his mouth and nose are different too. Nick and I talked in low voices. I wanted to ask about Betty, but didn't want to make him angry.
