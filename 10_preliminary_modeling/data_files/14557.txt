I was with Calvin, Silas, Elijah and Theodore somewhere. We had been chased through a forest along with heaps of others. We got to some shops and exchanged $10 for a "$5 note and coins". Calls were $8.70 but I didn't have enough money and I had no credit. We went to a bus stop and waited. The sign was on the ground. I asked if it went to Midvale and Silas said it did. I said I didn't know how to catch a bus and he laughed at me and I said that I could take the train and bus to university but I didn't know how to take it anywhere else. We saw the bus coming. I got my wallet out and the front of my SmartRider had come off (it was just blank and white). I thought that was odd, but it still worked. Calvin went to the back of the bus and it was a big bus. I went with him. Everyone else sat in random places. Sawyer (Lost) was on a chair that had wheels next to the row of seats in front of us. He kept slipping and had to hold on. I accidentally nudged his foot. There was some silence and I was trying not to laugh.
