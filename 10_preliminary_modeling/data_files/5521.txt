I worked in a very small, mom-and-pop store. The shelves were very well stocked and I waited on several customers and then it became some kind of a night club I guess because there was a line of female exotic dancers led by a male dancer all of them dressed in really fancy skirts and tops, and they came out and began to dance in a single line and it was very acceptable in my dream, it was apparently part of a show that this store put on for customers. But when they turned around and danced with their backs to the audience, the women and the man were all naked to the waste. He was very brawny a lot of hair on his chest, very muscular, I can't remember his face at all if I saw it. The women's breasts were coming out from under their arms, were down at their navel very, very peculiar looking breasts, and from there I was in a long room, looking up at a kind of cage, quite a way above my head, but I could have reached it if I had stretched. It had a glass front and was perhaps 3 feet long and perhaps a foot deep. And there were things inside it which I had to get. On the left side there was a bright yellow something which I had to reach inside and get but curled near it was a huge reptile of some sort. Probably a circumference of 20 inches at least around his middle, very, very frightening and I drew my hand back and when I did, it startled him and he came out of the cage it did not have a grid over it. It fell to the floor and became 2 very, very small hippopotami and they were very small and very menacing, and they began to chase me and I was frightened and finally, the room wasn't that big except there was a flight of stairs facing out of it and I decided to turn and face them and I turned around and gave them both a good kick. And they started to bleed, one from the mouth and one from under his chin and they were very subdued and tried to climb the flight of stairs, but because of their kicking injuries, they were unable.
