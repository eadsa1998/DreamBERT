There was a cop or guard situation, or a crime had just happened.  There was a long road at night, with a square building by it, up a slight incline.  I was heavily involved in the situation.  Two kids had been left outside, on a blanket or something, across from the building.  I was mad about it, when I saw them, because they were not being watched.  I was more mad because they could have escaped since they weren't watched, than because something bad could happen to them.  I was in the woods with someone.  It was near night.  I saw a deer peeking out from a half-hidden hole or trap in the ground.  It moved a little, and I noticed it.  It was shot but not dead, and I was surprised, I thought it would be dead.  I told my male companion - shoot it so it won't suffer any more.  He did.  Then he said - this was one I shot earlier, not the later deer I told you about that I shot.  I then realized - "He hunts for fun, and does not eat the animals he kills."  Because he had left this deer behind, and it wasn't even the one I had been told about, meaning there were maybe even more than I thought, out here suffering.  He had given me the impression that he hunted only what he ate.  I was not happy about discovering this, like it was a lie.
