[1997-06-06] I dreamed of a married couple that I really know and they were visiting in my home. I was sitting with a lady Peggy and Donald, I could hear in another room something about how he would like a cold beer and I realized that all of the beer that I had in the house was warm and I did say to Peggy "Did she mind if I asked Don to go to the store and just get some cold beer?" She got so upset! To console her I reached out to stroke her hair. It was long, I could feel it, and it was permed and my feeling in the dream was complete puzzlement at her reaction to a simple request about the store.
