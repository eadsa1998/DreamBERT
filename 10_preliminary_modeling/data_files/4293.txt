["A lovely many roomed house."] I am visiting a house I may rent or buy. I first check out the bathroom which is being remodeled. I see a large room, but a narrow doorway. I see an accessible toilet, then when I get in, it is an old inaccessible toilet with a sink over it. The man says he will have that all fixed if I move in. I walk down a hall and more and more rooms are seen. I turn left and another long hall, this time some steps up. They say they will ramp that but we'd lose some space in the kitchen. I walk through the kitchen, then the dining room and then a lovely living room. I return ad see the dining room has only a table and a refrigerator. I wonder why the refrige isn't in the kitchen. I decide if we make the dining room and the kitchen one room, we can fit the ramp. I go back to look at the living room. Lovely furniture, large made with beautiful woods. The woman reminds me that the beautiful furniture is hers and won't stay in the house after I move in. I wonder if then the rooms will look quite ordinary then. I am now sitting in a "room" which actually is a road with traffic passing through. The road seems to pass through my house. At one edge. I return into the house proper and see yet another little alcove room which is quite lovely. Neon art work. She turns them on so I can see them work.
