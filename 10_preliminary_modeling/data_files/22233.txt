I don't remember well, but I think I was in a forest. I wasn't hiding; I was just observing what went on there. I didn't feel any emotions. I observed how two men fought a duel. According to their clothing, I was in the eighteenth century. It was then that one of them killed the other, and got on his horse and went into the forest. He hadn't gone very far when a man came from behind and stuck a knife in his back. Then he stole a sword that he had hanging from the mount of his horse.
