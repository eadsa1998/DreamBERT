I was on a highway in a car and was being chased by someone. Another person of my age was with me. We figured that we could get to a certain house before the individual who was chasing us could. At this point some thought came into my head about a motor cycle but I was unable to remember what it was about. We beat this person or persons to the house. In this room there were several other people who I knew. The group was made up of boys and girls my age. We sat there with some revolvers and waited for the men to arrive. My revolver was shaped like a cigarette lighter. When the men arrived everyone gave up their guns except me. I thought that I better keep mine in case of trouble.
