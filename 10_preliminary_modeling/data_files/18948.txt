There didn't seem to be much of any plot to it. It more or less just seemed like a series of impressions, what I was able to remember. It seems I was talking to one person, but there were just a number of pictures. I don't remember these pictures too well. I can remember the last two. One was a tire on a car, just a close-up of the tire spinning. I was talking to someone in the background. It was just a close-up of the tire spinning. The next picture was a station wagon, a Chrysler station wagon, green, on a turnpike. The Chrysler station wagon, I think, probably comes from my roommate's parents. They're down here and they have one. It's not green though. Theirs is a metallic gray. Perhaps the tires come from the fact that I just put tires on the car yesterday. I remember the car was full. I can't say for sure who the people in the car are.
