I was a medical surgical intern at a hospital. The cast of Grey's Anatomy were employees there as well. I had been given the assignment of leading a bypass operation on a child. The other interns were very upset that I had been given the assignment. Dr. Bailey told them that it had been given to me because she and the chief of surgery believed that I was the one most capable of it doing it successfully. The other interns didn't agree so they continued to be upset about it. There were two other surgeries in progress and I needed to wait for them to be completed before I could begin the one I was doing. I lined up my surgical team and did some other prep work, including reviewing the patient's medical records, while I was waiting. There were two male, resident doctors who were vying for my affection. I was somewhat attracted to both and was interested in each for different reasons, but I was unquestionably more interested in a relationship with one over the other. I knew I had to decide between the two and then let them both know what my decision was. I think I had been hesitating because I did like them both and enjoyed having both of them in my life, even if it was for different reasons. I just really didn't want to say goodbye to either one, but I did eventually decide to commit to the one that I knew was the right choice for me and then told them both about my decision. The one I chose wanted to rub it in to the other. I didn't like that. There was a heated discussion between a resident doctor and one or more of the other interns. It wasn't related to the surgery I was going to be doing. While I was waiting I went to look in on a patient that was seems to be there for someone else's surgery, as though we needed him to help us with treating someone else. It seems to be similar to being a plasma donor but it's more involved than that.
