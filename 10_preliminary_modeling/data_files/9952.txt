I receive 2 letters from Edward. He says he is moving to Wales. I help him pack his things: a salt shaker (old); a pair of shoes (that fit nicely into his bag); I give him a plastic diamond like the one kids make in Jr. High; -- We are in N.Y.C. and I am afraid the skyscraper will fall but am not worried.
