I dreamed I was a noble of some sort and there was this big ceremony which involved presenting all the young virgins of the kingdom to the king or something like that, or presenting some of them anyway. I had sort of a place of honor in that I got to sit at a table at the foot of the king's throne, except as it turned out, the throne was built on a stairway and the king sat on top, and I sort of sat to the side and in back of it a little bit. There was another stairway going down too. I had to give my sister-in-law to the king and she had been selected as fairest of all or something and she had to go first. So the time came and the king was on his throne and I had to go over and get Bonnie. Everyone was dressed in very royal type clothes. I had to get Bonnie, who was laying not exactly on a pedestal, but she was laying in a horizontal fashion in this, lying rather, and I picked her up and carried her over to the throne. The king by now had taken off his jacket and was wearing a white shirt and tie underneath, but it was still kind of fancy. He was sitting down on the back of the stairs and I had to lay Bonnie down on top of him. He then picked her up and went off to his private rooms with her while everybody cheered. I was kind of upset. I thought the whole thing was kind of barbaric. I sat down on these stairs below the stairs there that were the throne and was very upset and cried a little, I think. Then finally Bonnie was back and the king was on his throne again. I asked her how she was, then I asked her how she liked it, and she said she liked it very much. But she was a little dazed and confused and hardly knew what happened. My feelings were mixed between jealousy and gladness that she found sex enjoyable. She didn't look too much like Bonnie. She looked like my wife in many ways. I suggested something to her about going out of there or something like that, but I don't think she wanted to or it didn't matter to her, and that's about the end of it.
