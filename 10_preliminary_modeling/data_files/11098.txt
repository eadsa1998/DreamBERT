Dream took place in the registrar's office. I was trying to see what they could do for me because I broke my glasses. The people in the office were very unsympathetic to me. I kept dreaming of all the money it would cost to get new ones. Because I can't see without them, I kept worrying about how I would get my studying done. The person I talked to was a lady with pointed ears and a dog's nose. All this time I seemed to be looking up to a high desk.
