It was a beautiful sunny day. My whole group organized a picnic. We were nine couples. The girls took care of the food. Once lunch was finished, the boys caught us unaware and threw all of us into the river. To avenge this we started to follow them to rub their faces with watermelon, but it was impossible for us to catch any of them because they were at a great distance from us. I awoke with a jump because it was getting late for school.
