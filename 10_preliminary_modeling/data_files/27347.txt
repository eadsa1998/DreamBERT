I was attending a tea party with eight other women (all aged between 40 and 60). They were teachers from the school where I teach. The principal was also there (F-40). She was very angry with all of us teachers because we had gone to the party and left our classes alone in the rooms. But we just let her fume and we went on having a good time.
