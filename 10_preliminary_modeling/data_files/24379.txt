After driving around the town where I went to high school, I pulled into the Starbucks parking lot to find a place to write. It was near the beverage castle near a neighborhood by the gray-blue painted strip mall. The Starbucks there was new. It was open until 10:30 p.m. I tried to find a parking space. A Porsche had snuck in and taken one. I backed out and just found another one. A girl from high school I knew but didn't want to talk to was pulling out in an old pickup truck. She was one of those who tried, but has a shitty career and would do nothing but whine about it and then I'd feel bad talking about "everything I'd been up to". I went in and a girl started talking to me as I was leaving after she stepped on my foot. Sorry, she said. Then she glanced back. Are you here for the fundraiser? A fundraiser-looking cosmetics sales thing was going on inside the Starbucks with a joint area, like those combo taco bells/kfcs. No, I'm a reporter, I said. I work for a newspaper. She was impressed and acted like she knew me. I went outside and then somebody's mom from high school came up and started talking to me. Though I didn't remember her and had forgotten her name. She was a hot mom, however. She then started to pitch her charity/fundraiser. I listened along to be polite and pretended to be curious.
