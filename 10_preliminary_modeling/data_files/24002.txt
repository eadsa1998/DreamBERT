I was surfing on this longboard and I was going really fast. I couldn't see anything in front of me √ê just the water, my board, and my feet. The water was really clear, like blue glass. I could see all the pretty plants and corals on the sea floor. I was in very shallow water my whole ride there and I was hanging ten. The only thing was that I was my brother. But I was also me. It was kind of confusing. Anyhow, all of a sudden this big shadow came up and I knew it was a shark. He had a grin on his face, but I couldn't see him. I could just barely see his shadow out of the corner of my eye, and I was trying to get away from him or he'd eat my toes. I was trying to go as fast as I could to get to shore, but I wasn't really scared, just kind of calm and anxious. I never knew if I got to the shore or not because it kind of just faded away.
