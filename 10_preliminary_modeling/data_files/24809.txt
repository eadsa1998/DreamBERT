All I can remember is a piece of paper. I think in the dream I was taking notes in a class. I was bored and doodling this picture on the paper. The paper looked like an eye. Setting: A classroom. Characters: I can't remember any. Feelings and Thoughts: Can't remember. I wish I could remember more. I know more happened.
