I was entered in a beauty contest and I had gotten a wonderful dress, and shoes, and gloves...but my mom's and dad's cars were in the shop. I was panicked. I called up a family friend, Karen, and she and her daughters, Satahi and Amron, came right over. We zipped over to the rec center where the contest was being held. I won the contest and I won an all--expense--paid round trip to Hawaii, first class. Setting: At home and at the rec center. Characters: My mom, my dad, Karen (a family friend), and Karen's daughters Satahi and Amron. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. I didn't know what it meant. Maybe I am going to be in a beauty contest.
