I was really horny and messaging people off Craigslist for sex. Eventually I went over to some guy's house and had sex with him. The next day I was at home (I think, it was completely different), sitting with Tristan, Frederick and a guy that I think was a close friend or family member of Frederick's. He said something suggesting Frederick should sleep with me and Frederick said 'I don't want to sleep with her, I've tried but she's unresponsive'. The guy said something like 'I don't know, sometimes you don't even take your shoes off' (ie, you don't try very hard) and I looked away, blushing. I was talking to Frederick later trying to suggest I was interested and wondering whether to tell him that I slept with someone else. There was a Facebook chat with me, Bryce and Percy. Some guy joined it somehow getting it from like Craigslist and was saying sex things to me. I deleted the guy and then Percy and Bryce.
