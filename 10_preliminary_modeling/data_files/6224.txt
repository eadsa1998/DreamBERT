Last night's dream I was climbing a mountain with some friends. The further we climbed the further it looked like we had to go to get to the top. We kept climbing and were getting very tired. It started raining. It was very refreshing, but the rocks were getting very slippery. One of my friends fell. We looked down and lost sight of him through the clouds. We all freaked out but we had to keep climbing. There was a tangle in my rope and I had to take it off. As I was doing this I slipped and fell. I was falling and I woke up by jumping up. I was sweating heavily.
