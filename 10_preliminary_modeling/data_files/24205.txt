Jordan, an ex-boyfriend of my former girlfriend Annie, invited me over to his house. He was far more docile and timid than I remember. He wasn't angry. Just told me to watch out--to be sure I really knew her before I got any deeper. That she was the type to lead guys on, and mess with them. Then I went to go check her out. She was staying back in her place in the north. In my head, it was a nearby university town, but more rural. I went around campus, checking around. I'd rented a minivan -- to carry all my stuff. For some reason, I brought all my essentials. Then I got an e-mail -- I just read it. It felt like it was beamed into my head or onto a sheet of paper right in my hands that I was reading. She said she wanted my sperm. And that if she were a sperm, she would want to be inside my warm body and then have it swim into hers. She's crazy like that, I admitted. I couldn't get a hold of her all day, like in real life. So I went to go pack up my mini van. But apparently, the one I loaded up with my stuff was the wrong one. It had been sketchily commandeered by a Chinese businessman and his associate and his driver. The driver was going to the airport. It felt like another country. It was like $50 a mile for rental and gas. I felt sick thinking of the miles rolling past -- and that I had left the minivan, the one I rented, back at the college part of town. We stopped to get gas at a Sunoco or something or a Shell on a busy strip filled with fast-food strip malls near the airport. I called Annie. I finally got through. There was laughing in the background. Her tone was like, "Hello? ohhh, Hi.... yeah, I'm having fun right now -- what do you want?" I asked her to pick me up. She sounded hesitant, like she couldn't. Then, I woke up.
