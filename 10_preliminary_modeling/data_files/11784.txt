This ship with teenagers on it sank. All the men were going to die, but most of the girls stayed with their boyfriends. One pretty girl left. Our S &amp; E class was going on a field trip. Kallie, Moira, two others and I were in the bus. Teacher-F-07 went to get something and Kallie started driving the bus. She started going up a hill with everyone screaming, then she let it roll back, but the bus tipped right and we screamed more and hurt ourselves but Teacher-F-07 saw and only rushed to see if Kallie was alright.
