Now I'm in the audience waiting for the show to start. Our main headliner star isn't going to show up, so a band starts up with music and I go up to pinch hit for the missing star. I sing well and then get into a blues song and the musicians really groove. I impress everyone. Then they continue and I get off the stage, get my jeep and drive it around so I can be closer to the stage, parking in an (obvious) no parking zone! I go back up on stage to sing.
