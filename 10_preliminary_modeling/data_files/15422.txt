Something had made me and someone else see everything bigger. We could also see these floating islands in the air. We were in a forest. We did something and ended up on a spaceship where I did something. Later I had to do the same thing again but I couldn't remember it exactly. Ezra wondered if they wiped my memory. Dad was talking about Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson and said it seemed like they didn't like mess as they wore suits everywhere. They had a new live show.
