I was in Haydn Hall, in the snack bar. Girls were selling tickets. One of the girls at the table was a friend of mine. Joan was a freshman. I saw a ring on her finger, but at first thought nothing of it. As I looked at the ring, I finally realized she was engaged. I went up to her and wished her the best of everything. I looked at the ring, which was not small or large, but very pretty and unusual. It looked more like a costume ring than a regular engagement ring. We talked about her future plans. She said that she and her fiance, who was a Beta, were planning on getting married in August. I, at this point, for the first time, noticed her Beta pin and tried to recall when she got pinned. I told her how lucky she was to be getting married and complained about the fact that it would be at least 2 years before I could get married. At this time more people seemed to be coming in Haydn for lunch. Several of my classmates were seated around a table. It seemed as if I was involved in the conversation with the people from my own class and was at the same time trying to learn from Joan if she would be back to school next year. I was interested because I thought the girl was very nice and would be a terrific asset to my sorority.
