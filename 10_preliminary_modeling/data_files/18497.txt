My father had built us a swimming pool. It was called a swimming pool but really it was just a muddy pond with a rickety bridge over it, more like a big puddle, really. The government said we had to have a drainage system, so my father rigged one up. He rigged up electric rollers, like in the darkroom, connected to an extension cord. The suckhole at the bottom of the lake was run by a vacuum system with a big heavy window frame. The cord got wrapped around the fan blades. I was trying to get it untangled so the filter system would work in our new 'swimming pool' because I knew we needed a drain and filter for healthy swimming. The water came up to my neck and finally I had to wait for the detective to help me get the filter system going. My aunt Dianne was dying and Elizabeth was alive and she was saying (that) the ladies had forgiven Dianne for sleeping with their husbands because she was on her deathbed. Their forgiveness made her calm enough to get very nervous about the fan blades. The lady then gave a test and rated you on readiness and though I could play the Mozart piece I could not keep the broken crayons off the floor around my desk. Papers were wadded up and sticking out of my desk and the floor around my desk needed sweeping bad. Finally a lady tested us on order, neatness and handwriting and then she told me to just go listen to music and draw. The desks were in a circle. I had long hair and I had gotten 3 wads of bubble gum stuck in my hair; separate wads, in the back, underneath, where it's all thick, and I had to cut it out with scissors, finally, because it was too matted up to do anything else.
