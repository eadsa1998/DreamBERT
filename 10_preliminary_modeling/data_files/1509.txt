Patricia and I go for a ride in a horse-drawn buggy. It has a top and I'd feel for the fringe on top, but no fringe. The horse trotted noisily. Patricia drove. We passed a house and Patricia said, "He's up there." I didn't know he lived here (her boyfriend). I didn't believe that it was a coincidence. We stop and she gets out and tells me to hold the reins. I do, but the horse won't mind me and keeps creeping forward, no matter how hard I pull on the reins. Then we see a big barn that has a garage sale going on inside. Now it's a small dog at the end of the long reins, dragging me around the store. I see books, videos, record sets. I ask to hear the record book and see that it is warped. I feel glad I didn't buy it sight unseen.
