 I'm in the Uptown Mall parking lot near Main Street in Oak Valley. I have driven my mom's car here. There is a hill going up to Main Street. On the hills are balls. Most of the balls are ping-pong balls, but some are golf balls. There are 15 balls, originally. There are more balls, then, and the goal is to throw the balls into a cup, which is then a barrel. Some other guys and a woman are there. We all try to throw balls in the big barrel. Two of the guys like the singer Tom Chochrane, and they sing his songs. One man throws a ball and nearly hits a Juicy Poultry Corporation station wagon that is on Main Street. We all run away. I can't find the car. Two men are talking about a stock or fund investment worth 6.7 million dollars, and what to do with it. I see a kid I know from Brimson named Josh, and his father. My mom flags me down; she needs the car.
