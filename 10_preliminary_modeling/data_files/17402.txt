I was in my boyfriend Jeremy's neighborhood.  Playing video games in the garage when his uncle or a renter or someone pulls up in a red convertible.  About Jeremy's luxurious house, with a huge wall-size aquarium, and getting a needle off of one of the large shark-fishes.  I met his brother Jeff's new girlfriend, a girl named Ann Veu.
