I was with my mother.  I looked at the clock and saw that it was 3.  I guess I thought it was Wednesday, because I was mad at her for making me miss my interview.  My brother Stuart was there and so I was complaining to him about it.  I think we talked a little about our conflict, and we couldn't really remember why we were mad at each other, or something.  Wherever we were, which looked like the shoreline trails, surrounded by marshy water, I was still trying to get to the interview.  We stopped in a restaurant and asked an old man to use his phone, and he was too excited about having a job at the restaurant with his grandson, who was about twelve.  I was jealous of the boy and not happy for the old man; he was wasting my time and not helping.  My mother's college friend Colleen was a restaurant owner as well.  Then there was a lion on the road and my mother thought it was a threat to me, so she tried to run it off the road with her car.
