In my dream I seemed to be in bed in a strange bedroom. Sitting in the chair in the corner of the room was a man who seemed to be quite familiar to me, but I did not know his name. His face was very kind, attractive, and I wasn't afraid of him. He was watching me while I tried to make up my mind whether to take the 3 capsules which I had in my hand. I don't recall the color of the 2, but the 3rd one was a bright red capsule, and looked to me like a Seconal capsule (a strong sedative) which I know from past experience that I am very allergic to it-it makes me quite sick. After deliberating, and knowing that I shouldn't, I did swallow all 3 of the capsules, and seemed to feel extreme confidence in the man who had given them to me.
