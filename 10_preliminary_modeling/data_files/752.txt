I had another strange dream, about kittens. The 3rd one. This one, I gave birth to 1 dozen kittens for their mother. I called her over. She moved them to a drawer nest, one bright orange one, one yellow one. I said they would be mine. The rest would be given away. They were cute, fuzzy, and playful. There was a puppy in this dream too. Strange. What does this symbolize to me? [BL]
