["My Mother's knife"]  I am driving back and forth along a wide sidewalk in a 1983 Chevy. It looks like a 1950's car, a convertible. Some young man asks about the car. He likes it. Now I turn the corner to the right and go in a house. My brother Jake is there. He picks up a sharp paring knife. I tell him that's my favorite knife. It has the tip of the blade broken off. I remember it was Mother's knife. I look at the knife again. The tip is back in place. I throw it at the wall and it sticks in. I was just putting it somewhere so I could find it again.
