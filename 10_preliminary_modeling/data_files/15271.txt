I was pregnant and on my honeymoon. I was about 5 months pregnant and had five kids. I had sex with the guy at some point. There was a bed somewhere in an open area. Danny Devito was there and I took a toothbrush out of the bedside table and put it in my pocket and then I left. He went to look in there when I came back. Then I was with my kids and we had a live-in nanny. Then, in an unrelated part of the dream, I was walking home late at night. It was really dark and there were others walking along the median strip. A little black kid ran past me with a gun, then turned back around and I rolled onto the ground. He shot at me and when there was no traffic, I rolled away. It was pitch black over there and I kept walking. I ended up at the train station and the next train was in 5 minutes. I got my phone out to call Mom to ask if she wanted me to get off at Centerville and she'd pick me up from there. A kid -- possibly the one from before -- gave me a ruler. I said "what's this?" and he said "a ruler is a ruler" and I replied "yeah, but why are you giving it to me?". He also told me that Kinski (Klaus) was in the bathroom and was going 'oh, oh I love you!'. It turned out he actually meant Stellan Skarsgard. I knocked on the door and we went in. He was alone. When he saw me I tried not to laugh -- we knew each other somehow. I heard a noise and went out and the whole place was covered in bubbles. It was flooded up high too? There was a guy with a dog and I took a photo. The dog was now Rover and I went up to him and took more photos. A blue van with bubbles pulled in. Mom was there now.
