I went to a cinema somewhere sort of far away. I parked in front of a wall on the opposite of the car park to where the building was. It was quiet, with only 2-3 other cars there. I brought a table and my laptop for some reason. Emmanuel was there too and we watched about 3 movies that were playing there and then I decided to go home. I walked out with the table and my bags and went walking down the carpark forgetting where I'd parked and then realising that my car wasn't there. I put the stuff down out the front and went in and told the receptionist that my car was missing. She said something like 'you must be new to this town' implying that my car had been stolen. I wondered how I was going to get home with all the extra stuff I was carrying.
