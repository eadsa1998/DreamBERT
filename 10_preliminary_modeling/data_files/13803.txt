We were at a shop, which was school and we were sitting in a group. I accidentally took a photo with my phone and it made a noise. I was sitting with Calvin. He got excited and said that Evelyn and Darius had just walked through the door together. I looked up and saw Evelyn going down to another corner and Darius coming towards the group I was with. Later I was in a clothes section. Darius was wearing that dressing gown that I liked. I went through the clothes looking for another but there weren't any others, then I saw him wearing another blue one so I went back to look again. When I saw him again he was wearing the one I liked and he had bought it. I complained to Mom and him that I'd wanted it for ages. He said "Well, it's either yours or mine". I don't know what happened after that. I saw Eugene's brother Rodney and I heard him talk and was thinking he sounded similar to Eugene (but he didn't). There was some game with a helicopter and you go to a spot and then deliver something to another spot.
