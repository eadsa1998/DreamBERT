I was with three other people I knew [can't identify in waking], driving downtown but I can't recall why. It seems we were having trouble finding the place that we were going. I told them that I remember there being a McDonald's nearby so if we can find that I can get us to the right building from there. Just as I finished saying that, I saw the McDonald's just a few blocks ahead and to my right. We were sitting in a booth at a restaurant having lunch. The place was packed. I was looking around and noticed Edward H sitting at a table with three other men. I asked the people I was with to excuse me for a minute as I got up and headed over to his table to say hello. He was sitting on the end nearest me to my left. They were chatting as I walked up. I placed my left hand on his right shoulder as I extended my right to shake his hand. He looked up and shook my hand as I said hello and said it was a pleasant surprise to see him there. He smiled and nodded his head yes but didn't say anything. I didn't know if he would recall having met me. I don't think he did, but didn't want to say that. Samuel K was there, sitting to Edward's left. Across the table from Samuel K was Morton K. Samuel K didn't say anything to me, which I thought was odd as he is the  one at that table that should have known who I was. Morton K extended his hand and said hello it was good to see me. He seemed to truly know me, which is odd since I have only spoken with him once, only as an introduction by someone else and then he had left. I shook his hand and said likewise. I don't know who the fourth person was.
