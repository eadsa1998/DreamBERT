We were going to the Beeks's house to watch a movie at 8:30. It would be over about 10:30. There were lots of things I needed to be doing. There was a clothes line pole that needed to be climbed in the back yard. There was the red wooden chest--one of the very first Coca-Cola products. Inside the red chest were beautiful pictures--b/w 8x10's of my father at about 18 years old. He was beautiful. You could tell he was an athlete first and foremost. Miss Pat said, "Do you all want to go out for a drink before the movie?" Miss Pat didn't drink. I said, "GOOD HEAVENS NO!" The thought of sitting on bar stools waiting, staring, when there were so many projects I was jump-up excited over. They brought a box to my father's station anyway. But I didn't have time. It was a nice box.
