One of my best friends (f, 20) and I were in a classroom. The teacher was one (f, 50) we both had had in junior high school. We both disliked her. She taught sewing there. In the dream she was teaching typing. It was the first day of the semester. My friend had taken the second semester of the course the previous year, while I was new to the subject, not having taken any before. Therefore, my friend had the advantage of knowing the teacher's procedures etc. We were instructed to write a heading on the paper. I made a mistake and the teacher ridiculed me. On the board was a sample of the heading we were supposed to put on our paper. It was written partly in the handwriting of a grade school child and partly in an adult's handwriting. She instructed us to do more things (forgotten now--never remembered clearly) and I did not do them correctly.
