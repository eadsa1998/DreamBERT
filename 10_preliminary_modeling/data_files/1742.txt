Then I'm on a couch and I have a little sickly duck that I sit next to the black night watch cat. There are 3 of them, black fuzzy Persians that have sharp, prominent teeth. They eat the duckling and I feel sick that I let that happen. Then I hear voices and slide down on the couch so no one can see me. I see three politicians like Haldeman, dishonest types sneaking out of a house and I listen in to their plans, hoping they don't see me.
