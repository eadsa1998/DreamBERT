I am hitch hiking on a big freeway with fences. I see a lion that would come eat me if those fences weren't there. I think to myself, "How can you hitchhike? You can hardly walk!" I agree and think that soon I'll get a ride and then it will be O.K.! A turquoise and white car with a boat on top stops. As I approach the car, I wonder if the people are safe or if they will hurt me. I realize they are safe. It's an older couple, a man, single, my age, and 2 young girls. It's a family in fact. As I get in, it becomes a trailer house. The driver, the older man, puts my luggage (a thermos bottle, yellow plastic), on the top. It lies loosely. I ask if it will be safe as some of the racks are open. He says, "Sure, no problems!" I get in. They make me feel comfortable. They offer me a drink. They ask how far I'm going. I say, "Louisville, Kentucky." They are amazed. So are they. "Ah! You must be a paleontologist," (to the driver). He agrees. I say, "So is my father. I'm meeting him there!" We talk. I mention my father has a master's. They mention proudly, "He has a doctorate!" I ask if they have a bathroom. They say, "Yes, but it isn't fixed up to use." They ask if I need to go. I say, "Yes, but I'll wait!"
