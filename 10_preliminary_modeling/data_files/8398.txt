I seem to be at PLU though it doesn't look like PLU does in waking life. I am with Matthew and Chris H. There is a row of swings. We are all talking and swinging. I am playing around and I find that as I swing I am able to make the whole frame of the swing jump forward or backward. I can make it jump forward a couple of steps. The swings are very close to where the football team is practicing. I don't know if I am still on the swing or something related to the football team teasing. One time when I do it I realize that I've maybe gone to far or gotten too close. I turn around and start to run away. They decide to run after me and tackle me. A bunch of them do and they land on top of me. There is something about being in one of the buildings and something flying around in the building. A bug or a bird maybe but it's too big to be a bug and I'm pretty sure that it's not a bird. There's also something about me working on a computer document. There is a whole list of categories or maybe a list of titles or groups of words. I'm going in and looking at changing groups of words and I'm going in and changing the description of that title or group of words.
