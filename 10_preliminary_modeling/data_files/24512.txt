I am at a dance with an attractive woman who has promised me a place to live. Our friendship is platonic. Afterwards we walk down a snowy moonlit street. We are happy and young. She puts her arm around my shoulder. "I like you," she says. "I really like you." Then we sit in her car and neck. Our kisses are sensual, giving, tender. She removes her blouse and straddles me. Outside, a small wood sign is tacked to a street lamp. Its handwritten letters state, "Kit Karson Scouts." I raise up and embrace her. "That's gold," I say. "Absolute gold." Then we make love.
