There was some show and people were in floats. Elijah, Dmitri and Seamus went past on a bus. The next day all these people were sick. This grass from this place had felt funny and tasted funny. We were then at school and this giant girl was walking around and she took funny steps. People were in costumes. There was this machine which did morphs of people. We were lining up and Calvin was in front of me. Daryl had his turn before mine. I still tried to go with him, but couldn't. Calvin got matched with Devin. We were hiding from some dude.
