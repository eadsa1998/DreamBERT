I am in a church that's sort of like black gospel but we're white. I am singing and notice the leader and I have lovely harmonic voices. We are the leaders. A small baby girl is being naughty and talking. A church member spanks her. I tell her to stop it, she is only making matters worse. I pick up the girl and hug her. She says "It's so hard to grow up," and I sigh, "I sure know what you mean." Then I put her down and we singing leaders march around singing. We stop. A black church group across the street teases us. The minister looks at our sexy evening dresses and yells, "What are you trying to do, make us throw a "mock" fit?" One woman is in a red "hooker" dress, another in a blue one. I'm in lacy white. [BL]
