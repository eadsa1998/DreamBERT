I'm at a school. I'm outside. It's time for the children to come in. Some of the boys run and play hide. I yell at them to stop playing around and get in here now! They hide in the grass. I hold an umbrella and go over and poke them. They get up, except one who doesn't move. I realize he's dead and I pick him up quickly and pull out a clod of dirt from his mouth and give him artificial respiration. He regains his breath and I yell to the boys, "Go tell Claude (my good-looking friend) so we can take him to the hospital." They run. I carry the boy and joyfully I see Claude has gotten the word and runs for a car. He meets me and we get in. The kids are all screaming that they want to come. I tell them that to be helpful they need to quiet down and back off. I pull one boy off the car. Then I look down at the boy's face in my arms. A clock sack is over his head and I say tenderly, "I saw you smile!" I feel relieved. He's going to be OK.
