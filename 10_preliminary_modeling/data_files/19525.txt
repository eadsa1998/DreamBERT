Scene laid in East Potomac Park, on golf course. Near clubhouse (just east of clubhouse) were 2 midget airplanes sailing around. 2 or 3 feet off the ground. The planes were just large enough to accommodate 1 person, and there seemed to be no motor nor wings. Shaped something like this. They were covered with this sheet metal, olive green in color. There was a small glass window on one end, and somewhere else a grating. The speed of the planes was very low and they were able to hover like a bird. One of them came directly toward me, but I was not alarmed as they were so small and light, and furthermore it seemed to me that the pilot was merely trying, in spirit of playfulness, to see how near he could come without actually striking me. I did, however, give ground -- i.e., stepped backward a short distance -- though waving to indicate to the pilot that I recognized his tactics as playful bluff. pointed out that the aviator who flew to the North Pole used a plane that could hover; I said, yes, but that most planes landed and took off at rather high speeds.
