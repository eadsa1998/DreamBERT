I was in a house, a ranch house. Paul Newman came in. We discussed what it was like when he took acting from the same teacher I am taking it from. He described doing real acting assignments in Hollywood. I was disappointed because all we do is rehearse and perform in class. I felt envious of his good experiences and sad that it still wasn't that way. As we were talking, a feeling of camaraderie developed. I then saw a flood rising outside. My rancher father was concerned because he'd have to ride out and see if it would threaten our ranch. I ran to the door and stopped him. I said, "Wait. I'm a better rider and lighter. I'll go." He refused. I said, "Are you afraid that if something happens to me, others will talk because I'm a girl and you should have gone." He muttered, "Ya." I got ready to go. I looked out the window. Water was swirling around. Paul Newman looked to the mountains and said, "It's not so bad." I drew him to the window and showed him. We were looking at the wrong place. He gave me his T-shirt to wear. It was too tight and he had to help me put it on. I was embarrassed. The water was rising and we had to escape out the window. We swam and found a high niche of ground and crawled up there. We kissed. There was a feeling of closeness. We really liked and respected each other. Then, the water receded and we had to go back. He and I were sad because we had to part. He was married and was in love with his wife. I got my horse and sloshed through the lowering water level back to the ranch alone.
