I dreamt that I was in church along with many others. We were listening to a sermon by our pastor who had just died a week ago. The choir sang a beautiful hymn, and we all applauded loudly. There was a great deal of levity and laughter, but no one seemed to remark about this case of extreme bad taste. The pastor left the pulpit and we all sat still and very quiet as if we were waiting for something else to happen.
