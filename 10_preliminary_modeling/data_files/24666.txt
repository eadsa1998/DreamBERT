I dreamed that we were at our school dance, and this man with a gun came in and put a gun to my friend's head - and then he shot her and I went to call her parents and they got there. That's all I can remember. Setting: My school. Characters: Myself, Helen, Arlie, Lynne, and more that I forget. I k now all of them and they were dancing at the time. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, sad, scared, worried, annoyed. I didn't feel good. I feel sort of mad about it and sad, but I don't like it.
