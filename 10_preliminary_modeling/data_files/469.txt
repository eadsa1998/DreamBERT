This dream is a continuation of dream 25. The spiders that were in the container seemed to be alien threats to a compound where I was staying and Carly had the baby. I could see the spiders grow and trample over flies, only leaving lifeless corpses behind. They were sucking the blood right out of them. Then I saw a giant spider, more like a monster, taking a fly and eating it. After it was done, the spider had a human expression on its face. Then I was at the house of my best friend. This house was an unfamiliar house that I didn't recognize as being my friend's house. It was as big as a mansion with a half-circular stairway leading from the upstairs to the main entryway. There was a group with me in the house. I sensed that they were up to no good. All my friends were leaving and I begged them to stay and not leave me alone with these men. Then we were all outside and these men took us hostage and were playing torture games with us. These men were throwing a big red rubber ball into a field, and if we didn't catch it, we would get shot. They threw the ball at me and I missed. I went to retrieve it, but kept on running. The leader caught up to me and backed me up against the wall of a barn and said that if I kissed him I could live. So I kissed him because I didn't want to die, but I felt guilty because I didn't  tell him about my boyfriend. Then I was in a bedroom on a bed crying, and then the leader came in with an alien who seemed to have command over the leader. These terrorists weren't fully human. The leader came closer to me and wanted to have sex. Then I told him about my boyfriend and I couldn't go on with his wishes.
