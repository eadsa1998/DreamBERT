I think it was some kind of research group who wanted people's ears. Somehow ears were being used for the good of some other people. They wanted to take them from people who were still living. I was extremely upset by this and passionately trying to get them to understand what they were doing to these people's lives by doing this, what they were doing to their senses of self, their self-esteem. I wanted them to think about how differently they will be treated by so many people, if it is noticed that one or both of their ears was sliced off. They were just slicing the ear off even with the side of the head, so there would be no protrusion left at all. I found myself doing this on what I would describe as a cadaver, but I have no image of a face or even of the rest of a body. Now I'm discussing with someone the use of a hacksaw to cut off the top part of computer tower case. I was concerned that the hacksaw he had was too delicate to be used on something as solid as a computer tower case. I thought it would work but I also thought it would be damaged as a result of that use. He went ahead and used it. There was a ridge in the design of the case, about two/thirds way up. This is where he made the cut. I was somewhere totally different now, with different people. I was told that I had to use a hole dug in the ground outside as a toilet. There was a woman that I knew, maybe Jennifer K, that I was discussing this with - how unpleasant it was. She seemed even more surprised than I at this whole situation. As we talked, I picked up a roll of toilet paper, unrolled a fairly long piece and began to somewhat fold it up to use it. I was using a lot more than I would in waking life and didn't fold it neatly as I would in waking life. The person I was talking to turned away to give me at least a little privacy as I used this toilet. We continued to talk as I finished.
