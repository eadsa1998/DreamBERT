I dreamed that all the kids from my Spain group were all in the army. We were sleeping in the bunks, and Rachel told me that Ben wanted to hook up with me, but I somehow knew he didn't. The sergeant came in and yelled at me, so then we had to wake up at 4:30 in the morning. There was a huge sandstorm, and we had to move through it, which was really scary.
