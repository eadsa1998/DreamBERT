There was a sense with the imagery that I was at a computer working on an Excel sheet. There was a list of things that at one point I realized that there were one or two things that I needed to always have at the beginning of the list because they somehow impacted the outcome of. I think maybe it was a task list. I needed to have these one or two things always at the top of the list in order to get the other things done. These one or two things were, one or the other of them were always on the list. This list was only for one person and yet there is a sense that is for me and not for me.
