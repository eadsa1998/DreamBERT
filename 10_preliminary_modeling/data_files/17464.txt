It was a dorm room.  The roommate was nice, talking about sharing things.  I remembered we still have to give notice to my housemate/landlord Andre, and that they were just finding another roommate now and they would need another and it seemed unfair.  I went out of the room to talk to my mother and get her opinion about this.  Our room was connected to a church.  My boyfriend Jeremy would hate it, and we had to go to service every morning.  I wanted out.  My research methods professor was there with burn marks of beads on her chest.  My mother had something in common with her.
