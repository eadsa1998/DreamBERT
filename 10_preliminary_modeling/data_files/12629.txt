I was at Mom's. We got some stuff together and got in the car. There was a fog. Mom thought a storm was coming and was going to kill everyone. As we were driving, the mist cleared and it looked hot. Mom thought that everyone was dead. But it turned out that the storm was ok and so was everyone else.
