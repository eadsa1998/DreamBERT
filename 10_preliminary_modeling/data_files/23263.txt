I am in an ocean liner waiting to embark on a trip somewhere.  My room is a dormitory-type accommodation, and I am trying to find something to write with.  I start going through a desk which belongs to someone else-Seth, I believe.  I am a little afraid that he will come in and find me going through his things.  The ship departs before I expect it to; it is night time, and I look out the window and see dark water rushing by below the level of the porthole.
