The setting was a house back in Rochester, NY where the family called the Crowley's used to live, but my aunt Mary was living there. In reality, she used to live across the street from this house. As I am walking up toward the house, there was a Western Union boy delivering two letters to the house next door that my aunt lived in. In reality, this was the Howland house, and one of the letters was for Kirk Howland, a boy who used to live there. They had owned a grocery store on the corner. The messenger boy lifted up one of the letters to look at it, and it seemed as if I could also see it even though I was at some distance away. One of the letters, which was for Kirk, was from some industrial firm and it seemed evident in the dream that this was containing some sort of job offer for him. I'm not sure whether the messenger boy was on a Vespa, or not, but it seemed as if he made quite a bit of noise as he arrived. As I was walking along on the sidewalk, I heard this noise behind me and moved over to the side expecting him to pass, and then he didn't. I looked back then and he was already started up toward the porch to deliver the letters. <br/
