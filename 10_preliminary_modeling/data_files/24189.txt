I was part of a team searching for terrorists who were plotting to destroy a Portuguese replica of a great city. The plot I helped foil previously involved the Brandenburg gate type columns being blown up and falling onto a nationalist shrine. This next clue was much harder. Something to do with the beach. There were hostages who knew, but couldn't or wouldn't talk. They were being systematically killed. We guessed the wrong one who would be killed, but I saw the gunman walk up, take aim and shoot a dart into the neck of one of them. He was a tall, bald Asian man in a suit. Young, with purple accents. I was wearing my pumas, so I didn't make much noise. I saw he was heading to a run-down house in the Arab sector. I ran up to him, watching my shadow as I sprinted. Then I put him in a headlock and attempted to drag him into traffic. He was strong, and when cars were about to hit him, he bended and leapt away. The people inside the house, a family of freedom fighters, ran out. They didn't want to blow their cover. The dad ran out to help the comrade and was killed. Splattered. I was dragged inside. They were old and young, men and women. A regular extended family -- people who did not look at all like terrorists. The police came and they convinced the overly soft officers that it was just a domestic disturbance and the officers left their house. They would do anything to get the attention away from them. Instead of exacting revenge, they scooped me in on their plan. I assume the result ended up in my above condition. I remember bits from the shootout, including one of their badly injured having a gun near their heart to be blasted because they were not well liked.
