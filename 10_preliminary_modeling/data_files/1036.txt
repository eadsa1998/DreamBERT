I'm at a dressing table. Kotex pads are strewn around. There is menstrual blood on the sleeves of my robe. I try to cover it with my hand. I clean up my dressing table/desk. Co-workers Josh and Pat, and other counselors come in. Someone puts music on. They dance. I get up and say, "Very interesting. I can do that. Let me show you." I scurry them off. The music is slow and sad. I dance by using my arms to gesture and by not moving my feet very much. I do, however, manage a toe stand once or twice. It's a very sad and moving dance. After, I go sit down in an easy chair. I see a big box with lots of birds flying around in it. I notice it has nothing on the front to keep the birds in. At first, the birds stay in, and then the baby quail scurries out. A big owl is standing near by and starts to dive for the baby quail. I jump up and yell. A cat goes for the baby quail. I push it away. Several of the women counselors come over and complement me on my dance. Then a man comes behind me as I'm sitting in this high backed winged chair. He has mistaken me for his wife. He calls me by her name. He wants me to come home. I tell him that he's mistaken. He won't believe me. I tell him to be careful of the swordfish that's on top of the box with the birds. I notice it has no sword and I wonder if I've misnamed it. He ignores the diversion and pursues me. He's middle-aged and pudgy. I keep pushing him away. He hugs me and pleads. I am aware that Pat is upstairs. She played the music for my dance.
