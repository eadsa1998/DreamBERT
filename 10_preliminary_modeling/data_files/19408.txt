I was parked outside my mom's house and my little girl, Cindy, was still in her car seat. I saw Alice, who used to be married to my boyfriend, Zack, come out from a house across the street. She had a gift for Cindy; it was a dress. I thought to myself, it was about time she made a gesture, being that her daughter was Cindy's half-sister and I always got gifts for her. Because she was being decent for a change, I was not mean to her. She was standing in the doorway on the passenger side, talking to Cindy, when Zack drove up. He slammed on his brakes. I ran over to his truck. He was furious. What is she doing, kissing up to you? I explained to him I was not becoming any friend of hers. Then he just started kissing me and he pulled me into the truck. He was all over me right in front of her, which was unusual.
