I dream that I was shaving, that I had a huge black beard. I was shaving, and I cut myself on the face. Blood started to run out very quickly. I stopped shaving and tried to blot the cut with powder and ointment, but the blood still came out fast. My hands and whole face were full of blood. I dunked my face in the wash bowl full of cold water. I then awoke.
