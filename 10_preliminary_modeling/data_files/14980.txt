I was at school. I sat at a bench and I was near Darius, Eugene and others. Eugene was closed to me and moved closer to make room for someone. Calvin was nearby watching. The others left and Calvin and I were talking. Eugene was standing around and I saw in the corner of my eye, that he laughed a few times at our conversation. We were talking about something and I said "and I was jizzing in my pants". Then I was playing World of Warcraft. A heap of others and I were on a ledge outside with a girl. When we were walking to a lower ledge, I said "abortion for the win". We sent the girl across some water. We all went across. There were PVP Horde around. It was a big deal when we got back.
