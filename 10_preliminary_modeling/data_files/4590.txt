["Talent on fire."] I am a young talented singer. I play the guitar in a blues style and sing. I sing on a stage. The audience loves me. A good looking bad guy is attracted to me. I don't like him. he sits at a corner table in the back. I like another man. The bad guy calls me over and flirts. I ignore him. Then I am in a building.. An oil refinery. The bad guy owns it. I need to set it on fire and burn it down. I put a drop of oil on the floor and light it. Like setting a back fire. It catches out of control and burns down the place. The good man and I run out. The bad guy chases us, angry. I run to a black car and get in and drive away at high speeds, trying to escape. I feel fear he will catch me and hurt me.
