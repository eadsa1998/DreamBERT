We were staying at a house. Fletcher had his camera and kept leaving it in places recording which was annoying us. At one point I was trying to take it to do something with it, but realised it was recording, so I took it and trimmed the video to take me out of it but as I was putting it back he came in and I tried to delete all of it saying I just wanted to play with it. Later I was watching a monitor with like live camera footage. I saw one of Cecelia and another girl hanging in a closet and I got some people and ran down. We took them down and tried to untie the knots. Cecelia was still alive, but was paralyzed (we thought perhaps temporarily, but we weren't sure and she lay crying on the bed).
