I was at home, alone, late at night. There was a party going on next door, but it was weird. People kept turning up out the front trying to get in, or going out the back. Most realised it was the wrong house and went next door. One group of people tried to break in, even after they saw me. Then there was a guy - either we were sort of friends, or he had just come to help - trying to help keep them out. There were some lollies and chocolates - it was Halloween I think - and we'd been eating some of them. I noticed this snake and large centipede thing coming out of a cupboard. I dropped a bag of M&amp;M's and they split open to reveal bugs inside. There were bugs in all of them and we were trying not to be sick. I text Mom at some point saying someone was trying to get in. Later I heard someone coming through the front door, so I grabbed a baseball bat and turned the corner and whacked the person on the head - but it was Darren, as they had come home as soon as they got my text.
