 I'm at home. There are people at the house. My friend Elise Rooks is there. We are talking. She tells me about a dream that she had. I tell her about the dream I had recently, in which she is at home, then at Armstrong High School. I tell her about the uneasy feelings between us in the dream. My friend Annette Gollum is there. She walks towards Elise and I while we are talking.
