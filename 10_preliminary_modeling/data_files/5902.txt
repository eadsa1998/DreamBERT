I am talking with someone, a stranger, about the difficulties of driving on the ocean bottom compared to driving on land. I remind him, as though I were speaking from experience, that this is not easy. Surface is rough and bumpy and one is not always able to see far ahead. I tell him it is always murky down there and a driver cannot go at all fast.
