Later, I'm in a department store. Thea is the sales lady. I'm looking at a package of something, maybe sewing patterns. She asks me to get some zippers off the rack and bring them to her. She keeps talking about how the boss keeps asking her if she needs this tool or that tool and she'd say yes and he'd buy it for her. Now she has hundreds of these zippers, she complains, and in the same breath would say, "And we need them, don't we?"
