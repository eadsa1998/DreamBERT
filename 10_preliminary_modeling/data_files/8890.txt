I was at a family event at my birth home. There are a lot of people there, so everyone must be there. I noticed something near the bottom of a tree trunk. When I bent down to see what it was I found three Easter eggs. Someone had emptied the contents of the egg with pinholes before decorating and hiding them. They were elaborately decorated. Two of them were actually stuck the tree at the end of each egg. I gently pulled them off the tree, as I didn't want to break them. I think the third one was just lying on the ground. Bev walks up to me. She is a young child, maybe 7 or 8 years old.
