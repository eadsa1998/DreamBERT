My roommate, Bill, and I went to Ft. Lauderdale at night. When we got there, we stopped at a sporting goods store. My roommate was so tired that he lay down on a sleeping bag that was on demonstration. The manager of the store came over and said he could sleep in it if he wanted--it would be great advertising. So he got some of his clothes off and went to sleep. Bill left the store and went out to the beach. Soon my roommate and I followed. There was a fat man of about 60 watching Bill and a girl he had picked up as they were in the water. He told us about a better beach that didn't have currents like the one we were at. The scene now changes and it is daytime and I am on a small motorcycle. I was going to where there was a big crowd and I was thinking something about the gear ratios he had in comparison to those in the cycle. The crowd was gathered around a fight ring. Some boys I knew from prep school were going to fight next--even though they were outclassed. After the fight (I cannot remember it or the outcome) we went to the house of a man and his wife (about 30) for coffee. I think he was a professor, perhaps for prep school.
