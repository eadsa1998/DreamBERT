I am auditioning to be a singer. I'm good. The piano player, Cory, and I are a good team. We fall in love. Years later, we are standing before an audience and telling the story of how it all started. I hug Cory and tell the audience how I snuck into the "big" auditions and was so good they had to notice. I told them how special Cory was in my life. It was a mutual admiration society.
