[1997-07-02] We were in this crowded room and it was very noisy and we were trying to find the door, trying to get out of there. There were a lot of people around, they were all, some were clapping, some were cheering and apparently it was at a concert. I must have dreamed about the concert because my son had been mentioning a couple of concerts in a row, and there was all this loud music and noise and I was trying to find the door and every wall that I came up to was just a wall and there was no door and I just kept going around in circles, around in circles and finally a security guard said "if you want to go out you have to climb out of the window." I remember trying to climb out of the window and I couldn't get out the window because the window was shut and I had to force the window open and I remember feeling the glass and the metal structure around the window. I finally got out and was walking down the road and I people were yelling and telling me I had to come back and because I paid for the tickets I would have to stay for the whole thing . It was really weird. Just as they were about to approach me, I woke up.
