The setting was like a space-oriented, semi-aquatic fallout (Fallout 3 was a game I had played recently). The setting was like a resort that had space docks for ships. I was the pilot of a ship. It was a saucer shape. I felt as if I could go anywhere and do anything with impunity. I could fight whatever giants or beasts I wanted. I could always escape, but I thought I could always win. A local girl, rough and tumble, came to me for help. I helped her, gave her direction, but it seemed as if she disobeyed the rules and ticked of a giant and ran to the safety of the resort village/spaceport overlooking the waters below. The giant chased her. It wasn't mean to begin with -- it just believed in honor and retribution. On the way back, she passed through an area that reminded me of the Korean airport. I was watching the scene unfold through her eyes. She was finally scared -- especially at having to risk drowning by diving under the water to evade the giant, which was as tall as the flimsy suspension footbridge strung across a gap in the karst cliffs over the water below. Later, as I was about to take off, she came to ask for help. But she decided she would go off on her own. I realized I wanted her to come with me, to work aboard my ship. She snidely commented that I should pay for a deckhand like anyone else. There was more -- involving going off in the hills in search of aid.
