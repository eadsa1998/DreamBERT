The only scene I can recall from my dreaming is a scene, a picture of Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. This rather innocuous scene seemed to have been kind of forced over the actual dream I was having and suppressing it so that I could not recall it. I was conscious of this mechanism working before Roger asked me to wake up.
