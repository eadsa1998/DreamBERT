Father Andrew and I are sitting on two chairs with oriental rugs thrown over them. I have asked him, if I can fill out the forms for Wendy and her husband. They got married in Church. He tells me what phrases to use. Then we go to a cheap restaurant for breakfast and he asks about Wendy's husband; he is surprised that I think highly of him. I know he approves of Wendy.
