I was at UI and had gone into E Hall to check on my classroom for an upcoming class I was going to be teaching. Another gentleman, about my age, came in for the same reason. We chatted briefly and continued to talk as we left the room because we were both headed in the same direction. He asked about my class. As I told him about my first experience with this class, I also said that I wasn't sure that the Midwest is ready for a class like this. Still, I was glad that the university had decided to give it another chance. I got lost making my way through the building, or disoriented. I stopped a woman in one of the hallways and asked for directions. As she answered me she pointed towards a glass door. As soon as she did, I turned to look and saw the parking lot. As I got to the parking lot, though, I doubted that this is where I had parked. I didn't see my car there. I finally thought I remembered where I had parked and walked around a corner of the building into another parking lot. I saw my car sitting in one of the angled parking spaced near the end of the row. When I walked up to the drivers side door, I saw a big clump of mud in the middle of the door. It was about six inches in diameter and close to an inch deep in the center. I knew a student had done this intentionally, even though they likely didn't know who owned the car. It still bothered me. I put some things in the trunk, came back around and opened the door. Now the mud was in the middle of the drivers seat. I was even more aggravated. It was still kind of wet, so I couldn't just brush it off. I reached in and began scooping it off the seat with my right hand. I did this several times, getting as much as I could. I knew I was just going to have to leave it go at that until I got home and could clean it fully.
