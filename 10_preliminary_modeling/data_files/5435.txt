I had the most ridiculous and vivid dream yesterday. I was dreaming that Kit had a girlfriend (a gorgeous blond girl) and she was sitting on his lap. We were in some room with a ton of other people watching The Office. I kept trying to be funny and make comments during the show to get his attention, but he kept rolling his eyes at me and scoffing and being generally quite icy to me. So I left because I was sick of flirting with him and getting rejected. I was walking on the street. I was with 4 other guys from my program, not specific guys, but I just knew they were on my program. They were laughing and joking and then I told them about how that guy the other week had harassed me on the street and hit me. Then they all started harassing me and grabbing and hitting me too. I freaked out and told them to stop, but they continued slapping me, so I started crying and ran up the street and straight into Jayden's arms. He hugged me and asked what was wrong. I was crying and he kissed me so hard and told me it would be okay. I was confused as to why he was kissing me when he had been pretty rude earlier. He said he hadn't wanted to flirt with me in front of his girlfriend.
