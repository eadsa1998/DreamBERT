I am seated at some conference. Maggie is there, Mabel and Orville, all co-workers. We are listening to some lectures. I am writing a story idea. Maggie suggests we do some stories and play. Then Mabel comes out and asks me to pay back what I owe her. I get my wallet out. She takes a $20. I am upset and ask her several times how much I owe her, expecting change. I am very upset at her and at the same time I realize she is right. I really do owe her the money.
