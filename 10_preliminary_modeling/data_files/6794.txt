In a large hallway with a big open staircase. On right side are a large number of black furnace doors with a foot wide brown wooden runway between them and the staircase. We are picking up. I ask what to do with an old magazine. "Put it on the fire." I open a furnace door and paper flames up reddish yellow, I put out fire. On other side of the hall. We are working. It's my part time maid's old place. "She's going to work for me all the time now", says our plump hostess. The maid whispers to me, "When's she's gone I'll tell you." I am worried but it will not be till next week and the maid will come to me on Thursday. Hostess says can put work away in drawers along under the seats on left side. Two of the same profession share a drawer. I am putting my things away, my steamer rug, a very shabby 2 _ Ft. Square yellow blanket, white rags and several small articles in e.g. pencils but look for R. to share. Ask for her.  "Oh, she went home with rose." I go to put my bag in drawer and find drawer on our hostess' bureau in the next room. So I take out my things putting small articles in my lavender housecoat pocket and return to hall to look for another drawer. I fin a rotten shelf on which people have been putting things in shoeboxes. I start to do the same but do not find any boxes.
