I was flying. I working my wings and I flew around the coke ovens in Rivertown. I saw the winner of the tropical big race yesterday and his next race aid $20. I was bolting up something and one of the bolts was bent and it would not come thru the hole. I was on the top of a plane looking down from the edge. I was making lunch. I split a piece of meat and was frying it. I was looking over my work clothes in the basement. I saw Bob Lippert lying nude beside a woman. I came over with Bob and I hit him gently on the legs and looked at his nude body and said to my Bob, "You like him first." He said yes, then no. I walked by a pond where Grandpa was sitting and I saw a snake's head sticking out of the water. I hit it with a club and down it went. I saw the rest of it as it went under water, then I hit another one and I hit a baby small one against a rock and killed him. I was operating the b and s. I thought it was quitting time, but when I looked at the clock, it was 3 p.m.
