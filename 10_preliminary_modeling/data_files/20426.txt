I was in a mental hospital. There were no bars on the windows. Above me there was a window with a pane of glass about 15 by 20 feet in size. A giant ape came and crashed through the window. The ape was wearing gloves. I was told that the ape had been hired to do that and the gloves were given to the ape to protect its hands. Then some workers came and led the ape away. Two patients slid down a rope through the broken window, and eloped from the hospital on a motorcycle. Later all the patients were lined up near the broken window and warned not to elope.
