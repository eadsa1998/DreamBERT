I am on a combat assault. Only a few of us ride in the chopper. We carry full combat gear: pack, weapon, helmet, ammo. We fly toward the Ivy Hill Apartments. From high up I see buildings, which appear like photographs. We land on a rooftop. I see my brother. At the same time I see a horrible sight. I walk toward it. The intact body of an American soldier glows like fireplace embers. His internal organs have hardened to stone and are clearly visible. I shout to my brother, "How did this happen?" He says he doesn't know. I am standing over the corpse. I can tell my brother is lying.
