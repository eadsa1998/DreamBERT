["Libeled."]  There is a large wedding happening and I am watching. Perhaps I am also the bride. A gangster kind of family.  The family is gathered around a huge square of tables and making toasts. One man, an uncle of the groom, makes elaborate grimaces as he speaks  and I watch with interest. Perhaps that is a family ritual or habit. The groom and I write a small 4 lined poem. It is amusing, about two animals, one perhaps a turtle, another perhaps a bird. We enjoyed writing it. But soon we read a critical review  of the poem. The entire family, and indeed the entire town is up in arms about this poem. They ridicule me for being wrong about the theme or premise of the poem. I didn't know my subject matter, they say. I laugh and say to someone well, they have a point. I made that mistake, but I was writing the poem from another point of view and so it didn't seem to matter for what I was trying to do. The people are unforgiving. They refuse to speak to me. I am being completely ostersized. I begin by being a big embarrassed and gradually progress to anger. I demand to see the mayor. He is upstairs in a building and refuses to see me. The secretary is rude. I finally snap and push past her walking rapidly up the stairs yelling at him that I am coming up and he will talk to me. I find him in his office and threaten to sue him for civil liberties. I tell him off.
