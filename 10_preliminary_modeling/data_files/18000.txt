My brother Stuart was holding a rack of karate belts in a wide array of colors.  Some of them were wide, thick bolts of material, some of them silk.  There were many colors.  I was talking to him about a green belt and how it somehow related to us.  I realized there wasn't a green belt in our system and wondered if all the belts were really used in various systems, and what the big wide bolts were for.  I was kind of sad and wanted to get back to karate.
