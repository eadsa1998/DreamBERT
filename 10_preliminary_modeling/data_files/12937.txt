I was at a shop and Ms Pendleton asked if I did media. She asked if Calvin and my "second best friend" did. I was like "huh?". Evelyn and Samantha were there too. I then realized she meant Samantha and said "Oh! Samantha!" There were bags there and I was looking at them. Mathea took the one I wanted. Seamus and Elijah were at the shop.
