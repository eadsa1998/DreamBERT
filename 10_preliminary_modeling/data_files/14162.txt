I was at a shop with Dad and Ezra. Dad was telling me that it was one week since he had had some dream. There had been an entrance to something and he had gone in it. I realized I was dreaming. There was a pipe thing with two entrances in it. Dad said he could see it too and he said he must be dreaming and I said 'no, I'm dreaming'. I pinched my hand and felt nothing. I got them to do the same and asked them how strong it felt and they replied with random words. For some reason, Ezra ended up chasing me and I ran into a bigger shop and he kept getting things to throw at me. First it was a kettle and it was always heavy stuff. I tried to make him stop and then tried to make the stuff disappear which didn't work, but it always missed. He threw a heater at me. I hit him with it. I ran out and there was a car parked just outside and it was unlocked so I tried to get in, but I didn't get in in time. It was actually very vivid at the time and I was thinking it was going to be a lot to write down, but was worried my poor dream recall lately might affect it (which it obviously did).
