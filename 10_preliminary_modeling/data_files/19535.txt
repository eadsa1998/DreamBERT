I am taking my tropical worsted suit to cleaners for a water wash. Proprietor said the suit couldn't be washed and read to deliver Sunday morning. That was agreeable to me, as I was in no hurry; and I first suggested that I'd stop for it Wednesday evening, or maybe wouldn't come for a week (it occurred to me this extra time would give me a chance to wear my gray suit, which had been water washed, and find whether this cleaning method was satisfactory). I then examine the trousers of my gray suit, and find them sweet to the smell (i.e., clean smell) and soft to the touch.
