We are at a resort with Chloe and ERIC and their daughter Martha; she says that she cannot sleep at nite. I tell her about ASTRORHYTHMS and that she needs to recognize her particular rhythm which may be different from the accepted day/nite rhythms; - shift: Chloe fills up a huge bathtub with water for a swimming pool for kids; the water is clear. Later I swim in a large swimming pool, but the water is dirty, filled with leaves that fell from the trees.... I want to swim in C's swimming pool.....
