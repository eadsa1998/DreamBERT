Howard and I are standing next to a car. A convertible. He wants us to have sex. I am thinking it over, wondering if after all this time, we could be happy. I pull back and say no. It won't work. He gets angry and grabs my arm and forces me over to the wall of  a house and tries to rape me violently. I hit him hard, knocking him unconscious. I then call 911. The person on the phone says there is nothing they can do since he wasn't raping me at the moment. I am angry and exclaim, Do you mean I have to wait until it is too late to get help to get help? I then see Howard regaining consciousness. I run, to grab my two children, who are very like Damian and Amelia. They think it's a game and run from me. I finally catch them, not actually finding Amelia as willing her to be there, because Howard almost gets us. I put the kids in the car and we drive away, only now I'm in the back seat and a woman is driving, telling me of a friend of hers who could help.
