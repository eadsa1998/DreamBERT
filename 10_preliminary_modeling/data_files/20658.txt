There were little girls in a park. I picked up one of them, and she felt stiff like a corpse. Later there was a flooded room. An infant was there, and was crying and saying that a snake had bitten it. I picked it up and examined the bite on its foot. I looked for a nurse. People were around. Then I wondered whether it was a boy or a girl. I started to open its clothing, but I stopped because I was embarrassed because of the people all around. I came to a nurse's office and I put it down. I wondered what I would do with it then, after the bite was treated.
