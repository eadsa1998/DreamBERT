I am supposed to pick up Sharon at about 7 or 7:30.  I have two records which I have bought for her.  One is a small 45 rpm, and the other is a long-play Gogi Grant record with a pretty red cover.  When I leave the record store, it is about 8:00, and I discover that I have forgotten the Gogi Grant record.  I go back and ask for it.  I see it in a little adjoining room, on a shelf.  The clerk goes in and gets it for me (or so I believe).  When I leave again, however, I discover she has given me the wrong one, and so I go back again.  I am getting really nervous as I watch the hands of the clock move.  The store is open, but the clerk is not there, and the place feels mysterious.  I look frantically everywhere but can't find the record.  Somehow I get Sharon.  We were supposed to see South Pacific, but it is already about 9:30.  Then, either at the shop or at Jimmy Creagar's house-the former, I think-I find a man and a woman dead and each slumped across a chair.  They really look terrible:  their faces are gray and starting to rot-all the usual horror movie stuff.  I tell Sharon "There's no use in us going to the show now."  The time by now is about 10:00.
