I went to Mass or some special service and I walked into church just as Father and the servers were walking to the back of the church to start Mass. I stood there for a minute and debated whether or not to go ahead of them and get a seat or wait for them to walk to the sanctuary and then follow behind them and get a seat. As they came back they headed out into the foyer so everyone started getting out of their seats and going into the foyer. I did the same. When I got into the foyer I debated whether to stop by the doors so that when we were ready to go back in I could get a seat where I wanted easier or if I should walk across to the other side of the foyer and still be one of the last ones in. That way I wouldn't risk taking the seat of someone who had been there before me. I finally decided to cross over to the far side of the foyer and be one of the last ones in.
