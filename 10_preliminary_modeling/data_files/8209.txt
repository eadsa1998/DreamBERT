We were going to get my mother a saxophone so she could learn to play. I wondered if it would be too difficult for her, strengthening the cheek muscles and such for playing a wind instrument, because of her age. I don't know why it would be. I thought that maybe if she had a saxophone I could relearn how to play the clarinet and we could practice together every day.
