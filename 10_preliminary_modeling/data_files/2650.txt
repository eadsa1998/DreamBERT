Ginny gives me a present, her old weights which are flat and rectangular. We are amiably chatting as she gives them to me, and I put one on my feet and try to do a leg lift. The feet, because they are crooked, move and I keep dropping the weights. I keep trying, aware that I am overdue for the exercise. Then she goes to fix lunch and I step into the bathroom to pee. As I pull down my pants, I notice the toilet bowl is starting to overflow slowly. I decide to pee anyway. As I am peeing, Ernie opens the door. He has to go pee and is waiting his turn. His pants are down around his knees. He stands out there telling me about this experience he had at work. I'm a little amazed he'd be that open and casual with me and I'm a little embarrassed to be caught peeing into an overflowing toilet, but we chat like nothing unusual is happening. He says he made a mistake in his PR presentation which he presented on the other company's film machine which had a mistake in it. I sympathized, "Just like being caught in a do loop," I say. He agrees. I get done and get up and he goes over to pee. I apologize for the messy overflow and he accepts it fine. I go into the bedroom. Ginny is calling to us to hurry and join her for lunch. I look at myself in the mirror and see my new weights are now a red bra I wear over my regular one and it's seen through my blouse, which is white and a bit crumpled. Ernie and I seem to be wearing a similar outfit. White shirt/blouse, beige slacks. I try to tidy up my appearance, but feel a little inadequate and embarrassed.
