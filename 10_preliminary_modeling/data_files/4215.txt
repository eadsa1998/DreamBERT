["Selfish woman dies, Judge Judy watches."] A boy is standing looking at a pretty blonde woman seated in front of him. Above them both is a TV ghost image of Judge Judy watching the scene. The boy is asking for some liquid the woman has in a bottle for his mother. She needs it. The blonde woman is dramatically measuring some out for her into a smaller bottle. Then the woman suddenly starts gasping for air. He then sits still waiting, then she clutches her heart and has a spasm leaping out of her chair and disappearing dramatically behind the chair.
