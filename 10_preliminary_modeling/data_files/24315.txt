Driving around Thailand. Going to the bad end of the town. I meet a tall girl from my university alma mater and her mom. I'd met them randomly and offered to help. They're meeting me on the other side of the river. I was going to go first and check it out. Only way to get across is by floating/fording. The man had a black dog that brought people over with a small bark log raft. He swam it to us on the dock. We had to go one at a time. I wasn't sure it was safe, but went with it. I was wearing my white American apparel shirt, black shorts, and had my gear in a waterproof bag. I jumped in the water no problem. Halfway across, a ferryman took over from the dog and quickly rammed the thing through the water with a pole. We arrived at the dock and talked money. I thought he wanted 300 for each. I said, yeah, right. Then I said 25. He explained how that would leave him with nothing. Again, I thought he was talking individually. I gave him two 50s -- though they looked counterfeit that I got from Cambodia. He didn't seem to mind. I waited for the others to come back across, but they went to the gift shop to get clothes that could get wet. Across here was "The New World", owned by a big guy who was the boss of all these people. A female warrior chick on the other side explained to me how he wasn't a bad guy, but had issues. How he married a woman for money, divorced her, and invested everything in this operation. He didn't like what she had -- money.
