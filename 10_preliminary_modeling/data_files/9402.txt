I am at the University, walking through tunnels, underground catacombs. All students have to go through them, sort of a safety measure. I come out to a class in French drama and sit very high up, looking down where I see a French woman actress; I want to be like her. After class I meet a woman friend who thanks me for being such a good friend.
