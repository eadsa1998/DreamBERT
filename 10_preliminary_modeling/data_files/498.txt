I am riding in the back seat of a large, old car which reminds me of a bus. In the beginning of the dream I am in the town where I grew up. There are some ladies from the local nursing home in the car. My (adult) son is a baby in the dream and is with me. A huge snowplow truck is passing us and I realize that the car is moving - not the truck. I feel very weak but I move the visors on the car and the head rest and I climb over the back seat. My legs are very weak, but I manage to stop the car. The car is now on a highway in my present town. Two of the elderly ladies in the car were wrestling. One is small and one is large. The small one know she doesn't have a chance but stands up to the large one anyway, saying she always gets put on the seat or the floor and that is embarrassing. After this the car starts to move again.
