Ezra sent me a message to help him prepare for "CAR men's" birthday. I went to see him and questioned him about it. It was a guy he met on the internet? He was also chatting to people for 'sex' which was a joke and some joke about 'the 9 year old inside me' which was some pedophile site. I had email from the guy before. I had makeup for Ezra and was putting stripes on him. There was this Alain Delon movie similar to La Piscine, but a suspicious cop got to the woman. She got him to confess. They were in a bedroom and were on tape. There was also this movie with Romy Schneider and Tom Hanks.
