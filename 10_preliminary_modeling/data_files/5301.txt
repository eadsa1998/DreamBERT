I had a dream that I was in some sort of basement with the rest of the sailing team. Some of the boys were arguing over which one my mother liked better. I was explaining to Andrea where I had bought my jewelry, when Caleb whisked me up and carried me up to my room, asking which of them my mother liked better. I said I didn't know, and he started dancing with me. I then saw Sue up the stairs, and she asked me if I wanted to go for a run. Then I woke up.
