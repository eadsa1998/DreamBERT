We are visiting Eli and Rhonda at their mountain home; To get there we had to go along a NARROW ledge, covered with cinders. I glide along very fast and arrive at their home to find that their architect friends are planning an addition to Eli's house. Wendy wants to help by putting down TILES on a floor, one of her special projects. I tell her to hire a tile layer and not to get her hands dirty. Frank is in another room talking on the TELEPHONE - a long conversation; I get a bit angry at him, although he sits close to me and tries to fondle my breast. I bite his ring finger lightly (!) and say "Enough, is enough." Then he tells me that one of his lady friends is coming to spend two days with us; I ask where she will spend the night and he points to the couch; I say "There are too many people in this house"; Then Frank brings me an embroidered vest that has red hearts and flowers on it in many colors. I feel reconciled.
