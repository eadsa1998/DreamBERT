 I am biking on my old little red Huffy bike down 26th Ave in Wilmerton towards Scott Junior High. It's nearly pitch black and the stars are marvelous. I can't see the road at all and am worried that I'll hit a big pothole and flip over. But I'm not paying attention to the road anyways. I cross Roundabout Way and as I do Elise Rooks drives by in her blue car. I want to yell to her but I don't. I think about going out to my girlfriend Annie's house even though I know she's at school. I can see the constellation Orion really well.
