I was at the shops and it was busy. Nana was there, but she was going senile or something and kept staring into the distance or would just walk off. I kept losing her. We went down to the carpark and I tried to get her to stay in the car. Then I was home, but it was different. There was a pink and nicely decorated letter at the door for me. It was from Zander. I then had a 6 year old daughter, which I'd had with Zander -- we had had sex at school and I'd had an abortion by taking a bunch of pills, but somehow the kid came back. Some guy was wearing a shirt from The Mercenary. I thought it was cool and was talking to him outside.
