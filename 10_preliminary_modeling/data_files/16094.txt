I was back in Spain and that I was with Kendra, Theresa, Hannah and Norah. And I had bought a suit case for somebody over there, probably myself, but I don't remember. And I was rolling it around on the cart and Kendra, Norah and Theresa were helping me roll it. And we were staying in this theater place, and everybody else was in a family-type place, and I was with Kendra and she was helping me roll this thing around. And I had to cross this main___? To get outside _____?_____, and [laugh] this dumb tape. Anyway, _____ found these steep stairs and she picked up the whole cart and was carrying it down, and it got steeper and steeper as we went down, and all of a sudden it turned into a swimming pool instead of a stage area and we were trying to cross with this cart thing. And the girls were, I sat down on the side because I couldn't go any further, and I said, "Could you please help me?" and finally somebody came. And there was this Spanish guy and he swam me across. And finally we got out of the water and we were walking beside the pool; it was dark time. And they were still rolling the cart for me. We were going for the bus, and I told Mrs. Hollander about the incident, and she said, "I knew something was going to go wrong. I just knew it." Just the way she is. And then I woke up.
