I am at a sort of hotel, but it's where my family lives. The relatives are coming over. I offer them juices to drink. I say, "Orange? cranberry? grape?" They don't like the cranberry suggestion. I go into my mother's room to find the juices to make (frozen juices). I am also looking for the script of American Woman because I want to share that with my relatives. They weren't at the reading last night. I can only find the first few pages and the end page. I remember I have the video and can show them that. I say to Patricia, "Don't worry. We'll set it up in two different rooms so only those that want to see it will; the rest we can entertain in other ways." I am going to go down the stairs and see an elevator and then see a glass French door to another area of the hotel. I realize I want to go there and see what that part is like. I go in and see I am standing on a sort of balcony looking down over a huge, beautiful room that has a waterfall where the huge fireplace area would be. The sound is beautiful. I feel the balcony area wobble and shake. I lay down on the floor to balance it. I feel it is important to be there and balance, listening to the beauty of the waterfall. I return to the main room and see a cousin, male. I say to him, "I want to share with you this special place I found." He is spiritual and agrees. I see another male and invite him to join us. I say, "I forgot your name; no, I remember, it is Erik Erickson." They have both written books about their particular New Age spiritual feelings, and are open to the wonders I want to show them; or at least they wouldn't laugh at me. They agree to come with me to the balcony in the other room to look at the waterfall. Other relatives wander around, Aunt Naomi, cousin Patricia, cousin Lenny. They do not understand. I know that and it is all right. I'm not asking them to join or to understand.
