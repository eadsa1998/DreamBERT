I am in a house. A man comes in. He and I used to be lovers and then I gave him to another woman. He's looking for her. She won't answer his letters. He misses her. I talk to him and encourage him to keep trying. She comes in and I try to talk her into giving him more time. I think about taking him back. Then I leave the house. A group of older women had just left and are together gossiping. I don't feel like I belong with them. I walk on, alone. I'm trying to get to my house (old M City House),  and walk up a dirt path. I see a man leading a cow, which then meows. I tease him about, "What kind of animal is it really?" It then looks like a goat. I turn left and walk across a field to my house.
