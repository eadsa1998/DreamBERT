I somehow accidentally created zombie spiders which multiplied quickly and could explode and basically caused the end of the world. It was an idea I'd had that someone tested and it worked too well. They would explode and multiply, and so on. From when it began, it was only minutes until it would destroy the planet. Tristan was like 'tell us who you find attractive at the Technical College' and I said 'Judah' and he was just like oh and then the world ended.
