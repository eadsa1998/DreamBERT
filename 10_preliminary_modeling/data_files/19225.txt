I was with someone driving in a dark parking lot. Everything was in full color. We were in a high-speed chase. It felt like some sort of action movie. We jumped from balcony to balcony, we ran, and at one point we ran right past the cops that were also chasing these criminals. It was like a never-ending chase. Sometimes we would get back into the car and cruise in the parking lot, making sharp turns and going up and down parking ramps. I couldn't see who we were chasing though. It was exciting. The setting felt like a huge shopping center, at night.
