 I wait for my dad outside the courthouse in Wilmerton. I back my truck up and part it. Elmer and Shannon Mohs are waiting in a truck in the parking lot too. I'm going to a movie with my dad and my sister Ramona. Ramona and I have a movie picked out. The three of us walk across the bridge over the Main River downtown. It is a metal grate bridge. My dad wants to see the movie "Pincushion". We have heard it's good, so we agree to go. We have sometime before the movie, so we're going to the Dairy Queen nearby in my brother Wally's car. I'm in a mall-like restaurant/hotel-like place. My mom and Ramona have come to clean up my sister Heather's cat's mess at the hotel. Heather wanted a cat for her birthday. She is at work, and can't take care of it. There is shredded paper and urine in the fountain of the hotel that needs to be cleaned up. There is a formal gathering occurring there. I empty a garbage can containing green class. A man tells me to be quiet because of the gathering. I am quiet. I tell my mom I think she has given Heather too many chances. I take the trash to throw it away in rooms that have signs on the outside that say "Open". Two very short ladies go to use the bathroom. Along the walls are photographs and drawings of northern pike's mouths with the whole fish in the background. There are some men painting in the mall. They ask me no questions when I toss out the garbage.
