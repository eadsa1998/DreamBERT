This dream concerns an artist friend of my husband's. He is an old friend, and he and my husband. have known each other since they were children. He is about 25 years old. The dream itself is short--only a fragment. In my dreams, I was this friend standing and looking over the shoulder of a fellow art student who was painting a picture. I felt rather puzzled at seeing him at art school and back in C--, as I knew he had graduated from art school this September and had received a position as a commercial artist in C-- to where he moved with his wife just several weeks ago. When I asked him why he was here, he said that he disliked C-- and his job and preferred going to school. For that reason he came back. I felt happy about the fact that he returned.
