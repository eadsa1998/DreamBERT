I dreamed that I was desperate. I wanted to achieve something superhuman. It didn't have a shape; it wasn't material. It was something deep, with a lot of light, but far away. I wanted to reach it, to know what I was pursuing. I got close to it, but never reached it. I always had the same amount to go, as though I hadn't moved at all. It ended when I awoke in the morning.
