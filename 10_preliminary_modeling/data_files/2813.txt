Ellie is looking into a mirror and talking about herself. I am annoyed at her; what a self centered person! I walk away. My dream voice says in disgust, "Are you really going to wait until 9:30 or 10:00 to write this down? You'll lose too much." (I do wait and lose most of it all.) There is a General, a woman who has some information. I need to exonerate myself from some trouble I got myself into. She brings me the disks, 3.5 size computer disks. I feel cagey, not totally open to her. She asks me to reimburse her for the costs of the disks. I am the wife of me and I say, "Of course, we'll find the money somehow." Me/the husband says, "Good wife," but me/he feels somehow betrayed by the General's self-interest there, even though it was appropriate.
