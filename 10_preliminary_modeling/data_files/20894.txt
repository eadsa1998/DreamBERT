I was walking with some woman. I had been there before. We passed certain landmarks. There were paths, trees, distant buildings, several stories high. The woman with me was young. I wanted to see her hips. She was shy. Later she said she had bruised herself on her buttocks, and she pulled down her panties and showed me the bruise.
