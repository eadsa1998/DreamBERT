 I'm in my truck. I follow my friend's father Phillip Hacker as we leave my grandparents the Redding's farm. We drive towards the town of Farmington. It if very foggy and I have trouble seeing his call all the time, and am afraid that he'll lose me. It is early morning. We drive through a cornfield. I just keep driving. We ride bicycles through an old west town, flipping over a deck of a porch or something. I am then in a restaurant. I talk with a prostitute, as I'm a bit drunk. I drink and joke with her, playing around. The prostitute and I site in a booth. There is a letter from my brother Wally to my mom on the table, and some other Hanson family artifacts, including photographs, one of which is of a big northern pike.
