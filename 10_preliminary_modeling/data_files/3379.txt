Mirabelle is walking and we are going to the park and talking about her having a baby. I see I am on a motorcycle racetrack thing, a dirt bike kind of track. I get back on the road. I go to my doctor's office to get my file. I have some questions. I take my file with me. It is full and I realize I never even asked permission to take the file. Now I am looking through the file and decide to call the nurse and tell them I have it. I see the Dream Group is forming in the other room and they are starting the dream work. I want to be in there and realize I don't have to make this call. I hang up. I look outside and see rain clouds, dark, thick, heavy ones all around. It is an ominous, powerful sky. I enter the dream room and suddenly I am consumed by a fierce, powerful force. It wells up from within me. I am expanding, ferocious and somewhat alien. Claude sees this and stands back in awe. I am all powerful and I grab his shirt front and pull him up to me (he was sitting on the floor) and say, "I'll make love to you later." I plop him back down and survey the room.
