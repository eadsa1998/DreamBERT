 I'm at a funeral home. I'm with a group of people. We get a tour. We see the embalming room. My friend Niles Zelling is in the group. We are led to a room with many books. Our classmate Pauline Davies is there. I look at a book by _ _ Jung, whose first initials may be B. O.. I think this is another author named Jung, or the same one using B instead of R as the first initial. I go up and down stairs and end up back in the entrance of the funeral home.
