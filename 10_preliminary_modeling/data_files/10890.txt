I was walking down Euclid Ave. near 105th. I then found myself in a building. There was a room with a counter and a woman behind it (like a counter in a department store). There was a door with 4 members on it. I was supposed to get married in the room. I spoke to my dad on the phone, telling him to come to the wedding at 8:30 p.m. He told me he was wondering about if he should bring an extra tie or go home after and change his tie because he was going to see South Pacific afterwards and would get his tie stained at the wedding. He told me if I needed anything, I should ask the woman. She took me into the room off of which was a bathroom. She showed me the bathtub and handed me the soap. As I was washing, my boyfriend and my economics teacher came into the bathroom. I remember it was 8:10 and I wondered if we'd be ready on time.
