A man drives by in a car and I don't like him. I call out belligerently that he is stupid and ugly. He slows up and turns around and I know he's big and strong and he's going to beat me up. I keep on deliberately approaching him and insulting him. There is a direct confrontation. He and I fight. Another man joins in. I pinch their balls and punch and kick. They hit me a lot too. Finally, I walk away bruised, but at least I held my own.
