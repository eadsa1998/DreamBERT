It was dark out, and I was in my back yard. I think that there was a dance going on, because there was loud music playing. Then a bunch of kids from my school come in my yard, and start dancing. I danced with a boy I like. I danced with a few people, until everyone starts to leave. I rush into my house, because for some reason I didn't want my parents to know there was a party in my back yard. Setting: In my back yard at about 8:00 at night. Characters: Me, a bunch of kids from my school, my best friend, and a boy from my school that I kind of like. I danced with him. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. We had a dance a lot like it earlier in the school year, but it was at school and inside.
