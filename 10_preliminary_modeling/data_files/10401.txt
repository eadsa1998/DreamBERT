I am flying in a airplane, sitting between Wendy and Frank. The plane is huge: like an auditorium. Lots of old ladies are watching a stupid game show. I go to the bathroom and have to lie down to pee. Then we land very softly in San Francisco at a sandy spot in front of a theatre that looks like the Ordway in S. City. Someone says not to worry.
