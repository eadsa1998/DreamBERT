My brother Stuart and I both were moving, and it seemed competitive.  People kept packing things for me that I would have preferred not to take.  I was stressed and anxious and frustrated.  I had to stop and give my mother and my maternal Grandma Jane hugs to apologize for my frustrations.  Things seemed almost like an obstacle course with small narrow pathways.  At one part I picked up my Exile CDs and sort of worried about the mud on them.  I walked into some volunteer clinic for animals.  The lady stuck the tip of her finger in my vagina and told me the ferrets would like me.  I peed and gave it to the ferrets to drink.
