I was reading about the Arrested Development movie. Michael Cera had said he wasn't going to do it, presumably because he thought he could do better. I was like "how can you do better than Arrested Development? It's the third best show ever... and that's pushing it" (as in, the top 3 are all so good, it's hard to make them lower than the other). There weren't any comments from David Cross at all. There was a character called Gaius. I was talking to this guy (I was me, but different) because I wanted to get into some film group. He mentioned something and I said that "I'm not wanting to sound like Battlestar Galactica" but he refused. Someone said something and shot all others (it's hard to read). There was a list of high rated TV shows and Felicity was on there with a picture of Keri Russell. The show worked like, she would write in her diary and there was a voiceover and that was pretty much it.
