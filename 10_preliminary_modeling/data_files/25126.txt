 I'm with a group of men including my dad, my basketball coach Jackson Shooter, my friends Nate Nelling, Simon Naver, and maybe Simon's father. We are going to play a game of basketball. I notice that Coach Shooter has a beard. I tell him it looks good. He doesn't think so, though. There are three age groups with prizes. My dad is putting on long white socks with red stripes and red and white hi-top shoes. The game is in a small racquetball-like room. There is some stuff in the room we'll have to move. My dad talks and jokes with me about the last time we all had a big basketball game. I guess there is a big 6'8" guy and I beat him last time. My dad says, "You turned his head into his neck", which is I guess, my dad's weird way of saying I played well against him.
