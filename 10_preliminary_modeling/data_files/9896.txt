I am to go on a boat cruise on a lake, near E. Town. I see a map where designs are drawn to show the similarity of our location to that of E. Town. I see a boat and am the last to get on the boat. I mount it like a horse. Then go downstairs and start writing postcards and a diary; write one to the Retreat Center in gold ink. -- We are walking along a highway. I fall behind and see a young girl, wife of leader, inhaling medicine, like Frank's asthma medicine. She has "brain damage?" She and her daughter must return. This leaves only 4 or 5 of us, but we trudge on, like TV news and I am tired and confused and angry. Also I lose my diary and postcards, and see them rolling away, like a little cart, along the highway, way ahead of me. I cannot catch up.
