I am with Frank and Zena; Father Andrew is not celebrating the liturgy: I sit in the back with Calotts. Then Father Andrew comes in later; he looks exactly like my father; he wears glasses but no shirt; I touch his back where he said it hurt; I help him; he is very friendly; I tell him I did not overreact.
