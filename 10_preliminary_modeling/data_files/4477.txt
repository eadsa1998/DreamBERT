["Baby potty seat."] I am sitting on a baby potty seat. I have a large gravelly bowel movement. I am sitting outside in public. People are around. A male old high school acquaintance comes by. He wants to chat. I am embarrassed. I try to wipe myself and put a paper over the mess. I try to hide myself by keeping him in front of me so he can't see.
