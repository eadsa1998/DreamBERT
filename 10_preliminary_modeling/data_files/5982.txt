I look out from my house onto the back yard and notice that the small dead tree in the middle of the yard that I was planning to chop down is already chopped down. My brother X., who is staying for a while at my place, announces, "I chopped it down. I wanted to surprise you." I feel very disappointed because I had been planning for a long time to do it myself.
