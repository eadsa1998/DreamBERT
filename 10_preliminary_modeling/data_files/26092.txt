 I arrive home. My friends Kevin Simpson and Jose Ramos live at my house. They are having a party later tonight. It's early now: 8:00 pm. I look around the house. My mom has left a note on the stove saying that my neighbor Mrs. Shelly needs food and money. My mom wants my roommate Stephen Ramos and I to go over and see Mrs. Shelly tomorrow morning. I'm with Kevin and Stephen in a house I don't recognize. It may be my or Kevin's house. We walk through it and talk. I talk to Kevin about his girlfriend. She has her period. I say they should have sex and he should just wash his sheets, which I know are dark green. I think this because he needs to wash he sheets anyway! Kevin has a book on the man who started making Busch Light beer. At the beginning of the book, the beer bottles have orange labels. There is a funeral in the book next, and then the man who started Busch Light beer.
