I was in a transport airplane (army transport). I was in the rear of the fuselage next to the door. The airplane seemed to be out of control. I don't know how I knew this because it was flying perfectly. I just knew it was out of control and I was overwhelmed by fear. I was unable to go forward to the pilot's compartment or to move around at all. I was just gripped by this fear. I awoke too frightened to go back to sleep immediately.
