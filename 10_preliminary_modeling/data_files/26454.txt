 I'm at my dad's old house in the living room. There is a basketball awards ceremony taking place for my Armstrong High School team. One player is awarded a big award, a certificate. He is either my teammate Larry Rollie or Shawn Salzburg. The award is a certificate redeemable for $60 cash. Something has happened, and at this ceremony the award has been divided into three awards: three $20 certificates. I am called, as well as another player, to receive these. Basketball players and their parents are there.
