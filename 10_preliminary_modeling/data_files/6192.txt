In this dream I am lost in a jungle and am walking along when I see this huge object. The object looks like the side of a bloated tick or the side of a huge gray submarine. This object is towering over the trees. I remember feeling afraid of it but going closer anyway. When I am close to it the side splits vertically. A huge elephant comes running out at me. I get out of the way and proceed to watch all sorts of wild animals run through. I think I walked through the split after the animals went through and I'm in my old hgh school. I can see myself screaming at my ex-girlfriend for something, which I have never done. I remember seeing all my friends but they were just staring into space.
