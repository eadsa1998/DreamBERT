["Where's the accessible bathroom?"] I am in a large public bathroom. I need to go and I am looking for the accessible toilet. I walk past all the stalls and can't find one. I decide I don't really have to go and leave the bathroom. There are both men and women in there. It is crowded. I wander the halls of this college looking for another bathroom.
