I was on the road to Clinton. I had to go to the health department there and pick out some paper work. I was not afraid of a drug test. They let me pick out 2 other peoples forms there, so I could be more people if I wanted to. One was "Dan" and I couldn't even read the writing. One was a stranger. It was a long road back to Laurens and I wondered, if I drank the coffee, where I could go to the bathroom on the way home. There was a very steep hill. Midway down was Veronica. She was wearing an elegant black cape with a beautiful curved deep neckline. From the edges of the shoulders and trimmed in beautiful soft fur like a fur boa almost. I wanted to take her picture. I had one shot left in the camera. I had a present for Veronica. A little yellow chair with an Eiffel tower in it. She liked it. I'd taken the last picture and a boy was gonna let me ride his bicycle down the hill and take pictures of me but there was no film left. My mother was doing room inspection and I was afraid the lady would come back and get me. I had left my camera with Veronica and forgotten about it.
