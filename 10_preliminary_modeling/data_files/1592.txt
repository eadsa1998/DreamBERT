I am asked to act out an improv where I am an elderly person and I am humorous like not hearing correctly and responding differently. It makes someone chuckle. Later someone asks me what kinds of problems do the elderly have. I sigh at their innocence and ignorance and say, "Just like the disabled." And I list some problems.
