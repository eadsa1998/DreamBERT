Group of people, built a home, garage, shower, woods, one special man. I went to take a shower in my birth home. There was all kinds of stuff in there. Many other non-family members had used the shower but left things lying in the tub. I was thinking that they should pick up after themselves. That someone should say something to them. I went out to the far right corner of the woods and climbed over the fence. A whole group of people did this.
