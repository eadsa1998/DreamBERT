I was at some creepy place near Nana's, I think. Dad, Ezra, Jayson and I went there. Ezra, Jayson and I were in the same room (it was like a little house). There were 4 single beds. The fourth one was going to be occupied by Christopher Ryan. From left to right the beds went mine, Christopher Ryan, Jayson, Ezra. Everyone kept referring to Christopher Ryan as Dave Hedgehog. Then I was back at home. I got something in the mail. It had a book of people. Christopher Ryan was what it was open to. I read it but it said Chris Crimwell instead of Ryan. It also said he was born 12 September 1986? I asked Mom who Chris Crimwell was and she said, "You know, the Dave Hedgehog guy".
