I am getting out of my wheelchair to go into the bathroom. I start to do a dance and although I move slowly and with some pain, it feels good to do these dance movements. I go into the bathroom and I see a pretty village scene when I look down into the toilet. I am talking to someone just outside the door. I am looking up my brother Dwight's telephone number in my blue address book, but I can't find it. I see: Corinne 470, Lydia 475, A.S, Halloween 472, Kesi, Keshi, Kassee. There were other words and numbers. I laugh at Lydia and I'm nostalgic about the Halloween event. [BL]
