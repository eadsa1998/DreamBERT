I am delivering a guest lecture for a colleague in a modern college auditorium which has a lot of high-technology audio- visual aids set up. The audience in the lecture hall is small, but a video camera broadcasts my face to a medium-sized television screen. I feel that I am not effectively making my point, which is about books written by a forgotten author. While still talking, I fumble around with cables, trying to connect the video signal to a larger screen. Finally it works and my image appears on a movie-sized screen hanging from the ceiling. I feel more confident now because this picture is much more impressive than before. I show one book by a favorite author -- I can't remember who -- , holding it up to the camera for all to see. In it is a bibliography, which I read aloud. As I read each new book's title, I hold up that book, and its front jacket appears on the huge screen above.  Every book is more obscure, and harder to find, than the previous one. These books are precious and meaningful to me, but I wonder whether I am getting through to the audience.
