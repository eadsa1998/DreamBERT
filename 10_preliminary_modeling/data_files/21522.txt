I was making something to eat. I put a big ear of corn into the bowl and was taking off the corn with a spoon. I saw a land title letter on the table and I didn't like it because it was not a very good outfit to deal with, so I got hold of the letter and closed the door and was going to see what my dad did with the mortgage. We were surrounded by savages or an army of soldiers at war with us. Someone promised us a way of escape and we paid him and he was leading us to escape.
