Working for Dr. Ashh and Frank is impatient: he shouts at me when we get ready to cue up for supper; he runs off and leaves with mean words. I get so mad I pick up Dr. Ash's RR lantern and smash it to bits!! Then run off and get in line and meet Nevena Camden and Father Andrew and Marissa Camden. Suddenly we are in Paris in a small French car; we look in at a mad scene at a RR station and newspaper kiosk. An American girl comes in and only wants "funnies"; then back to waiting in line. I tell Father Andrew about smashing the RR lantern. Then Frank and I ride away in a small car.
