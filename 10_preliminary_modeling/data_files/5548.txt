[1997-05-13] We are riding in a car one of the rehab teachers is in the front seat and I am in the back seat we got into conversation and she told me that she spends her summers in West Hampton and I told her that I spent years of summers in West Hampton. We got to talking and we were going to where she stays. I told her where I was and she said that she was 2 to 3, miles away from there and I was really excited to get back to West Hampton again, I hadn't been there in a long time. We got there but then we ended up going to a church, and one of these lady's that I know, A was at the church and was preying. I took a rosary out, or had it in my fingers and was praying, but then mass was going to start and so I couldn't finish saying it. When I came out of the church, I had to try and find the driver of the car that had brought us and I didn't know if she had seen me, and I had to walk around the parking lot for a while before she saw me and she called out to me. I then got into her car. Then I was in my apartment in Eastfield somehow, and there were people there, this lady named N who used to room with me when I was in my very first apartment in the 70s in Massachusetts, and I had to get up and make breakfast for her yet somehow there were stairs in the apartment and I had to go down the stairs and I didn't want to wake her up and I was going to try and make breakfast for myself first. There was a door at the bottom of the stairs which I had to try and close, so she wouldn't hear me. But then I found out that she was down there already so I couldn't surprise her with making breakfast.
