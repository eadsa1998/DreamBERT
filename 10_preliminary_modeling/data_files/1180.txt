I go into cafeteria similar to L.C.C. Some convention has filled it up. I go to a cafe near by, but there's no room. I finally find a stand and buy a scrawny half sandwich for $1.19. I try to pay in pesos and then I find American money. I'm not satisfied with my purchase. It's not enough and it's so costly. Then I go to a meeting. As I come to the closed door, the leader comes out. He is a cat. He stands up and paws my suit jacket where he is going to up the name tag. I turn my head away to the left. I find being near him distasteful. I go in. The room is lined with women of all different shapes and styles, but they are all confused or sad, or uncomfortable. It's like a re-entry workshop for women. Most of us have on bright red clothes. The cat leader changes; sometimes he's a man, sometimes a woman, and sometimes a cat.
