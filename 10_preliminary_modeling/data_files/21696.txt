I seemed to be working making the parts or some kind of part like a barrel with counter sinks. I made a drawing of a telescope with a pencil. I was driving and parked my car. Then it was a bicycle. A boy parked his bicycle next to mine and it also was red. He started to take his bicycle and I yelled to him, "That is my bicycle," and he said it was his. Then I looked and my bicycle was still parked next to his. I was working at White's and we were talking how we were laid off for quite a while. Bob was hunting. I heard a shot or I stepped on a bank where I could see the hunters. There was snow on the ground. I saw Bob come over the hill and go thru deep snow. Then I heard a shot. I looked and Bob was running after the rabbit. He was running down the street. Then I saw the rabbit run across the snow and Bob was after him. I got some money from Marty. I looked out the window in the shop and the davenports and acmes were outside and were being operated full blast.
