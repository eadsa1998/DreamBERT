I dreamed that Orlando Bloom went to my high school, and of course, all the girls wanted him, including me. But for some reason, he only wanted me! So we were in the dining hall (my friends and I), and I guess we were studying for exams. But Orlando walked up to our table and pulled me away. I guess he needed me to fix his shirt collar or trim his hair, because all of a sudden we were alone in the corner. I kissed Orlando. After that, he kept chasing me everywhere. Then I had another dream that I was hanging out with Jackson, just walking around and messing around and kissing, but then I looked at my watch and realized it was almost midnight. I had forgotten my curfew. I tried to take a train home and my father told me I should have been home earlier because I had to babysit that night. The kids wanted to rescue this horse, but it was out of Beauty and the Beast, the scene where all the wolves attack the beast, and Belle has to save him. So they finally went inside and had breakfast. Later I played soccer with Sue.
