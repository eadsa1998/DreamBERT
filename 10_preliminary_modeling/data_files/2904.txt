I am in a room, like maybe a big lecture hall and I am curiously looking around. I see nearly everyone sleeping, sitting up. People are cuddled together like Charla and me in my chair. One person is holding the other like I hold Charla. One boy had a beard and mustache, but he was just a boy. He slept like a child. I enjoy looking around me and seeing things. I am aware I am dreaming.
