We've been moving and I am hunting for the box containing my research but it has gone. I hunt in three rooms. One large box looked like it. In one big empty box was a smaller one because we had given away some things. I return to the big box. Perhaps my papers are under the clothes. I lift them and see some rolls of black satin for slips marked Lois. Meantime H. says she'll drive me and the little child but we must go as there are only ten minutes left.
