I went out the back and a bloke next door asked me to read a book. He said to pick a colour -- red or orange. I saw that orange was Harry Potter and because I don't like orange I chose red. It was Noah's Ark. He told me to read it and give a speech "next Friday". I was thinking 'Meh, this is just a dream'.
