My girlfriend and I are in the parking lot across the street from my apartment. We walk up to her car and I notice someone inside. It is some old bag lady and she says she is looking for cardboard to recycle. I tell her to look somewhere else besides in my girlfriend's car, and she walks away. As we are driving away, she runs up to my side of the car and shoves her hand right into my face. I am startled at first, but I turn my head and bit her finger hard, down to the bone, I am sure. She pulls her hand away and screams. I am already spitting and trying to get the woman's blood out of my mouth, even though there is not much because it happened so quickly. My girlfriend is upset, but I am calm once we get out of the parking lot. In my dream I am sleeping next to my girlfriend when she starts talking in her sleep. I lean over to wake her up and I realize that I went to bed alone and that I am dreaming the whole scenario. I get excited because I realize I can control the dream. I look over at the alarm clock and the time is way later than it should be. I wake up to my alarm going off.
