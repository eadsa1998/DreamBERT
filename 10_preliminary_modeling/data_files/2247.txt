I'm in a swim pool at some kind of a Uni house reunion. I go up a flight of stairs and go down one and think, "How, silly! What a waste of energy." I notice that Ginny is hung over from last night's festivities. Jen H has moved my bed and my head will rest in a different direction. It bothers me a little. I go back upstairs. Nat III comes up and I don't recognize him at first. He admires me. Another one comes up and says, "You've sure gained weight." I tell him about the cortisone. It's my excuse. He doesn't completely buy it.
