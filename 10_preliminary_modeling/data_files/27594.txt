I dreamt I was in the I---- office, quite as usual. I don't remember what we were arguing about, but S---- (president of I----) and I were deep in an argument, each insisting stubbornly on our own point of view. There was no acrimony in the debate, but neither could be convinced. So I said, "S----, I insist we submit this to the C----." and I said to myself, "I know they'll agree with me."
