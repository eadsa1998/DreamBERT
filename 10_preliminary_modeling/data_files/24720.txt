I was picking blueberries in a huge forest, and if the blueberries were workers we had to skin them and roll them up like a burrito. People I was picking with were really nice. It was really fun. Miles &amp; miles of blueberry bushes. Setting: A field somewhere. Characters: Two girls and one guy - strangers - can't describe, were there but I couldn't see them. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. Stuffed with blueberries. Good dream but still a little strange.
