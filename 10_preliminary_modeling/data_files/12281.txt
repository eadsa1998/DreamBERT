I was following Daryl. We were watching a movie and I sat behind him. He moved away and then moved back. Then, we were in a group and Daryl was right next to me and we were standing close. We had a discussion about Sims 2. Daryl's house was ugly and we were outside it. It was number "three thirteen". Mom said to find out what he something.
