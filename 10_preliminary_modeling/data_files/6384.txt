Set in a desert, at night. I had taken a trip in an airplane with Amy. She was wearing the traditional desert garb, for fun it seems. I was wearing a coat. Apparently, we had broken some kind of law because we were about to be executed with guns by soldiers on a stretch of the desert. Time passes. Back in the desert. Amy and I have escaped execution somehow. Rumors reach me that Tara is also in the area, and has been attacked. I run into her eventually and seems she has been stripped of clothing, but not much else. I am angry that someone would do that. I provide her my coat. She is very flustered and I find that I have to comfort her. When she has calmed down, I find Amy and we all find refuge in a cave, in which we fall asleep. There is a moment of darkness, and then I wake up (for real).
