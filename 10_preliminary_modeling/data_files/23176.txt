I was leaving a college campus, maybe where I once worked.  As I waited to cross the street, a car pulled out of the campus drive and turned left in front of me.  When the driver, a Chinese girl, saw me, she stopped her car right in the street and asked me if I knew what part of speech "yochii" or "yochi" was in Russian.  I told her I didn't know the word, but it sounded like it might be an adjective (if it was "yochii").  She said she thought it was a preposition.  Meanwhile, cars were stacking up behind her.  She finally drove away.
