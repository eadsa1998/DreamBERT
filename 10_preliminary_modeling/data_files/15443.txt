I was at someone's place/hotel. It was small and apartment like. A new season of Dead Like Me was playing on the TV. Ellen Muth was the only remaining cast member and the new girl characters were really lame. It was very serious and dark. She was no longer a reaper and was living, but had been called on to do it again. Then some others and I were in the show and we had to go down a toilet to get to some place. A lady caught us in there the second time and I panicked and went down. But it hadn't been activated so it was just a normal toilet and it spat me back up. We paid her and she activated it. Ellen's character liked this guy and they were on a bed covering each other with blood and fleshy bits. I had no idea what was going on. The next day I watched an episode with Dad and Ezra. I complained that it was too serious and he said he liked it more this way. I said it used to be quirkier and that it was created by "Bryan Fuller, he does Community or Modern Family [actually Pushing Daisies]". On Facebook, people were wondering what the names of the kids of a character in Modern Family were called. Someone mentioned me in a comment. There was a character called Jacqueline, but people would interchange it with Izzy.
