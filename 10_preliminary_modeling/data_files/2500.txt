I am directing an open air play/movie. It's a rocky terrain and yet it's in a building. There is a high wall with very high windows like in a gym. Bright sun is beaming through the windows and I ask someone to go block it. Someone puts an Indian blanket over the window, but it doesn't help. Someone says the kleig lights were left on. I stop the actors and say, "Let's take a look at the rooms and layout so we know where to move." I draw a square on a blackboard and label one the living room. Then I say you know, like the "salon." Then I'm watching the actors and I stop them and say, "You don't have to shout. Here, let me show you." I run over and do Mark's lines as he watches. I walk up a few rocky steps toward the female actor and say softly, "Let me press your hand one more time." Then I change the line to, "Let me take your hand one more time." Then I run back to the camera and look through it to see how it all looks. I notice some Indians sliding down the hill on tires and I am annoyed. It's right in our playing area.
