A man is trying to mount a horse. He says he likes thoroughbreds because they fight (or are strong). The horse becomes a black, long hair Persian cat. I am walking and I ask where the sheriff is. He is the actor John Ritter, very cute. He comes over to me and we talk. I am very attracted to him. We stand close together and I am very aware of his warm, caring eyes. I put my arms around him and we hug. We don't want to be separated. It is very caring and good. Sensual. He tells me he has 2 kids. The girl is moving up to the next step in her studies. She's quite smart and is advancing fast.
