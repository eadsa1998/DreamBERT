I was moving into the new apartment.  It was the supposed to be the one that my boyfriend Jeremy's old friend and crush Mickey had been in, and that's how we found it, supposedly.  I remember seeing, I think the TV.  There were animals that were going to stay in the apartment.  A couple guinea pigs, I think, and some birds.  My brother Stuart came to visit and talk, I guess, but I was pretty apathetic because I knew he would be defensive rather than apologize, so it wasn't worth my time.  I'd found another container of sauce for the leftover Thai food in the fridge.
