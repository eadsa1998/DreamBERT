I am in an apartment. There are puppies there and shit all over. I pick up one of the puppies and hold it like a baby. We go downstairs to get the manager to get them to clean up the apartment. The other woman goes to talk to her. I say I'll go too but she's afraid the manager will get upset because we have the puppy without permission. So I pet the "baby." It's very sweet. My friend comes back with an industrial kit to clean out toxins, etc. We'll have to vacate for hours. A bartender points out it's the wrong kit. We just need soap and water stuff. She goes back to exchange it. Now the bartender is a union musician who has to play any song requested. The manager comes over, saying she refuses to play two songs, Jingle Bells and one other. I comment that the boss should abide by the same rules as the workers. The workers applaud.
