I am a spy and have crossed the German lines and made contact with a German soldier. He invites me to conceal myself in the bushes where I find a row set up of movie seats in violet color. We sit in the seats and both look up at a large mountain not too far away. He says, "See all those French soldiers up there." I can see hundreds of them in the distance silhouetted against the sky. They look like ants and as numerous. I think to myself how easily someone could pick them off with a high powered rifle.
