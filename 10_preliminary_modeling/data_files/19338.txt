I met a girl I liked at Cub Foods and I recall her asking me to play hockey if she married she. I think I was about to drop to the ground. I was nervous and I could hear my heart thumping loud in my ears. The girl is 15 and she's a nice friend. I woke up after she asked the question of marriage with a smile.
