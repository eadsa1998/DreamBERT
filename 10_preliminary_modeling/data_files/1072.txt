Tony W wants me to help him take a test. I must hold pictures up for him and ask him questions. It's called the "XXX far-sighted test." It's going to help him with his relationship with his wife Nancy S. George wants me to help him with something too. They both want me to do it at the same time. I have to tell one of them I can't, Tony, I think. Nancy S asks about the test. When I tell her the name she says, "It's not far-sighted." I lean over to her (a little annoyed) and say, "It's far. The pictures are very simplistic and black and white. You'll be able to see them. They lack detail." Something about cheese. [BL]
