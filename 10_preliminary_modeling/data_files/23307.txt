I stepped from an eastbound evening train at West Newton. An engine running rather slowly crashed into the rear end of the train as it stood at the station and derailed all the cars without upsetting or smashing them at all. One man had his leg jammed in some way and there must have been tons of pressure on it, but presently something shifted and set him free. He merely slid to the other end of his seat and sat still. I was much relieved to see that he was not hurt. Walking through the cars, which were very out of line, I was grasped by a little boy who was shrieking with nervous terror. I carried him into the station where he became quiet.
