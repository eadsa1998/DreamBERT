I was recording with some random camera. We were outside and on these stadium type seats. Daryl was next to me making weird noises. Melodie was there. Evelyn was doing a bunny hop and something about a mouse trap. I was trying to remember who I liked because I didn't like Dmitri anymore. I was at a shop and was burning a CD. The camera had a weird memory stick and was taking forever to copy over. I got in trouble, but I said that Mr Carmichael always lets me do this so I figured that it would be alright.
