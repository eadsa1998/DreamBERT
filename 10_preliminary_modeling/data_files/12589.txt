I went into this room to go on the internet and I checked my phone quickly and saw that I had five messages from Mom and Dad. Someone started opening the door and I went to hide, but I thought they might go to the desk so I stood up. Eugene came in and saw me straight away and said "You were hiding from me" and I said "No, I needed to look something up on the net and dropped my phone". He was with his friends. I left and it said 'Mike Windham' on the door and I was thinking that it wasn't Mr Windham's name.
