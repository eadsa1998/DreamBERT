I am teaching a class in a university.  I have assigned a textbook which deals with economics, and the students had a reading assignment from it for this class.  To my consternation, I have not read the assignment myself, and I failed even to bring it to class.  I call on some of the brightest students in the class to summarize the reading, and I ask them questions-but for my own information and clarification, not to test their understanding of the reading.  I feel very awkward.  At the break, I go to the bookstore, and I find that they have one copy of the text.  I hate to buy another copy, since I already have one at home, so I try to read as much as I can.  Pretty soon, though, the break has stretched into more than 20 minutes, and I am nervous about the bad example I am setting for the class by being late.
