It is time to do voice studio work and people are late. I am singing a song with Doug and I am pleased to notice I sing well and in harmony. Lucy is there. We nearly finish the song. There are two more lines to go and we decide to stop for the day. Barry asks if he's needed tomorrow and I say yes. Sherina comes in and it is 6 o'clock, not 3 o'clock as I wanted. Dino comes in late. I am annoyed and ask what happened. Dino is standing and very tall and I ask him to sit down so I can talk to him without hurting my neck. He sits and now I look at a reflection of his face in a metal mug. I pick up a calculator-like thing and push a button out of curiosity. A male voice comes on a message machine from a bank. I can't get it to stop. I push buttons, read directions, etc. and can't figure it out. I ask them and they try. I look for Doug. He will know but he's eating an apple and walking down some stairs. I go to the top of the stairs and look down. I see he's dropped his brief case in the green ocean water in the room below and he is swimming, while still biting on his apple, to get it. I hope he's OK because he's partially blind. He feels his way out, pushing aside the fallen leaves. I wonder how come the water is allowed in the room; the nice wood floor will get ruined. He comes back and I turn and walk back in, not wanting him to know I watched. I now pick up a baby and notice it has hair in its mouth. I pull some out, wondering if the baby bites people's hair and then can't spit it out. I find more and more, deeper down the throat, and realize the baby gets hairballs like a cat and we have to get that out of there.
