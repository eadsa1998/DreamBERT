Me and Dora were in Germany/Austria/Vienna. It was one country with the same name--3 names. Me and Dora were printing pictures of each other in the darkroom and we had to expose the image underneath and focus on the bottom of the bed under the covers. I was printing pictures of Dora. Dora was printing pictures of me. I was worried Dora would see my surprise (for her) before it was finished. On the ship we had to jump out into the ocean and hold onto big wooden doors riding the waves. At Aunt Jenny 's house we were in back, in front of the garage. My cousin was singing.
