 I'm in a forest where a marathon is taking place. There is a wide path with deep ruts in the muddy ground. The area is very wet. I'm going down a large, steep hill. A lot of the runners are injured. They have sprained ankles, pulled muscles, etc. Some have splint-like structures on their legs. The splints look like real human legs, so it looks like 2 legs on top of each other. I am to help the ailing runners, but first I need tot put a pencil in the small refrigerator at the bottom of the hill. I do, opening the door and tossing it in, and then go and help a man. He has a sprained ankle. My mom and I help him up. I ask him which leg is hurt. He says his left. When we stand up, he puts his weight on his left foot. I wonder if he is faking the injury. We help him to the top where there is a small tent. People can drive their cars up to it. Family friends Louise Manilla and Lois Schmelzer are there, helping the runners. Also, a man who may be Dick Zates is getting people's vehicles or helping people to their vehicles.
