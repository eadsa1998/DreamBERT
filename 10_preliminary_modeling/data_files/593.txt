Something about an open house in a business building. I arrive early. Denise, a child who is a friend's daughter is there. She is sitting on a chair waiting. She wants to know if I still have some money I had hidden in my bra. I do. Something to do with dimes I'm saving for school. We are early so we must wait for the events to start.
