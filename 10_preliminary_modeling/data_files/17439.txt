I was with my boyfriend Jeremy.  I knocked on a panel, a window that we thought led outside, but actually went into a control room.  Two people came in and one gave me her coffee.  We cuddled up to watch a movie.  Freddy Krueger.  Bad things started happening, as if watching the movie gave Freddy power and the movie was related to real life.  There were two large spiders by the door.  We took care of one and the other stood up.  It looked like a glove, and crawled outside.  A baseball glove flew past.  Fighting, dangerous cats.  We had to fend everything off until the end of the movie, and then things calmed down.
