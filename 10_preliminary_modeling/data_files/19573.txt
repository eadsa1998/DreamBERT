Some party unknown asks where I live. For some reason I determine to lie about the matter, and answer that I live near Vienna, Va., out past the dam. I knew nothing of that section, whereas my questioner proved to know all about Vienna and environs; and to test the truth of my statement he asked me which road I took past the dam to reach my home. However, I feel I must bluff it out, and I answer "The road to the right."
