I dreamed that I and my family were Puritans. We were living the same house as we live in today, however. I was shelling peas, and was in an old-fashioned dress when a girlfriend of mine, Charlotte Kominsky (20) came over. She asked to borrow something (I can't remember what) and mother said, "Bridget (which was my name), go up in the attic and get it for her." I went up to my room with a stepladder for there are no steps leading up to our attic, and climbed up on it, pulled back and door, and a bird flew out and got caught between my hair and my neck.
