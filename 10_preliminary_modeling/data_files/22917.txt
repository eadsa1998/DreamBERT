Joe Sizemore had been going down a list of names and when he came to mine he asked if I had played football the year before.  I said no, only baseball-except I believe I said I had substituted for Larry Poponovo at end a couple of times when he was sick.  Coach said he wanted me to come out for football that year.  I told him I would, not so much because I wanted to -- I knew I couldn't stand practicing every day -- but because I was flattered that he would ask me.  The next name he called on the list was Tommy Jacobson.
