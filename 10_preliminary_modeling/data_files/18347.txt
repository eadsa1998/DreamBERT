I was in the city where I go to graduate school or somewhere like that, and I walked away from my wife for a few minutes and found there was a little airline right in the city where I go to graduate school  that was offering trips to the city where my wife's folks live, for about $1.25 fare. I thought that was quite a bargain and bought a couple of tickets. I expected my wife to be along in a couple of minutes and thought, well, she'll get an airplane trip now and we'll go down to my wife's hometown and see her folks. But the plane got ready to take off and my wife hadn't come yet, so I wanted to get off, but it was too late now. So I had to go on and fly to my wife's hometown, although I did get a refund on one ticket. We got to my wife's hometown and I wanted to get a flight back, but there was no flight back. It was sort of an unscheduled airline and they flew in rather little planes. So I was stuck in my wife's hometown, but I think I got back to the city where I go to graduate school .
