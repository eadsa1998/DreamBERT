 The penalty for "Sugi", which is something that I am familiar with though the spelling or pronunciation of the word may be different from the word I know, is being raised from 60 to 80. This is for forced sexual acts, phallic acts. I'm in a scene where there is a big pile of lumber, including 1.5 inch by 4-inch boards, with cards in the pile or in the boards. Something is being built. I pull out some lumber halfway from the stack. The ends of these boards will serve to hold other boards while they're being cut. A man asks how to cut the boards. I understand how. There is a sexual scene that may be a rape. There is a lot of sex in this scene and it may be a crime. The police are there and they this man questions. The man says he is innocent, and wants to convince others of his innocence. This scene may be associated with Wonkers Hall at Brimson. <br/
