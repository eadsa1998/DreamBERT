It's time to take our baggage to the airport and catch our plane. We are late and the baggage man is annoyed. Then we do it a second time. We get to the baggage counter at 10:10. That's the time the plane leaves. I say, "I know I'm late, but you can do it, right?" He sighs and does so. Then I realize I can't get on the plane. So I go back to get my baggage. We decide to drive. Then I lose everybody and realize they drove away without me and I have to walk. So I walk for miles. When I get there, one of the four people isn't there and I realize I didn't have to walk after all, because she had the van. I just missed her. Then we have three drivers and two vans and we try to figure out how we are going to drive so far that way. Someone's going to be tired.
