 I'm at an airport where I see lots of luggage that is to be discarded. I want to take a hard-sided suitcase to protect some of my stuff more than my green suitcase. I have left my green suitcase on a bus, for storage, parked out in a flat open area near the runway with a few other vehicles. There is a small white truck with a topper-like compartment that is filled with explosives and ammunition for my friend Kevin Simpson and I. I hold two small wooden boxes with sliding top lids that contain ammunition. I take a black hard-sided suitcase out of the baler-like machine. It's old and has a scaled appearance, but will work fine. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. It's hot. I tell Stephen I want to go get a drink. We do. We walk along with the crowd. I see my sister Ramona sitting at a table with her friends. It's as if I'm a senior and she is a freshmen. I jokingly touch her head, saying hi affectionately. She shakes it off, annoyed with me, as is characteristic of a freshmen.
