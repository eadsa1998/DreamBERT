I was with three of the characters from the TV show Ed. I was with Ed, Carol, and Molly. It wasn't on the show. The four of us were friends. It seems that maybe I was closest to Carol. The four of us were in a car going somewhere. Ed was driving and Molly was in the front seat with him. I was sitting directly behind him and Carol was behind Molly. Ed was talking about something that he did. None of us could believe that he had done that. I reached up and tousled his hair with both of my hands and said, You silly man. He ran his fingers through his hair. I was afraid that I had irritated him or made him mad - that he didn't like it that I tousled his hair. He didn't say anything though. Carol laid down in the backseat and put her head on my lap. I reached down to brush the hair out of her face and accidentally rubbed her face roughly or the wrong way. She jokingly said something to the others about me being rough. I also had a sore on the ring finger of my right hand. It was kind of inside where it would rub against the second finger. It was a big round thing. It was too large to be in that spot on a finger. I had been messing with it. It was almost as though it was a wart and I had been picking and pulling at it and I had maybe pulled it out myself. It hurt a little, but not that much, not as much as you would expect it too. I kept looking at it and thinking that I needed to go see a doctor about it. I don't remember actually talking about it.
