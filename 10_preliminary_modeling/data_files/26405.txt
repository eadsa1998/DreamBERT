 I'm reading a book and am being tested on the material in the book. There is something called an air curare, which makes one's eyes burn, and produces toxic gas in decaying bodies. There is a war occurring. I see my classmate Megan Cunningham near the Wilmerton Hospital. There is a question of skiing in Vail, and a question on Valex, which is how to use a reference center. There is a question about how Judd Decker would take a ___ ( I forget) pill, and how to take drugs. I'm supposed to list the page number that I find the information on so even if I guess the correct answer it doesn't matter. There is a farmer who won't put grain into his anus through a funnel any more, at a National Guard Armory. There is a question on high altitude urination.
