 I'm at the Middle Mall. I may be Bruce Willis. A car is being driven with Bruce Willis and Rose, from the movie The Color Of Night. She reminds me of my ex-girlfriend Annie: attractive and deceitful. The car is driving to his parent's house. The cripple man from the movie The Usual Suspects is with. Bruce and Rose are in the back seat of a station wagon. There is a sexual overtone, like she is going to give him fellatio. They go in the house. The father and mother are scared of intruders. I am now in the dream, not Bruce Willis. The group goes into the basement, to assure themselves that there are no intruders. They have a dog, which starts barking. We see that there is an intruder with a gun. It is a man by the bathroom. The person approaches us. We see it is an older woman that has problems: she is not emotionally well. She comes forward, and I wrestle the gun from her. It goes off one into the floor, and I turn it on her and fire a second time. Two people that I catch chickens with get shot, one is Randy, and the other is the guy who always sits at the front of the van. The man who rides in front is shot twice and is still living, so I shoot him in the head, which kills him. I am terribly sad. I cry and cry, saying, "I killed my brother!" I am beside myself with grief.
