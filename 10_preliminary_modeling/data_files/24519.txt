At a crowded seaport, I run into a woman that I had dated twenty years ago. We sit and talk. She puts her hands on my arms and says she still loves me. I feel the same toward her. It feels wonderful. We go for a walk. She once worked here and points out a large flag mast; at its base, there is a small rusty prong. She says it has caught on her clothes many times. I break it off. A policeman or guard arrives. He asks what I've done. I tell him. He puts me under arrest but I knock him down, and kick and pummel him. To create a panic that will help us escape, I grab his pistol and fire it in the air, yelling "Gun! Gun!" Then I wake up.
