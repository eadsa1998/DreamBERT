It was my first day back to work after my vacation. I went into the training room to sit down and talk with Bill C, as we typically do when we get together to discuss business. I sat down at one of the tables. I think I had two of my new business brochures lying in front of me, but not together. One was lying on the table with my appointment book on top of it. The other was lying on my notebook. Bill C was standing to my left. He might have been getting water. As I sat down I asked him if he missed me while I was gone. He didn't answer me. After what felt to me like an awkward silence I said that it seemed that Jennifer C had done well in my absence. At that point as he turned around to look at me he said something about having Penny [unknown in waking life] cut me twelve checks. I quickly turned my head to look at him. He was dead serious. Not a smile on his face. I was sitting there in shock. One of my worst fears had been realized. He had decided to terminate me. I quickly calculated in my head that he was giving me six months severance pay. Then, I don't know if I was wondering if he really meant twelve checks or if he actually meant twelve weeks pay - which would only be half as much and give me much more serious concern. Or he might have been saying something to clarify that.
