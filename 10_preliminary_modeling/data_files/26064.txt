 I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson. We go to the house of Josephine Zirbes, a family friend. A female friend of Josephine's answers the door and lets in. We go in and talk with her and Josephine. There is a cat there. We've come to ask for a metal suit of armor. We want to borrow it. Kevin tells Josephine that a suit of armor that we did have let him run really fast and quickly.
