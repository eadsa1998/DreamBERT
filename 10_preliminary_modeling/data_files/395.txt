I run this "castle" sort of place. I've got a problem with this guy - a sort of wizard - who wants to take over, I've heard of his plot with another guy, and I'm sort of at a loss right now. I'm looking for Michael Keaton, who's staying here, I like him a lot and he helps me do things, he's very clever, though elusive when it comes to a relationship. I don't really know where I stand with him. I go down where he stays but he's not there. I'm quite frustrated, I need his advice. I see other people going about their business, and I wonder if they know how confused I am, and how they think of me as an administrator. Somewhere I find this note. It's from the housekeeper, she's a nice round ruddy-cheeked woman - she says that she didn't want to tell tales, but somebody is skimming off something and pocketing the proceeds, and she thought I should know. Well, I'm glad she wrote me this note, but it's a couple of years old. It must have been lost all this time. Still, I'll do some investigating. While I'm reading this, I'm eating an ice-cream cone (it's a pretty big scoop on a little bitty cone) and trying to climb a wall. I need to haul myself over the top, and I'm hesitant to do it with the ice-cream cone. After a couple of false starts I do it. It's okay. I go on to cross this sort of pond thing next to some bleacher seats (concrete or stone, I think), and finally see Michael across the way, going the opposite direction. I call to him, saying I need to see him. It's taken him some effort (I think magic was involved) to get where he is without getting wet, and he's not too keen on coming back across, but he does - partly from friendship, but also because I am in charge. I tell him I need his help, he says okay.
