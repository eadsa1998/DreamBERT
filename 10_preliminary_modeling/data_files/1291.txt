I'm a Queen, maybe Elizabeth. I am visiting a country, probably Iceland. It's nearing the spring there. I must walk across the ice floor. It's dangerous. If I step on the wrong part, I'll slip in. Guards come with me to hold on to me and point the way. They place cardboards and pillows when I should step. I tell them, "My balance isn't good because of my ankles." Off we go. I nearly fall in several times. We get to the side where I sit in a chair at a table. It is sitting on the ice!
