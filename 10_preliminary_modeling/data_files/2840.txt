I have finally finished a schedule of pill taking and am relieved I no longer have to take these pills. It feels good. I get in the passenger side of the car to return home. Something about Grandma Mildred. We forgot something, maybe the key to the house, and she goes back to get it. I sit, waiting, and then realize I have the key and we can go in to wait for her return. I get out and try to find the key in my purse. I finally find it. A girl comes by with a note from Grandma. A man reads it and sighs, I might have known to not send her. She's buying things for the house, a refridge and a stove for the kitchen. [BL]
