I was in a living room with my sister Mary and her daughter MaryEllen and her son Ronnie. It seemed to be my living room at home but I can't really tell. We were watching television, when a man with a ski mask came in the room and shot me in the left side of my body. We all kept watching television and the man left. I just looked at the blood through my shirt. Next thing we were outside and getting in a car. There were two men getting in a car right behind me. One of the men looked just like the man who shot me, except he did not have the ski mask on. I said to my sister, "Is that the guy?" and she said, "Yes, it is." An ambulance came and I got in it.
