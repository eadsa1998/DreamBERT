There is an invasion and I see the air filled with planes. One comes down and lands on my arm, only it's not a plane now but a metallic butterfly-like machine. It says, "What is your name?" I know I've been captured and must answer. I say, "B. J. M." Then a huge creature in black, tall and very muscular comes over. He's a huge soldier. He says, "Barb Sanders?" I say, "Yes." He says, "Come with me." I follow him. He kind of looks like Terence (cousin). I'm taken to a resort hotel-like place. Darryl  is there. We escape and are in the woods. We start to make love and I love it. "Oh good," I say, "I get to feel your sexy kisses again." He performs oral sex and I say, embarrassed, "What are you doing?" I repeat that several times and then as we are nearing a climax, two girls come over (young women). They are the enemy also and I realize we are still too close to the hotel and not really deep in the woods. We run fast and get in my van and drive (I drive) fast, only now we're on open plains and the enemy headquarters are right near by. I say, "We've got to find cover in the trees," and I drive toward the trees, but I end up driving in a shallow river and then it's deep and we are floating. I paddle for land to discover it's a line of floating furniture -- wood, kitchen chairs, then tables, then cribs and bedroom sets, from tiny to large. (Earlier there was a strange bathroom where I had to squat down on a funnel-like shape where I found a note from Darryl suggesting we meet. I had come out of the bathroom, which had two doors, one unlatched saying, "Yes, yes, yes," very happily.
