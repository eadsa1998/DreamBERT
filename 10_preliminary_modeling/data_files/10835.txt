I had a dream where a magazine seller came to our home and began throwing magazines of all sorts all over the room. And it seemed as if he was in an insane state of mind. Astounded, we got up and it seemed that he had run out and left everything all over the room. We knew not why he performed such an act. The participants in this dream were my mother 49, and myself and this magazine salesman whose face I cannot place.
