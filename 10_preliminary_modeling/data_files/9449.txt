I see Frank with his ex-wife who has returned. I am very jealous. But he tells me he does not love her. Then we are in a garden and I wander about. Meet my thesis advisor and say to him, "Frank is taller than you. His upper arm is shorter than yours, but his lower arm is longer and his hands are longer." We laugh and laugh and have a good time.
