I dreamed I was walking down the street with a man who was a composite of 2 boys I know. I was very conscious of his dark brown eyes, his dark thick eyebrows, and his dark brown hair. He was of medium height and rather stocky, and between 28 and 30 years of age. I remember feeling extremely happy and very lighthearted. Then my grandmother (who is living in Los Angeles) walked by and I introduced her to the man whom I was with. Then my grandmother walked away after taking a gook look at the man and I awoke.
