Getting into the car, our friend Jake fell and hit his head.  I took him next door (his home) and there was a party.  Cats, and his brother Willy was sitting in a chair spaced out.  Drugs, maybe.  There were some cool toys.  I talked to Willy for a bit- nice guy.  Then, a flashback, I guess.  Realizing that the guy I was following was Willy.  Followed him through a bad party of town into a room down an alley.  They assigned me to a table.  It was a severe-case detox facility.  The people were volatile; it was scary.  True danger.  We barely escaped.  Then, I was telling my parents about Willy.  Something romantic was growing between us.  And of course there was talking with my boyfriend Jeremy.  I had a decision to make.  Love with Jeremy is strong, developed.  The situation with Willy had a spark.  He was tender, and it seemed like a good prospect.  Later in the same dream, I had to get a goblet of holy water.  I was trying to take it outside to someone without spilling.  Outside I crossed a bridge and started to cross another, going horizontally.  They were trying to dispose of a rocket about to go off.  I latched onto it when they set it off, trying to use my body to shield the shrapnel from everyone.  Once it looked like I was high enough and the coast was clear, I let go of the rocket.
