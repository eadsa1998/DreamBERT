I am not yet married: Frank comes to stay over night at our house; my parents arrived unexpectedly, and my mother sees him in the room and orders him to leave. I am scared at first but then answer: "Yes he stayed over night." Then she inquires if we're getting married, but I say I want to wait. "I want a normal life" - not uncertainty or RR. He asked me to get married, but I said "just because you spent the night here is not reason enough." Good feeling with M.
