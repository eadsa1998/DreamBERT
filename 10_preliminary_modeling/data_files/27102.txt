I was dreaming that I got up on this Saturday morning in M--- Dormitory after the breakfast hour. So I went over to the C---D--- to get an orange so as to have some breakfast. On the way back I saw my friend's (male-age 23) friend (male-age 22) on his way to Saturday morning classes at D--- school. I suddenly realized that my friend was sleeping in a third floor room ( I live on the second floor) in the dormitory, and that he would be late to school if he didn't get up. But instead of waking him, I went directly to my room. There I commenced to undress while at the same I watched a very strange affair going on outside in front of the dormitory. It seemed as if a group of students were rehearsing for a play which they were going to give. There were several students, both boys and girls whom I knew, dressed up as the well-known "keystone cops." Then there was an old electric car in which sat another male student in an early 1900 costume. Also there was another girl in appropriate costume who kept running back &amp; forth between the car and the policemen always pleading and falling down on her knees.
