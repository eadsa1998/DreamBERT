Mom and Dad were in Canada, and they were going to drive down and come and get me and go back to the cabin and they did. And Mom drove down, and she said that Dad was waiting at the cabin and we were trying to get stuff together, and she was looking for her little personal tape player unit, and she couldn't find it. So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden Dad appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and Dad stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I couldn't turn it off. I clicked the power switch off, but the sound was still blasting at full level. So then I had to stop the CD player and try and turn it off. Last night I had a funny dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in the Warrior Vision room with Melinda and we were going to take a test in there for some reason. And we were coming out and Mrs. Talmadge sees us coming out and she comes to talk to us. And Melinda is teasing and she says "Yeah, that's Jasmine, messing up your room in there." And then we go out a back door and we're in this field thing, and then I'm with Mom, and I was trying to find a place to practice my song for chorus and not have anybody listening. I'm tired; can you tell? [sigh] There were these kids around and so I can't. I stand up on this tall thing and I start singing, and then all of a sudden I'm in this church and I'm auditioning in front of Mrs. Dougherty and Mr. Hanover. And they give me a song that's completely out of my range and I keep screwing up and stuff. And I have a microphone and the board is right behind me and I'm trying to adjust things to make me sound a little bit better. Then I woke up.
