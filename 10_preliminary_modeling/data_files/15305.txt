I was at Nana's and Mom and Ezra were also there. I had to leave and lots of people were coming there. My car was a Holden V8 and it drove smoothly. I got to the road and heaps of people were coming in. I realized Mom was coming back in and I turned around. Someone was then trying to trick me so they could take something.
