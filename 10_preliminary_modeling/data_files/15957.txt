I was at the Technical College, which was different and we were going for lunch. We went to the canteen and it was weird and lots of stuff was closed. I had found a video of me falling and curling up as a bus came towards me and Brock stopped the bus. I had forgotten about it. I showed Tristan and Frederick. Later, we were at a pub and Tristan got drunk and kissed Ms Nowak and she just laughed.
