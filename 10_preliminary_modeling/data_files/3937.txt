["The enemy or the helper?"]  Ellie and I and our babies are kidnapped and tied up and put in a car. I fight the man, hating him. We go to an old house and I manage to get enough free to knock him down. I hit him over and over with a hammer, first on the penis and then on the head. I try to kill him. I force him to lie on the floor, holding him at gun point while I also get a pair of scissors, since I can't find a knife, and cut Ellie's ropes. He keeps trying to get up and I threaten him again with the gun, which I had wrestled from him. It is broken. Ellie and I take the babies to the car and start driving away from him. He chases. We pass through a small western cow town where the people look like traditional cowboys. I think about finding a sheriff and getting help but decide this is probably his people so I don't stop. I continue driving down the straight road. Finally I stop to call for help. I learn that the man is actually trying to help us. He rescued us from our parents who were going to kill us. In fact, as soon as we were gone, they had three more babies to replace us and could care less about our well being. I am now confused and don't know if this is a good or bad guy.
