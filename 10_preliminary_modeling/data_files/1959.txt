I am seated near Howard/Arthur who hands me a valentine and asks if I had received one like this, would I respond favorably? It's wordy and long with 2 or 3 pages. The first page has hearts and the word "husband" in a square that moves (so different words can show in the "window") I say, "Yes," but I'm just being polite and I think, "I've already married you once." We are both pretending the valentine isn't for me and I am actually confused if it is or not, so I pretend nonchalantly, then I gather up some belongings I'd been collecting. I look in a paper sack and see sugar-free bubble gum, sugar-free M &amp; M's and chocolate chips. There is a small, golden miniature trunk that has drawers that open up. I spill candies and am scooping them up with my hands. It's been a long time since I'd had sweets and don't want to leave any of them behind.
