In our house with many people, talking of how to keep cool in big crowds, esp. when traveling. Frank is about to leave on the train and we expect it will be crowded; I make a huge sandwich and cut it in half with a big cleaver; "I simply try not to expose myself to situations where there are huge crowds; so that is the reason why I am not going to the Retreat Center this time.".... we eat and talk.
