I first remember being in a room which I think was a gymnasium, and there were a lot of people there. Then I remember being in a mall, or a toy store of some sort, and there was this girl I knew sitting down and doing something to her hair. I sat down and threw a couple things that were on the table onto her hair. Then, realizing that wasn't exactly what she was trying to do, I cleaned her hair and made sure there was nothing left in it. She asked me if I wanted to get dressed up, and I said I wanted to wear really bright colors and look really crazy, sort of like a motley fool. Then I remember some computers, and a few other people and I were gathered around them. And the girl I was just with- we had been slow dancing without music (the music wasn't really needed). We just sat around, and I don't know what we did. Then she left. I thought she would be gone forever. I started dancing with someone else. Then I found her again, and I just pretended that the other girl didn't exist. I told her I thought I lost her, and I was so happy to find her again, and we started dancing again. The next thing I know, my parents are letting my brother drive me home, which wasn't the best idea. First, he doesn't have a license, and second, during the ride he stood up in the driver's seat, trying to look cool or something. Then, he slowly took his seat belt off like it was some kind of dance move. I was screaming at him to let me out of the car, but he wouldn't. I couldn't think of a way to stop the car without the possibility of getting us in an accident. The next thing I know, we're at home. I told my mother what my brother was doing, and she said he'd be in trouble but didn't appear very angry. Then I saw Clarissa, a girl I go to school with, who I took to be my ex-girlfriend (in this dream). I had a feeling she was upset with me for some reason, so I didn't try to talk to her. I felt bad she was feeling that way and I wanted to know why.
