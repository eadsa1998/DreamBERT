All that I can remember is that I was at some type of social function. Someone came up to me and asked me to dance, and some time later this same individual in exactly the same manner asked me again. I can't explain how he asked me, but I do know that it was in the exact same way. The second time I said fine and grinned. I can't remember how I answered the first request. The second time he asked me was just after some sort of intermission. I recognize the person as someone from either Case or Reserve campus' but I know that I have never met him. I was very conscious of him wearing a brown checked jacket and was also aware of the dress I was wearing, but not of the color.
