I was helping in my dad's store, (as is my custom when the benevolent spirit moves me), when a rather tall man, about 40, came in accompanied by a woman. He carried a package which he wanted to mail at our sub-station. He opened the package and showed me two letters which were enclosed. One letter had a three cent stamp on it, the other was unstamped. He asked me for a penny stamp. I told him this was unnecessary. He insisted however, so I went to the stamp drawer and brought him a penny stamp. The woman with him was about thirty or so, and related in some way, but not his wife.
