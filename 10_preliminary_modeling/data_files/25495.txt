 I'm on the first floor of Wonkers Hall at Brimson with my friends Stephen Ramos and Norman Noman. I have a blueberry muffing and a glass of milk. I say an analogy to something, which may be related to soul. Stephen and Norman yell something about strawberries. The athletes are watching football on television. I go upstairs to see my ex-girlfriend Annie before I do homework. I want to kiss her. It feels as if we are a couple. I go to the Humanities computer lab, where my professor Greg Welters' class is meeting. I have a red plastic cup full of milk. Greg tells me to dump it out before I enter the lab. I drink some of the milk and dump the rest out. I fill the cup with some water and drink it. The lab is really full. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. There is a first-year woman who keeps talking to me. My co-worker Katie James is there. I find the lone Power Macintosh that is available. It has Humanities-Fine Arts Applications open. I go to the chooser and select Social Studies Applications.
