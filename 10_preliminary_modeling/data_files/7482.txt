Mary is wearing the red dress that she had worn at our 25th wedding anniversary. She is smiling and happy and healthy and looks exactly as she had when she was alive and in good health. Her hair is jet black, and her eyes are beautiful brown "sparklers." I have a frontal view of her. We are dancing and just happy to be together. In another scene we are driving in my car and I am going quite fast. Mary tells me I am going too fast and asks me to slow down. To my immediate right is a low stone wall. Although I can't see over it, I know there is a cliff dropping away on the other side of that wall. On my left is a broad expanse of grassland as far as the eyes can see. I veer sharply away from the wall and drive on the grassy plain, in a direction parallel to the wall. The mood of this dream is one of joy and happiness. At one point I see Mary wearing a large red turban. I don't like it and tell her so.
