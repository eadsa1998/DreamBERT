Bonnie and I are in the living room. Mateo comes in the door. We are planning the "Birds" shows. I am now on top of a roof and some one (Paulina) jumps off the 1st story edge so she can get a ladder for the rest of us. It's a red plastic ladder and shaky. I carefully climb down and then notice my brothers got back on the roof. I call "The Birds" together to discuss the two upcoming programs. I tell them I made a mistake. We have a one-hour show at 3:30 and then at 4:30 another show across town. If we only do 40 minutes, we can do it. There are 7 of us so if each does 6 minutes, we'd be OK. "Lori" says, "What if I can only do three minutes? Jennifer H says she'd do the other 3 minutes. I apologize for making the mistakes in timing of the two shows.
