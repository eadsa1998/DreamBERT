Mark Wahlberg's character from Boogie Nights was dating this girl and her family was annoyed about it [note: I watched the first half of it last night]. It was in the olden days. Then one night they had sex. The next morning he seemed bored with her and she was with him in the kitchen. Her siblings picked up on something different and said they thought she had had sex. He said she wanted to do it again and her siblings told him that she was actually only 16 and lied about her 'papers'. He said he had to go if that was the case, but then the mother went to the daughter's room to check on her and heard sex noises. Then I was outside somewhere with Mom, Dad, Ezra and Nana. It was night and we were on the way to Dad's new place. It was really far away. He wanted a room mate. Some witch/psychic predicted Mom's future. One time she put a spell on us so we could control these car placements. Then all females had numbers on their tongues. First it was letters and mine was an 'F'. You couldn't see it unless you put a certain light on it. Then there was a video Mark Wahlberg's girlfriend from before had 23 on her tongue and he had '3' (girls now had two numbers, guys had one). These people came to kill him. I watched Dawson's Creek later.
