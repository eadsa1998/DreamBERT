 I'm at Armstrong with either my friend Kevin or Stephen. We are walking down the main hallway towards the office. We get to the last set of doors, which we can see through because they are made of glass. My friends Elise Rooks and Esther Thurman are walking towards us on the other side of the glass doors. I run up to them and say hi. There are a bunch of groups of two, three, and four people outside the office socializing, all of my Armstrong graduating class. I am with Elise and Esther. I am uncomfortable with Elise because we recently kissed and fondled each other at a party (in real life). There is a disturbance on the south side of the building. A bunch of people goes to check it out. Kevin is among them. I walk down the hall past the guidance office. My friend Niles Zelling is there. I guess that he and his brother Tim came up to Wilmerton. <br/
