I am going with Kay and Ed to look at house they wish to buy. The first one we come to has an AAUW clubhouse on the corner and blacktop paving over the rest of the lot. It won't do as it lacks garden space. I ask how much they'll get from the house they will sell. "$6,000." Why so little? Oh yes, it's termite ridden.
