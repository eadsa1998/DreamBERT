I can't remember how it happened, but a black guy was lying on the side of some water with heaps of bullet holes in him, but he was alive. A friend and I were there and she decided to drown herself. I jumped in to save her, but I started drowning and someone saved us both. He was wearing a hoodie etc, so we couldn't see his face. On the news it said that it was Mike Bailey. It became a famous event and was all over Youtube etc. No-one believed that I was one of the girls there. I found a video with a close-up of me lying on a rock and coughing. Mom was telling me to straighten my hair to talk about it on the news but I didn't want to. Later I was in an audience. A guy asked for people to participate in a game. Evelyn and I volunteered. People commented on my white skin. We had to go underwater to find stuff. The second one was in Morse Code and was a list. I took a waterproof radio and we sat at a bench trying to work it out.
