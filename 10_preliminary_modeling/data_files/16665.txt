Another problem dream about trying to get into Central Lutheran. I dreamt that we were having some kind of function there, like a dinner or a fundraiser or a dance or something. And we were in a big hall that was kind of like the Coolidge Hall, except it had a wooden floor, it was kind of like a dance floor. And people could come in the sanctuary and come through to the hall, which is where we were. And the part that I remember the best is that it was time to leave and people were clearing out, and I was going to leave. And somebody opened the door at the back of the hall, but it was kind of leading to another hallway going to the office. Somebody opened that door and I could hear the beep beep beep, you know, that says that your time is running or you only have a minute to set off the alarm. So I ran as fast as I could, calling for Pastor Gregg, and eventually I got his attention. He came back to the back door and Shirley was there, I guess, and I guess Sheryl was there too. And they were diddling around and diddling around and diddling around, but they couldn't seem to get it shut off. So [laugh] I just sort of went to the middle of the hall and hoped that it wasn't going to be too loud. And, of course, we heard it and everything, and the company came out and police came out and it was all dark, like all the lights went out. And the company was telling us all this stuff about trying to help us get our act together, if you will, and not do that again. And then, next thing I know, we were in the sanctuary and somebody did that again where they opened the door and the time was counting, and somebody didn't bother to try to shut it off, either that or they couldn't. So that time I just ran around the building and I took off running down the street, through that neighborhood for a couple blocks.
