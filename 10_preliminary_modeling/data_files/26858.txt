 I'm flying with my friend Melanie McDyss and her family. We seem to be going west, following Main Street out of Wilmerton. Melanie and I are in contact: I have my arms wrapped around her legs, while her knees are pulled up towards her chest. I seem to be attached or supported by a thin metal wire that stretches across the sky. We are whisked over the ground-the wire may move. We fly over a river, very low, close to the water. I know that we are, or this is like, flying over New Zealand. I turn or am turned backwards as we fly. I see the family behind us. The clouds in the sky are dark, in contrast to the other clouds around them, which are puffy, light and dark: very ominous and beautiful. We come to an immense dam made of light-colored concrete. It is several hundred feet high: huge! There is a small amount of water flowing out of the top of the dam. Melanie and I fly and float above the dam, high above the water. She and I embrace and kiss. We float and fly, doing a backwards loop-de-loop, which is a mind-bending experience at this height. We continue to kiss, and have a sexual encounter in the air. We descend a bit, rubbing up against the damn. We're in a large bathroom that has several stalls with her sister Beth. Beth leaves. I close three doors after her. She has a good idea of what Melanie and I are doing. We continue to have a sexual encounter after Beth leaves.
