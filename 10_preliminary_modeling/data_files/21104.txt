Ann and I had a beer and whiskey. Barbara and brother Mike were there. They took the beer. I told Ann, "We won't have any meat today for a change because I am sick of it for a while." I picked up a small object off the table and it was a marrow bone. I threw it on the floor for Trixie. I was down in a deep cut at the end of a railroad line. There were rail ties built up on the side which held the sides from falling in. I looked at the bumper on the car and thought what would happen if the car bumper hit the wall hard. Baby Pauly came to my mind when I was in bed relaxing.
