I remember being in some sort of a classroom with many people, whom I don't know. Then I walked down a hall and went into what appeared to be a movie or an auditorium with a screen in the front. There seemed to be something on the screen, but I don't remember what. When everyone started to get up, I looked behind me and saw an army officer, male, middle-aged and bald on top. He started walking toward the front of the room. Then I looked toward the screen and there was pictured some army officers who looked busy, as if in conference or something, but they were standing and moving around. Then I saw my brother in the background on the screen. He was in uniform and pacing back and forth. He had a trench coat draped over his left arm, and he looked unconcerned. (My brother is 24.) Next I remember leaving the movie and going through two open doors which appeared to be elevator doors, and led into an elevator. I went in and before the doors closed, people started turning around, saying, "Close the doors," apparently because light was shining into the dark auditorium. The doors finally closed by themselves and I felt relieved. That is the end of the dream.
