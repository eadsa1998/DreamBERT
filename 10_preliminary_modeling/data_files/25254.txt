 I'm with my friends Hilary Nano and Annette Gollum, and a 14 year old girl I don't know. I have sex with each one of them separately in a very short time span, but I don't ejaculate in any of the encounters. I'm with Hilary in a room. She doesn't believe that I didn't ejaculate. I tell her to give me fellatio, and if I don't ejaculate for a long time, she knows that I did before. On the other hand, if I ejaculate quickly upon receiving fellatio, she knows I was aroused previously, but did not ejaculate.
