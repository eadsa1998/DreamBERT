 I'm in a building which seems to be like Carter School. Ice blocks crumble from a neatly stacked pile. People are killing other people, defending themselves from others who are deranged. The stab of a knife has affected these deranged people. To kill a person, people cut the throat and cut the head off the person. People go around killing the affected people. I'm the last of the unaffected people who hasn't been stabbed by the knife. I'm in a parked car that seems to be near the basketball hoops outside Carter School, with two people, one of whom has been stabbed. I'm in the back seat on the passenger side. I reach up and cut the throat of the stabbed, but seemingly okay, person in the front passenger seat. At some point, I kill the other person in the car too. I am in my friend Gino Teavor's back yard in Oak Valley. I imagine the last being: the final all-powerful cause of this affliction. He is not there. I imagine he is there, and that we fight. I spin, and with my back towards him, I ring his neck under my right arm and slit his throat, killing him.
