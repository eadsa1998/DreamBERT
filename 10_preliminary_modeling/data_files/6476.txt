I was reading books that Will had just written. Very Will. The covers were dark, mottled, evil looking, with shadowy pictures of him all over them, smoking cigarettes, wearing his boots, being evil. I read them through. They seemed very much like something Will would write, very natural. I thought they were unfocused, diffuse, full of sarcastic laughter and evil -- very good. They were like other of his writings but much better. <br/
