Dreamed I was on top of a hill. There were ancient gothic type buildings built into it, or something that felt that way. There was an antagonist. He was chasing me. I felt like I could always dodge him or it, but he kept trying to get at me. There was some sort of strange social circle surrounding this; it was part of like a co-op. I was there only temporarily. It was going to come to an end soon -- or I was leaving -- and I was trying to get people together to have a party. The rooms were open, like gazebos, and made from wood.
