We had an excursion and went to some famous dead artist's place in this old abandoned town. There were old buildings in the town. When we got into the artist's place, there were animal costumes and I put on a llama outfit. There were also statues and things around. We went into this elevator, which was on the outside of the building and it started shaking and I said "We should've taken the stairs". Selena had this other animal costume on and we were pretending to be a couple and were taking photos together, but they all turned out blurry. We were then playing some pass the parcel game and I was next to Eugene. We had to all put our arm around the people next to us and so Eugene had his arm around me and I was extremely nervous about it. He fell asleep, but his arm slipped off and he woke up. Nana was also around. We were staying in a room that was really high up (the building was really tall). We had to climb up this ladder and there was a secret password. Eugene, Shen and I were staying in a room. These bad guys were coming and Shen said "oh no". I was looking in my sandwich to see what I had.
