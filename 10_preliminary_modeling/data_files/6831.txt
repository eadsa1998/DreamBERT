She has to find her officers for O.E.S. I agree to be her Ruth. She has to preside tonight but she hasn't yet got her guest officers. I suggest Hap. I am looking over magazines and show her a picture 2 _ by two inches of a child with leis, in color a dull rose and ask if that wouldn't make a nice picture for a scrapbook. I am not thru the magazine when I lay it aside and go upstairs to help her. See Sadie and others lying diagonally on a long dark green couch at the side of the lodge room. Tell her it won't be so bad because it's past officers' night. (It will be next meeting.)
