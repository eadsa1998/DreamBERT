I had my own Uluri on, and I was experimenting with it.  First wearing both cords on top of my clitoris, pressing (like how Lynn and I started it that night when we invented it.).  Then open beside the clitoris in various beaded and corded positions, for stimulation.  Then I was practicing and experimenting reaching orgasm with it.  (Explicit sex with Lynn described here, which I have deleted in this copy.)  There was a sense throughout the dream that I was experimenting for marketing and production, and for the text to go on the insert pamphlet that will go inside the Uluri box.  So I was searching for ways to describe these techniques to customers as I was doing them.
