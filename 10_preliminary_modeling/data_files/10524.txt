I visit Pedro in a motel; there is a big king-sized bed half made up. I wait for him to get ready to leave for the airport. I ask which side Kevin slept on and sit on the other side (!) I get a telephone call from someone at the "Y." The person wants to go bowling or play some game. I say "I just woke up" and slam down the receiver.
