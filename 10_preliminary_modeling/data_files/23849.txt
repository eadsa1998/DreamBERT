Not a very clear dream.  I was at a conference with two bosses and other people, co-workers.  Felt like a hotel or a boat.  I was not happy, there was some issue of hierarchy that was bugging me, or people were dissing me or leaving me out.  I felt out of place.  But when I thought of my own individuality, apart from them, I still saw humor and playfulness.  I was sitting at a table with the two bosses, and trying to rearrange my chair or the chairs at the table.  I felt like they disapproved of me or thought a woman shouldn't be there.  I bumped my head on the umbrella or the pole in the middle of the table, trying to rearrange it.  I moved the umbrella up or expanded it outward and tilted it to get it out of the way, I was frustrated and feeling self-conscious, not wanting to be there.  Also in this dream I craved chocolate.
