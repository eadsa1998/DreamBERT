My friend Sandy rang me. She was all upset that an aunt of hers had bought black, magenta and lavender tiles for the bathroom. My daughter and I were at my childhood home, which was empty of others. While we were waiting, I think for my husband, we lit a fire using ice-cream sticks and wrappers in the fireplace.
