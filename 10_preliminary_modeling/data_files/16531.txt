I was going on a trip with Mom and Dad and two other strange girls, and we had to go on a train or a bus and we were going to some foreign city in the middle of the country. And I had a seeing-eye dog, but I had absolutely no training in what to do and how to do it. I only knew a few things that I had to do, and so I'm trying to manage this big dog and keep him under control, and get in this bus and this train. And then I switched to another scene suddenly where we were in a hotel room with Mom and Dad and these two strange girls, and it was a really small, like one-bedroom room, like they are. And the carpets were red, and the walls were kind of bleah, yellowy. And we were playing this game with like a bunch of letters and little design things that you were supposed to pull out of a box and make words. And whatever the words said you had to do. And Dad wasn't really playing the game. He was laying down in front of the bed, so whenever we were walking around, we had to step over him. And I was remembering how I was putting my personal stuff under the bed because I didn't want the two strange girls messing it up. And I don't remember too much about what words we were making in the game, but one of the girls like laid near my stomach and sat on my back and like waved a paint brush between my legs, and I was so scared because I couldn't kick; I couldn't get her off of me and I was afraid of what she was going to do to me. And, let's see, was there anything else? I don't think so. That was all there was.
