I am in my bedroom. I hear Arvonne and her friend, a tall woman, moving a yellow dresser from her room to the living room. I hear Arvonne exclaim angrily as she sees a white dresser already out there, "It's always her daughters. They always leave things out here." I feel guilty because I think I should have moved it back into my room. I feel selfish.
