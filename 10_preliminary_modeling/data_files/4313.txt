["A screw loose."] I am holding an intricate balloon set up Ernie gave me, perhaps something from the blood tests. I notice a screw is loose and I am trying to tighten the fastener. It isn't aligned correctly and as I fiddle with it, I walk out to the van. I see that all the rocks I gathered up from a creek bed are piled around the passenger seat. But Jake wants them to be moved. So I stand outside the van leaning in and scooping up handfuls of rocks some plain rocks shaped like potatoes and some white crystal like rocks. There are a lot of them and I keep scooping and moving. The rocks are now between the seats and a bit back into the van. Now I get into the driver's seat. I suddenly drop the screw out of the balloon fastener. Lydia comes over and I say can you help me look for it? I point to the floor of the van at the driver's seat to several screws. I say these are big ones that don't fit. It's a tiny screw. She is trying to help me look.
