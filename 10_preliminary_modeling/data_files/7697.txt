There was something oddly familiar about this. I was at a meeting. I think at the hospital. I felt like I had been at this meeting before. There were several large round tables. Doctor Bl was sitting at one of those tables. I sat at another. Someone was sitting on both sides of him, though there was an empty chair at his table. We had been given manuals by the presenter to follow along. The pages were glossy and the colors were shades of beige/brown/gold. The man I was sitting next to had his book open to a different page than I did. Doctor Bl's was open to a still different page. I changed mine to the same page as Doctor Bl. The man next to me, whom I felt was superior in some way, told me that was wrong. That page said 1999-2000 goals and objectives. The man next to me finally convinced me it was the wrong page so I turned to the page he was on. I was walking outside, back to the meeting. Another woman walked up alongside me and took my hand. I asked her if we had met at this same meeting the last time. She said yes. She appeared older than me, with very full, shoulder length, straight, salt and pepper hair. I never did see her face. She was getting ready to take lunch to a group of people. It was part of, or an exercise of, this meeting. She stated that she had done it the last time and found it very rewarding. We had the option to take lunch to someone or to have a spiritual lunch by ourselves. She left and I prepared my car/mini-van to take lunch to some people. I had the car running and the AC running so it would cool off. It was a beautiful summer day. I remember how green the grass was. As I was doing this I felt excited like it was a very good think to do and that I would enjoy it. Then I saw other people sitting in the grass and eating lunch alone or in pairs. I thought maybe I should do the same. I remember thinking that I didn't know who I would take lunch to anyway.
