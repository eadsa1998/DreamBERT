 I'm in a camp or a group with a bunch of German people. One or several of them seem to be my mom's cousins. There is a fire started and the end of a log is burning. I break off the burning end by stomping on it. There is a basketball court made of dirt, and a poorly constructed basketball hoop. One lady tells a story about milk in Germany. She talks about how a German family left for a vacation and left the milk sitting out. They were gone for a weekend. The heater was shut off for the weekend and turned back on upon their return. The milk was somehow still good when they got back, and they drank it. The rest of the things in their house were spoiled, and had to be thrown out. I meet my sister Ramona, and her friend, who people are saying I am supposed to like. Her friend is the same age as Ramona, and may be German. I shake both of their hands. There are people in the kitchen making something with cottage cheese. The cottage cheese is bad: it has spoiled. There is more cottage cheese in the refrigerator, which is our refrigerator at home. My mom is there.
