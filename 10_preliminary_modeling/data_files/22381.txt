Last night I dreamt that I felt like flying and that I got off the ground. In my dream I felt I was in the air flying. I could see the whole city and I went to the university and saw all my friends going into class, and when they saw me, they greeted me, without seeming surprised. Then I went back home and laid in bed and in front of me I saw some car keys on a sofa. I went out running and got to a car which was parked in front of my uncle's house. I got in and drove it around everywhere, going up hills, going to Callac and picking up two girls on the Marine Ave. I dropped one of them and took the other to a solitary place, but she refused to be in such a place, so I took her to her home, an apartment, and there was nobody there. She invited me to come in and asked me to help her with some Math problems. I did this and when we were finished, we went to her bedroom and I undressed her, and was undressed myself. Then we laid down in bed and made love. The next day I went out looking for the car, but it was no longer there. I desperately searched for it everywhere until I arrived home and found my uncle who was looking for his car, without knowing who had stolen it. I said nothing to him and went out again, looking for the car, and I found it abandoned on a highway. I took it back to my uncle's house and told him that I had found it by chance. He didn't believe me and told my parents, who punished me by hiding my pencils and drawing papers. They locked me inside a non-existent room, without windows and with a very small door through which I could hardly get in. That's all I remember about my dream.
