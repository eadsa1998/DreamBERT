Before I tell the dream, I just want to say this. I have a huge fear of sharks. I was at the seashore with my mom. I was swimming on the waves when a big wave washed me on top of a pile of shark fins. All of the sudden I heard someone screaming, "No! Help me. He's dead." I turned around and the ocean had turned into a pool that went for about 30 feet and dropped off sharply. People were playing in the water. A huge shark was right next to the shelf. All I could see was a giant dorsal fin, twice the size of me, and part of its back. It was eating a person. An elderly lady was on the edge screaming. Her arm and leg were bloody stumps. One lifeguard was in the water and the other was with the lady. The shark threw an old man with a shark tooth through his chest up into the air in play. The lifeguard that was out of the water grabbed him out of the air and laid him on the ground. The shark threw the body of the other lifeguard up into the air. The body was decapitated and was missing a leg. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my mom moving toward them, as if to help. I grabbed my mom and stopped her. I knew that anybody who tried to help would get eaten. Then I woke myself up.
