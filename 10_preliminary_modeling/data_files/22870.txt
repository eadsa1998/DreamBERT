Morty Tohnes was carrying a shotgun and crawling into a sort of doghouse.  I was afraid he was going to shoot me, accidentally or otherwise. Jim Wheeler [Morty's half brother] and I were in a hay loft sort of like Uncle Jack's in Freedom City, with a door in the front.  I looked out and saw a lot of people moving out of the barn and heading for the house-kind of backing up.  Someone was ordering them out of the barn,  I walked cautiously to the door and peered over the edge and saw just a glimpse of a reddish forehead.  I knew it was Clayton Thome, and that if I stuck my head out in sight he would shoot me, for he had a shotgun, and was looking up when I saw him.  I ducked back inside and told Jim.  Jim went to see for himself.  I was afraid he would get shot, but he didn't.  We started looking for a place to hide or escape, for we were sure Clayton was coming up.
