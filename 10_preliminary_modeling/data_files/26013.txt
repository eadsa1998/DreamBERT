 I'm at Fishing Haven driving my truck down the driveway to the 15 Mile property. It's a dangerous road consisting of big rocks. There is a cliff next to the left side of the road as one drives down. I go slowly. The road is uneven because the rocks are so big. I think the rocks look different because I haven't been down the road for several days. I've been staying home, which may be there, reading and such. I go inside and set a green glass bottle of beer in the refrigerator. It may be Heineken. The twist off cap of the bottle is twisted so the seal is broken a little bit. My old roommate Sean Williams is moving things around a lot. The refrigerator and the freezer are moved. The floors are wooden. The rooms are bigger. Some other Fishing Haven employees come. One or two of them are new. We don't talk. I know they are new. My former coworkers Tom Olson, Amy Rancher, and Jenny come in. I immediately ask Jenny if she has my books, and as I do I realize it may be rude to ask that right away. She has one book with her, and hands it to me. It's gray and black, and it may be "Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande". I see and hear Amy tell Jenny to ask me something. Jenny asks me if I want to go into town and go to a movie. I don't want to spend the time going into town, but I don't want to turn Jenny down, and she is attractive, so I say, "I'd love to." I change my clothes right there. Tom and Amy wrestle. I wonder why Jenny asked me out. I think she and Tom must have broken up, and now Tom is dating Amy. Jenny is folding my clean laundry. I ask her what she is doing, and tell her not to fold my laundry! I take the gray wool pair with the red stripe to wear and throw the rest in my suitcase.
