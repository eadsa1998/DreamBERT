I was at my old high school and there was an assembly being held out between the two buildings and all of the home rooms were drawn up together and they were all in alphabetical order. So I ran to find my place and it was a place I would have had with my married name, not the one that I would have had before. Everybody was just lined up in rows. Then this airplane came over very low, a very big airplane, and started giving us directions to do various things and I forget what the first thing they wanted us to do was and the second thing was to all come together in a tight little circular mass and everybody had to be in this. And we all did and then something happened. I don't know what it was. Maybe the airplane blew up or something strange happened and lots and lots of people got hurt. This was all sort of like a, it wasn't quite real. It was like something you would read about or perhaps imagine happening. Then everybody was lying around on the ground and everything. There may have been a lot of people hurt, but not many people looked hurt. All these different magazines were lying around--Life and Time and New Yorker and everything. And Time Magazine was very concerned with this whole thing because somehow it was their fault or something. And a representative from Time Magazine was going around looking for his Time Magazine and asking us if we still liked Time Magazine and if we would still read Time Magazine, very stupid things like this. All the teachers were very concerned. They were afraid there was going to be some kind of a scandal connected with it. The parents weren't going to be very happy about all this which, of course, was probably quite true. So there was just all this discussion going on about it.
