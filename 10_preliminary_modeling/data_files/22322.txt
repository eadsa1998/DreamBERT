The second one was of a rather erotic nature. I was accompanied by two friends, B. and V., in the house of the latter. Some more boys arrived and they suggested we play poker. Since the bets had been raised after a few rounds, I was simply watching the game. We were in a hallway on the second floor which leads to several rooms. One of them had the door opened and one could see a window which faced the street in the background. Since I was beginning to get bored, I went to the window, which turned out to be in the room of V.'s sister, though she wasn't there then. The window faces a house which is about 10 yards away from the street (in real life, a friend who wasn't in the dream lives there). It was nighttime and I was watching the people on the sidewalk of the street where the house ended when R. (V.'s sister) came into the room and stood at my right side about two yards away and in front of a wall closet with sliding doors. The room was only lit by the light of the house across the street. I hesitated a few moments and told R., as an explanation, that I was supposed to meet a friend at 10 p.m. in front of the house and, looking at my watch, I told her that it was 10:05. She didn't answer; she didn't even move. She stayed like that a few moments, staring at me, and started to undress. Once naked, we started to kiss. I had closed my eyes, and opened them when I heard steps and voices coming towards the room. When I opened my eyes, I realized that we were both naked and somehow on her bed. The steps and voices kept coming closer and I started to dress in a hurry. I was nervous and couldn't move well. I felt clumsy, useless, scared. I was so involved with myself that it seemed that R. had disappeared. The voices were already behind the door, which was closed at that point. I was desperate. It was then, when the door was about to open, that I awoke, agitated and scared, and without having said a word to R., without even know what had happened to her in those moments.
