I was lying on a floor looking through a mirror. I saw the reflection of two girls about 10 years old. I could see up their dresses and I enjoyed looking at their legs. They could not see me, but one of them turned my way and I feared that she was suspicious about something, or that I was exposed some way so that she saw me. I was hidden behind something.
