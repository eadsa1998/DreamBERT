 I'm fishing with my dad, my sister Ramona, and Tom, my co-worker from Fishing Haven. We're on a porch in school. Around the porch is shallow, weedy water that we fish in. We catch toads and frogs. The toads are three or four inches long and wide: very big. I am going to hook a toad, and then it is a lure, and I try to thread a huge orange and yellow jig head into it. The jig (I think, or the toad?) cracks. <br/
