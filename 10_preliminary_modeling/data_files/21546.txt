I saw numbers 7th race, 1-3-4 and 8th race 4-1-2. Pete said I won $500. Leo came over by me with the paper. I wanted to look at the entries, but it was dark and I couldn't see the names clear enough, but then I saw 4-3-1 and I saw 4-4 for first or winner and I told Leo that number four was the winner. Eddie Palander came over to me and showed me a bull horse that he was to play. I said I was going to play it also because I was looking for a bull horse. I was trying to dream of the winner of one of six horses that are running the same day and the number four horse is showing himself.
