 I'm in a store in Forkville with my mom and my two sisters, Heather and Ramona. We're at a sort of foosball table that is made like a pinball machine with a little spring shooter made from wood that one pulls back. I'm talking to Heather about being responsible. My mom says she's going to take a walk. I say I'll meet her at Applebee's in 10 minutes. It is in the same plaza that we're in now. She says meet in one minute, not 10. She then goes out to the parking lot, which has a light layer of snow, and starts dancing around. I'm talking to Heather, telling her she has got to make good choices in life. I tell her she has to respect our mom and not be rude to her. I basically scold her for being a dumbass and tell her to shape up. Then I look at Ramona, but I don't say much to her.
