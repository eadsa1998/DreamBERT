 A large great white shark has been killed. It was hooked and then shot in the head. Oil, fat, and blood run out of the shark, turning the water purple. Others and I are not on the boat then, but drag the shark back through the water of a beach area by hand. People are there. The shark will have to be cut up and processed in a wooden shack where we have dragged it. It is big: about 20 feet long.
