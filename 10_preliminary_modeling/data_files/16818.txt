These Indians I was friendly with were planning to have a dance at a river. I had told some guy about it in a spirit of joy. I realized I had made a huge mistake. The man was planning an ambush and intended to kill them. I threatened to kill him if harm came to any one of them. I went to warn them. I could see the tribe painting their bodies and adorning themselves for the festive occasion. I felt tremendous love for them and I was sad and afraid that they would be killed and it would be my fault.
