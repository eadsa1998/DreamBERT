I saw This Miss. There was a big green moth or butterfly that landed on me. I picked it off by the wind and threw it up and it landed on me three times. I was in one of the city parks sitting in my shorts hunting ducks. I realized I left my shell in the car. A fellow came by and said, "Are you sure you are allowed to hunt here?" and I realized I was not, so I left the park. I was home by my mother's. It was dark. I walked into the house with a paper and I was surprised my sister Sue was there. I put the paper on a side. We had a baby at our house and I was loving it up. I kissed the baby on its mouth as it had it open.
