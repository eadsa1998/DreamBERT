The dream seemed to take place in the same locale as 096 and out on the porch of this house there was some apparatus set up for an unusual game, a game of skill, it was supposed to be. I don't understand now how it could really work, but there was a sort of rectangular box, say about 2 feet long and a foot wide, and in the center of this you place this little flat circular thing to which one end and shading into it very nicely and geometrically was this triangle pointer so that overall the thing was sort of cone-shaped. And on the bottom of this there was sort of a circular part with sort of a pointed piece of metal that stuck down, and I guess several other something had to be there to balance the thing. And you place this in the center pointing to one corner of the box. And then in the opposite corner you were supposed to do something in some manner with your own hands without actually touching the disk thing which would make it go up to and get to this other corner and have the pointed end of the triangle touch the corner. And it was a very delicately balanced thing. As a matter of fact, now that I remember, there was a little pointer underneath the pointed end of the triangle too and the whole thing was so sensitively mounted that any little thing would jar it. And as a matter of fact, it was picking up all these seismic waves, supposedly earthquakes all around, and there were so many earthquakes, however it seemed sort of strange there would be so many because this thing was constantly moving. And the method, I can't understand the method by which you were supposed to get this thing moving, going in the right direction, because really you weren't supposed to touch any part of the thing with your hands because it was some sort of parapsychological phenomenon. But it was supposed to have something to do with magnetism and that's really all I remember of this very complicated game.
