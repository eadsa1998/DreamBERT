We were on a train going somewhere. We had to spend the night en route at a hotel. As we were arriving she said perhaps we would not want to stay at so expensive place. But I said it was only for one night. So we went together. Someone said the town was so full that there were no rooms on the first floor. We were taken up immediately by the elevator to the third floor, where there were three beds. The bellboy said some one else would be with us. It was some one we expected. He showed us the bath across the hall and we tidied up. I opened my suitcase and found I had not forgotten my tweed coat. After washing, etc. I went back to room but had forgotten our number. We turned to the right and knocked on a door which opened and showed three men dressing. I hastily withdrew thinking I was glad I had knocked and at left found a confusion of rooms.
