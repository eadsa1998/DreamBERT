I was at school and in a gym. Autumn was there and she was a bit loopy. We got put into groups and Autumn pulled out a gun. She said she'd shoot my group or the other group. I think mine was bigger so she was lining up the other group to shoot them. Daryl was in the other group. I was then thinking "She'll probably let them go now" and she did. Someone noticed a scar on the back of her head -- she had a 'lobotomy'. There was food in the gym. I grabbed two of these chocolate things and left. I went to the common room which was bigger and different. Eugene and Darius were sitting in a chair behind ours. Calvin and I were on ours. Eugene was singing Love is All Around and I starting singing a little of it, quietly. Calvin said "Look around, it's your boyfriend". I was recording Eugene singing. Then I remembered that Mom was picking me and Ezra up so I left. I had some clothes on a clothes line and took mine off. Ms Pascal came and I asked if I needed help. I went to the car and Ezra was in the backseat, and I was wondering why he wasn't in the front. Then he moved to the front. Later we were in a car accident. The tip of my nose was bleeding. I think someone died and then I was at Mom's and Darren was making jokes and Mom told him who died and Darren decided to kill himself. Later I was playing a game and Darius was watching me and I was like "Go away".
