I was showing a boy about 15 around a printing plant. A press was printing red and black. I looked at a sheet and noticed that it only had red printing on it. Then I met another boy about 15. He wore glasses and was intellectual. He spoke to me about the mind. He said that the important thing is the other second thought. (Before going to bed yesterday, I pondered the problem of whether so-called opposites such as male and female are in fact opposites or "others.") Later I was with the first boy. As he walked out of earshot, a girl came over to me and commented that I was "sure getting friendly with that boy." "You must like him," she said. I felt embarrassed by her comment.
