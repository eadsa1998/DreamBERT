I lived in, or was staying in, this big house sort of near the sea/no close neighbours. Lots of windows around it. It was night and I was outside and it was windy. I went back inside and was worried there were dodgy people around. I locked the door. I sat in the dark, in the corner on my computer and I was watching the security cameras and saw quite a few guys sneaking around the side of the house. I called the police and said "I'm alone at [whatever the address was]" and the guy was like 'oh are you so-and-so's niece' and I said yes, yes and said there were dodgy guys. One came up to the door and just opened it and came in. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed two kitchen knives and stabbed him. I remembered Rover was in the house (it was just us) and I went to find him and saw a guy aiming a machine gun at him, and I threw one of the guys in front of him to protect Rover from the bullets. I slit two guy's throats at the same time, and stabbed the last guy. I think there were a few more guys that I also killed. Rover had gotten hurt and I called around for some kind of 'pet ambulance' and I sat with him, patting him.
