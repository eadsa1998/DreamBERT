 I'm in a classroom for Historical Geology. My professor Greg Welters has the class all go to a living room. We seem to be at my grandpa and grandma Redding's farmhouse. We eat food, including chips. A lot of crumbs are left on the floor. We watch a movie that goes until 7:30, a half hour late. We all gather our things up to leave. We were supposed to take our things with us from the classroom. I fold up a chair and put it in grandpa and grandma's bedroom, which might be Greg's room as well. Greg walks in wearing street clothes. He lives here.
