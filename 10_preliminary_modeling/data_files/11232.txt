I was standing in a railroad station. The location of the station was unknown to me, and all I noticed about it was that it was very bare and desolate. There was a great crowd of people in it, but I could not distinguish any of their features. As I stood there, I saw a man in an Army uniform of the first world war. I was puzzled because I could not distinguish his rank. On one sleeve he a had a red major's star, and on the other sleeve he had a gold and black private's stripe. I was looking for someone but could not find anyone due to the large group of soldiers that were boarding the train under the direction of this one soldier described before. As I watched, a soldier came running up to the station and just managed to board the train as it pulled out of the station. The thought struck me that the soldier was a girl that used to live next door to us, but had moved many years ago. I began to chase the train yelling that the last soldier was a girl and did not belong on the train.
