I need to pee. I find a room, only Dwight walks in and wants to pee. He goes to another room. Then Valerie is around. She seems upset about something. The way our family is. I am surprised she does try and talk to me nicely. I start to walk past the room Dwight is using. He says don't come here. I say It's OK. I won't.
