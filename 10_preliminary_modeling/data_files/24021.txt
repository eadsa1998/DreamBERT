I wanted to go to my girlfriend's house. My mom said no, because she didn't want to drive to her town from our town. Ten minutes later she said, "Okay, we're going, you don't have a choice." She practically shoved me into the car and we drove to my friend's house. All of the sudden we arrived at my other friend's house. (We all ride horses a lot.) She said to me, "Do you and our other friend want to ride?" I said, "Sure." She said, "Okay, I'll be right back." She came back with three horses tacked up and football gear for 3 people (I hate football, but my brother is a high school football star). We put on the gear and went to the arena, except it wasn't in an arena. It was a really nice football field. We were playing and the next thing I knew I was in my friend's house using the phone. I called my mom and she said she would come and pick me up. Then I started looking for canned foods. I went to the pantry and climbed to the top shelf. I found a whole bunch, but I just left it there. Then I started looking for towels for us to sleep on (even though my mom was coming to pick me up). All of a sudden my mom was there. I left. When we were just about to get off the freeway exit to our house, she turned around and went back to my friend's house. Then I was crying because I left my riding equipment in my closet at home.
