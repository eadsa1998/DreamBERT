I was at OLG Monastery. I think there was some kind of event going on because there were people there that I knew besides the sisters who live there. I think it was people from my SDI class. Or maybe it was family - or some of both. It might just be coincidence that I see someone there that I know. I had gone to use the bathroom. To the left and in front of the toilet were two closet kind of spaces, but instead of doors there were shower curtains. They had so much stuff in them that the shower curtains were pushed out a bit rather than hanging straight down. I pulled the curtain in front of me to the side a bit to look inside. I was talking to one of the sisters about professional closet organization. They had either won the service or someone was donating it. I was telling her it wasn't going to be anything elaborate or expensive, but rather something simple, neat and yet much more functional than what they have now. As I'm talking I'm thinking about their coat closet in the reception area. I'm motioning with my hands and saying, you know, a place to hang coats but also a place for hats, handbags and umbrellas. While I'm saying this I'm envisioning a wood organizing system and I'm wondering what the closet people will do for umbrella storage.
