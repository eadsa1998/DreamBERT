I'm staying in a house full of women. One of them has invited me there. It feels like a soap opera or a film. I'm in a spare room or a living room just having slept on the sofa or in a pile of clothes. It's a large, cluttered timber house with several stories - it feels like a boat. There's a spiral staircase or a lift. One of the females may have smuggled me in here. There may be, or have been, something going on between me and one of these women. Perhaps they are all friends, like a student house, or perhaps they are all sisters.
