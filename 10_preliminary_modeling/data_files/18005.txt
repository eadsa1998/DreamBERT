Me and John were in my study and this guy was climbing up on a ladder outside the house and he was black. And me and John hid and he found me. And then me and John went downstairs and he wasn't there anymore. And then we saw a guy with claws when we were in the den and we ran upstairs into John's room and then he slid. We ran into mom's room and hid under the bed and me and John laughed. And then dad came in Â­ he was the guy with the claws.
