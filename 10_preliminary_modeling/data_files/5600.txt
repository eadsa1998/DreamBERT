[1997-05-29] Had a dream, not a very happy one. My mother came into the room and told me that my Uncle Joe from Missouri, had passed away. I don't think I was here in my house, I think I was in my old home in Ashford where I used to live and my cousin Jan was there. I got up and everybody was having coffee and doughnuts. My aunt, who has passed away in 1984 was there, and at this table with everyone else. She was a fabulous person, my dad's sister, I guess she was my favorite of all my aunts. She used to take care of me after school.
