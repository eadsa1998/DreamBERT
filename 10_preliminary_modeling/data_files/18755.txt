Me and Rudy were going on a trip. To get credit for the trip, we had to fly back from a different place. There was a connecting flight that wasn't listed on the schedule. It was the way we had to go. The middle stop was not written in the schedule--but it was the only way to get there. We were at a celebration--a wedding. There was a moving braid of people--3 lines of people--moving and inter-woven like a braid of hair, and our thumbs hooked around a guide rope and slid like coat hangers. 3 girls were in front in long dresses. Bending their knees ever so slightly to dip to the music--without moving their heads or arms. The young girl forgot the 3rd dip and did it alone out of sequence with the others. The audience laughed. I had moved into a place--an apartment complex next to lakes. I discovered a Key Food and another grocery store ???. Key Food had a moving on special. I went to the lakes. You weren't suppose to swim in any lake. One was designated swimming because the big one was for fishing. I cut my foot on the bottom. There was a small kitten. It was too small to walk or take care of itself. So it went back in its mother's stomach. You could see it in the X-ray. It was tiny.
