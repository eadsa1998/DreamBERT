A tribe of Indians came upon us flying like shields. We got hold of the shields and mounted them and flew them also. When you were on, you seemed to be free from attack. A young girl tried to get my shield down. I tried to get away from her, but couldn't, so I picked her up and I flew with her. I put my hand on her vagina and she said I came. I let her off to a shanty with a young man and I left. The Indians got the flying shields back from us somehow and were guarding them. I got to them through my knowledge of the chief and when I got to the shields, a guard jumped out to stab me. I got hold of his hand and pushed the dagger away from me. I gave him the high sign and he relaxed. I was a friend. I then left and had to get a fellow to go with me to kill the guard. I heard it was Joe Hlavah. I came to a meeting place and asked for Joe and a fellow pointed to a table to the right. I looked there and there he was. I got him and we got the flying shields. I saw a parade of them coming our way. I yelled at our men to get off their horses. We would meet with the shields and Indians and make peace. I was doing a fancy dance for a dance I was to act in.
