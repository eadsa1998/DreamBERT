A family Christmas gathering. I see Doug leaning over the face of an older, ugly woman, perhaps an Aunt. He's standing behind her and she's tilted back looking up at him. He drools on her face. I feel disgust. I am seated on a couch, but I am crouched or squatting behind my cousin Patricia. My knees are hugging her back. It's a friendly posture. I give Jake a box of 20 different colored felt markers. I watch his face. He's not pleased and I feel bad. He then opens my second present which is more of the same. I say, "I'm sorry, did I give you the same thing? I'll change it." He walks away, unhappy. I follow him and tell him I want to talk. Jake isn't interested, but I persist. "You're nearly 40 now and looking at your life, what have you accomplished? What time do you have left to do, what?" Jake scoffs and ignores me as he usually does.
