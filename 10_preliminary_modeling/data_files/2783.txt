I am a cowboy and must help save my buddy held captive in a barn. I sneak up on the barn and make noises so they will come out and chase me and two other men. They ride away in another direction, leading the bad men after them and I circle around and sneak up again on the barn. I see a wad of money stuck in the barn wall and more is handed to me by somebody riding on a horse. I yell and maybe throw some money at the ones in the barn and they come after me. I ride fast and they follow, shooting, and I lean frontward over the horse, trying not to get shot. I am worried because they are catching up and I'll die. I see a train and I yell, "Is this the St. Louis car?" Someone says no and finally after several tries, I grab the last car and crawl up into it. Someone says, "That's the St. Louis car," and I say, "Yes, that's what I've been waiting for," or "Good, this is what I want." I met someone and they were from St. Louis and I loved them and now I'm going to go find them.
