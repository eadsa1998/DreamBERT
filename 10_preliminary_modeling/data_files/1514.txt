I am across the hall. I find a dress and a pair of undies in a dresser drawer. I hear the kids and Howard coming down the hall toward me. I look. They all march past in a single file, with dower faces on, especially Howard. He is followed by a little boy named Dwight wearing an expensive, white, embroidered shirt. Paulina tries to help me take off my shoes and knee high socks. I laugh and say, "You're not much help!" (In the previous dream with cat, I remember that I hadn't made love to my husband Howard for years. I feel a little bad and think, "Oh well, maybe I'll start." The very next thought was, "No! I won't do that!")
