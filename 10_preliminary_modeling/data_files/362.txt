The apartment is nearly empty - are we moving in or out or what? There've been some others here but I'm alone at the moment, and I can see out the front window an old woman's getting out of her car with a gift package. I don't want to see her - she's a nuisance. I'm not dressed, either, and I grab a robe and try to get myself covered up in case I'm discovered, and when I see she really is making for the stairs I fumble into the back and try to hide under something. Apparently she goes away, though, and my friends come in. We talk about the plants. I still want to know if I can plant the poinsettias, and I think (Mike?) might know, but he's not sure himself. I notice somebody's moved the hanging baskets. Why? Very strange.
