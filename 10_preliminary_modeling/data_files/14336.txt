We went to a restaurant, like Retro Betty's. We were in two groups; one included Mom and the other had Dad and Ezra. Mom said "We're here for Brad Pitt's birthday" and the lady took us to a table that only seated four and I said 'no, we want to sit together'. She left and we all sat in this booth in the far corner. I had to sit next to Ezra. Then I was somewhere else and climbed up this ladder onto a platform. There were shopping bags up there, filled with lots of biscuits and chocolate snacks and bread. It was our shopping from weeks ago that we had forgotten about. I took all the bread out, as it was all moldy but took down the bags with the snacks and went to show Mom. She was next door. I went over and there was an old lady there and they made me take over the vacuum and vacuum this small patch of carpet in the lounge. They went into the dining room or something. There were two cockroaches on the kitchen tiles and I called out and told them but they said not to worry and continue vacuuming. Then I was playing a game, like Sims 2. I had to pick a setting for the Sim and other random stuff like that, as well as creating them. There were a few backgrounds which were really detailed, but they made it look cluttered and I couldn't decide on what to do. This guy told me to not try and make it fancy and just make it how I want it.
