 I am in a group of men who are older than I. We are going to do some sort of sport or recreational activity. They know and call me by my name. They ask me if I am drooling, or something like that, with fluid on my face that looks like snot. I say yes, I am, as if it is a good thing to do, as if it is something I should be doing.
