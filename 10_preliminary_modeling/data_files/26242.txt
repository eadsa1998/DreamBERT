 I argue with my housemate Jack Thigpen about the heater in his room. I sit down at the kitchen table at home in Oak Valley. I am overbearing and firm. Jack says he doesn't want to look me in the eyes. Then he does. I look right at him and tell him he can't leave his heater on when he's not in his room, or else he has to give us $45 for the electricity he'll use by doing so.
