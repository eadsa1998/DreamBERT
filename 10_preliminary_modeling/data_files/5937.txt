I enter a bar with a baby who appears to be my granddaughter. A baby high chair with sawed off legs is on the bar surface and I place her in it. Somehow I have a feeling she is my daughter and I her mother. Someone brings dried kidneys and crumbles them in her soup (someone else had previously brought her the soup and she started eating it right away and I was pleased). I protest as this second stranger puts the kidneys in the soup, thinking that now she will not finish the soup ... but she continues to eat and again I feel relieved and pleased.
