 I'm in cornfield running with the Brimson men's basketball team. I, or we, are looking for a person on the team. It may be Jordan Mallstrom, or it may be a shorter, fatter guy. The coach Yar Glenn is then giving the team a speech, telling them to not listen to the new woman who is helping coach the team. He says to listen to him. I am playing basketball with my friends Jimmy Youngman and Sam Crimson on a big mat, the kind used for the high jump. I pretend to play well. I think that four players out of some five players must be on the New York Knicks team.
