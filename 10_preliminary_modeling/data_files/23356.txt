I have never seen this celebrated house (the Fairbanks Mansion) at Dedham, though its picture is familiar enough. When I viewed it in my dream the only odd thing I noted was that the middle section of the long, rambling building was built of brick. Around the homestead stretched green fields in full sunshine. All was peaceful and quiet excepting that across the road a barn was burning with more smoke than flame. I felt a mild concern for the historic house, but, considering its distance from the ire and the stillness of the air, I believed it to be reasonably safe.
