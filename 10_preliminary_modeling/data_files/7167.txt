Now all the people were gone and H. hadn't come for me. Probably she thought Star wouldn't be out so soon. Then the host came and asked me how I was getting home. I said that H. was to have come for me. Perhaps I had better phone and I started to look for a phone. I saw the host and two strangers trying to climb up the steep bank on which the house was built but they could get up only a few feet.
