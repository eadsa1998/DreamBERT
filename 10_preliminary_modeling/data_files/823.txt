Later, I was in a house with 2 teenagers (boy and girl), supposedly my children. We had shut and locked all the doors and windows because awful bats that could suck out all our feelings and insides were trying to get in and get us. The front door wasn't really a front door. A branch from a tree was the door. There were holes in it that the bats could fly through. I got a heavy hatchet but the handle was a small, dry, breakable, flexible twig. I was going to kill the bats as they came in. I could sense them out in the dark. I went to the branch. It semi-fell down. Then birds, white with pretty eyes, started to come through. I had to chop and chop on their necks. Bloody, and their heads fell off. It was hard to kill them. Then they went away. My "children" said, "Oh, thank goodness, it's all over." I didn't believe it. I was still worried. Then people came through the door. They were friendly, in a group, moving in. I knew that they were going to get us. I wouldn't let them near me. My kids went to them. One grandmother kissed my son. I felt heartsick. They were going to finally get us.
