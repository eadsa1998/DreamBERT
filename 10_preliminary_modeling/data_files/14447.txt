I was at university. Our speech was actually a play that we had to do in front of the whole school. We were in large groups. I asked our teacher how we were supposed to remember all the lines and she said that we would. Ezra was in the audience. Afterwards, we were given the day off. I was going to ask if she meant we could go home, or we still had to stay there. She said "Are you going to ask me something? Shut up". I walked out and called Mom and she said she was busy seeing a heap of people. I said I was let out early and she said it was too bad. I went to the bus stop, crossed the road and the bus was right there. There was a car coming towards me in the wrong lane. I got onto the bus, sat down and then went and tagged on. I didn't know the route though. When it was close to where I needed to go, I got off. I ended up at a shop. There were two Targets in it. I got to the door to leave, and it was all dark. I was with someone else (a girl) and we were trying to get away from someone. We went out to the carpark. We found the girl's car. This other girl was chasing us and she got in, so we ran. We went to this other car and the key worked. We got in and locked the doors. The seat was low down. I put it up and then started to drive. It was hard to see. The lights were red, but I couldn't stop in time and I drove through as it turned green. I think I went back to a bus stop.
