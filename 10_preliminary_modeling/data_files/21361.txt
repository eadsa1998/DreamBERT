I was watching Brandy Last and another horse racing. It was still like a shadow running or moving across. One was ahead of Brandys last and he came up and seemed to nose out the other horse. I was sitting outside. I saw a bird trying to catch a bee. Then the bee came at me. I had on a pair of leather mittens and I kept on balking him as he tried to attack me. We fellows from Whites went to a party. We were drinking whiskey.
