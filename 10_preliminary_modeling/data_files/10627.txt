There was a gigantic party in a place that looked like my old school, but everyone was from my high school. I came with Tina and Polly and they both split. Tina went with Heidi. Then from the second balcony I saw Polly and two other classmates, all in matching outfits -- black shirts and orange sweaters. I asked if I could have some clothes, but slightly different ones. So we all went to a train that took you to a building in the air. It stopped really fast at the third floor, but one of the girls lived on the second floor. It was a train/plane/elevator. She gave me an outfit and I went to the party. I met a black guy that looked like Malcolm Jamal Warner (Cosby Show) and we screwed around. I don't really know who he was, but we went to his house and I didn't really like him after we screwed around.
