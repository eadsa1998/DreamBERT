I can't remember properly, but this guy and his mother lived in a fancy house at a shopping center, as they had shop things there. One day he saw someone who was vampire like and he stabbed them in the heart. He told people about it and they thought he was crazy. Soon after, there were lots at his door and he was stabbing them all with sharp things and then he found his mother and asked if all the doors and windows were locked. She said they were. They closed the blinds and snuck along under the windows. They looked out a window and they could see the entrance of the store (the store was circular). There were some vampires lining up. They went out another entrance and they turned around and started coming at him. He managed to kill all of them. Then they got back up and it had been set up by his mother to show him that there were no vampires. It now had been an episode of a show and I had thought it was a good idea. Jasper and Fatso were back and they were all at Ezra's room.
