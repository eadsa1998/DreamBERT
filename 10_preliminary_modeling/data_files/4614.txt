["The fairy tale castle and chaos."] I am in a town on the outskirts. In a huge fairy tale castle. I had been sleeping in a car. Charla was there. Katrina drives up with her small children. Her youngest daughter looks like Lydia's (Anastasia's friend)'s youngest daughter. She is whining and crying. Like a spoiled brat. I am annoyed at her. I am trying to gather up some things. Then I go into a bar. Lots of people there. I am insulting and yelling at most of them. I say mean things to Charla. Then I go to the Fairy Tale castle. Looking for the city's King that lives there. Instead, I find three women roommates that live in the front room. The room is very cluttered and messy. I crawl up on the fireplace mantle. I am very annoyed with them. for being very irresponsible. I leave the castle very unhappy with them and me.
