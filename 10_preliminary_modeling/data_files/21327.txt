I was going thru or near a fence and there was a big dog there. He came at me. I sort of went up above and the fence, but the dog jumped up almost over the high fence and tried to bite me. He did that a few times and I sort of had to go higher, so he couldn't get me. I was out in the country hunting. I saw men shoot at some pheasants that flew over. I saw some fly over very high, so I shot at them, but couldn't reach them. Bill Kotnik was mad because he wasn't getting any work. I was walking over a lot of chips and I think I crawled over them. Roosik, the old real estate man from the old neighborhood, was at my home with another friend. We sat in the parlor and I told him how nice it was we had a cross ventilation in our home, but it was not so cool in the summer now like when we first moved out here because the place was not so built up like now. I looked out and saw all the homes now. I pointed out what was all fields before now it is all homes. I was looking at a picture of some rich man. He had the race results on the picture and it was supposed to have played some kind of a five-horse parley or a system of this type.
