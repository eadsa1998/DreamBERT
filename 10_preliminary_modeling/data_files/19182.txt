we were in the physiology laboratory, and I was wired to the Grass polygraph with electrode leads from my head. I have one lead from the center of my forehead that was held on with a big elastic band around my head, and we were using this to measure sodium pump mechanism, which is all screwy. I mean you couldn't possibly do it this way. Anyway the sodium was outside and the potassium was inside. To get an action potential, the membrane, I think in this case it must have been a skull which was depolarized and sodium flowed inside. The potassium flowed outside. When I kept thinking, every time I thought was the sodium flowing inside and the potassium flowing outside, I was thinking this was kind of a screwy situation because we really can't measure this and we're measuring it this way. It's kind of all hodge-podge, mixed up. Martha was one of the lab partners. Day residue: Martha was my lab partner yesterday. I have been wired up to the polygraph for EKG's and ECG's and EEG's. The sodium pump mechanism is a membrane potential for a cell for the body, and we've been studying this in cell physiology. It was a mix-up of day residue mostly.
