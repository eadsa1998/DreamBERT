I am seated on a bench on a porch with a man and we are talking. There are other people strolling around, some women being catty about me. Another man sits by me on the swing. Someone is showing a video of a famous celebrity talking about E City. I say "Oh, I love E City. I describe the scene to the man by me. I tell him this is an arts fair (Saturday market). He admires what fun we seem to be having and how progressive. Then a road that leads to the ocean. I am puzzled and say, "We don't have an ocean at E City. Maybe this is someplace else." Now I am going down the road and see the waves. As I round the corner, I see it's a wide river with big boats causing the waves. I say "Oh, this is the big river, the W. In Dover." We go down by the river and I point out the newly built modern bridge. I get upset being so close to the churning water and say, "We have to go back up to the road. I get scared near deep water." I try to crawl up through a grate-covered hole. He is wanting to explore the bridge more and moves his grate so it covers my entrance hole. I say, "Help me please." He then pulls me up by the arm, concerned not to hurt me. I make it up and then say "OK, now we can explore the bridge."
