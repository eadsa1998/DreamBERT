I had a gadget. It was a light switch that turned on when a section of the wall was pulled out. I showed it to a man who resembled an employee in the hospital's carpenter shop where I worked when I first arrived here almost five years ago. (He has not spoken to me since I was involved in a plot to run away from the hospital in December, 1960.)
