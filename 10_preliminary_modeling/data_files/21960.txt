I was by some neighbors'. Mike P. (deceased) came home with the groceries. He stopped by Ann and me and offered us beer. We didn't want any. We just were thru with our meal. A lady invited one of our friends to her house for some drinks. Anna and I didn't go. There seemed to be a murder, but the evidence was not found. The sheriff and a posse gathered. They had a hunch where the murderer would be if he was not murdered. I noticed the sheriff had a small gold badge. Instead of a large one.
