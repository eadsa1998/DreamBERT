I was on the second floor of a rather large house. It was summer and the windows were open. As I looked out I saw a huge lawn with a group of people gathered under a tree. I decided to go out to see what they were doing. The scene changed to a basement. There were tables and chairs in it and I was sitting next to a girlfriend of mine (age 18). I looked around and saw a door which evidently led to a subbasement; the door opened and a young fellow came out with a package in his arms. Again the scene shifted and I was walking our dog on the green lawn.
