I was back home again, and I was on my s_____ upstairs and we had somehow I was getting to have all these tons of things on my hard drive, and I needed the space for audio and I didn't know how these things were getting on there. And I, you know how sales people call sometimes and they solicit their marketing and stuff? Well, this girl called the house and she was selling things, and I started asking her a bunch of questions about things and she didn't really know the Mac platform that well, but she knew about things ____ and I thought that maybe the fact that the beautiful angel statue's wing cracked off, I thought that maybe that was screwing up my system somehow. [laugh] And I told her that, and, of course, she probably thought I was crazy. And she decided she was going to come over to the house to see what I was talking about, and to help me out, and then I kind of, I went online somewhere, which is something I can't do, and I was trying to download some kind of audio or something, but instead this green dinosaur was getting downloaded and opened and all, and I couldn't close it. I couldn't do anything. I had to do a restart to get out of that. And I couldn't even do that. [laugh] And then she came over and she was like hanging out in the house for two days, not really doing much. And then I can't remember, I think we fixed my angel statue, and then her supervisor came, and he was a real nice man that actually knew what he was talking about, and he helped me delete all these things and I was telling him, "Okay, let's shut down the right way this time." And he said, "Okay, I'll do it with the keys." And he actually did it the way you do it for Windows, and I was starting checking on, I was, I guess I wasn't sure what operating system I was using. And he did the Windows key, the ____ and the _____ just like they taught me at the Wilcox Center. And I think there's more to it, but I woke up. I think this came from watching Bobby, how his setup is a little more different than ours, and he knew all these games and stuff. I guess that's what I'm thinking of.
