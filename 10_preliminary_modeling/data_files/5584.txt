[1997-05-31] I remember getting on a bus and this lady named Jan was our bus driver and I thought we were going a short distance and although we got on in Hartford, we ended up going to New Haven. It was just a local bus not a Greyhound type of bus. I really didn't want to go that far but I had no choice because it happened. I was really distraught because I had in my pocket 2 checks for 2 bills I was going to pay and I noticed after getting on the bus that instead of putting in checks for the bills, I had put in 2 canceled checks instead. I couldn't fix it, and part of me asked if I should take out the canceled checks and chance putting cash in there instead, because I had no way of writing out new checks. I decided to go home later and fix them up even though I was supposed to mail them today. Then we got to [a state university] and there was a lady there, an administrator of [another town] who said "oh, you can't run things by yourself you always have to have your assistant with you" and I said "no, I've run seminars on my own without an assistant and the kids that were there really liked them" so I was trying to convince her that I could do all that stuff. And then we had the radio on and it was WPOP and instead of being sports there was a children's format all the time, they played children's programming. There was another lady there named Jan that I knew and she wanted to be reimbursed for things that she had bought, clothes that she had bought and I said "no we couldn't do that" I was pretty sure the system wouldn't let me do that, because she ended up being a client and she wanted to be reimbursed for stuff.
