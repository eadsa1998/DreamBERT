We were suppose to go camping but we couldn't go until everybody was together. One guy was asleep in a tent in the yard and I was throwing rolled up socks at the orange tent to try and wake him up. Then I went to the basement to practice the piano and it had a VERY weird sound because the keys were metal, coated with (white) enamel, and some were swollen like eggs. I didn't get to play long when somebody said, "STOP THAT RACKET!" I said, "Do you know Jasmine?" They said, "Shhhh. I can't hear." I called on a phone, 377 Florida, and it was Bob Hess. There were 3 mirrors. And girls in black and white sequined bathing suits were busy staring at themselves in the mirrors and hugging them (the mirrors) and trying to look sexy. But then 2 girls had rolled up foam (rubber) with balloons, carpet and fiber contusions (were) sticking out. (You could see their heads sticking out from a circle, cut into the carpet roll; you could see their lower legs and feet.) On the roof pier we were standing and talking about Kerhonkson and I told them it used to be $179 for 3 weeks. Now it was $500 for one week. They were talking about how talented Beth Lanford was as an artist. I was drawing on the walls. The guy who'd been asleep in the orange tent was waking up. It was night. 3 obese ladies were walking in single file around the roof pier in mumus. (plural of mumu. Tent dress) A fella pointed at the ladies and said, "No they're not. I is a man. I made millions toward boobs and hairdo's," but he shook his head NO! We had to shake out a rug, 30' X 6' on top of the Brooklyn Bridge and we each grabbed a corner and bundled ladies in it; and dust, dirt and cat hair floated down from the "rug shakin'" onto the 3 obese mumus.
