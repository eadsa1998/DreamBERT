I was recruiting participants for my research. I had six people and just needed one more. I talked to Susan J and Dorothea D to see if they knew of anyone. I am someplace where there is a large gathering of people outdoors for some kind of socializing. It almost seems like a family gathering. I'm standing at the rear of someone's parked car, talking to them as they get something from their trunk. They mention that Paul H might be a good participant. I hadn't seen him in years. A man approaches the car and I hold out my hand to shake hands and ask if he is Paul H. He smiles, and says no. I realize it was either his dad or a brother. Then another man approaches and I do the same thing. He also says no. This one I'm sure is a brother. Then another approaches and I don't want to be wrong again so I don't do or say anything. Someone says something to him about me wanting to talk to him. He smiles and walks over to a lawn chair and sits down. I ask him if he ever recalls his dreams. He is still smiling but looks at me quizzically. I'm wondering if he is just thinking that I must be crazy to ask him, someone I haven't seen in years, such an off-the-wall question. I explain to him that I'm working on some research involving dreams and I need one more participant.
