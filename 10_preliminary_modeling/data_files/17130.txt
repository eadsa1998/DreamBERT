I was at some sort of recreational facility in the late evening.  I think I had to ask my good online friend Del a question.  I was reading what I thought to be his reply; if it was or not I couldn't tell.  The letter set up the scene for what would follow. I didn't believe it was real; it was just an explanation or enactment.  It was dark and I was standing by a reddish-tinged wood post of the pathway overhang at a park.  I waved to Ray as I thought I saw him drive by.  I turned back from where I had come, and I saw a man in the distance.  I realized it was connected to the letter.  The man raised a gun toward me.  I bumbled forward but could do nothing.  The bullet struck me in the rear right of my neck, just below the skull.  I felt the bullet's impact and lodging.  I fell to the ground hard on my left side after the impact of the bullet.  I just lay there calmly dying.  I didn't think to try and stop the bleeding.  In the morning I had an excruciating headache where the bullet had entered, and my left side where I had fallen was quite sore.
