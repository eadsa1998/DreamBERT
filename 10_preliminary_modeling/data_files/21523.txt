Winnie was telling Ann she was married to Jim Varga before she married me. I was there. Ann didn't like this. Winnie said they couldn't get along because Jim had his way and couldn't see it no other way. I wanted to ask Ann how did we get married in church if she was married before, but I couldn't get that question in. We went for a walk in Rivertown at night. It was near the high school. I saw two men lying on the ground. I told Ann, "Now let's get away from here before these follows came after you." We started away and one of the fellows came after us. I hit him and knocked him down. He got up and came again and I put him down again. Then it turned out I was going after a woman who was there and she had a knife. She tried to stab me, but I got the knife away from her and calmed her down. I went into a store and bought a cake. I thought I gave the lady a dime and it was a penny. It shined and I thought it was a dime. As I took my change, I had slugs or flat pieces of steel mixed with my money. When I was awaking, I was saying, "I did." I saw King Knight.
