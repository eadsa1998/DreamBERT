Lifting one after another half dozen large scrapbooks. At the bottom of the pile I find two marked with my name. Look through them. One is mostly Hawaiian. I note one picture of pineapple cannery. I think perhaps one of my grandnieces or nephews might like my old Hawaiian picture books for a geography project. ... Looking at stampbook--a page of mostly red stamps. I have too many common varieties of Bulgarian.
