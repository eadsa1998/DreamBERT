I was at school and somebody was telling me about this little island with a sound studio on it called San Palmy and Uncle Larry happened to be vacationing there. And we were going to see him for his birthday. And also we were going to see the sound studio, and I had heard like lots of good things about it and stuff. And so we went there, and we were laying on a blanket, we were drinking stuff in a park. And I had Yoohoo out of a plastic bottle, and then we were going to go see Uncle Larry and then I woke up. I never got to see the sound studio either.
