We were diving off the rocks into the dark blue-brown sea water. Rolling waves smacked against the rocks. We couldn't be sure if more rocks lay hidden under the dark surface of the water. So we had to check first. The other girl lost me. I had a shell necklace my father had made for me. It was a choker-style necklace and very pretty. Dora had been giving Rudy help with Science and made notes in a calendar to "hold Science News" on some days. The calendar was on a hospital bed. A waitress was on the run from the law in a convertible--with her new husband. She was about to divorce him if necessary. She had a little daughter. She was going to leave with her mother and cross the country--working in diners by night. She knew that at night time she could hide easier--working out in the open at all-night diners and truck stops, where time stood still, and cops would sit for hours with coffee and pie, killing time while the shift clock ran down. Her husband was driving the convertible. She had spunky blond short hair and glasses. Next to them on the highway was another convertible. A sex kitten older woman with the biggest red hair-do I've ever seen pulled up and made a move on the husband. She was about to divorce him anyway, so she (the wife) didn't care really what was going on. She was on-the-run with more important things to think about than petty jealousy. Into the sand, you would stir with a stick and say the words "mars" and after you said, "Mars the Red Planet", the sand would get lots of finer sand in dark red powder--like black cherry jello mix swirled in. Mixed more and more. Then you'd pick up the sand on the beach, pack it down a little--wait and the little teeny baby space creature would come out. Taps to the head with a stick would bring him to life where all was fine until he grew and became a menace to society and it was a massive operation to try to kill him then.
