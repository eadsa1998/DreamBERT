I dreamt of acting in this play thing with my friends at school. I had what I thought was a really dumb part and our director was mean. We had to show another kid (some boy and I) down to where we were, and even though she wasn't supposed to be in the play, she kept sneaking in our room and singing out of tune with my singing group. The pianist was annoyed. Setting: In a spacy basement of our school which I've never seen. But every time I'm in a performance in a dream, that's where it is. Characters: They were boys and girls in my class, a cruel director that has never been mean in real life, and an annoyed pianist. Feelings and Thoughts: Annoyed. I hope I don't get a "dumb" part in the play I'm trying out for.
