I was walking thru a field and there were big blackberries. They were so big, about 1-1/2 inches square. I knew they were not free, but I picked some and ate them. When I got to the corner of the field, I had to climb over the fence and the farmhouse was near there. I heard the farmer say to the boy, "The berries are $4 a quart." I had an idea he wanted me to hear that. I yelled at him, "I will give you $1." I ate about a dollar's worth. I heard this was going to be an air raid alert and it did come. The sirens went off and I saw a big missile on the ground. I heard them say it was 90 ft. long. I saw some planes. They looked like rockets go up. I looked at some land where it was dammed. It was to be filled with water later. I was looking for Marty. I found him. When the alert went off, it got dark. I was walking up a very steep hill.
