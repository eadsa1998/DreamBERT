Sweeney was what I heard a voice tell me when I heard Dugan's voice and I asked him to give me a winner. Ann and I were out riding at night and we were lost on the side and muddy streets. I flashed my headlights but couldn't see the streets so well. Dugan blabbed and I couldn't understand him. Then I heard young Sweeney and I thought it was false.
