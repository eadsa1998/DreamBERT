 I'm at my high school basketball coach's wedding reception. I'm with my friend Stephen. It is a different place than where it actually took place. Stephen tries to get served alcohol from a lady. It doesn't work. Later, he gets a pitcher of beer and we are sitting right next to the tap. A homosexual man comes up to me and says, "My friend will lick your ass if you ask him." He thinks I am homosexual. I am startled. I avoid looking at him. People are passing around a microphone. My friends from high school Tiny Combs and George German are there. Tiny gets on the microphone and says , "Sluuu, Shhaaap", which are two words that I use frequently, and have become a nickname for me. We all laugh. Then someone tells me to say, "A man named Nate up an ass Named Kenneth." I say it, stuttering.
