I was in Rivertown and I wanted to see what I could dream of to play a winning horse, but couldn't. I tried to look, they fly, but I didn't fly so high. I got my feet wet so I went by Grandma. My sister Ann wanted me to go by Sue and teach her to drive a car. She gave me dry socks. I was on St. Clair and there was a coal yard there instead of a gas station. I was looking for coal in the woodwork and couldn't find it. I looked in the form and saw Busy Pony starting his season.
