I was driving through Coconut Grove to my apartment when I noticed a large apt. building about a block away from my place. It looked somewhat like the Coconut Grove Bank building. The thought occurred to me that three acquaintances from school, who I knew roomed together might be living there. Suddenly I was walking through the hall of the building and found their apartment. [surprised, neither p or unp. No color]
