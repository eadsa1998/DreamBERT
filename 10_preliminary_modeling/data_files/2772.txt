Tom Cruise is driving a car. His girlfriend is in the passenger side and I am in the back, between them, leaning over the front seat to talk with them. I see Tom copy some words off a paper and he wads it up and throws it away. I see it is a FIRO-B test form and I start to tell him all about how I was a counselor at the community college and gave that test which was developed by (I couldn't remember his name), that California Pop Psychology guy, oh, yeah, Will Schultz. I then say, "I gave that test to all my family members and they sure didn't like that." I laugh. Then I see we are going across a huge river. The water level is right up to the edge of the road and a long, black, snaky hose thing is floating in the river. Now we go up on the bridge, which arches up high, and I see that the road is also water and we hit something submerged in the water. I look and see a tip of an iceberg shaped like a volcano. I say, "Oh, look, there are those ice cubes, no, ice bergs." We slow down and hit a few more as we go.
