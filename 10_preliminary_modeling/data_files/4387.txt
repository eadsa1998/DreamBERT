["Loving the rock star."] Dovre and I are across the street from a rock concert. The lead singer sees me and walks over to me, still singing. We sit together lovingly, cuddling. Then he walks back on stage and finishes the song. After the concert, he comes out looking for me. He is a silent man who loves me and is attracted. I enjoy him also. We need to stand close and touch. We kiss. The kiss is a bit closed and uncomfortable, but the sexual anticipation is building. He leans against me as we are up against a wall. It is wildly sexual now. Feels hot and passionate. Dovre is a bit jealous that she is the younger woman and is being ignored and then she sees it makes me happy and feels fine about it. Now I am in a shower and feeling the sensual pleasure of it. He peeks in and I say to him, get naked and come here. He does and we make wild love. Orgasm. It was great.
