John Payne was in this dream, and after a while I was shocked to see that his right arm ended in a stump between the elbow and the wrist.  There was also something about falling in this dream.  I think I fell from a cliff at one point and managed to spread my arms and glide to a safe landing.  At another point, I was not able to, and fell hard on my face on a sidewalk.  It wasn't pleasant, but I was surprised I wasn't injured.
