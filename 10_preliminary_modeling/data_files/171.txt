I'm in England visiting (or not - maybe I'll stay) and have been staying with my brother and somebody, who's just left for a weekend or something and My brother's going home. He doesn't really want to but it's got to do with his health or something, he has to. He's taking me to the train/underground/something stop, I'm going further north to visit a friend and we're running late. He has to be leaving right away himself - he says "Hard to believe, at (8.45?) in the morning I'll be back home". I realize suddenly he can keep my cat for me - that'll be such a good idea. He says well, maybe - you don't mean permanently do you? I say, well no, of course I'll just be here a while. But maybe not. I'd like to be able to stay. Now we've gotten to the place for me to get the train - it's dark and there's nobody around. I was supposed to be there at 8-something - .35 or .45, and it's 9 now straight up. For a minute we hope the train's late but surely it's been and gone and what will I do now? He can't stay, I may just have to stay here instead for the weekend. Won't kill me. Earlier (or I got north anyhow) - I'm with the girl I'm visiting - she's a teenager, just going off to school soon. She talks about where she's going to go and I suggest she check out Cambridge and Oxford and those places - she seems to have the idea that those places are only for well-off men and not just anybody. I say they're not and she might as well go somewhere really good if she can. We also talk about her having a car and seeing it repaired - I have a suggestion, something I learned from my px, about the exhaust system? She's a bit excited about having a car of her own, and being able to go around where she wants to.
