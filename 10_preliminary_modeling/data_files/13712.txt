I was at home. Eugene, Darius, Alejandro and Jeremiah were staying over. Ezra was there too. My room was really messy. My diary was on the floor. I was going through a box of stuff and Alejandro was watching me. I found some Goosebumps books and I said "I love Goosebumps!". I didn't want them in my room in case they got hold of my diaries, but they didn't go in there. I was going to play Pokemon Diamond.
