Dad was low on money, and Dad, Ezra and I broke into Acquaintance-F-11's house to steal some seeds because she had cool trees or something. I was in the study and Ezra and Dad were across the hall. I was putting stuff under the desk incase she came so that I could hide, but she came in and hit me. We explained what we were doing.
