I was applying a great deal of effort to move a vehicle from one place to another, but my efforts were in vain because the vehicle moved and so did the floor on which it stood. Then I would run to stop the floor from moving, but at the same time the vehicle was coming at me. The only thing that was left to do was to jump from the train, but I wasn't moving because there was no wind and there were few waves and the boat didn't move because it ran into a stoplight and then a plane that was flying above fell down.
