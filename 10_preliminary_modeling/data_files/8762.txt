I was working at my computer. The screen I was viewing was an odd combination of MSWord, Explorer, and the screen to view the files in the search screen. I wasn't able to read the entire file locations. I noticed that the toolbars at the top of the screen were misaligned in a way that I hadn't seen before. Some of them started at the far right of the screen and then continued below. There were large gaps between the end of one and the beginning of another on one row. I thought if I fixed that it would resolve the other problem. I kept clicking on the bar at the beginning of the toolbars and trying to move them into place the way you normally would to change their placement but for some reason it wasn't working. And at least one or more of the toolbars had icons on them that you wouldn't really find on a toolbar.
