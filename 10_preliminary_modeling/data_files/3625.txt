Lucy and I are together. I realize I've been skipping classes again and will get yet another term's worth of failing grades and "Y"'s or incompletes. I feel like a failure. Lucy asks me if I've talked with Dr. Roy. I then start drinking out of a small baby bottle; I am sucking water. I kind of feel some satisfaction reverting to baby, but a woman disapproves very much, at me, a grown woman behaving like a baby. I feel a bit guilty.
