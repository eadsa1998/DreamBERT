I dreamt I was sleeping at home when they started to pound heavily on the door, and constantly, so I was forced to wake up and I called my brothers so that they would go and see who it was. But they were soundly asleep, so I had to go downstairs, upset because whoever it was, it was too late for knocking at the door and least of all on a Saturday on which my parents were away at a party and they would be arriving very late. I went down in my pajamas and, when I opened the door, I saw it was the family doctor, but he looked much younger. And as he came in, he told me that he had come uninvited because he was retiring and he was not going to practice his profession and that he was in politics, and that the only time he could have visited with us was at night. I was worried because I was in pajamas, but then I remembered that he was my doctor and had seen me since I was small. And we started to talk and suddenly dawn was breaking, and he and I did not move. My dream ended here.
