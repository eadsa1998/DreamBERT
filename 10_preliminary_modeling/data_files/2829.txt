I am doing my business and somehow things are not coming together well. I don't know what the next piece is and I kind of put things together as best I can, but I finally walk away from a big mess in the center of the room. It feels like a play I'm writing. Now I am a woman, like Cybil Shepard, and I am married to Robin Williams. Robert DeNiro likes me also, because Robin does. He follows, with intent to charm me. We are all now being followed by a mobster man and his henchmen who will kill or rape me. I decide to take a shower. I go into the shower stall and am worried because one of the henchmen is in the shower stall next to me, looking for me. He senses I'm there and tries to rip open the metal wall between us. Meanwhile Robert is washing his face in a sink and is trying to clean up so he will be more acceptable to me, and next to him is Robin who walks into another shower stall and sits naked on a toilet, his penis tucked down in the bowl like I've seen Howard do.
