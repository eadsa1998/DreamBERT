As I was waiting for a streetcar, an elderly lady, standing next to me, started crying. I asked if there was anything I could do. She told me that she was very afraid of getting on and off streetcars because she had once fallen off a streetcar. I told her not to worry because I would gladly help her. When the streetcar came, I helped her on and then took her to a seat. She asked me to sit next to her, so I did. All the way to my destination, she told me about how she had always wanted a granddaughter but that she only had grandsons. She said she wanted to repay me in some way; and although, I was insistent that there was no need for it, she finally obtained my name and address. A long time later I received a great sum of money; and the only signature was "from the old woman to whom you were so kind."
