I am at a house, possibly my "mom's" house, and a combination party is happening. One group of people is my relatives and another group is my disabled friends. I go from one room to another, mingling and chatting. In the relative room, my mother, who is fairly young and pretty, and I tap dance together. Everybody likes that. We have fun. Then I go to the room with my disabled friends and we talk. Rochelle questions me critically. I made a statement and she'd say, "Did you actually use the masculine pronoun?" I just looked at her and said, "Yes, I did" (not politically correct, you know). Now a woman is going up on stage to sing a song with a big name rock band. I am her sister or friend and am asked to come on up and join in. So now there are four to six men from the rock group, "Heads and Roses," mostly drummers, and her and me. She sings and I add some harmony. The song is about "I love you Dad." Dad (not my real one) is out in the audience. Even though she is the star, I manage to get the last line in with excellent harmony and everyone is pleased.
