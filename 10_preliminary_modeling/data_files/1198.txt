I'm in a house. 3 guys are there. I'm half-standing, half-sitting informally on a chair. Two of the guys are lounging near, leaning on the chair or sitting on the arm of the chair. We are quite close. It is sensual and pleasant. We are talking about a traffic ticket I got. It cost me $27.00. They say they got one once, and it was only $119.00. Mine was for speeding so it cost more. My girls come in. We're getting ready to go somewhere and then I can't find them. I go looking. One of the guys is Zach. He follows me and stays near. It's pleasant. I am equally aware of his presence and the search for my girls. I am upstairs. I look down over the balcony rail. I see Dovre who is a cat nursing her baby kittens, 2 mal cats (male but I left the "e" off mal) approach. I say, "I didn't know Dovre had kittens!" I am surprised and a little shocked. I don't like the looks of the male cats. They look threatening. As I'm leaning over the rail, Zach leans over on me, gently. I realize he's interested in me sexually and I caress his leg with my foot while pretending to look over the rail. We are both happy. He has asked; I've said, "Yes." We go downstairs to shoo away the bad male cats. I then see that it wasn't Dovre but it was a paper cut out of a cat and many baby kittens. It was a joke. Then, I see little paper footprints leading off through the house with lots of messages I can't understand. I pass a door. It's open and a disapproving girl/woman with black hair on a bike frowns at me. A man carrying a basket with nice breads in it stands at the door. I say, "Pasale," and hope I said the right tense for respect (le, not te). Zach and I follow the little footprints.
