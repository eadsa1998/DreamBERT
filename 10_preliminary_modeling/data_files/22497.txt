I dreamt I was in some sort of resort, but I was alone. The house was old and the climate rather cold in the afternoon. I saw that the sea was starting to get rough. Each time it grew rougher and the waves grew and their size was terrifying. It kept coming closer and I ran, scared. I ran from the place where the sea wanted to swallow me. At last I could escape and then my dream ended.
