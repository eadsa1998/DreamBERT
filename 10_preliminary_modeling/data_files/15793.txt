I can't remember the exact details but I was with Malachi and he really liked this apple pie that someone made. I discovered that he was a guy from a long time ago - who was immortal - and was getting revenge on people who wronged him when he was younger. I think he met with his mother at one point and seemed friendly with her, but then turned and accused her of letting her boyfriend be a dick to him. I was also watching Big Brother at some point, I remember seeing David and I also remember Sandra being with Sam and she was upset and crying because they couldn't be together. He said to her that 'either they'll get married or they'll be bff's forever'.
