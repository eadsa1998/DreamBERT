 I'm at grandpa and grandma Redding's old farmhouse. It's morning and I want to cook breakfast. I find two eggs and some sausage in the freezer. I put a frying pan on the stove. The flames are too high so I turn them down. At some point I decide I want to leave. No one responds to me. There are a lot of people there. My mom ignores me when I say I want to leave. I tell her to fuck off. I say goodbye to my sisters Ramona and Heather and my brother Wally, but not to anyone else. I storm out the door. Out at the car my siblings come out like they're driving home with me. I'm really mad! I yell at my mom loudly. I tell she has always respected me but she isn't now, and say fuck you to her! She knows that didn't respect me by ignoring me and she says it's good that I recognized that. My voice is high pitched. I feel choked up, like I have a lot of energy in my chest that is constricting my voice. I think there is toilet paper in a tree.
