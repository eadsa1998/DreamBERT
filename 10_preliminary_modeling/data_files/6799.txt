At a student gathering. One, starting on a catch, asks me, "What is this?" 3 times I say "Watch" and wonder when the catch is coming. Another student comes up and feels in my mouth. He is tall, blonde and I think he is Bob Everly. (Everly, a former student of mine but his first name wasn't Bob.) He says, "To think you still remember me."  I say, "So you are planning to study dentistry." "Yes."
