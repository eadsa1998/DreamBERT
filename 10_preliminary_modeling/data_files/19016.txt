I was at the airport. A Cessna, oh, I guess about a 310, landed and followed behind by a four prop C-6. It just so happened that I was bobbing around down on the runway where they just landed and they stopped. First, the DC-6, the big 4 prop, two stewardesses come out and then a couple passengers and then a half a dozen or so passengers come out of the Cessna, and I knew I was leaning against one of the airplanes. Some old biddy was saying to me, "Sorry, but you can't lean against the airplane. You can't touch nothing out here. These planes are chartered to DCF or yeah," which stood for something, I don't know. DC Freedom, Headquarters of Freedom, something. So she's reminding I can't touch anything around here everywhere I go. Then I was leaving and I heard 3 old guys. One said to the other, one asked  one about the other about a test in a course. I forget now what one it was. This other one was a kid. He asked them if they had an _____________ and they were talking about that and it didn't seem to have anything to do with the airport. Then I was walking away and I walked in front of the Cessna and as I looked at it from the front, it looked like one of those real small Cessnas, and I thought to myself, "They must have had a rough flight." So there was an _________ and I was hoping that they did because of that one woman being such a pain in the neck. Then I was awoken, but I was still trying to remember what DCF stood for, and I still wouldn't know. I knew the F stood for freedom, but the D and the C I don't have any idea at all. The D I did, but the C I didn't. Anyway, I was trying to figure out to myself before I wakened.
