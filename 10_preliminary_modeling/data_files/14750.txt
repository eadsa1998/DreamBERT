Granny had some underground thing with people they used to feed the poor. I saw her pouring oil and singing into the drains (it was night, in some spooky American like neighbourhood). Then Cartman (South Park) followed her and people who were sick got put on this big stone and cooked, there were about four there. Granny was there with other people. I was at a party like thing with Mom. Margarita came up to me and said something mean and I ignored it. Later there was a big cheesecake like cake and it was from KFC and had almonds. I showed it to Dad. It looked really fattening and this guy said it was $50. Hilarie Burton was actually from here, and her and some guy came back and were playing at the beach. Margarita came back to me and apologized and mentioned me having kissed Duane and said my secret was safe with her. I was now Haley (One Tree Hill) and she had a friend who could read minds. They called her and said she had dreamt that she was in a car and something bad happened. She said Nathan did that, but ignored it. She was then in a car with Jamie and they crashed into a building.
