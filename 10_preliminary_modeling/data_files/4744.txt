["I can walk now."] I am in a wheelchair at perhaps a University. Friendly people and I are going from one building to another. Lots of stairs everywhere and no ramps. I drive my wheelchair up a short flight of cement stairs. I make it, quite surprised that I did. And pleased. I then see the left wheel is frayed and damaged, coming apart. I look down a long flight of stairs. Too long to drive the chair down. I see another back flight of stairs made of wood and flatter longer steps, more gradual. I decide the chair won't work anymore and decide I will attempt to sit on my butt and scoot down step by step. A woman stands at my left and I stand out of the chair and balance, leaning on her arm for support. Then I take a step and successfully manage the first step. I try a second step and one by one I successfully walk down the full flight of stairs. I am ecstatic. I can walk now. A male professor, friendly is in the background somewhere.
