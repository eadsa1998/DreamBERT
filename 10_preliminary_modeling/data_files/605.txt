I am at the home of Aunt Genevieve, who raised my father. Later I am at my mother's and I am outside in the snow. I fall over the edge of a hill and can barely get up. Then I am in snow and try to call for help but can't make enough noise. I am struggling to make noise and can hear people looking for me but I am sinking in the snow. I am afraid they will find my body in the spring.
