I picked up a crumpled paper sack and thinking it was full of trash was about to throw it in the garbage when I found it was full of almonds. I had eaten a couple of nuts (felt them crunched) when I realized they were Mrs. Mar's (dead) and took them to her. A young boy asked where Ar(?) was. I told him I had a gazetter in my small blue dictionary and we looked it up. Not there nor in my large two-volume one. So I referred him to an old unabridged Webster.
