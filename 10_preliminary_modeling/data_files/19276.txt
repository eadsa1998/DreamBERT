I was in the middle of a forest on the edge of a river that was rushing very quickly. I was walking along the river skipping and stumbling over rocks, when through the trees, I saw a very small, one-room house. This setting was not familiar to me. The weather wasn't sunny but it wasn't gloomy either. It was just in between. I came to the door of the house and when I opened the door the house was full of sand. I climbed up on top of the sand and I felt strange, like I was trapped or sinking through the sand. In the house I met three girls that I recognized. They were my close friends from the summer ballet camp that I went to the summer before. Soon after that the sand filtered through the house, my friends disappeared, and in the house appeared my giant trampoline and my Uncle Bob, whom I'm very close to. He teases me all the time and is my favorite uncle, but I haven't written to him in a long time. I began to jump on my trampoline and soon everything disappeared and I was left alone in the forest near the river.
