I was in a room with my boyfriend Jeremy. 'His' friends(ours, including some of mine he hasn't even met like Neil Block) were there and I guess playing practical jokes while I was trying to spend quality time with Jeremy. It was weird how those friends weren't necessarily themselves. I remember referring to one of them as Gonzo. Anyway I got extremely fed up with all of their little games and it got to the point where everyone was in a pile and I was stabbing at them with a mechanical pencil.
