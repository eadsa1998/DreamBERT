I was going on an errand, and I passed our former residence. I seemed to think the street was the one on which, in real life, we lived when we resided in my home state -- before moving to New York -- but the house was the one in which we lived when we moved to New York. The house across the street had been replaced by a large house, open on the first floor with bedrooms on a balcony on the two sides and the back, large windows and elaborate furnishings. A woman about 50 lived there. Our former house had been enlarged with dormers. I went back home. Our present house was the one which in real life we lived in before the one which in the dream was our former house. I told my mother what I had seen, and I told my sister.
