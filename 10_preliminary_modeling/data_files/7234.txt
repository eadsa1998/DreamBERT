[2nd dream] My guest kept asking if I had certain articles of food for dinner. Carrots would be so good. I told her I had my groceries delivered because the nearest grocery was down that hill and it was too steep to climb carrying much of a load. We sat but all I had was coffee and toast. I looked in the refrigerator for fruit and jams but there was only slices of chicken in it. I asked the young boy to pass on the jam he was digging into.
