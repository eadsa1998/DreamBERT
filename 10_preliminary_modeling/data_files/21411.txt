Bob cut his finger and it was bleeding. He was monkeying with old scrap metal. I saw the blood and when I was going to fix it, it was Jerry's hand. I wiped it off with alcohol and it stopped then. He put on a Band-Aid. Franklin had a lot of meat ground for hamburger. I was eating on the street. The table was set on the street. I was eating in the old scrap iron yard at White's. I called for help and got the wrong parts. I couldn't shut off the party and I heard music. I climbed up on an old shanty and the roof broke in and the walls were ready to cave in. I got off in a hurry.
