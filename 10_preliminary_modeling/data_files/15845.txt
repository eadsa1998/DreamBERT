I was with Esther in a big, multi-storey gothic style house. We were doing something to do with work, but I'm not sure what. It was stormy and we went outside to do something and around the side of the house it was pitch black in the distance and a thick grey fog just in front of us. It was getting closer and weird noises were coming from it - like a whispering static. Someone else with us went into it and we ran back inside, but it had caught up and it was pitch black inside. Once it had enveloped us, the sound stopped and I couldn't see or hear anything. We had referred to it as both 'The Silence' and 'The Nothing' [the first made me think of Doctor Who and the second of The Neverending Story so I couldn't decide which one I preferred]. We were stuck in there for a year, then it went away. Only the three of us who had been caught in it had been 'gone' for all that time though.
