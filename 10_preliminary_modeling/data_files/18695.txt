I was on a family vacation in Florida. A storm was brewing. It got all quiet and still and I decided to make a run for it. I got outside, down the steps and the wind picked up again and driving wind. I hid behind some Palmetto bushes and Jay Mills was there and we watched a huge condominium sliding down the highway, like a mac truck going 100 m.p.h. After if passed we started running under a parking garage to go sit in the ocean where nothing could fall on us. I was sitting at a restaurant table counting my quarters. I had 12 quarters. 3 stacks of 4. One of the quarters was a Krusty the Clown quarter. With a bubble top. I was looking at it when a guy and a stranger sat down at the table next to me and said, "Well, are you about ready to go?" and I said, "I don't even know who you are," and then his friend came up. They grabbed me and said, "You're coming with us." I tried to think quick if I'd done anything wrong. I had no drugs--nothing illegal--so I started to yell. They picked me up by the arms and feet. I struggled. At first I couldn't speak. Then I reached out to grab a customer at another table. "I DON'T EVEN KNOW THESE GUYS," I screamed and finally the guys put me down. They were annoyed that I had mixed up the plan. I looked at a little piglet. I wanted to leave at that time. So I unplugged the alarm clock and threw it out in the yard. I almost hit some man with it and I apologized but it was funny so see his expression to see an alarm clock to come flying through the sky. An alarm clock, staring, ringing.??? I was carrying yellow gloves and lots of business men and women filled the bathroom. Paula ??? ....and maybe the nights too. There was free stuff. Me and Lisa got coffee and I knew better than to put packs of mustard and ketchup up in my back pocket because I'd forget and sit down on them.
