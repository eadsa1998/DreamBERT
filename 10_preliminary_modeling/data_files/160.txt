There's a kind of war or rebellion going on at work, and management has some of the employees working for them, but not many are morally behind them. I'm in a small office - just came there to help or take over for another girl, we're going through some files and sorting things. There's a couple of girls from "the other side" crouched behind a desk across the room shooting arrows at us. We're pretty nonchalant - mostly these people can't hit you for beans, and the risk is small (though present!) so you just do your thing and don't bother about ducking, it's not as though you don't know what they're going to do. The girl I'm with is going through papers on my right, and she says she needs to leave early, there's something she needs to go home for, will I mind taking over for her? I say no, that's fine, I don't have much to do anyway. But this arrow-business is becoming a nuisance, and you know all I really need to do is just go and kick the desk over on 'em - so I do that. Takes a couple of tries but it goes over - it's a regular heavy old gray one, and one of the girls is pinned under it. Don't know if she's hurt or not. The other one comes out from behind and says, look, I hope you don't resent this too much, I'm just doing this because I have to, I don't really want to hurt you. (She has long hair, sort of pretty, "nice" - reminds me of Bailey Quarters.) I say to her, that's okay, actually I'm just worried about the rest of your life. She considers that - yeah, she says, you're right; I don't know if I really want to hurt anybody at all. I say I don't know if I could actually hurt another person myself.
