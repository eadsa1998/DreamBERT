On a fairly flat strip of ground bordering a river. There are many tall weeds, some growing in dense clusters. Several ladies are practicing golf. One of them has on a white, tight-fitting sweater. They swing in a desultory fashion. The instructor, a tall man, asks one of the girls a question. Next, I am sitting in wooden bleachers next to Ole Kalm, a tall, husky young fellow. He is changing his shoes, and says he must go into town but will be back in 35 minutes. He also says that he was too light to play on the regular team; also, that he is not affected by heat. It seems to me he cannot be as old as I, who have been badly affected by the heat, especially that experienced in a shed on south side of a barn. Someone asks a question about the callus on the heel of a colored man, but another person says, "That would be mere idle curiosity."
