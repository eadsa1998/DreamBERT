Wayne R has a computer. He's got it on a cart and going down the hall. I follow, asking questions. We go to a room where he sets the computer up. I ask how many bits because it seems small. It only has 630K. Then I type for him. He kisses me passionately. I respond and kiss back passionately. Then I say, "Oh no! You're married," and draw back sadly because I want him. Then another man and his secretary come in. I set up their computer. He codes in lots of numbers. It's for playing games. They crowd our stuff over and I end up sitting in front of a tiny portable typewriter. I get it out of there and try to fit in the cramped quarters. Now I'm driving home. I'm parked in a wide spot next to the freeway. I'd put up a sign advertising puppets. They were the man's and I'd show how they work to people. A carload of people stop. The woman wants to see the puppets. I say, "You bet," and go to the back of the van and dig around. I can't find the puppets. I find a computer part that opened up into a puppet like a transformer toy. I take it to show the people saying, "Sorry. He took the puppets with him. But I can show you these. Plus I've written two books and have hand puppets of the characters. I'll show you those." The people are disappointed. I'm improvising and wish I'd never started this whole thing. The woman offers to go take the sign down. I ask Ellie to go find my hand puppets. She doesn't want to, but does.
