I was at 'home'. This guy had been annoying me for a while and it went Ugly Betty like and it showed him going to use me for something. I didn't like him though. Then he had a party and I was wondering what he was doing. Henry (Ugly Betty) came and he was my boyfriend and when I saw him I was like "Henry!" and ran to him and hugged him.
