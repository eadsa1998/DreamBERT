I am captured by a bad guy who is going to have sex with me and then kill me. He and his henchmen get us (four of us). I try to run. He has guns. He is chasing. We are wondering where the nearest safe place is. Then I see Josh. I tell him we need a place to hide and he says, "You can hide in here." We start to hide when we see him drive up. He'll see us. We hide in a closet. The man comes in with a rifle and is looking around. Now I feel bad for Josh who is in danger because of us. He is diverting them to the outside when the woman driver who we escaped from enters with a gun. Josh says, "That's my wife." Uh oh! Dilemma. Where are his loyalties? He acquiesces and stops helping us. I see Josh and look at him, wondering if he'd still help us. The feeling is he would if he could.
