Jerry, Lisa and I were walking across a field. We were each holding a huge platter of lasagna. We were discussing which kind we liked most. The kinds were like avocado, pineapple, and broccoli. We were bringing them to some people on the other side of the field. Those people were Devin, Sophie, and the Sandy from acro and the Sandy from school. Here the Sandys were identical twins. We ate the lasagna and it started snowing. Setting: In a field, maybe at Tahoe. Characters: Jerry, Lisa, Devin, Sophie, Sandy A. and Sandy F. I know them. They're friends at school and Sandy F. is a friend from acro. I was in the dream, too. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, and full after eating lasagna. It was a good dream because I was with my friends. I liked the dream because it was interesting. It wasn't like my usual dreams.
