I was staying in some hotel thing where you could pay to have a guy keep you company and maybe sex (implied) and I was considering it. Later I was with others in a crowd sitting down watching something. I was with Cecelia. Fletcher came and sat next to Cecelia and she talked to him. I felt uncomfortable. We went to this room which was Frederick's room I think and was where we'd had sex. When Fletcher was gone I started laughing saying 'imagine if he knew'. Later Frederick and I finally talked and he sent me a big message saying that I was being needy and he was being clingy. And that he felt like we couldn't date because I didn't want kids and if I did decide to have them I would let weed get in the way and if I protested 'well you're told other things are good for you and you don't do those'. And also that I would let my weight get in the way because I had issues with it, and was worried that I'd never believe he didn't care about it. I was like 'um' and started to write a message about how I didn't want to date him, I just wanted sex and that if I did have kids I'd be responsible and that my weight didn't matter that night so why would it be an issue for me later.
