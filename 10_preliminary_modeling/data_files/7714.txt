They were firing Jane H and I went and talked to the person who was firing her. I was very upset because I know she didn't deserve it. Somewhere along the line, someone suggested I interview to be the store manager again. I asked about the current JLI members to see if there was anyone around who would remember me. I was inside the shop but it was jut a very small room, like a small living room. There was very little merchandise. Jane H and Janet S said that's all there was. They gave the impression that there was concern that the store might have to close. There were several colors. The one that sticks in my head is red. There were two very cool pieces of furniture. I'm not sure if they were really pieces of furniture. One of them reminded me of a miniature of Grandma F's wardrobe. The other was similar, larger, and yet different. One was marked $300 and the other $130. Jane H was marking them down and making it sound as though they should already have been marked down but I wondered if she was just doing it for me, as she often does in waking life. I remember the prices $50 and $75 being mentioned or both for $125 or $150.
