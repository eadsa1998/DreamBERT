I was at Granma's and she had my school photos from Year 3 and 5. I took them and also found some more cool photos. Ezra and I were on this thing, like the top floor bit of a barn. It had movies and books on it. There were three kids down below, and Ezra and I were throwing stuff at them. Ezra was singing 'The Weight'.
