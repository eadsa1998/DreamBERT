John Payne had come to visit me-in the city where I went to college, I believe.  I don't know where I was staying, but I had to find him a place to stay.  I tried to direct him to some apartments I knew of on the other side of Forest Park, but found the directions were too complicated.  Tommy Crutchett was nearby, though, and I knew he lived there, so I asked if he would take John, and he did.  I soon realized that I wouldn't know which apartment John was staying in, so I jumped in the car and tried to catch them, but couldn't.  When I came to the apartments I found that there were hundreds of them, all arranged in separate courtyards, sort of like where we lived once.  I saw several other football players and their families, but no sign of Tommy or John.
