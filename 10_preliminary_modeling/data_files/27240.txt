This dream is very vague and hard to recall. I know I was sitting on the grass with a school friend. A car drew up &amp; a man got out. I saw the back of his head which had a round bald spot and thought, "He must be related to S--." I have spent several months "getting over" S-- and had thought myself well out of the whole affair at the time of the dream. The man came over &amp; spoke to us &amp; he was S--'s brother. I kept making nasty remarks in regard to S--'s forthcoming marriage thinking at the same time, "Darn! I'm only showing him how much I still care." I also kept telling him my name &amp; was disturbed that it made no impression on him for S--- had supposedly told his brother all about me, that being the height of the sublime.
