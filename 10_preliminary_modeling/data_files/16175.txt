There were these really tame mallard ducks in the back yard, stepping all over the grass and everything. And Nancy and Lorraine were here, and Dad was going to take Lorraine to court for letting Nancy step all over the grass. Last night I had a kind of bizarre but sketchy dream. I dreamt that Ms. Hanson was teaching classes in my room and that we were like dancing down the stairs or something, and then we had to go pick up Ms. Allard from this pool thing that she was at. I don't know -- there must have been more to it, but I can't remember now.
