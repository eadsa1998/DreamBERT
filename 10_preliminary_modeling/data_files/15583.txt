I was talking to Benjamin on Skype but we lost internet. I could still talk for a bit and I said I was going to my Dad's to go on the internet. I had to go somewhere first, and had to climb these 'steep' natural steps. I had some paper in my pocket and my phone but I was worried they would fall out so I put them in a zip lock bag. There were some mountains and stuff in the distance and it looked cool and I wanted to take a photo but I had to move out the way. At the top there was an office where I had to do something. I went on Skype on my phone and told Benjamin I'd be 30 minutes or so. I got to Nana's and went on the net to talk to him. Then I was sitting outside my car in front of a school. The people from the car in front of me were having an argument and they said they should start charging people to listen. I was like 'well, I'm going now' and went into another red car on the other side of the road. Benjamin was in the passenger seat. I told him what happened and drove off.
