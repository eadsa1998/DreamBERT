I was outdoors with another woman and mother going to a restaurant but they walked too fast and didn't wait for me at crossings. I was afraid and called "Wait for me." At last I caught ip and asked where mother was. She said she had turned in at a nearer place because of the rain. We'd go on and order and mother would come on when the shower was over. Meantime she had met a friend there. Then the woman said we were there and she would hurry on ahead and see what they had.
