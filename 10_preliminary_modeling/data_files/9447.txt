Frank has returned and we are alone in the kitchen. We dance naked, body to body, make love. Wonderful. Then other people come in. A man and a little girl who wrote a poem. I say something about prostitution as against love. "When you pay you don't get involved, but when you don't pay, you have to pay with your soul." Then I leave to get dressed. I had been wearing a bathrobe when I spoke with the others. I put on a green butcher linen blouse and a black skirt. I return feeling very good.
