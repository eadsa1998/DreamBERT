We are in Grandpa's car.  Grandpa is driving.  We strike and kill five different people.  I remember the last one well, because I saw a group of children in the road in the middle of the road-a pair of twins and another child, all about 4 years old.  Grandpa tried to straddle them with the wheels  When I looked back, amazingly he had done so with the twins, but the single boy had apparently raised his head while the car was going over him and was struck by something under the car.  When I looked back, the twins were standing over his body.  We ended up at Uncle Jack's, in a house similar to the one at 606 South Wilson.
