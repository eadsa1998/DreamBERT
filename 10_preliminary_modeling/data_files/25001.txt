 There is a big building with a fire spreading through it. I am a firefighter, or I feel like one for a bit. The floor may fall out. I'm afraid of that. There is a woman that seems to be the key to the fire; may be able to control it. She may be a witch. The firemen eventually bomb the building, and the witch dies, even though she isn't in the building. I am flung away from the building on a rope-like thing and pulled back, all in the air, like a yo-yo. I'm in a graveyard climbing back over a fence to the building. After the building explodes and the witch dies, I take her body and show it to the people. It's in a body bag. I tell people she is from Gerald (University) and let them see her rotting face.
