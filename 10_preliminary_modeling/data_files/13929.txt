We had an excursion. I was taking photos with my phone but they came out straight away. Eugene and Darius were staying quite close to me. There was a tunnel with water and the head of the Statue of Liberty. Samantha and I took a photo. I had photos of Eugene. We all sat down and Calvin sat next to me and was joking about Evelyn and Darius. I went to put the photos on the computer.
