I was floating on a huge raft and there was water all around me. I had a huge cow thing on the raft with me. We went over an alligator and it tried to eat the cow. I saved the cow. My dream changed to a place with big huts everywhere. I found a hut which everyone wanted but I got it. I then went into a hut where people were making paint. Setting: (On a raft) In a cavern at first, then a kind of plantation. Characters: A girl I didn't know who was on the raft and just a bunch of people. Feelings and Thoughts: Excited. It always was interesting and exciting to think about.
