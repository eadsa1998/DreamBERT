I dreamed I was attending a concert at a place resembling the interior of the Hama. I was enthralled by the music which was strictly classical and had more volume than melody, yet the piece was not heavy. I was conscious of the others in the audience, but of no other single person. The music was extremely vivid, but I canlt remember the time and I don't believe I have ever heard the piece before. I had a feeling the concert lasted a long time.
