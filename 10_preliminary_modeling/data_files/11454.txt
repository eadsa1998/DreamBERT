I was driving a car through a hilly countryside and there were two small children sitting in the back seat and looking at the scenery and laughing. I stopped the car and we all got out and I picked up a small rifle and went looking for some animals. A big tiger came charging through the brush and tried to attack the children. I picked up my rifle and shot it through the head. The children looked at me with admiration and I felt happy. It was a bright sunny day and through the trees I saw two deer drinking from a pond. I shot both deer and loaded them on the car and then the children got out and I gave them each a deer. As I drove off the children threw kisses and I was happy and excited.
