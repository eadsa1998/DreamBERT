 My friend Anna Woods and I are in my room. There is a big beanbag chair there. I am going to leave. I kiss her goodbye on the cheek. She kisses me on the mouth, and with her tongue! I am taken back; surprised. There is a pause in our actions. Then I start talking like nothing just happened: pretending. She tasted salty.
