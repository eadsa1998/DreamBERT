I clutched Stalin by the arm and led him to the pink armchair. Then as others lay down on the floor to sleep, I tell him to go back to the armchair to sleep but he laid down on the floor too. He seemed to be trying to find a soft place for his head. The others have pillows. They are Americans, both men and women, 5 or 6 of them.
