I was at the beach in my father's car, driving around and flirting with girls. Then one of them attracted me and I asked her to get in and she accepted. We rode around unfamiliar places and then I kissed her passionately and bit by bit we got undressed. Then I felt her hot breasts, but I realized I wasn't in the car anymore, but inside a house, lying in be and the girl wasn't a stranger, but a cousin of mine whom I don't like very much. We were performing the sexual act and I was comparing her to a prostitute that I know. I kissed her again and when I looked at her face, it was that of the prostitute and she asked me to pay her, but I didn't have money. Then she chased me along an unknown beach. When I was able to hide, I realized that I was naked and I tried to remain hidden, but people who went by looked at me mockingly. At that moment I was trying to hide underneath the ground. But a while later I was dressed again and came out of my hiding place, very calmly. That's all I remember.
