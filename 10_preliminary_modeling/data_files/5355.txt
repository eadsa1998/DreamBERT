I had a dream that everyone from my Spain program was having a party on a bus. We were all eating popsicles and having lots of fun. Then we got to the refuge that was apparently at the end of the party. I really wanted to go to sleep, but I had to leave for some reason. It was so sad saying good-bye to everyone again, even though it was just in my dream.
