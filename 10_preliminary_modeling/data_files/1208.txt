I look in a mirror. My eyes are pink and puffy and the pupils are missing. I wander around the house looking for Bonnie so she can take me to the doctor. I find her. She's crying because one of her cousins has died. I turn a corner and see a room full of hospital beds. An overweight middle-aged man is sitting up in each bed, with hospital p.j.s and robe on. One man says, "You're a week late to teach your well-being health class." I am embarrassed because I had forgotten! I think quickly, then start to lecture. The man has a red face like he is blushing.
