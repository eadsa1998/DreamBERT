Our house was creepy and we had maids and stuff. They turned evil. I wanted to get inside to get my stuff. We were running away and it was really dark. The lighting, though, looked strange like a dream, so I did a reality check and it worked. I was wishing for Eugene, but it wasn't working, so I yelled out "Eugene!", but nothing happened.
