I picked up a Chinese newspaper in the library, knowing that I couldn't read it, and I was a little embarrassed that others might think that I could read it and that I was showing off.  There was a crossword puzzle in the paper, in English.  For some reason, I told someone that there was no such thing as professional translators, and then I thought about Anita and I wondered why I had said such a stupid thing.
