I was out the back. I thought I saw Diabla in the pool, but it was another black cat. All the cats were out there except for Diabla and Kiki. I was confused. Dad was supposed to take them to the Cat Haven. I had done some analysis of my dreams (symbol interpretation). I was upset because I didn't take the dead cats out of the pool.
