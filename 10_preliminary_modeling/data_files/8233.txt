I completed my dissertation proposal and had sent it to Deven D. A day or two later he was at my home. This was my house on Lakeland Dr. where I lived with my husband. I wasn't all that surprised to see him there. I asked him if he had been home yet since conference. I think he said he had been home for one day. He had a briefcase sitting at the entrance to the family room. It was sitting open and I saw the envelope for my dissertation proposal in there. At first I was just glad to see it because I hoped that I could talk to him about it now. But then I also thought it curious that he had received it so quickly. There were also things in his briefcase besides papers and the types of things that you would expect to see in a briefcase but I can't remember what they were. There were two other people, women, there. I think they may have been from CIIS. One of them might have been Terri O. We were talking about my proposal. The woman I don't know asked me about my timeline for completion. I said I intend to complete it by Spring 2005. She nodded her head yes. I said that my ideal, however, was to complete it by the end of 2004, though I admitted that I didn't know if that would be possible. She shook her head no, as if to say to me that there is no way I would be able to achieve that goal.
