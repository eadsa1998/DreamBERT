 I'm in a church, walking up the center aisle, taking part in a ceremony. I see my grade school classmates Jerry Kasper and Patrick Bergman sitting. I shake their hands: it's good to see them. Later, they attack me. I feel like I'm playing a video game, like I am a video game. I punch Patrick hard in the nose. I then move or I am moved, in a position ready to fight, to another place. It feels as if I'm standing up, hopping or bouncing, and head over to the place or person where control of the fight is originating, as if to fight them. I encounter Jerry and Patrick again. They are drunk, slobbering. I fight them, slowly and steadily beating them. One or both may vomit as a result of the alcohol and/or the beating.
