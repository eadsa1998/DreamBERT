Went down for a nap and dreamt of going to lunch at some restaurant in a theme park.  It was a sort of strip place.  We were taken to a dark table, salads already provided, and I had macaroni and cheese.  Looking at the menu, at the end was a list of all the actresses and their phone numbers.  We saw their cars, all different.  Then, seeing the actresses, it was easy to tell who owned which car.  The colors were coordinated.  The midget had the small pink car.  Something happened with a guy sneaking into a trunk of one of the cars.  It became an odd pursuit, the rest of the girls coming after the guy rather forcefully to defend the other girl.  There was a stop for a night before things continued, and it ended up back at the restaurant, and the man and the owner of the car he hid in had gotten together.
