["Friends and business don't mix."] Bonnie and I are at work. I am returning to the community college to work. Theodore is there. As I am preparing, Jerome calls me into talk with him. He is very friendly and I am surprised. Then he begins to tell me all about his business on the Net and how some of these would be helpful to me. I realize he is simply trying to sell me something. I am disappointed.
