I went for a drive with Ms Solomon to her house for some reason. It was a somewhat long drive and past a forest. Later, we were in Canada and they pointed to a white bit on the map (it was snow) and said it was hard to get around because it was big. I was riding on a trolley thing. Payton was too. He asked Ms Solomon if we could get our reports now. People were on the road. One group had a member lay down in front of us. They would also shove people's faces into others' bums. Evelyn was one of the ones who got forced into someone's bum. I was then with Calvin and when we got to the place we saw Evelyn inside and tried to convince her to leave her 'friends'. She refused and we said that they were mean and we weren't, we would "make jokes". We got her on the escalator and kept pushing her, so she didn't go make up to them. We went outside the building and they wanted her to ask this guy out. He was old and married. To distract him, I went across to this little shed and screamed and pretended to be looking for the screamer. He came and was annoyed. Eugene was then with me somewhere and I did a reality check and I was thinking it was weird to breathe. Then I was in 'my room'. There was a bunk bed and a penguin toy on the top bunk. It was black and white, like usual with a yellow/orange beak. I was looking at it as it was very vivid. I tried to make Eugene appear and was turning around. I had slept in my bra and it was hurting me, so I took it off and then had no clothes on. Dad came in and I woke up and was like 'go away, I'm naked'. He left.
