Calvin and I went on a boat? It was a place for the MUPC. I had done the assignment before. I had to roll a dice for something (there were like 30 of them). I told them I was here for that. There was an elevator and Calvin stopped it, but it was only half way. We let it go and it was ok. We got in and everyone complained it was too small. We got there and just had to play around. Ms Edmundson got angry and annoyed with us. I found some notebooks at a shop that had been written on. I was like "what a douche". There was a table and we were told to sit there quietly. Then she came and said that maybe we should split up and I said "why?" and she said "you have the rest of your lives to spend together". I was like "pfft". I got the dice out a while later for some reason.
