Taking a nap at Mother and Daddy's house on the sofa. People coming in and out of the room. Trying to get them to help me wake up. I could overhear them laughing at me for moving my hands around in my sleep. Tried to decide whether to continue to signal for their help and have them keep laughing at me or stop trying so they would stop laughing.
