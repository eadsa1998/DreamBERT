John Knetass said to John Gotch my number is 8-7-8. I was working  for some company. My right hand was sore and there was a sore streak of hardness across it. I thought it was blood poisoning. I threw a loaf of bread to mother. She caught it, then she thought she threw it back. It went up and hit her on the head. Then she threw it hard at me, but I caught it. All at once it got dark.
