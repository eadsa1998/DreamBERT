I was at Westport College and that I was going to take a test in English from like an English class. And they had brought in this professional test proctor and this test proctor had all the people sitting in black across part of the length of the room, just sitting on stools and taking this test. And I was at a regular desk in the back of the room, and Mom was there, and when I got my book she was going to go outside with me so we could read it, and the teacher directed me to do that. That's what me and Melinda used to do. And when we got outside there were these big bumps in front of the building that I almost tripped over, and that I was crawling over so I could really feel how they were going. And then we got to a picnic table where we were going to take the test, and Mom was bringing out food and drinks and picnic stuff and we're picnicking and talking about everything under the sun, except doing the test. And I'm telling her, "Come on, come on, I gotta take this test. I don't know when the period's going to end, but I have to take the test." But she said, "You have extra time; don't worry." And I think that was that, and then I woke up. But before any of this, before I went into my test room, I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty was in the hall talking to somebody, and she was going to drive up in a fire truck with a whole bunch of costumes. And she was going to whoop the siren really loud so everybody would know she was there with them.
