 I go into a small gathering which may be a casino, party, or reception. I am with my friend Stephen Ramos and two women, who may be my friends Mya Rousing and Nicole Peterson. Stephen jokingly locks Mya and Nicole in a bathroom. We all leave the place. Nearby is a house. We are in the house, looking for a way out. Uncle Phil, from the television show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, and his wife, are having a birthday party there. We need to escape unnoticed. There are some nice rooms there. I look for valuables to steal. The people living here are rich. My friends Hilary Nano, Niles Zelling, and Tim Zelling are also there. We must evade uncle Phil and find an exit. We make it out. Stephen's car is there. I am supposed to be meeting them in their car somewhere. I'm at the bottom of a dirt cliff, which has roots as steps. I climb up the cliff. Niles has the key to the car. He throws is down the hill, and leaves it there.
