I was on the ground facing a snake which was slithering toward me just as it did in The Passion of the Christ.  I had a pistol.  I fired once and missed; the bullet sailed lazily over its head, and I was worried that even if I hit it I couldn't kill it.  And sure enough, the second bullet went right into the snake's mouth without any effect.  The third one missed, and then the snake was too close and I woke up moaning.
