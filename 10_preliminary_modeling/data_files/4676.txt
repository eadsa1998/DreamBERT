I am in an open field or a university campus. Lots of students are there. A woman teacher is talking to the group. I am suddenly concerned I had forgotten to study for a mathematics class and maybe a science class. I feel a bit of panic. Then I relax and think oh, well, it's my last term. I'm not going to worry about it. If I flunk those classes, then I flunk. I see a plate full of hamburger gravel and corn. It is my left over mess. I start to put some water in it to scrub off the mess. Right in the middle of the field as the teacher talks to the students. Then a man talks. He is sharing how he came back to school after some time being out of school. He confesses he's in trouble. He didn't study, he partied and now he's on drugs and flunking. He tells his story. I and others feel great empathy for him as he slowly walks sadly away. I am now sweeping up a gravelly mess off the field like I'd been doing on the plate. A student runs after the man. I am relieved someone will try and help him. The woman teacher stands there staring at him. A Tom Hanks kind of counselor goes to him. Good. He will get some help.
