["Performance excellence."] I am in a room with other students. I am asked to audition for a part with a Uni house young student, female. We go in front of the class, seated at a small card table and do a scene. We are very good and impress the woman teacher. She asks me to be in the upcoming production. I wait, atfer class, to get instructions. She has me try on a dress, a costume, for the play. It is too long and we are pinning it up for the hem. She wants me to hem it. I sigh. That's hard work for my hands but I don't say anything. Then I see the bottom part is completely cut off and the dress is now at the knee. I think that will be an easier job to hem.
