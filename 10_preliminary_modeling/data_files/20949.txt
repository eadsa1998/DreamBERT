We were trying out a shotgun with Andy P. It shot to the right side. I shot at a piece of paper on the street that was moving and hit it. A news boy was behind it and he yelled at us. He was lying in the ditch by the curb stone. Someone threw out Bob's red rubber ball. It bounced, but I didn't want to ruin his ball.
