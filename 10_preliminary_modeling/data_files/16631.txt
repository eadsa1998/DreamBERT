Mom had to give a pee sample at the doctor's office. But she didn't actually have to go to the doctor, she could do it at home. So get this: She had to float a bucket in the toilet, and put the phone in the bucket so that whatever she would pee in the bucket would go over the phone to the doctor's office! In this dream, I had to go to the toilet. I remembered that the bucket was there, and I was just going to take it out. But the bucket tipped, and it got full of water, and the phone got wet. So I took it out quickly and put it on a side, and I was wondering if I was going to get an electric shock. See, this was the kitchen phone, and it was still, like, attached to the wall. But how we had it in the bathroom, I don't know, go figure. I think that's all there was to it.
