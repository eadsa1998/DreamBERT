I was driving my car at night and I came on top of a hill and I noticed I was lost. It was a strange street and seemed like a strange town. I was loving my wife Ann in the garden. I drove my car and steering didn't seem to work, so I ran into a tree. I went to talk to Charlie and Andy, and Joe came in and gave me a stare that I am always loafing, so I told him I was working all the time he was away and just came here. I watched fellow down the pins and glasses were about 6 ft. away. The boys threw the balls thru the air and would get one pin at a time.
