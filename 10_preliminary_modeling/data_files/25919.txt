 I'm walking with my high school teammate Tony Kramer to Jefferson School in Oak Valley. We are in front of the old rectory on Bauer Avenue near 1st Street. I'm wearing maroon colors, and he is wearing tan. We're dressed up. We walk to Jefferson, where our teammate John Kulik and others are playing basketball. There are cabins up north. I stay with Tony in one cabin. He is also staying with a woman named Kristen in a different cabin. Our cabin is a one-hour cabin. It is pretty nice, with a double bed and a refrigerator. My friend Matt Yams and my boss Mike Hollow tell me of a dream of catching frogs. I am going fishing with a slip-bobber and my slip-bobber rod with 12lb test line. Mike makes me take my ultralite rod too. I walk by my high school friend Tina Totts in the forest area where the cabins are. She asks me about her eyebrow clipper, as if I have it and she wants it back. I see or am in a scene where people are sledding. It is winter and the hills are covered with snow. People go fast down hills on different types of sleds. One man does a nice jump. I walk through a trough-like stream of icy water. I go into a bathroom in a building. My grade school football coach Fred Truck is in the bathroom cleaning his butt hole with bidet.
