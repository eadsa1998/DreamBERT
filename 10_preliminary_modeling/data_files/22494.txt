Last night's dream took place at the door of my house and on the street where I live, which is a little square. I was watching and sometimes participating. I saw my father. I was also impressed because two performers from the Tom Jones show were dancing; they were women in pink silk dresses with white polka dots, like Spanish dancers, with frills, typically Spanish. They were dancing at the entrance, and my mother came out of the kitchen into the street and saw them. My father was also watching them. That's as far as my dream went. I wanted to hold on to the moment and there remained two flags from I don't know which countries, which served to prove that they had been dancing there. I also saw Tom Jones in the air, swinging and singing, but I couldn't hear him.
