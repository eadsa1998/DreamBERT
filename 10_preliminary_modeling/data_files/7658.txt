Matthew was giving a man his first haircut at the house where I grew up. The man had a stocky build, was balding, grey curly hair, very nice, wore one of those felt, flat type of a hat, but not a beret. He was being very supportive and kind about this being Matthew's first time. When he was done, I gave him a thumb's up, though I didn't think Matthew had done a very good job. As the man was leaving, I tried to find Matthew to see if he would be hurt if I fixed it up a bit for the man but I couldn't find Matthew. I went ahead and ran out to the driveway to make the offer to the man anyway. I had still been in bed and had on a short, spaghetti-strap nightgown. I stood by the man's care with my arms folded across my breasts for this reason. He took me up on my offer and continued to be very kind about the whole situation. I asked the man if he ever thought about shaving the top where he had alot stray hair. I started fixing the rest.
