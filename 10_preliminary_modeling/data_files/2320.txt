I go into my sister Lydia's house to visit. I see room after room that go far back into the house as I walk from one room to the next saying, "I had no idea you had so many rooms that she could use." An open door led to a restaurant and a waitress heard my remark and agreed. We go into another room and Lydia is upset. She says a man had just had a heart attack and had fallen forward onto a chest of drawers, badly marking the wood and Doug will be upset! I am shocked she had witnessed a death and turn to see this mark, but it's so tiny I can barely see it. I try to soothe her and am annoyed she's so upset about Doug's reaction. We then go outside, we'd gone full circle and have come out a side front door. She says, "See my beautiful view?" I look up and suddenly notice a magnificent range of mountains, lush green and wild. I say, "You really do have a beautiful view." I then see quite large people mountain climbing with ropes, some throwing themselves off the mountain and looking terrified and then the rope catching them so they were safe. I say I'd not like to do that. Then we go for a walk by the raging river, all brown and roiling. As I near it, I have to lay down because I feel afraid I'll lose my balance and fall in. We move away and Lydia says it's about ready to do a loop wave and might flood the house. I say, "Your house gets flooded?" She says "Yeah, sometimes." Later I get in my van, but before we can leave, I must empty the water from a vacuum cleaner-like thing. I open the sliding door and pour the water from the hose to the curb. It flows and flows and flows. I am amazed (astounded). It is so much water. At one point the van floats like a log and nearly crushes a floating face. I push the van away from the curb, just in time, and feel relieved the near accident was prevented.
