I was in a play.  A story like Moulin Rouge, a love story.  I knew the plot, but there was no script, so we adlibbed it all.  I had a twin sister- I don't know if that was a character or an actress.  Things ended differently.  Although we were the actor and actress, the boy and I were both delightfully surprised when it was a happy ending- the girl went with him.  Then I sat on the steps of a train station with my arms around my boyfriend Jeremy and I sang "Loudly" to him.
