It was night and raining and I was driving Ezra somewhere but I was letting him drive. I told him to pull down the next street so we could swap because it was illegal. We did and I turned around and stopped behind some cars at the lights. I got out to take the L-plates off. There was a car behind me and I took off slowly and turned left. I was trying to find my way around. We ended up in a hospital and I couldn't work out how to get out. This lady said she would help but we had to sign up for this course etc. We ran away and she got angry. We ended up in a street and one side was decorated 'spooky' because it was some area that did something like the Royal Show. There were cartoon-ish cars. Then we were with Mom and Roland and I asked what he was doing and he said "drunk" and offered me apple pie. I said I'd have half of it. I asked if anyone had found this photo album/magazine which had photos of celebrities and I remembered it from this night ages ago where I had been on that creepy street. James Spader had been there and people had said they liked him and he said "it was my brother that you liked" etc -- his brother had died. There was also a professional photo of Milo Ventimiglia. They were mostly all candid though. There was also a photo of Jason Segel and one of Neil Patrick Harris meditating and he was really skinny.
