I was talking to Leif on Facebook and said that if someone interesting offered me sex, I would be interested. I was on holiday in this weird country. I went to take a photo and a lady told me I had a bug in my arm - it was sticking out the back of my arm, and was serrated so I couldn't pull it out. I went to this guy who could get rid of them and he put sewing stuff on and then said he wasn't 'good with Chabrol'. There was a list of all the guys who could get rid of them and their 'strengths'. Feargal Sharkey was a 'Chabrol' so I went to him. He put it underwater and then just easily pulled it out. Thre was a little bit left alive - the first bit was meat and the second was skin. There was a guy who was invisible and a drug dealer. He could appear for a while sometimes and could float. A guy came looking for him and he floated out of the way. His girlfriend heard a girl in his room and was listening to his voicemail, and knew he was there too.
