 I'm with a group of six others in an area that is flooded. There is $3.99 for all of us to eat. We are waiting to be rescued. There is a woman and a child. They sled down an icy hill onto snow and up to where I am. The woman sends her child before her on a tiny sled. Then she follows. They go fast and become airborne after a bump, and then crash into the snow. The snow I am on collapses. I fall through down into a narrow gulch or ravine: a big crevice. I manage to climb up a little ways. When I get to the top I yell at the woman to move away from the edge of the unsafe snow. She doesn't move, and we both fall down. It is cramped rock area with snow. We slide down a long ways. I am with my classmate Bryan Beard. We go to the setup area for the rescue plane. The area is a big hanger. We need to move a big platform that we are on to the big door and attach it. The platform moves, kind of floating. We try to get it into position. I fall out of the platform and hang onto the big door, grasping a lock. The platform moves back around and I jump in. The plane is there. Bryan and I have paper towels. We must hold the roll of paper towels to wrap around the propellers of the plane. It is a last resort. We don't have many options. I hold the tube of the towels with my fingers in each end. The end of the towel is wrapped around the propeller. It turns slowly. Before I know it the towel is unraveled. It didn't help the propeller much.
