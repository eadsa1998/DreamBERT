I'm in the M City house. Arvonne is there and Paulina. I am feeding a baby. Paulina and I are preparing foods. I pick up a packet of paper and decide to put it in the "old pool room." I go in there. Lots of boxes of things. I go to the far windows and look out nostalgically. The girls wonder what I'm looking at. It looks pretty ordinary to them. I say with a sigh, "You can't see what I see," and describe the old garage and the drive way. (I remember sexual enjoyment and love with Darryl)
