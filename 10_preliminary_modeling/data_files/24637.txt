I was at math class, and my teacher for math whose name is Tom was teaching us the same stuff he had taught us today. And then near the end of math class, he got really weird. He was saying a lot of things he hadn't really said, and was changing what he taught us today to something really, really weird. I didn't really understand him at the end of our math class. Setting: In the math room. Characters: Tommy (math teacher who has brown hair and was wearing a red, green and black sweater). Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. I was startled because I wasn't really sure about what the dream was
