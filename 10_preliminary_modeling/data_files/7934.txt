Before I arrived or before I got into the house I was talking on the phone or something about having had some surgery. So I was arriving in pajamas and a robe and I was talking about a itch and about how each time I scratched the itch my gown moved up a little bit and I was making jokes about that. So I was still joking about that when I entered the home to begin the lecture. I was using a hairbrush to scratch my itch. I was sharing my life story of my journey to finding my current path. It was an in-home lecture. Some of it was my family and some were, I suppose, friends of family. I remember specifically Mother, Daddy, Bev, Aunt P, Larry K, Bruce W, Dick W, Sue K, Linda W. At one point, when I was kind of caught off guard, I had forgotten that this was the purpose of this lecture so I was having a little bit of trouble composing myself to start to talk. I found myself very teary and didn't want this to be a tearful talk. I was also somewhat concerned because my parents were there and I was guarded on what I wanted to share in front of them and I also did not want to hurt them in anyway by anything I said. I finally got started and a couple of times people started their own conversations about unrelated things. I just quit talking until they all quit talking and decided to pay attention. I was thinking how rude that was and how much it irritates me. I find it disrespectful to a speaker. I went through a little bit of my history and I got to People's drug stores and I started that maybe I needed to fast forward through. just recap company closings, etc and how I took that as a sign to change career paths.
