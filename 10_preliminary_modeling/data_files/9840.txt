Walk by the Church: see liturgy in session; see Father Andrew in red robes. He is standing alongside the altar; I walk in and try to ask him a question; somehow I get entangled with his robes and I fall down; I am very embarrassed because I am wearing inappropriate dress; ask who the liturgy was for? Music Conservatory students; later similar liturgy for Music Conservatory students: I lie in a pew, naked, very embarrassed.
