I seem to be running away from someone in flight or just running. I was cleaning out something and on the bottom as I scraped it, it still was sweet. Fisher and I were walking along a road. I looked over a deep valley and on the opposite a man was sitting with a pistol in his hand. Then we walked over a bridge. I looked down and it was very high. I was afraid to go near the other end. I was afraid to fall over. When we reached the other end of the bridge the water was high, almost reaching the bridge. I looked down Pearl Rd. and Ridge where there were a lot of trees before and now I noticed they were cut down and gone.
