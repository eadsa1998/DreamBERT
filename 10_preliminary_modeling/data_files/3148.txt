Now we are coming to earth and I realize I've made a wrong decision. He has gone back to his drugs and he's a teen boy now and hangs out in another space capsule, being irresponsible and taking his drugs. I go out to confront him. Dovre is wiped out on drugs also. They blame each other and I see Dovre is holding her baby and the baby is distressed. I forcibly take the baby from her and leave them to their misery; they will have to choose to come out of it themselves and I dedicate myself to caring for the baby. She now sleeps cozily on my shoulder. Another woman (my mother?) has another baby she is carrying for. I realize this is what I need to do. I need to go back and care for the baby and do it right this time, giving freely of my time and energy to protect the baby.
