 I'm at a restaurant with my mom, my brother Wally, and sister Heather and Ramona. The restaurant is in the city in a shopping mall. We order and eat. The waitress is crabby and short-tempered. Several waiters are there to help clear away the dishes when we're done. A man comes to our table. He seems to be the manager. He is wearing dark pants, a white shirt with stripes, and a tie. He wants my mom to write a check to pay for the meal, and then he'll give her cash. This somehow benefits him. He estimates the cost of our meal using a calculator. He figures my mom's meal to be about five dollars, and everyone else's meal to be about $2.75. I had what my mom had plus an appetizer, so I figure my meal will be the most expensive, costing more than seven dollars. My meal costs a lot more than the others. The man figures the cost of the meal to be about $25. He gives mom a $20 bill and $5 for a tip. He comes back a little bit later and says that $25 isn't enough to pay for the bill, and gives mom a $50 bill. Wally, Ramona, and Heather order more food. I don't realize they do this until it arrives at the table. When it does, they are not at the table. I eat whatever it is that I can, stuffing it into my mouth. The food consists of fried appetizers. My mom writes a check to pay for the meal. The man ends up paying for the whole meal. The waitpersons are crabby and impatient. We walk out of the restaurant. I see a person I know from high school named Karin Bellview. I look at her and say hi. She is sitting on the ground. It takes her a little while to realize it is I, but she does, and says hi. I say that the whole experience in the restaurant was weird.
