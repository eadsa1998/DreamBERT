I dreamed that I was coming home from a dance - my date was sick &amp; one of his friends had to bring me home. En route home, this friend, who does not resemble anyone I know became quite amorous, frightening me. I finally got back to the dorm; came in a door (which actually does not exist - seemed to be cut through the wall).
