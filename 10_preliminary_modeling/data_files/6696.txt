I have to go to the hospital for a check on my eyes. I go in and start to arrange my things. The nurse tells me the doctor will see me soon. When I open the table drawer it is full of things left by a former patient and many cigarette ashes. I wonder why a good hairbrush is left. I make a complaint. The nurse comes back and says the doctor hasn't come but she had better give me my coke now just in case. I think she means cocaine and I wonder why she gives it the evening before and anyway why since there is to be no operation this time since both eyes have been operated on. Another nurse tidies up the table drawers. It now has a row of short ones at one side like an office desk. She has emptied the bottom ones but I want to use the upper ones so I begin to move the old alphabet blocks from one drawer. Then it is morning and I am on the lanai talking to another patient. Then I am walking in the hallway and nearly fall for I do not see the last flight of three or four stairs at right angles to the first cross the hallway without any railing. It is nearly noon and Dr. M. has not come yet and I worry some. At last he is there but talking to his wife and someone else about going to see an exhibit. I would like to go too. At last he comes to m and asks if I have been receiving treatment. With some resentment I tell him the nurses have done nothing for me all day. I've had no medicine, not even what I've been taking at home. I did not bring that since I was to be here only one day. He pulls 3 or 4 bottles of medicine from his pocket and tells me to take them and says, "We may not be back today." He hasn't checked my eyes and I can't go home if he doesn't return and I exclaim that I was to have gone and "You are always saying that it will be shorter than it is. I wish you'd say it would be longer so I'd not be disappointed."
