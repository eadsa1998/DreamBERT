I was at my first job as a trainee supervisor. It was a supermarket. Niles was there too and I saw his checklist of stuff was completely filled out and I only had two things checked. I was annoyed that he'd done it before me. I was then at home and Mom and Darren were planning on buying this house across the road from Rochester Circle. It was old and falling apart and small. I was complaining and said I didn't want to move. Our house was the same, but we had an attic and the yard was massive. Mom and I went for a walk in the backyard - which went alongside the road and the fence wasn't totally closed off - and there were all these sheds and things falling apart and rotten.
