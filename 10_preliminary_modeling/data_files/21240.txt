I was flying around a house. A lady tried to catch me. I first ran, then flew up and watched her from the top of one side of the house. Then I took Bob and flew up high and I came down and up in a dive-bomber style like I flew fast. I touched a young girl's sex organs and it was a male instead of a girl. It got hard for him. Then he touched my sex organs and it was so sensitive that I had to push his hand away and he always came close to me and did it to me. I saw large black walnuts on the ground. A big truck was coming down the road, which was narrow. The big wheel and tires sunk into the mud and the mud pushed towards me. I moved to the edge of the road. We were sitting on a boat and funny bugs and salamander like things moved by. The boat was on land. A big savage of some kind came by and pushed our boat into the water and started to row us out. His enemies came along the shore and they were throwing objects at us. I held onto Bob. I was afraid we would overturn and Bob would drown because he couldn't swim. I was half asleep and I heard loudly Beachhead. I was looking for a farm. I went to Rivertown. I met Mike Farina. I was going up a hill to get one at a small store. One of my friends was to be a rebel so I got a pail of dirty water and said, "So you want to be a rebel," and I gave him water as he came at me. He finally gave up, then Kogler said he was going to be a rebel. I threw some water under a door where Kogler was putting on the rebel clothes.
