My dream last night was that it was spring gala at my college, but it was actually at my high school 's hockey rink, which was located right in the middle of Manhattan. There was a lot of confusion surrounding the event: first, I had forgotten my dress but had no way of getting home to retrieve it; My mother was be really unhelpful; Jessica was trying to call me, but my phone wouldn't work, and the whole time I am just trying to get my dress. I somehow managed to shower and get ready, and even timed my arrival at the rink properly so that I was neither too early, nor too late. I soon realized, however, that I had put no eye makeup on, so I scrambled through my bag looking for mascara and eyeliner. I ran to the bathroom. In my dream, I thought I looked great in my shiny silver dress and strappy high heels, even though I would probably wear neither of those items in real life. So I finished applying eye makeup and tried to find Aaron. I had been looking forward to gala for a while because I wanted to be with him. On the bleachers of the rink was every guy from my high school. But I was frustrated because I only wanted to see Aaron, but instead I could only see every guy from high school. I kept hoping he would just find me and pull me away. And even as I started waking up, I tried to stay asleep to see if I would ever find Aaron, but I never did. It was almost as if I knew my conscious self couldn't see him, so I wanted my unconscious side to compensate for the absence.
