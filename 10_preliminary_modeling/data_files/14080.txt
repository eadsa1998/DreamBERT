I was watching One Tree Hill. Carrie and someone in the Scott family or close to the family had become friends with her and they brought her to Nathan and Haley's house. She said she was getting help now and these other people at the house tried to get rid of her before Haley saw her there. Nathan had an apron on and was covered in chocolate as he was making a cake or something. They tried to stop her going in the kitchen, but Haley saw her and got angry demanding that she leave. Then a few kids were there and they were all boys. I couldn't remember who was who. Keith was there too. I said he wouldn't be able to raise his kid. Haley and Nathan had had a new son and it was just born and it had a ring on, which looked huge and like it was going to fall off and I was like "Ew, why does a newborn have a ring on?".
