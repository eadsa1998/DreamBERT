I am wearing a lovely evening gown, walking through a building hoping not to be noticed. I almost make it, but a guy whistles at me. I ignore him. He catches up with me and asks me to dance. I agree reluctantly. He says he only dances "the box," i.e. he dances in a straight line backwards, then turns 90 degrees and dances the next line, etc. forming a square. He's attracted to me. I feel defensive, and somewhat stiff.
