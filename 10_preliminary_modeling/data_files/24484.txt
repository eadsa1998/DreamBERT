I am on a patrol with another American. We set up a perimeter and ambush site. We are in the jungle but it is, in fact, a large civilian park. I ask him for my M-16 because I cannot find it, but it is lost. He gives me my .45; he has the machine gun. In the morning, after an uneventful night, we head back to a car, which will take us away. The car has been broken into. Items have been stolen. No one can be trusted.
