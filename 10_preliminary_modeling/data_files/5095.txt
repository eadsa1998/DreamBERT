Mary is laying in the bathtub taking a bath. My bath chair is out and I am standing, intending to bathe standing and wondering if I'll be able to stand that long. Nancy comes in to scrub Mary's back and I sit on the toilet to have a watery bowel movement and hope it doesn't stink. I try to wipe myself and get some on my thumbnail. The sink is filled to overflowing. I rinse my thumb and continue to wipe my butt, which has streaks of it. Suddenly Mary yells, "The Clinic," and gets up and runs so fast out of the bathroom that she doesn't even bother to open the door, she goes through the door, like she's a spirit or melts through it. I comment on that to Nancy, it is so amazing. Mary comes back very upset because she was right. She just missed her clinic appointment and it was so important. She's leaving for Mexico and wanted to know what to do if she got raped and they used knives to cut the inside of her vagina. I try to be helpful and suggest she can find some books on the subject at Paralandra's. It wouldn't be the same, but maybe it would help. [BL]
