 I'm with my mom, my sister Ramona, and brother Wally. We're going down Hill Ave from Main Street to 3rd Street. My mom says it smells like fishing. I agree. It's not totally light out, and is early in the morning. We get down near the Jones' house on 3rd Street, and are walking. The Jones family is awake. Some of them are sitting inside and some are sitting outside. They are smoking. Don Jones is inside at a desk doing cocaine. I am smoking too. I am only exhaling. I put my cigarette out on a snow bank on the porch. As we are walking, we see a man light up a cigarette as he jogs. I think that he is really dumb. I job a little with a lit cigarette as I approach the Jones'. We are inside their house. My uncle Miles Redding is there. We are going to play two-handed Cut Throat. The family members that are with me are there too. We play the game with photographs: my photographs of summer fishing and some hunting photographs. There are different sizes of photographs: some 4x6, some 3x5. There is confusion about the rules. Twos, threes, and nine through Ace are used. We are then using real playing cards, not photographs. My childhood neighbor Terry Mink is there with his little brother. Everyone is up early to smoke.
