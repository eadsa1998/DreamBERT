I was dreaming about taking some sort of trip. I arranged 4 packs of cigarettes, Lucky Strikes, which were partially empty, each to different degrees, to divide my vacation into four parts. I gave them to someone, telling what date each stood for, I remember one that was for July 20, the other dates have faded. One pack was almost empty, having 4 or 5 cigarettes left. Transition here fades and I was then in a store trying to use a pack of tickets for a trip on some lake. The man I was talking to runs the soda fountain at the corner drug store. He told me that I must have 2 tickets next to each other on the ship with the number 34 at the bottom right hand corner of each one. The tickets were arranged with numbers much like on a calendar. I didn't find tickets arranged this way I only found one that had a 34 on the corner. Transition again fades and changes and I was on the edge of the lake. English professors began appearing, mostly ladies. They had dangling earrings, and once again numbers came into my dream. There was English 309 A, English 219, etc. and each one had a professor appearing for it. I was awakened at this point.
