We were at the Technical College waiting around in a hallway. I saw Fernando come out of a room and he was surrounded by smoke and carrying a bong. I was like 'you're smoking at school?' And I went in and he had this jar of weed, but it was like thin strips of asparagus with different colours on the end and I said I'd never seen anything like it. I got my weed out of my bag and walked back in to show him. A lady teacher came in and saw us and walked back out. Later I saw Tristan at his work, which was this desk job thing and he said that he was banned from the Technical College and no one would hire him. He told me that they told him it was for failing a class and that I was probably going to get the same thing and I was worried and dreading the call.
