My little brother chased me out of the house one day with marshmallows. He was throwing them at me. I decided not to throw any back. I ran to my car and took off. I burned my tires going out he driveway, making a lot of noise. There was a police car behind me. He stopped me and gave me four tickets. This made me mad because had had them written up before he got out of the car. The left front door was open and the cop was standing about 4-10 inches from the car. After he gave me the tickets, I slapped it in reverse and took off. This knocked him over, but I was still mad about the tickets. I went over to school, but just getting to school I stopped and looked down a hold in the ground 8' diameter and 12' deep. It had like cheese cloth over the top and music and news were emitting from somewhere in the hole. I have seen this hole many times in other dreams. After that I met two friends in the parking lot and was showing them the tickets, but got so mad about them, I woke up.
