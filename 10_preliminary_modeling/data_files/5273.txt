I dreamed that I owned this "salty bar" with Granddaddy right next to the ocean. One day, the whole school had to sail over to China to hear some sort of lecture. I missed the boat and had to swim over. I had brought a plate of Brie, but it was filled with poisonous crabs from my trip over. I dropped the dish when I got on land, and was terrified that they would poison me. But then I told myself that this was a dream, so I kept on walking to the lecture. When I got there, it was more like SNL than a serious lecture. I couldn't understand why we'd had to travel that whole way for this. I was sitting on the stage and could see Jackson right in front of me. The lecture ended 3 hours early. The deans said we had to remain there for the next 3 hours before going back. Vanessa started whining but then everyone made fun of her, so that was OK. Then Jackson looked at me and said he loved me and I woke up.
