It started out, it was Nancy and me. We were getting this little girl from this woman. I didn't know the woman and the little girl. We got her (the little girl) and we put her in school. She was a little younger than me. I was looking for my mom. I went to this club where my aunt, who was a stranger, worked. She said, "Oh, why don't you dance for us? We need a dancer." I danced for them, and all these boys went, "Woo woo." The boys were from my class. I went outside, and I went to the store. At the store they said "Oh, why don't you have this?" They gave me this outfit, which was black, over my head. You could only see my eyes. There was a long-sleeved dress. Mom came up to me, and I said, "Mom, there you are." Mom said, "So you got dressed by that place." I said, "Are those your relatives?" Mom said, "No, I just go in there (the store) a lot." We walked by this group of girls. There were weird sounds, and we thought it was a ghost. But it was really these girls and boys. At first it sounded like Bob's voice (8-year-old boy from school who has a crush on Vickie). We just walked on.
