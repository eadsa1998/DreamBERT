I was a guest at a dinner party, at which all the people present seemed to be members of my fraternity. My mother and I sat side-by-side at the large table. There were a few older people there whose number seemed to constantly increase. They were quite jovial and one lady in particular was exceedingly adept at relating funny anecdotes. I don't remember anything of what was said.
