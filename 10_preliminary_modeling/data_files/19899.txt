A patient on my ward named Ward appeared in this dream. I was in a gym. Ward had a teenage girl by the arms and legs and was swinging her in a circle. Her back was to him. She struggled to get away from him, and finally broke away and ran out of the gym. I called after her and said I would swing her in a different way that would not hurt her, but she did not hear me. (This patient had a virile build, and very masculine features, but his concept of women as mere sex objects always annoyed me.)
