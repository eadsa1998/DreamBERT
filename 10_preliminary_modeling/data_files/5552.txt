[1997-05-14] This dream involved guide dog school. Somehow I was at my parents' old house and we were sitting on the front porch and a lady came up and asked how did I get home every day, at what time did I get off the bus, then I said that I don't take the bus, once in a while I take the bus, but most of the time I don't take the bus, at first I couldn't remember how I got home and then I remembered that I took a taxi home, but somehow I couldn't figure out how I did that because somehow I was stuck at Redwood school, where I attended when I was a kid and it didn't seem to have anything to do with working. I knew that I usually walked to work like I do now and so I was all mixed up trying to answer her question, it seemed like an unusually difficult question, very confused. Then I was at guide dog school and there were all these people who it seemed were waiting to be evaluated for guide dogs. There must have bee 45 students all standing around asking questions and nobody was assisting them, and I wasn't there to get a guide dog, but I remember thinking, gee, what a disorganized school, to have these people standing around asking questions and not being seated in a room, being talked to about what to expect and what its going to be like. And then we were in this other place and it was really early in the morning and we had eaten breakfast and I was walking around and there was a lot of grass and a lot of opened space, and for some unknown reason, I had to get up early and I said that I was going to walk around down here, its so nice, it was a countryish setting and I was going to walk around.
