I was in a concert hall of my favorite singer, she was singing and I was sitting in the 5th or 6th row. The concert location was unfamiliar to me. I've seen Jewel play dozens of times, but I've never seen her in the location I pictured. She began by singing five or six songs, then introducing her sister (she doesn't really have one) sitting next to me. Her sister frightened me, dressed in all black and with a piercing. Her sister didn't even smile or wave as she was being introduced. She almost smirked. It was really bizarre. Then Jewel took a break and came out ready to sing without any clothing. She was totally naked, no guitar in hand, just the mic on stage. I remember thinking that this was really funny. It didn't seem that implausible at the time. Then I woke up.
