We were in Maui. Maui had a bear problem. We went swimming in the pool and a bear came in. It was right near a boy but it passed him. He came towards us and as soon as it caught us it said "Gotcha!" and he took off his mask. It was a person. Setting: Grand Wilea, Maui. Characters: A bear/person, Sally, a boy, and me. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. I was really scared because I thought the bear was going to eat us.
