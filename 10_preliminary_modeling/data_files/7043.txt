I'm leaving a party. Say farewell to children. Ask way to bus station. As I am leaving, see my hostess behind a glass door and bid her farewell. As I near RR tracks, ask way to station. Buy ticket to Milwaukee just as train comes. Ask for thru ticket to Seattle but can't buy one. Ticket $1.31. Realize I left one big bag with my best change purse behind. Oh they can send it after me. I find change and pay for ticket.
