 I'm in a cave-like structure that is dark inside. Some people are with me. I see the eyes of two tigers in the cave. The eyes are green, and shine brightly. I seem to be on the Redding family farm, or a farm with open spaces. They two tigers are there, a little ways off. Others and myself are scared of the tigers. Someone hands me a .44 caliber magnum for protection. I open the chamber and see there are no shells in it: the gun is of no use. I go into a small shack, which is the farther north of the two old white sheds at the Redding farm. I try to close the flimsy wooden gate behind me. There's a gap below and above the gate, which wouldn't protect me from the tigers. I look on the shelves of the shed for ammunition. I find many shells that are close to what a .44 caliber magnum shell looks like, and I try them in one of the six chambers, but not many of them fit. I find one that fits. It looks like a longer, thicker .22 caliber shell. The tigers come around and enter the shed. I am terrified. I make no quick movements. I try to act smoothly and calmly, like I'm not worried at all by them. I know the tigers are extremely powerful, self-contained, and potentially deadly for me. They wander through and leave. I know one bullet isn't enough, so I find more.
