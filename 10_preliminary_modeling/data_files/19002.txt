Prior to awakening I was going through a series of ideas like the first time I recalled a series of stages, a picture of a sheet of paper. There was a number of them that just sort of flash by. Then just prior to awakening was a picture of overcast cloud. It was just sort of being separated. Another voice was saying that it seemed as if there was some instructor describing the situation of this cloud opening up, and this instructor was saying something to the effect like there is an opening which is hard to detect at first. The rest of the instructor's voice isn't clear. This is possibly just before being awakened.
