Talking to someone about Jennifer C at the CAS office ordering office supplies and there being something not right with the financial part of that - like they're trying to cheat the office supply company. I told them that I saw one of her supply orders and I noticed that she had deducted a certain amount from the total due. It made me suspicious. Bill defended here saying it was a special deal or a coupon. Ordering supplies for SAID.
