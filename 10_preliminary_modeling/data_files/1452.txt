I am a teacher and a mother. I have a young good-looking son. I am at Aunt Elaine's house, sort of. I'm sleeping, naked, the sheets just barely covering me. My son comes in to wake me up. Someone says to him, "How can you do that? Aren't you turned on by her?" He says, "Yeah," but I'm his mother, so he doesn't do anything about it. I get up. I am arguing with our boss because I can only use the materials at hand to teach with and all we have are tissue paper and glitter. I pick up a blue round thing and toss it aside. I need books, updated material, etc. Our boss says what we have is sufficient and use it!
