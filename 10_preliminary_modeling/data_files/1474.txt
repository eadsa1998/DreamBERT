Abner and I are going to play a game. A sleek cat hops up into my arms and is very friendly. She puts her paws around my neck and hugs me. I feel very happy. "She's hugging me," I tell Abner and my mother, in surprise. I want to spend time with my cat. Abner feels a little hurt, so I reluctantly put the cat down.
