It was a winter's day and I was driving along in a car full of people my own age, male and female. We came to a house which was only half completed. It belonged to a newly married couple. The wife had just finished setting the table for company. There were no doors or windows in the house, merely places where they should have been. The house looked like it had been struck by fire. In fact there was a woman around the age of thirty-two who was standing in the corner and ironed. She said that there had been a fire that day, but that she had to finish ironing the little girl's dress. We all left the house when the guests began to arrive.
