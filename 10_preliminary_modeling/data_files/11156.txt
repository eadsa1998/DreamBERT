I dreamed I was entertaining people of my own age in a house which was supposed to be mine, but it was a house I had never seen before. I was unfamiliar with the cupboard and closets and every time someone asked me for something, I would hunt frantically, but would never find it. The person who asked would never be mad, but would look at me as if I couldn't help what I was doing. I can remember music being played and a great many people everywhere laughing. I can also remember thinking to myself that this house that was supposed to be mine could not possibly have been, yet I did not know where my real house was.
