I dreamt I went to the free clinic because of swollen breasts -- maybe infected. I stood at the counter and talked to the guy about my symptoms. I felt embarrassed. He would repeat what I said back to me. Then I heard a recording of our interaction. I was surprised by how upset and afraid and hesitant I sounded and how bored the guy sounded.
