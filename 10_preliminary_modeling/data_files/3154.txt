I am standing in a group of people all entangled together in a sort of circle. We are singing a song and entwining our arms and holding hands. It is awkward. I have something in my hand and yet managed to keep connected. After we are done, Marilyn steps over and says we could do some choir work. I nod, but my attention is on this bunch of food I need to take, care of slabs of meat in packages. I need to get them frozen and put away and decide to put a refridge in the area we're at, rather than drag it all home. I want to make a lunch. I go home and it's a mess there -- food all over, dirty dishes. Marilyn starts cleaning and I say with relief, "Ah, you've started back to work." I pay her to clean up, but it's been a while. There's lots to do. She is energetic and efficient. I am glad. There's something about traveling, maybe on a bus.
