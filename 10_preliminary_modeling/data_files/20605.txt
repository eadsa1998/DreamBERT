I was in a dimly lit basement room which had a dirt floor. A tunnel was outside the room. Birds were feeding on some bread. A hungry-looking goat came and ate some of the bread. Then two boys about 10 started fighting outside the door. A moment later I noticed that they were handcuffed together. One was a little taller, and his hair was long. The shorter boy seemed to fear him.
