I was on a tour bus with a group of people. We were driving on a mountain road. It seemed that we were in Hawaii or the Caribbean. The bus was going fast and out of control. Then I looked around and saw that my group was no longer on the bus. It seemed they sneaked off. The bus hadn't slowed down, so I didn't notice the group was gone until I looked out the rear window and saw them on the side of the road while the bus sped on. There was a young girl on the bus who seemed equally confused. She was either Hawaiian or of Asian descent. I couldn't tell. Then the bus driver, a man, turned around and laughed maliciously, like he wasn't going to stop the bus or crash. Finally we came to a narrow cobblestone street, and I grabbed the girl by the hand and jumped off the bus. She did something afterward. I think she thanked me and started to eat something. I was confused as to where she got the food. Then I started to retrace the bus's route to find the rest of my group.
