I was going to my grandmother's house. When I got there, I found that a bunch of fellow students (all male and all dressed in white) had thrown a pair of shoes onto the roof of my grandmother's house. The shoes belonged to my aunt's boy who is brain damaged. I thought this was a dirty trick and was quite angry at the students for doing this childish act. I climbed up on the roof to get the shoes and threw them down to the ground. Before I could get down , the group of students started throwing rocks up at me from all sides. I crouched in the center of the roof and none of the rocks hit me directly. Then they decided to come up and get me. I punched the first one up the ladder off the roof. A few more came at me and I knocked them all off the roof. The rest left me alone. Then the scene changed and I was in a bar with a small, raised wooden stage. A stranger asked me if I wanted to fight, and I said ok. So we fought (boxed) on the stage and I beat him. Then another wanted to fight and I beat him also. Then still another and I beat him. Others wanted to fight, but I was tired and had to quit.
