I was with my boyfriend. We were in his old blue car and it broke down in a suburban area. We both got out of the car and walked to the first house we came upon. It was a huge white house with about five floors. We rang the doorbell and an old man came to the door. He took us downstairs into the basement to show us spare parts for the car. All of a sudden, these arms (like an octopus) started coming through the windows. My boyfriend and I ran, as one arm grabbed the old man and sucked him through the window. We ran all of the way up a spiraling staircase to the top floor. From there, we could see outside and we saw some strange animal eating shrubs outside. We started to sneak down the stairs -- Then I woke up!!
