["Growing new fingertips."] A man sits to my left. We are in a class. Only we are the only two students. He asks a question of the woman teacher. He says he had a friend a woman, who told him that after you get your Ph.D. you need to focus on one thing and study it. He wants to know how to find her. He talks about Mr. Spock and science fiction books. The teacher is annoyed. She says, so then your question is about finding an old friend? I absentmindedly bite off the tip of a newly grown finger tip and spit it out like a fingernail on the floor. Then I am shocked that I had done that. I feel a bit sick as well. There are two tiny well formed healthy new fingers growing.
