I was somewhere downtown in Pittsburgh, although I did not recognize my surrounding, with my father. He wanted to buy a pair of shoes so we entered a shoe store that was on a side street. Not finding any he wanted, we left and turning the corner, we came onto a main street. Just ahead there seemed to be a large building such as a post office or a courthouse, although I didn't know which. Looking back, I saw a great many big stores where we had not been and I wondered why we had not gone there to look for a pair of shoes.
