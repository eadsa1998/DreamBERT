Ezra got this dog and it was called Tess. It was quite big. We kept it out the front of home and it just sat at the door. Farrah had a Myspace and it said she was 16 and I was thinking that it wasn't right. I complained to Mom about the dog because it was going to go feral because no-one spent any time with it. I went to school, but I had an excursion (just me). I went to some school place and I was in the art room. Other people were there too. There was a big slope in the room and a table was nailed down. We had eggs with a brown thing wrapped around it. Then we had to put curry and some sweet stuff in it. It was taking forever so I just ate it, instead of cooking it, but it was actually meat or something. I was hoping we were there for two and a half more hours so I would miss out on all of school (it was Tuesday by the way).
