I looked at a selection and I saw Fireball Zack picked as a winner. A canary and spider were fighting. The spider got the canary dizzy and groggy. I broke them apart. Ann and I came home from work the same time. Sabruck was our insurance man again. He was in overalls. Bill Grove and I were in the Richman Bros. Co. looking at different machines and at flaws in leather and clothing. My large toenail was broken. I pulled it partly off and I noticed my small toe was like half squeezed flat on the side. I shook the rest of the nail and it was coming loose, so I left it alone.
