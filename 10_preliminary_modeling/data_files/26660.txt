 I meet a woman who hunts deer. I ask her where she hunts, and she says near Merton. We talk about the location and narrow it down so that I know she's the woman who hunts across the road from the Ramos' property. I ask her about the Ramos' property, to describe where we hunt. She's not familiar with the trailer house on the property or with the Ramos family.
