I was actually in one of Astrid's crazy stories, and I was kind of trying to film it for a movie, and I was crossing and doing all these dangerous, treacherous things, but I knew I wasn't in any real trouble because it was all an act. And there was this big thing, like I was climbing these rocks, and trying to get over this thing, this wall. And then I was in a bathroom and I was climbing on this toilet and then climbing on the paper towel thing up onto the edge of the stall so that I could climb out the window. I never really made it out the window because I realized I couldn't get there. And the toilets really stunk in the bathroom. And then I can't remember what else. I think I was going into some other cave thing, like there was a little bonfire in there and it was a really cool little scene that was set up there. And that's all.
