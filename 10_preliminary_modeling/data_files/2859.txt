Jack Nicholson likes me and my foot hurts (my right one) and I have to get in the wheelchair to make it around. It's time to leave for the weekend and I ask this young woman to hand me this and that until my lap is full. I say, "Put these bags of chips in my back pack." She says there are already some there, no room. I say, "Oh well, I'll take them anyway." She stuffs them in and Jack and I start to go home. Now we are in a restaurant with teal blue walls like my bedroom. My mother with teal blue eyes (which is unsettling) and my father are there. We are going to have dinner with them.
