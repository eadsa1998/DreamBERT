I see that I am in the university yard and see a girlfriend on the floor. When I go over to her, I get the impression that she has cut the inside upper part of her leg, but blood is not coming out and I put my fingers in the hole, which is green in color. The sensation is chilling and rather unpleasant. I take her to another part of the university so that she'll be cured. There is a succession of images which are unclear and I don't remember.
