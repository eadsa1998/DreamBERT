In my dream I pestered my mother until she allowed me to have contact lenses made. The first day I got them, I wore them and I was very happy with them. However, when I went to remove them, the glass in the left eye refused to budge. I struggled until I became very excited and frighten. My whole family tried to help me get it out, but they couldn't. Finally a doctor was called in, and he removed it, but he told me that I would be blind in that eye.
