["Research with Del."] I am in a room with Del. I am wondering if something is not acceptable about Del and me. Maybe I don't like him as much as one would if there was a relationship. Something about the genes. Then there is some research being done. I am holding a stuffed white furry animal puppet and playing with it. Del is watching. I think I am measuring whether or not I want to have a relationship with him.
