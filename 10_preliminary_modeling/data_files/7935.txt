I was working for BCC. Our desks were right next to each other as they were in waking life when I worked there. The daughter of the boss was working right next to me. She was younger and turned the radio up really loud. I don't remember what kind of music it was or if that bothered me also or if it was just the volume. I asked her to turn it down and she refused. I reached over and turned it down myself and told her it was difficult to hear on the phone with the music so loud. She just reached out and turned it back up. I reached down and turned it down again. She turned it back up. The boss came up and told me to just let it go so I quit. I was just working there part-time. I remember I was packing up all of my personal things in plastic grocery bags and I was surprised at how much I had. I had two of them full of nothing but candles. all different colors and sizes. The boss had left. It wasn't that I was present but I knew that he was talking to someone about my leaving and concerned about it. He didn't want me to leave. He finally came back and was negotiating with me to stay. My negotiations included a $2 an hour increase in pay and 3 weeks paid vacation and I don't remember what else.
