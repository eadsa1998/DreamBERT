I am cooking some party nibbles for the women in my book. They are coming over. I'm trying to clean the house which is a big mess seconds before they're to be there. There are packages and packages of raw hamburger they have brought as food. I suddenly decide to make sweet and sour meatballs. I go to the kitchen to cook. Only one or two of the whole group come and I smell rotting hamburger.
