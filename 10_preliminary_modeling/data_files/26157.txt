 I'm having a dream group meeting. We seem to be on the east side of the garage at my home, but it also seems we may be near the intersection of 3rd Street and Oak Avenue. My friends Bill Hanson and Hank Anderson are there, with my housemate's friend Matt, my grade school classmate Misty Ryan, and one other woman. We talk. My grade school classmates Eric Stoner and Patrick Bergman come up to us: they're in the dream group too. They both have blond hair. Eric's hair is shaved and braided in a checkered pattern. They don't fit in with the group. Something happens and I ask of tell Eric and Patrick to leave. They leave, and the group finishes the meeting, which seems like the last meeting. I shake Bill's hand and hug him. We all walk and talk. I feel most connected to, appreciated by, and appreciate Bill. I feel I may be ignoring Misty, especially, but also the other members of the group.
