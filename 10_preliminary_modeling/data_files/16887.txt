I'm sitting in a carpeted room - like a student room with several people from the past including Jerry, who is trying to play the guitar, and Trisha and some of her friends, who are going to produce a radio station. They ask me if I'd play some of my band's new material. In the dream I have a 3 piece band, and we perform some tunes with harmonies. Jerry has his guitar strung completely wrong. I offer to restring it. Everyone laughs when I printout that he has crossed over the strings.
