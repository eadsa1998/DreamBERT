I had a history final, a 25-page paper to write, in three days.  I couldn't work because people were there and being noisy.  My old dorm roommates Sally and Chelsea were both there.  Tuvan music was on, and I started dancing around the room to it, and then singing along.  Sally looked up.  Then my boyfriend Jeremy and I went into the rumpus room.  There were 8 brick steps and Jeremy tried jumping over all of them.  I just jumped a few, not willing to risk landing on an edge and getting hurt.
