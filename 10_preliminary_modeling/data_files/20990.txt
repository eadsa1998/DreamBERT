A gang of boys from the Whites were together, talking of what we did when we first started to work at the Whites. I was kind of flying around. The big shots of the camp came by and we had to get out of the way or they would run us down. There were a lot of trees around. I put on an oil spout on a machine and it squirted all over and high up like a spray. I threw an object and it flew back and forth like a rocket.
