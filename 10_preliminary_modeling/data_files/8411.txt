I was living in an apartment building with a long hallway that had apartments along each side of the hallway. It almost looked like the hallway of a hotel. I had learned that one of my neighbors had a cleaning woman that was a, maybe even two of them, good and charged $83 per cleaning. Actually I think I talked to the neighbor first to see if she would tell me about her and tell me how much she charges. I was telling one of my other neighbors because I thought that was fairly reasonable. But then I think I said I knew someone else who charged less than that. Somehow though I was talking to a cleaning person, or thinking about talking to a cleaning person, to find out if there was a way that I could have her clean and it would be less money per cleaning or if I could afford to have her come just once a month.
