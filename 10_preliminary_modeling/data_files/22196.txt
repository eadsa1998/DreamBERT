I remember very little. I was with a group of friends in a very beautiful club, but not many people were there. I was showing off at the Olympic pool and they applauded me often. When I came out of the pool, they placed a huge wreath around my neck. I felt very happy. After this, I started doing other sports. I played basketball, soccer, tennis, etc. I felt I was great at everything. Besides, I was having tremendous success at everything. Everything came out right. This is the best way I can relate my dream because I cannot recall it with more precision.
