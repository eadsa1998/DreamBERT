I received in the mail an appointment as assistant psychologist. No it was only a dark gray application form and it asked for two or three references. Whom could I ask? But I should be more than assistant. Guess I'll send it back and tell them I want a higher rank. But here LK comes to work with me. As he spreads out papers in the dining room, I tell him we had better not work there. Miss W. wouldn't like it. She's a terror. Isn't she? I ask a maid who agrees. So we go to the living room but there is no suitable table. I'll get the board I use as a lapboard.
