I was at home and there was like a small party or something and Chris (Big Brother) was there. About 5 people were in the back room and one by one they gave Chris a hug because he was crying. I stepped down and put my hand on his back and he turned around and hugged me and I hugged him back (though my left hand got stuck between us). I said "it's ok, she's a cow" and he laughed and said "I know". The hug kept going but he didn't seem to want to get out of it and he said 'is there a reason this hug is so long' and I said 'no'. Eventually we pulled apart and I went to do something. Mom told me she was inviting some people over for dinner and I said I wasn't coming for it and she said 'but it's for you' and I said that I didn't care, I wasn't interested.
