I had kind of a silly dream last night with a lot of silly things that weren't really connected in any kind of way. But first I dreamt that I was at school and I was trying to go somewhere. And the elevator in the main building was like real small, only enough to fit like me and another person. And I was in it by myself, and I had to go up to the third floor. And I kind of had the notion that there were more floors than three, so I kept pushing 3 to get to go up higher, and then all of a sudden I realized that it was going up past the third floor and into the control room shaft and the little trap door thing on the roof kind of lifted up for a minute and then banged down. And then I was like really scared because I thought I was stuck up there, and then I realized all I had to do was press 1 and it would start coming down again, which was exactly what it did. And another thing -- kind of later when I was outside -- I was walking down the hall and these two, this guy and this girl were talking about something juicy about their relationship, I guess, and they were like kinda singing and kinda talking, and I kind of thought they might be fighting even. And I was trying to follow them and hear what they were saying, and I followed them into this classroom and I sat down kind of in the back of a row and it was real noisy and stuff. And I realized I was in Ms. Marcos's class, in her 5th period, and I didn't want to be caught dead in a math class for an extra period than I had to be, so I got up and I walked out, and then I went downstairs, and I think I was going to some kind of party, but I woke up before I could get there.
