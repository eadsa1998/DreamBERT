I am at some type of gathering, like a picnic. A male friend who is a judge is carrying a plant to my car which someone has started for some reason. The plant is supposed to help me. My husband is there. The car is a Cadillac. The judge may be looking for an Escort (which I used to drive). I have to cross a ditch to get to him but I go on looking. I meet a friend from high school whom I haven't seen in 40 years. She is with other friends. As we say hello she falls off a little rise and gets skinned up and hurt and cries like a little kid.
