I was in my apartment with 2 girls who were soon to move out and I was to keep it alone. A man was talking to them. Suddenly I realize he is talking about renovations needed and I'm in on that. I want the hideous red figured tattered paper off and fresh paint. I'll be gone from July 2 thru October, couldn't he do it then? He Couldn't promise, but I'd so like the painting done while I'm not there.
