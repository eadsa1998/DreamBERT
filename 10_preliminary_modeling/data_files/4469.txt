["Fixing up the office."] I am in my office, perhaps at a university. Sharon is working hard at fixing things up. More than I want, really. She wants to get permission from the authorities to move the public water fountain in the hall into my office for my private use. I am annoyed with her. I don't want to offend the authorities by taking more than my fair share. I say to her But there is no room in my office. Where would you put it? Then She is tiling my floor with what looks like Jello packages. This is taking lots of time. I want to get on with my work. I am annoyed and fidget. Waiting impatiently. Paulina is there also helping. Lenny and Amelia are there and getting into things. I just want to get on with my work and all these interruptions keep happening.
