I was staring at a football when for some reason it turned into a sheep. It was a full size sheep with a sheep's body, but its neck was made of the lace of a football. The lace, however, had been bent, as often is the lace of a football, and the sheep's head seemed to be too heavy' for the bent lace. In the dream I loved the sheep and would continually hold it and pet it. As long as I held the sheep and loved it, the lace neck held up the head. When I stopped holding it, the head would fall down again. I had the feeling of being quite worried about the poor bent neck and a fear of letting it go because the head would fall off. I wanted very much to do something about it, and felt very bad when I couldn't.
