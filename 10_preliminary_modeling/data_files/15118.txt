I was in France or something. Some people I knew were staying at a place across the street from some hotel where Hugh Laurie lived. There were flashes (?) they didn't like and I went over to tell him. I knocked on the door and explained the issue and he said he'd fix it. Sometime later, I went back and his door was unlocked. I went in. The kitchen was at the far end and the TV was next to the door. He had two video players and one DVD player. There were lots of movies, mostly on VHS, and quite a bit of 80s/90s horror. I remember seeing Children of the Corn and Basketcase. I looked at his CDs too. He had two doors to his bedroom and the blankets on his bed were messy. I quickly went back to the front door to leave. He came in from the hall and I said I had just come over to remind you and he said he hadn't forgotten. There were lots of other celebrities in there too. Something happened and caused them all to cheat. He called me there and I went up and when I got into the room, he pressed me up against the door, locked it, and kissed me. Then it showed others bringing people in. Then I was in bed alone and I took a photo of the room and then left. There were tables outside and we all sat around. There was a video that looked real of me on this buggy thing. Jared Padalecki was on the seat behind me and Jensen Ackles was next to me. I was filming and joking around. Mom said Ezra wanted to move out. Dad was collecting something about people for something (pictures maybe, I can't remember). He had Wash (Firefly) and he said "I liked Firefly and Serenity". He also had Dominic Monaghan (although Dominic was spelt differently) and he said "I like Lost and Lost" and there were others. I laughed and only one had the actual name of the actor spelt correctly.
