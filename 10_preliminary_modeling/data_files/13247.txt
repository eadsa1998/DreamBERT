I was watching a movie. Madonna and Bill Pullman were in it. Calvin was there. I was reading a review and Bill was giving a speech. It reminded me of something and I was deeply upset. Samantha and Payton were then around. I was playing Sims 2. I had some mod and you put your finger in pink goo, but it wasn't working.
