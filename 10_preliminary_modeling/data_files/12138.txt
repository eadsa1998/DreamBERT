I was somewhere that was like Saw 2 (it wasn't really, but in the dream I thought it was). We were in this house place and had to go to bottom floor using an elevator (Super Mario like). We couldn't get back up. Silas, Classmate-M-15, Jake, Vivienne and Ryan Cartwright were also there. There was a room with a video camera and blood baths. Ryan had been in there earlier and had to get out. We went back in there and worked out that we had to burn the lounge. As we walked out he held my hand. There were air conditioner ducts. Outside there was a plane crash, and then it happened again.
