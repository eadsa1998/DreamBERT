We are to catch a train to go back home after a visit with Edward. Edward and I walk about and he shows me his exquisite collection of GLASS and ART objects, some of which he made himself. We talk about Marita and I say "You did such a good job of raising her." We are very close. I feel I wronged him; and he tells me again how much he loves me. I don't want to say goodbye. The others are already on the train. Edward and I walk down the stairs to the train platform and I say: "I still have a long way to go (i.e., much healing to do)." I LOVE YOU." Then I run to catch the train. It is already MOVING but I manage to open a door, or a coach, far in the back and to walk up to where the rest of the family is sitting. I see them waving at me frantically and believe I see my FATHER's hand waving also. very emotional upon awakening...
