I was on a ship on the ocean. I don't know who I was with. The ship was an old sailing ship, kind of like the Mayflower. One man was dressed in the fashion of Captain Hook but he was not a bad person. Nor did he have any impairments. There were other people on the ship as well. I don't know if we were trying to get away from someone or trying to accomplish something. I don't recall any particularly bad feelings. We had docked and someone was handing me furniture and other things to put on the ship. Without their knowledge, I was just throwing the things off the other side. This was good, because it would somehow protect us.
