I dreamt that my boyfriend was kissing me, but suddenly he seemed to disappear and a fat guy dressed in the latest fashion, with a beard and sideburns, appeared and he was getting close to me in order to kiss me, and I was trying to get away from him because I did not like him. And people told me that fat men -- and this one especially -- were very good in marriage and in love. I had seen this figure, this man, and looked at him very closely at Mass on Sunday, and he was very fat. And what really called my attention was that his wife was very tiny and I pitied her for having such a fat and huge husband. That must have influenced my dream.
