I was in a room somewhere and I asked Ezra to pick the best looking guy out of a list of people. The list included Simon Pegg, Mark Heap, Nick Frost and Dylan Moran. I said I thought Dylan Moran was. There was a video playing with Mark Heap in it and Ezra said "I hate that guy!". The movie was old but James Spader was in it and I had downloaded it, but I didn't know that he was in it. I was at home and Dad was hanging out with Amanda Bynes.
