 I am at a place where I work. It is like Middle Mall, but not the same. My high school classmate Holly Ball is also there working. In back of this building are three cute girls, all of whom are younger than I. My truck is parked in back. In ten minutes, I am going to eat cantaloupe with the three girls. I am thinking sexually, like I am going to make out with one or all of the girls. I go inside. I am defecating. I hear my friends Stephen Ramos and Tiny Combs talking about deer testicles. There are three businessmen out back with me. Their bill comes to $1.10. One guy gives me $2.00 and I give him $1.00 back. I am giving him a bargain.
