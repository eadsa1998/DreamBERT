I had another dream before I woke up, which started off here in the town we live in. And I'd been uptown or something, and I was on my way home, walking. And I came to the house of my friend, Judy, who lives close to us. And I had bought some sort of plant. It was in a flower pot. It had a lampshade on it. And I decided that I didn't want it, that it had bloomed, and it had green leaves, but it wasn't at all an attractive plant. And so she was throwing some sort of plant out also in her back yard, and so I threw mine out there, and then decided there was no point in keeping the flower pot, so I threw that away. And then I was walking home (very dim), it got complicated and involved. These three children had been kidnapped by these men and put in this building, up on the 4th or 5th story. And they were kept in this room so well, that although everybody knew they were in this room, or rather the building, they couldn't find them. And the police and the other people were searching for them. And while they were searching for the children ... they occasionally had this vision or thought they saw this huge woman who sort of seemed to be the ... or the mother figure, who, they'd see her in corridors. It was all a very sort of eerie aspect to the whole thing. And finally, after the children had been found, the appearances stopped. And they decided that it must have been the house itself that somehow was projecting its own personality ... thoughts or emotions about the children to these people who were looking for them.
