 I'm in an area of newly constructed houses. They are lined up one after another, really close together or connected. I'm in a kitchen area and seem to be able to walk from house to house, seeing all of the kitchens. I see rough wood: none of the cabinets are finished off. A man is there, near or in one of the kitchen areas. He seems to live there, and may have items in the cupboard. The houses overlook a lake. They seem like townhouses, lined up.
