As I was leaving my building, Sandy (a girl I met in another country who developed an unhealthy obsession) came in. She didn't see me. I was walking across the other side of the lobby. I was wearing sunglasses. I saw her come in and go to the counter, as if she had found where I live and was trying to surprise me and was asking if I lived in this building to the doorman. Instead of meeting her, I went out the revolving door. It was sunny outside. I felt bad, so I waited for her to come out. I was leaning against the building. She came out and walked passed me. I said, "Sandy." she turned around and acted surprised. I didn't want to see her, but I felt bad she came all this way to see me. This reminds me of the same feeling I have not looking forward to going out with this girl who asked me out the other night.
