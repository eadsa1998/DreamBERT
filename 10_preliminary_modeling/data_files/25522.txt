 I'm in Hillston with a man and a woman. There is a historical geology world conference at a campground. I go into town with the two people. We are out of control, and slide into the conference site. The two people and I fly. I am only aware of me flying. We fly around a pink water tower-like structure. I'm really high up. It is before dawn. I hear that the fog will lift at sunrise: it is heavy now. We are getting ice cream. We control flying speed by the angle of the dip: how steep we are flying. While I'm flying I see the whole earth, and the edge of the earth with the blackness of space next to it. I see the pink and blue colors of the earth and the sun. There is a name for the earth as I see it from this great distance. It is called "Terminal ______" (I forget the second word). We land. It is demonstrated how to land and then store your bicycle in an apartment. A man with a white beard demonstrates how to store a bicycle.
