I have the dreams back in the senior prom at high school. They all went to the hotel conference room first. Later, I arrived by myself. They were all sitting down ready to eat. I walked in and said hi to everyone. Somehow I don't understand why everyone is not dressing up. I was all dressed up with a white prom dress. My hair was fixed. I was wearing a pair of white gloves. I was just ready to go to spend my special night. Not they are not dressed. My boyfriend was driving crazy. He didn't sit next to me, and didn't get a chair for me to sit down. Instead his friend did.
