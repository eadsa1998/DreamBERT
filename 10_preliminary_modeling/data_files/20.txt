I'm on a footbridge with some friends and there's a baby bear that I want a closer look at because he really doesn't look like a bear. I fall off the bridge but I hold onto a rope and a fence that's a short distance from the bridge for some reason. I can swing back to the bridge but need help to get back up and I yell for my friends and they don't stop right away.
