When we were out of town a few weeks ago, I had a dream that I was in a reception hall place that kind of looked like our school cafeteria. And I saw this woman sitting at a sound board, which is very unusual, because whenever I see people at sound boards, they're always guys. But anyway, there was a woman at a sound board, and the board wasn't black. It was kind of a light burnt sienna brown with the knobs and things were black. And she wanted me to come over and help her, and she showed me where the power switch was. But she wanted me to find a video input key, and I was looking all over the schematic for it and I didn't see it anywhere. And meanwhile, while I was looking over the schematic for the video input key, she was mopping up and cleaning up the reception hall. And she was sweeping the floor and things. And I said, "Could you come over and help me find it?" And she didn't seem to hear me. And then after a while I woke up.
