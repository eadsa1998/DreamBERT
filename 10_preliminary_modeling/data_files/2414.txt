I see Andrea and two men at an exercise area. I'm getting ready to leave with someone, a friend, female. I say, "Oh, I want to tell Andrea. I'll just take five minutes. Go on ahead." I watch as the three line up to run a race. I am amazed how fast Andrea is. She wins easily. I call to her and start telling her how I used to have a box full of papers from my teaching year in another state. "That was a very hard year," I said. "I call it my memory box." I share with Andrea how good I feel now. I think I let go of the memory boxes. Then I told her about how I played my guitar so well with Nate, I mean, Abner, who I was going to marry when I was 6 years old.
