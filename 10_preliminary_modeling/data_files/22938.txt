I had my daughter Christina with me in my car.  She was in her car seat in the back seat.  It was late at night, and we were on our way home, but on the way I stopped at someone's house (Uncle Jack's maybe).  They were having a party, and for a while I forgot about Christina, then rushed out to the car when I remembered.  She was slumped down asleep in her car seat, about to slide out of it. On the way home I had to stop and get a few things at a supermarket.  The kid who checked me out was very young, and he obviously didn't know what he was doing.  When he gave me my change, what was supposed to be several 1's were actually a mixture of 5's, 10's, 20's, and 1's.  I pointed it out to him, and he seemed to be confused and put the whole stack back in one compartment of the till.  The bag boy took my groceries out, and when he came back in he asked if he could borrow a nickel.  I had already planned to give him a nickel and five pennies, so I gave him two nickels and a penny instead.  Just before I got home I realized that I had been duty officer (I was still in uniform) and was supposed to remain on duty until relieved rather than simply leaving when my time was up.  I guess I went home and put my daughter Christina in bed, though I don't remember; then I went back to where I was supposed to be on duty-a little store like a 7-11 which was run by Julie Skinner and her family.  To my surprise, Christina was there.  She was all dirty and was playing behind the counter with another kid.
