I was in a downtown shopping district with two other girls. We were in a very big hurry to get someplace by 6 p.m. The one girl wanted to go to a clothing shop which was located on the 25th floor of a very old building. We went there and looked at some bathing suit. From here I remember waiting for an elevator. There was a man following us from this time on. We always knew he was near because of a very mysterious whistle. However, he never caught up with us. We were always in a hurry throughout the dream.
