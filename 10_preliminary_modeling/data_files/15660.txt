I woke up and went on Facebook to see a million posts about Kit Harington having died. He had been in a 'fatal car accident'. The headline on an article was 'Kit Harington dies a brother' -- his last word was apparently 'brother'. I was worried about the future of Game of Thrones and also felt weird and sad about it.
