I was at a sewing school sent a machine where I finished a long, black sleeveless dress. Took it off the machine, looked at it, wondering if I could keep it. I had to get somewhere at 11 and wasn't dressed for it. Looked for her to find out when I was to be ready. We should leave at 10:30. It was 8:45. I had time enough. I told H. I had been initiated into KS at the meeting last evening at Mrs. C.L. She was walking quiet well without her wheelchair.
