Me and Vicki Davis were sitting on the floor in the gym. There were tables set up and lots of strangers and a foreign man, an important fellow who was very neat at a table by himself. There were lockers and gym baskets between the stage and where we were getting ready. We had a Bugs Bunny record to play. We both had books to read and she was dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and I was dressed like Fidel Castro in shorts. We practiced and it was funny but when we went on stage we were 45 minutes late. People were already yawning bored. We failed miserable. I forgot my book to read irrelevant passages from and I had to go back to the locker and get it. Vicki forgot her book. I could not wait for it to be over. Neither could the audience. We were going to take photographs with Jay Mills. He was meeting us at the gallery. He usually rode his bicycle in from Connecticut. He had a favorite hat. It was a McDonalds hard hat. It was obviously a rare out-of-city hat and it had been stolen. William said Mills should wear a NYC McDonalds hat in the city because then nobody would want it. We were getting ready to go and Jay Mills said, "Merri, you need to get your camera and your lens and your film. They're all in different places inside the gallery." And it was like hunting for Easter eggs.
