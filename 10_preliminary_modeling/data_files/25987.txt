 I'm on a Big Resort Area trip with some guys. We get there and are going to unload our gear. My junior high classmate Rich Karn has brought a gas engine and an electric trolling motor with a battery. The first thing I say to him is that he's hauling these on every portage! We have two boats for our trip. Both are Fishing Haven boats. One of them is wide boat. In the back of the wide boat there is a video screen of some sort. I'm at a cash machine. The guys in the boat fiddle with and rewind the video. I forget to withdraw my cash card. When they rewind the tape it scrapes the card. I go get the card. I've withdrawn a lot more than I need or want to have on me: $70. My grade school friend's father Myron Kasper's red van is related to the video: I see the red van driving forward and I think it should be backwards, because the tape is being rewound. My high school classmate Arnie Heller is there. He works for an outfitter. He has a Fishing Haven radio with and is going to do a 2:00 tow. I ask him if he'll give us a tow: just the one boat since the other has a motor. He says he was out last night, and implies he has a hangover, but says he can tow us after his 2:00 tow. My friend Nate Nelling asks Arnie if he can get a tow also. Arnie replies yes. Nate doesn't realize that the tow is for all of us.
