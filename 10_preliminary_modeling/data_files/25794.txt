 My boss at Fishing Haven Mike Hollow says something to me about doing something with or on the 24th or 25th floor. We are near water, on a dock. Mike is wearing a life jacket. There is a spot on the right shoulder of his jacket that is missing. It is as if someone took a bite out of the life jacket. This is my cue that I am dreaming: I realize I am dreaming. I push Mike off the dock and under the water.
