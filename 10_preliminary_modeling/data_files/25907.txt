 There is a party at my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas' house. I go with my dad. I see my aunts Sherry and Willow Redding there, and hug them. I ask them how they know the Thomas'. Sherry says she has a class with Annie. There are many shorthaired women there. My dad and I talk to Bill Thomas. I try to avoid Annie. My dad takes out his checkbook to make a deal with Bill regarding Annie and I. Annie comes towards me happily. I turn and direct myself towards her when I realize she's approaching. She is wearing blue and is happy. She happily says that she and I are going to take a 10-minute walk. I guess my dad bought or bargained with Bill for me to have 30 minutes with Annie. There is a boat in front of their house. A motor is in the boat. The boat is old and run of water: run down. Annie drives slowly out of the driveway in a small green car, ready to go on a walk. My dad follows in a car. I'm walking. I motion with my hand for them to go by me and keep going because something is not right: the timing or a distraction. A big Lite Ice beer semi truck comes towards us, the doors on our side of the truck are swinging open as it goes past. I Think Annie will come back and get me for our walk.
