Gavin, Terrence, Tiana and some other kids were at the beach with me which was next to my house and a big shop. I went to the shop and took a big whiff of this ugly green and white nighty (which I could smell, and it smelt like this disgusting green sauce that was on some octopus that I had). It was disgusting. We were all hanging around near a stage. There was a competition going on, on the stage and Gavin kept staring at me. This thing was trying to kill us. Ezra came and followed me out of the house, so the thing saw us and we went next door to call someone.
