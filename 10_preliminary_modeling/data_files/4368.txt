["Setting limits arbitrarily."] I am at some indoor place where Paulina/Charla was at school. She is happy with her male teacher. She wants to stay and continue doing things and talking with him because he is so supportive. I want to go home and I decide arbitrarily that I need to set boundaries and deadlines with her. I insist she finish what she is doing and pack up so we can go home. She argues and wants to stay. I insist, aware that there is real reason to go home now. Just that I decided to do this. She finally gets ready and we begin to leave. The performances are just now beginning and we will miss them. I insist anyway. We go to the edge of this indoor water channel. Across it is a performance beginning. We pause to watch it. It is a special effects extravaganza with fireworks and odd creatures dancing out a run way toward the water. A black and white zebra striped animal. Rolls around in dance sequences. Too bad we are going to miss the shows but I have already decided to go home, and by God, that's what we will do. We slip into the glacier blue, warm and very calm water. We silently swim through this smooth water. All is silent. We swim to the next door which is our home.
