The last dream I can remember happened last night. I woke up in the morning fully ready to go to school. I had all my makeup on and I was fully dressed. My mom drove me down to the place where I get my bus. There were a couple of 7th graders standing at my stop, where they usually are. I could swear to myself that I needed to put on makeup, but everyone told me that I looked fine. I wanted to put makeup on, but there was always something stopping me. I got on the bus and went to school. Then I woke up. I remembered my dream as soon as I woke up. I was afraid because I thought I went to school with no makeup on.
