I dreamed I was on the shore of a small lake with a hill rising about ten feet in back of me. A girl was with me and one I did know. A "C.B." type of plane was stunting over the water and headed straight towards the girl and I. I was afraid and ran to the hill and back against it, but my friend was not afraid and she stayed by the shore; the plane zoomed up just in time to miss the hill. Then the plane landed and two men, rather good looking but none I'd seen before, stepped from the plane into a small boat and rowed towards us. Next scene we were in a hotel and they were there--here I woke up.
