I've moved into a house - it's a nice little one-story frame house, not so terribly old, like VKian, as to have a style - more like a plain farm house-y look. Cabinets built-in, with screen doors, layers of paint, sturdy, darkish inside right now, late afternoon. I like it a lot. I may or may not have been planning to live with a roommate, but I certainly didn't know a bunch of LT people were going to live here too. They start arriving, and I'm quite concerned about this - I'm feeling deprived and disappointed, but looking at it objectively, maybe it will be fun and productive. However, something dawns on me all of a sudden, and far too late: I'm a long way away from work - this place is some such distance anyway, and I've got to drive to work! No bus! and it's so far! It'll take all morning to get to work. Damn. My mind pictures the road - it's as if this house is out in the country, and the road to town will be 2-lane, no development, most of the way, and I'm thinking maybe it won't be as bad as all that, with no lights and so on. But I'm feeling panicky all the same, not about the drive but about having moved in here without knowing these things and it's too late to back out.
