[1997-05-15] I am in a college dorm room, I think it was my old room at [City] College and B was rooming with me and we had pizza in our room and I said "there's no anchovies on this pizza" and we wanted anchovies on it. And I was in bed and she had an anchovy all wrapped up in paper and she handed it to me and I unwrapped it and I was surprised that she had brought one and I said "well how did you know that we were going to have pizza in the first place?". I don't know what she said and we were laughing about it and I asked her if she wanted the anchovy and she said "no" I could have it. So I ate it. At some point I opened my suitcase and got my transistor radio out and turned it on, I was trying to find a religious show but I found Dr. Dean Edell and I was listening to him. There was a whistle in the radio, it wasn't coming in so good, and I remember that my suitcase was really light. In reality my suitcases are very heavy usually. It was the larger kind, not the little tiny ones that you usually get on pizza, so I tasted the anchovy then there was a man there, who I think was a psychologist, but he seemed very old, like around 85 and his wife was there, and somehow his suitcase or briefcase was locked and he couldn't get it open and he had important things in there that he had to get, that he had papers that showed him how to open it, a combination perhaps, but he couldn't remember where he had put them and so he couldn't get it open and I was trying to help and I said "try not to think about it and maybe you'll remember, if you try not to think about it, sometimes you'll remember things about where you put things". That was the end except that his wife was really upset that he couldn't get the suitcase or briefcase opened. I didn't know what it was because I didn't touch it. That was in the same dorm, he was in a different room of the same dorm.
