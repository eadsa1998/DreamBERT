I dreamed I was with my mother and stepfather and my oldest brother. One of my father's friends, Rossman, in an apartment. It looked like the one we had in the Lakeshore Hotel about 8 years ago. I had just recovered from an operation. It was as if my arm had been amputated and elevated, put back on higher on the shoulders. I had a functional arm and the stub of the old arm, but it didn't bother me particularly because I had use of the good arm. Ross was asking me why I wanted to be a doctor. I said, "It's nice. That's the way it goes. You have to be something in this life. As long as you have to be something, you might as well be something that does good and has prestige and high status." He said he didn't particularly need that. In fact, he said he didn't need to be anything. I said it's alright, but it's hard to eat like that. I was late. It kept getting hot and cold in the apartment, and I remember turning the heat down and then it got cold and we'd turn the heat back up and it was too hot. Turn the heat off. Then I walked down to where the bedrooms were, and my mother was lying in bed crying. I asked her what was wrong. She was crying because she had hardening of the arteries. I told her not to worry. Tomorrow we can go over to the VA and have her checked. There was a girl involved. She was kind of fuzzy. She just kept appearing and disappearing. Hall: The name of the man who comes into the dream is Ross Madden. He died last year of a heart attack while he was in the hospital for having his legs straightened.
