There was a meeting and I sat with Eva facing rows of girls. Very boring. At one point all shifted seats so that the different races were separate. R. was there. Then we were in another room and returned to arrange the first for another meeting. The seats were in small groups. R. said to put them in rows. I started to do so but it was muddy and sloppy. I said we'd skip this row where two clumps of bushes and a big puddle would be in the way and spread the rows so that people could walk in and not get muddy. So I set one chair in a soft place before a good walk and tried it but one leg kept sinking deeper.
