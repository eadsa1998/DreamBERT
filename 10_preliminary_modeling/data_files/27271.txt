I dreamed that I was in my methods class - about 6 boys &amp; 15 girls. Suddenly - a lot more men entered the class - followed by a number of freshman girls. Since it is a "300" course, I could not understand the young girls; I was very resentful. I had the feeling inside me - I hope there has been an error and we can revert to the original.
