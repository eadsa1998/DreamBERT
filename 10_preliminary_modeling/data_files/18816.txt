This dream takes place in a small town. As near as I can remember, almost he whole town was working toward one cause while the authorities were against them. It seems as if there had been a crime committed and the townspeople were protecting the crooks. Investigators were everywhere and it was my job to guide them around. Several times the underground would act to prevent the authorities from doing anything--like when they were after someone, an empty street was suddenly at the snap of a souie key man's finger, transformed into a maze of blockades, signs and parked cars. Usually there was one car that the investigator was pushed into. He was then driven off to be enlightened by someone, but there was no violence--in fact, it was funny. The scene now shifts. I am in a high priced European car (a black Mercedes, I think) with a sun roof. The car seems to be mine, and so does the house I stop at. A girl is there and apparently I am very fond of her. I cannot remember anything we did, however. Just vaguely I remember getting her a drink--champagne, I think. The scene now shifts again. The girl and I are listening to a radio. We seem older, perhaps married. The announcer is informing us that the country's #1 criminal has died beneath the wheels of a train. I remember that the year was 1939. Now the scene shifts again, this time to a 1939 car. I am thinking how remarkable it would be if the people of that year could see a 1964 car. The whole dream took place at night and the setting was, except for the last scene, was in Europe. I was often among very rich people and was, I guess, rich myself. The people in the dream were almost all older than I--average age was 30.
