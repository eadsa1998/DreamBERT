I'm nervous about meeting a guy at a club on Thursday night to whom I've only spoken on the phone. I dream that I am at a hair salon getting my hair styled into a French roll. Then I'm at another salon getting my hair crimped. I also go to a nail salon to get my nails manicured. Next I'm in my room and my two girlfriends are giving me advice on what to wear. Then I'm shopping at a fancy department store. A sales girl is giving me advice on what to wear. Then I'm back in my room and my sister (who lives in D.C.) is telling me what I should wear. It seems as though I've tried on dozens of outfits before I finally wake up.
