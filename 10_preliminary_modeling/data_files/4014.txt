["Like the Kennedy family."]  I am a young woman who visits a very large family. There are perhaps 11 or more adult children and the male head of the family. It reminds me of the Kennedy family. We are called into a large room with three or four couches. They all sit on the couches and I am amazed at how much furniture is required for so large a family. The older man lectures to his children. At one point he walks up to the son and leans into his face and says sex. He means they shouldn't be thinking about sex and relationships, but getting on with their careers. He then comes over to me to get acquainted. I need a crochet hook to make something. He walks me over to his daughter who is severely disabled in a wheelchair. He leans over to her and says No Tim. He means she shouldn't be thinking of her boyfriend Tim. They help me find some crochet hooks. But they are all too big. I see the size J. I need smaller. We search around for awhile. The son comes over to talk. He is attracted to me, as I think the father is. I am shy.
