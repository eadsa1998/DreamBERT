I was working in a jewelry store. A man whom I knew in his early thirties came in to buy his small daughter, 5, a present. They looked at several of the rings, including rubies and emeralds, but the little girl was particularly pleased with small carved animals in pastel colors. When he left the store I realized that he was leaving town and I hadn't said goodbye. I ran after him in pink socks and no shoes, although it was raining. I got to the station only to discover that the train had pulled out. However, another train had just come in. My father got off it and I was very pleased to see him.
