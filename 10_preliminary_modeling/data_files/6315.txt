Another dream which I had was one in which there were kids in the woods somewhere. I was with my brother and they were behind some bushes. They were being loud so I threw a rock at them. They began to chase after us. I was saying to them as I ran, "I'm sorry." I remember feeling like a coward with my brother watching me do this. I ran into my house, but it was not my house. It was someone else's house and I thought it was my house. I locked all the doors and windows so no one could get in and then the kids started throwing bricks in at the windows. I became scared so I called the police. They never came. Then my brother and I went outside through a window or something that they could not see me leave. We watched them throw bricks at the house. Then one of them wandered over to us, and I began to talk to him. He was siding with me and forgiving me for throwing a brick at them. Then he called them, the rest of the kids, over to us and they were not so forgiving. They tried to hit me over the head with a brick so I tried to cover my head. I have no idea where my brother was as I tried to escape. Then I woke up feeling my heart racing. I was sweating and afraid but at the same time feeling like a coward.
