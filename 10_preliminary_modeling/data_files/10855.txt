I was at the home of a friend that lives in the country. I was walking toward the barn. At the door of the barn sat a woman about thirty years of age. I do not know this woman--her face wasn't clear. I did, however, seem to know her in the dream. She was holding a baby. I called the baby by my four-year-old cousin's name (my cousin is a little boy). The baby, however, was much younger than my cousin--perhaps not even 1 year old. I hugged the baby several times. A good friend of mine was with me in the dream.
