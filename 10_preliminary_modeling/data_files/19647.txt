A large field on one side of which is a farm house. The part of the field nearest the house has numerous tufts of clover (red) the tufts separated from each other by 3 or 4 feet. There is also a culvert on this side and in the culvert ditch is a half grown rabbit. There are other rabbits in the filed. I pick up the young rabbit, intending to transfer it to opposite side of field where there is a deep ditch, and much rougher land -- where rabbit will be safer. Soon after I am feeding a small flock of ravens. They are glistening black and somewhat larger than a crow. Some of them are quarrelsome, pecking rather savagely at other; and one grabs another and hangs on.
