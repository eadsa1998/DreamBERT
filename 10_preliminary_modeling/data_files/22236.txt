I was studying on a corner and suddenly I dreamed about elephants again (like the last time), even though these were smaller. Then I saw Mary's mother (the girl I am I love with, but to whom I haven't spoken yet). She walked towards me, looked at me and she quickly went away laughing. Then her daughter Mary came out, looked at me and smiled and I smiled back. Then she took my hand and told me that she loved me. As it was late, she said goodbye to me and asked me for a date (then I laughed and laughed because I remembered that once my friend Louie had asked me whether I was waiting for her to tell me she loved me and then ask me for a date). Although I didn't want that, I cried later.
