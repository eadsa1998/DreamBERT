Waiting with two other women to use toilet. Those inside are very slow in coming out. I remark I should be meeting my brother and wonder if I could risk leaving to look for him to explain delay. One of the women speaks of her engagement for 4:30 p.m. Finally I get up and try the door. Place is empty after all and I slip in to use it thinking perhaps I should let them who have waited longer go first but still it was me who found it empty.
