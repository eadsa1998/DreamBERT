I was in my room. Somehow I realized it was a dream and everything was vivid. I then wished my nails black for some reason, but they weren't complete so I did it myself. I then went out the back and instead of unlocking the door, I just made it unlocked. Ezra went behind the shed and so I pulled it back to get through. He found this lump of cookies and cream ice-cream and I grabbed a bit out and was eating it. Then Ezra turned the lump over and there was a cut out cube full of big maggots. I spat out my ice-cream. After, I 'woke' up and was talking to Dad and I had been talking in my sleep. The back door was also unlocked.
