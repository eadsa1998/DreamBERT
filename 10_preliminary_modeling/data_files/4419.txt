["Dream love."] I traveled to an island where a special dream conference is. Charla is with me. This has two components to it. One is for regular dreamers. The other is for teachers of dreams. I am happy I get to be with the teachers. We travel by bus from one workshop to the next. I look out the window and see large canyons where waterfalls and beautiful powerful streams are. I admire the beauty. At one workshop, Charla and I dance contact improv. It is a sweet beautiful dance. Everyone loves it. An eastern Indian man comes over to me. He whispers a phrase in his language in my ear. I don't know what it means. I know it is sweet and positive. I go to the back of the crowd and find a good looking dark haired eastern Indian man I am attracted to. I ask him what those words mean. The man is in love with me. He smiles tenderly. He says I can't tell you here, because we will be interrupted. Let's have dinner together. I am happy. I return to my bus seat up front. I remember that I had promised Fatima I would have dinner with her. She is seated behind me. I turn and say, I need to cancel our dinner plans. How about lunch tomorrow? She is disappointed, but understands. Now Charla has fallen asleep. The bus stops. We get off, I carry Charla in my arms. We go to the man's hotel room. He helps me put Charla on his bed to nap. He watches me lovingly as I kiss Charla. I love her very much. We step into the living room. He embraces me, lying me on the couch and soothingly and lovingly telling me that the words the other man spoke were the sweet declarations of his intense love for me. I realize the man loves me deeply. I love him as deeply. We cuddle happy with our love.
