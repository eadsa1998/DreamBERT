I dreamed that there were all these houses in the main building, and that it was huge, kind of like Versailles, times 100! I had on a pair of wings and was flying around the library. And there were all these incredible Alexander Calder mobiles around. The place was huge, no matter where you turned there were more rooms or stairs. There were several libraries, small rooms, kitchens, ballrooms, pools, everything. Lou kept trying to take my wings. Then I had to buy shoes or something. Then I woke up.
