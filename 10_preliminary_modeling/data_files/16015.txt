A bunch of us were staying at this hotel thing which was also like a themed fair. It was cottage like and old timey/fairytale like. The rooms were very big and there was like one person per room even though my room had like four double beds. Lots of people were there hiding from something. Some of us were hanging out in a room. Mom and Frederick were there and on the opposite side of the room. She came up to me later and was subtly asking if I wanted to talk about it and I said 'I don't know what you're talking about' and she was like 'he told me'. Out of embarrassment and annoyance, my eyes welled up a bit and she was crying a bit out of sympathy. I 'yelled' saying 'I don't want to talk about it. I don't want you to know about it'. She said 'you should tell me these things' and I said no. She said 'he said he doesn't feel the same way you do' and I said 'how do I feel?' And she said 'well you like him a little bit' and I said 'no I don't'. I left and went to my room and messaged Frederick on my computer asking why he told her but every time I went to type the words would change. I realized I had a virus and it was this program which would predict your text incorrectly (and change words written correctly). I went on my phone and messaged him properly. He said 'all I did was play some of Bohemian Rhapsody and [a song that was called something like I Want It or I Want You To Know]' and I assumed she had deduced from that and the awkwardness. Later the things we were hiding from found us. They were like magic, there were possessed skeletons and zombies and disappearing ghost things. Everyone started running out of their rooms and fighting them and running away and I was trying to escape.
