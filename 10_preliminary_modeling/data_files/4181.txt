["The dreams fly me."] I am aware that I am in that between waking and dream state. I feel charged energy. I don't want to wake myself up and yet I want to examine what is going on. I am standing on a high second story platform in a huge room. I am wearing my blue velvet dress, A man has something in a box. I open the box and green shapes fly at me and absorb into my body, mostly in my right shoulder, from the back. I am afraid because I realize these things, are entities of some kind and they are taking over my body. I also realize they are dreams the man had captured in his box. He demands his dreams back, but they beg me not to let him imprison them again. They force me to fly out over the empty expanse of this huge room. I am afraid they will release me and I will fall and be hurt, but they are deeply in me and they fly me down toward the group of men standing on the floor. They fly me right above the man as I tell the man for them that they will never return to him. He is angry and would hurt me if he could reach me. The dreams fly me back up out of his reach. Now one of the dreams is the green shape of an angel like woman who is right behind me holding me as if to ensure we can not be separated. She is whispering to me information. I listen, feeling empathy for them. They had been cooped up too long and are resentful and angry. Intense feelings. I want to change something. I wonder what I want to happen. I then scream loudly, as if I were in fear. I wait for the images to transform to frightening things, but they don't. I am kind of glad. I don't know what to do or what I want to do with this lucidity.
