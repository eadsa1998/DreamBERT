Four girl friends in the dormitory and I were out on the porch roof of G____ Dormitory at night loading pamphlets into a dirigible that was hovering over the porch. They were pamphlets protesting the Communist party on campus. Mrs. C___, our house mother, looked out the window and saw us and made us come in. She reported us to the Dean and we were afraid we'd be expelled. Everybody in the school felt sorry for us and declared us martyrs to the cause. The dream ended and I don't know if we were expelled or not.
