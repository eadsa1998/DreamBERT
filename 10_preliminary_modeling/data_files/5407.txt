Last night I dreamed that I was back at school, but it was a combination of my high school and my college . I was having my English seminar with Clark, but James and Ed were there. Then I was naked, but I had to go to philosophy where we were reading Wittgenstein. I was horrified that I was naked, but no one seemed to notice. Then it got dark and I couldn't find my way back to the dorm. Then I woke up.
