I was in a supermarket or 7-11.  Norma Grimson was also there, and a few other people from the agency.  I don't know why I was there, but I felt that Norma was buying a going-away present for me, so I tried not to notice.  I bought a cheap robe, because I planned to take a shower there and wanted to have something to put on when I got out.  I just hoped that the robe was not what they were planning to give me.
