I was a witness at the birth of a child. It didn't seem like a hospital, it just seemed like we were in some big room, had to be a delivery room by all practical purposes but it really wasn't I guess. I was allowed to touch the baby as it was coming into the world. I don't know who the lady was and I can't remember anymore. The baby cried and they had me give it a little bit of a spank and it cried and I woke up. This dream was triggered by listening to Rush Limbaugh who was discussing this abortion thing
