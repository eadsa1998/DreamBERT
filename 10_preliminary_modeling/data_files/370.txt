I'm at a TV studio with a small package that I'm supposed to give to Billy Connolly and the actress who plays his wife on the TV show "Billy". It's white and not wrapped up as usual, but in 2 pieces, and none too neatly. It contains some odd, "found"-looking, old things. I don't know where to find them, and as soon as I step into the building I start seeing people I know - mostly from LT, but not all. I stop and chat from time to time. As I'm talking to someone else, I get squeezed around the neck by someone just coming by, and I lean back and see it's Annarae. I hug back and say hi. (She's wearing a peach sweater, and I seem to think she's got some trouble - we don't talk about it, but I feel sympathetic. I let these people go on and I start back for some offices I passed back a while ago. I have to stop for a minute and squat down to fix my shoe or something, and a weight bears down on my back, driving me to the floor. It's a man - I don't know him but I know who he is, and this is his idea of some sort of joke greeting. A couple of other people come up - they tell me who he is - and say to him how stupid he is, get off her. He doesn't, and I gather my energy and roll over with him, heaving him sideways and flinging him to the floor. I tell him if he doesn't get off I'll roll up like a hedgehog and fling him all over the hallway. Finally he does and I thank the others and go on. By this time I'm thoroughly frazzled. I find a reception desk and a girl there tells me where I can find the actors' manager (or agent or maybe the director, I forget). I go that way and find his office, which is very small and has some wall shelves with books and knickknacks on. I look at a couple while I explain my business and he looks at the package. He says he'll see it gets there for me, I thank him and go.
