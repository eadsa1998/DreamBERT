I dreamt I saw an Indian dance similar to the one depicted in Annie Get Your Gun. The dream was just a few seconds long. The dance was done in beautiful rhythm, the costumes were of all bright colors. The Indians in my dream were not dancing a war dance, but rather one of being happy and joyous. I was watching the dancing and clapping out the rhythm. Men were the only ones dancing, although occasionally women would join in if they liked. Men, women, and children were gathered around in a circle looking on.
