["Aliens from the Inside."]  I watch a man as he is doing research. He is suspicious of a woman. Some aliens are around and he wants to question her about them to find out where they are. She is not cooperative. She is vague and slippery. He goes to her house and goes in. A maid takes him to the living room. He sees a box of journals and asks the maid if that is the woman's diaries. She says yes and then leaves. He sneaks over to read them, and as he does he realizes that the woman is really the alien. I see images of the woman's face and I watch as it transforms in a series of images to an ugly brown pop eyed alien face. The woman comes in and seems relieved he knows. It seems a friendly relationship.
