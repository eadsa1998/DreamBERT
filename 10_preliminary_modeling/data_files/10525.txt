JUNE and CAROLYN (from the Book Cafe) are visiting us and we have set up 2 easy chairs on our lawn with a big TV set like the one here. They are watching TV. As I go to get something in the kitchen, I go by a small table and cause a glass to fall down and break. For the rest of the dream I am vacuuming up BROKEN GLASS. I am very thorough and careful.
