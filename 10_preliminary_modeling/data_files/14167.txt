I was at Mom's and Ezra was over. On Yahoo, there was a video of Farrah with fire sticks. I called Dad to tell him and he answered with "five". He had already commented on the video. Ezra was then at home. I was complaining about the equilibrium of the water bottles. I was telling Mom that some guy from something she watched was in True Blood (I was talking about Rene) and that he was the killer. I was explaining that Sookie could read minds and she was like "Sookie?" and this had something to do with a killer that had struck nearby. This girl had a 'Tanaca' (I think) dress on. It was then the next morning and I hadn't slept that night. I had stuff on my bed. There was some party thing and Eugene had facial hair, which looked hot so I was trying to take a photo. Mom was going to see a guy called Ted. I said "Ezra's not here I have no-one to play with" and went for the drive. Gavin was somewhere.
