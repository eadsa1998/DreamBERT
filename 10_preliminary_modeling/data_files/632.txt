My mother and I are patients in an asthma hospital. My cousin, Joan, and my aunt, Sarah, are there. We meet a lesbian couple I met there before and I introduce them to Joan. The woman says she loves all white sisterhood. It seems she is Native American. My mother goes somewhere. I find a room, like a kitchen, and am going to take food and then remember I'm not at home. Jeanne, my sister-in-law who has cerebral palsy, is also there and I am trying to ask two women who are volunteers to help Jeanne with crafts but they don't seem to hear me. Sarah has two bandaged ankles. My mother says my dad needs to get a bus soon to go home. I start back to our room but get lost.
