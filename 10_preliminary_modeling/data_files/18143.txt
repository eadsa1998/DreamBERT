I was the guest in someone else's house and didn't have anything to do for a while, so I was looking thru their supply of books and ran across a couple by this young girl. At any rate, the story was that this girl was about 15 and that this boy was about 19 and they had fallen in love. She had borne a child to him and they weren't married. He was in love with her and wanted to live with her and support the two, but she wouldn't hear of it and left him for a while. But later she came back again and had another child by him and left him again. But finally she came back to him and consented to marry him. Sometime after they were married, she had another child and this time she left him for good. I believe she had written the story about her experiences and she had written it also. It seemed to have some sort of strange reverse moral and that he was the one that wanted to marry her and that she was the one that left him.
