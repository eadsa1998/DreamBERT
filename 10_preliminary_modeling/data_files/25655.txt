 I'm in my friends Brittany Johnson and Jana Green's room at Brimson. There is music playing and candles burning. Brittany and Jana aren't there: they're doing laundry. I see them in the laundry room, which is just west of their room. Their friend Darlene Miller is with them. Darlene takes off her pants to put them in the laundry. She is skinny and has black underwear on. There is a woman on the phone near the door to the room. People are eating dinner in a place like Mason Cafeteria. Someone has several long Kentucky Fried Chicken boxes to carry food (chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy, etc.) away in for dinner. I am starting to eat. A man makes a comment "on that damned Hansen or Hansone". I am sitting near him and hear him say this. I get up and go over to him. He is alone under a table. Some people see me get up and they know why. They say, "Ooohhhh", like the man is in trouble. I pick up the table off the man. He is tubing or pipe with a block or bucket head. I easily pick his tube body up with my hand. His body is only about _ inch thick. I bring him outside. I bend his body in half and them him on the ground, which is the sidewalk near my back door at home. A few drops of green liquid have spilled on the kitchen floor at home. I wipe them up with a napkin and go to the garage to throw the napkin out. Someone says something to me using the "forbidden" name. I say to them, "What did you say?", though I heard what they had said. The person immediately rephrases their words to give me respect. I say, "That's what I thought." I walk by people and say excuse me if I am close to them. They are intimidated by me and don't want to upset me. I don't see much chicken with the meal. I thought there would be a lot of chicken.
