I was out in Rivertown taking a walk by Homer Daughtery's far. He stopped two men and gave them jobs doing some kind of work on the farm. I walked into the woods of my boyhood days. They came by a streetcar. I got on and was the only passenger. I conversed with the motorman. I relaxed on the seat and said, "I could ride like this all day." I asked him how many miles of railroad track they had and he said 135 miles. I said, "How far do you travel?" and he said 32 miles. I got off at a small town on top of a hill and he went down. I called me down, but I didn't want to go down. There was a hose near me and the water was squirting out of it on my feet. I turned it down the hill and it squirted on him down below. I walked over to a small park. People were sitting around a sort of small lake, which seemed to have a swift current of water. It would bring in objects at a swift pace. I looked out and an old model Ford coupe came in on the current. It took the Ford around the lake twice at a fast pace, then it came to a whirlpool. This whirlpool spun the Ford so fast I moved to protect myself from being hit from any object that would break loose from the Ford as it spun at a high rate of speed. Finally it stopped dead, the door opened, and out came two small boys on a platform. As they got off, the Ford sunk into the whirlpool. It was an excitable scene. The boys said they were going to store and the current caught their car.
