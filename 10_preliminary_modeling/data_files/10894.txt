I dreamt my roommate and I were saying in our room at school, but the room was a part of a large hotel and summer resort. It was warm weather and we were having a wonderful time, swimming and playing tennis. When we returned to our room, the hotel manager came up and tore a ridiculous sign off our door. He was very angry and told us if this didn't stop, we would have to leave the hotel.
