[1997-05-23] I'm wearing a very pretty silk dress and I have my period, but I have protection so I am not worried about doing anything to the dress. But I always get concerned about when I have dreamt like this, because in my dream I know that I don't get it anymore because I had a hysterectomy in real life. So I always have a conflict feeling in my dream when I have it in my dream. Later I am reading a book of Braille pages, 19 to 34. It was about this girl who happened to be one of my old clients and that she was riding horses and she was doing all these sporty things, like playing football and she was totally blind and I couldn't figure out how she could do all that. Then I thought, well the article is wrong or something's strange about this magazine. In the same dream I am at this house with a great big living room, but somehow its my house and its after 4PM and you walk out of this carpetted area to a screened in porch and its really nice. The carpeting is new but there are these big square pieces of lint which are somehow there because it is new and I had to get rid of them because I was scared that my dog would try to eat them but I didn't think the vacuum cleaner was picking them up, because I had bent down and felt a couple and touched them.
