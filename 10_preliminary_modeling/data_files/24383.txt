I was fighting against other people; guys and girls. And I had other people (guys and girls) with me. I was running through the forest hoping that they wouldn't catch us. There were swords and stuff up in the trees. We grabbed them (the swords) when we saw the people. We fought with the swords. Then we ran away. I felt like I wanted to fight, but I also felt fear.
