I was in a house with some others. There was a dinosaur outside and I had to get onto the roof to get away. I was jumping from roof to roof. I jumped to one, and missed and was hanging on to the ledge. I then swung into a kitchen. We then lived in that house which was in the country. We got this kitten but it still in an egg (which was how they came). I had to look after it. It was nearly ready to hatch, and I put it under the tap to soften the egg, but not too much, although I thought I might've left it under there for too long. It looked chicken-y. I put it in a cup and then took it out. Its eyes opened and started to hatch. It was then a normal sized kitten and it was orange. Mom said if we were going to be getting a new cat, this would be it. Darren then came back. They called it Ray, but hadn't decided on what to name it. I was playing with it and it fell asleep. It liked me and Mom noticed and said to Darren, that they would get him one later (it was originally supposed to be for him). Then he was another guy and he was trying to bond with it, Ezra tried too, but it still liked me. I was on the computer and Mom came in and said that Aaron (who was some teenage guy) said that I could stay over to try out some computer. I downloaded some program which did some blood sampling thing, toxicity levels and other stuff.
