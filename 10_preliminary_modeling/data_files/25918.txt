 My coworker Amy Rancher is waiting for her menstrual period. Her mother wants to know when she gets it. She should be getting it soon. Amy gets out a tampon and goes to the bathroom. She has gotten her period. I put a tampon in me: in my vagina or in my butt hole. It doesn't fit well: part of it sticks out and won't stay in. There is blood on it. I may get it to fit.
