I am holding Mary in my arms, but at the same time I see her from a distance. It is Mary, but her face doesn't look like Mary's. Her face is squarish and hollow or emaciated. We both know she is sick. Although I am making love to Mary, I am also doing "the laying on of hands," trying to combat the cancer and to cure her. She accepts my "laying on of hands" -- or at least doesn't resist or protest. I place my hands on her stomach and on her back. I pray that the disease should disappear -- that God's strength and power will wipe out the disease. While I do this, I hear a kind of "popping" noise coming from Mary's body in response to my prayers and to my "laying on of hands." While I feel that I am having some success in fighting the cancer, Mary remains calm and stoical. She neither accepts nor denies that my efforts are helping her. There is a scene in this dream where I am sucking on Mary's nipples, which are quite long and prominent. She quietly asks me to stop because it's hurting her. I stop.
