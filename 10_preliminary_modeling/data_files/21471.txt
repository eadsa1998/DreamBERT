I was in the back yard and there were 3 big tricycles. I was going to ride one. There was a mouse running around on the lawn and I was going to step on him. I finally stepped on him and when I looked in the grass for him, all I found was grasshoppers that were dead. I was flying low with Audrey and her girlfriend. Audrey gave me some gold. I flew to a dead end in a building twice. There were homes on fire. People were standing and watching them. As I came to the fire I saw another fire and no one knew about it. I told the crowd about it, so we went to it and put it out.
