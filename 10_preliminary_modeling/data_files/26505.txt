 There is a woman at or in a place that may be a playground. The number three appears somehow. My friend Matt Yams is driving my mom's maroon car. Another person and I are in the car. We drive on the grass of the Railroad Company softball fields in Oak Valley, going eastward on the north side of 3rd Street. Matt is speeding. A police car passes. I know we'll be pulled over. Matt speeds up, and we drive onto the blacktop. I encourage him to pull over, but he tries to escape. I'm in a group of five people, including several police officers and my friend Melvin Dahlheimer. Matt isn't there. I'm in a car. A person blasts the lock of the car using a handgun. This is an aggressive, tension-reducing act, releasing energy. At one point, I wrestle Matt's gun to the ground. There are eight shots in one gun. I fire off some rounds in the gun. I run through people's yards and get hung up on a clothesline.
