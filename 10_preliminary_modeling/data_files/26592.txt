 I'm in a rocky area with a waterfall with my friends Paul Jones and his roommate Cordero. Cordero talks about places one should see. There are rays of light beaming down. I try to climb up a little rock structure. At the top of the structure is a clock or a calendar that shines. It is a smooth, flat circular structure, somewhat goldish-tannish-brown in color. There is a platform there at the top of the structure where this item is.
