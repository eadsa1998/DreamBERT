I was a dinosaur and a T.Rex came to the place we were living in and all the dinosaurs. So we had to go to a different land but the T.Rex followed us. So when we got there I was running so fast because I was trying to get away from the T.Rex that I left my mom behind. So I went with my friends so I could get help Well they said they lost their Moms too. Well I had some magic so I disappeared because we found the T.Rex and then I said, "You can't see me right?" and the T.Rex said "right" and then we taught him how to be nice, not mean. Then we saw our parents when we got back waiting for us. Well when we saw our Moms we were so happy to see them that we jumped high into the sky that we reached the clouds. When we came back down from the sky we said "Mama, Mama so glad to see you." Then we showed our Moms the T.Rex and when they saw him they were "Aahhrrrr" but we weren't afraid at all and we said "He's nice".
