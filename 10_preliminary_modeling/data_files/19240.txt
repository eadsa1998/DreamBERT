Setting: the woods inside a castle (unfamiliar) and a friend's house (familiar). I went to visit my boy friend at his house but his best friend told me to be careful. Then the setting changed to a castle where a queen wanted to kill me for visiting boys. She chased after me until we got to a lake in the woods but we were still in the castle. They took my cloak off to behead me but when it was taken off, a bright white light flashed and when it went away, everyone was scared and they let me go. Ages: 16, 17, 20. Characters: all familiar (boy friend, friends), the queen even is a friend. It was unpleasant until I got away and then I liked it. No animals except a bird that was in the background of every scene.
