Long dream of train trip to the Retreat Center through the mountains; "I'm never so happy until I see the mountains!" I say to no one in particular; there is confusion and long hassle about getting a roomette. Finally we settle in, very plush, like a hotel, but we have to share it with a black woman... why? shift: I bring present to Margaret and Patrick (our Retreat Center Directors)
