 There is a television show about the making of a movie about a shark. The shark is mechanical and won't hurt anyone. At one point I feel as if I may be the shark. I am swimming or am underwater, and I have to go a long way. Debris sinks on top of me as I or the shark moves. After this show my friend Fran Susse and her father are on an infomercial about cards. They ask people to call in and comment on or discuss a card game or situation that they have just demonstrated.
