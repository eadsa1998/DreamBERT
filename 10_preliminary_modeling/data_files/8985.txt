I was talking with three girlfriends. One of them worked part-time for the YMCA. She is getting ready to leave to coworker shift and she mentions that she is going to work out while she's there during her shift. I am also working part time there and told her that I didn't realize that we were allowed to work out during our shift. She said that we are allowed to we just have to make sure that we keep our jobs or priority. So if there is something that we need to be doing for our job we need to do it rather than working out. However, if we get a break or don't have anything to do that we can't work out. I also have some things I guess in my locker at the YMCA that I've been hanging on to. They belong to someone who is no longer in my life or are somehow connected to that person. It almost feels as though this person has died. Someone told me that it's not healthy for me to continue to hold onto these things. They said I needed to get rid of them and let go. I said something to my friend about it because I thought she would agree with me and be supportive, but she wasn't. She agreed with the other person.
