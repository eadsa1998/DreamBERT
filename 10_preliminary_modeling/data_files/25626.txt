 I'm fishing at Many Fish Lake with someone, maybe my friend Hank Anderson. We're trolling along the weed line, but I am always in the weeds. I am not able to keep my lure out of the weeds. I can't fish. We're on the east end of the lake. We swim to the second boat landing, which I don't ever use. We get out of the water and walk along the shore back to the main boat landing.
