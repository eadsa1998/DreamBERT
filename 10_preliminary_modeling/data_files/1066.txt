Rosemary comes back to town. She walks in and sits on a couch. I sit next to her. She says, "Where were you? Why didn't you meet me? I waited for over an hour and then had to find a way here." I apologize and say, "I thought you still had your car and would meet me here." I feel slightly guilty for not thinking more about her situation, as she got left in a bind. She leans back and says, "Oh! I've been to a Jungian conference for 5 days. I'm exhausted. It's like learning a new language." Another woman comes up and chats. I explain to her why Rosemary's so tired.
