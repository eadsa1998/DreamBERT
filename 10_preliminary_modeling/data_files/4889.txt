I am in a house that is supposedly Esther's. I see photos on the wall of Naomi when in high school. I don't have that photo and feel hurt. Then I remember they are sisters so it would make sense she gets them. I lie down on a small bed to rest. Then Charla comes in and wants that spot. I go into another room. A small boy grabs up some candy like pills. I quickly take them to check and see if they are OK for him to take. Some are not. I tell Esther. I check my pill stash to see if he took some of mine. Aspirin like drugs. I am concerned.
