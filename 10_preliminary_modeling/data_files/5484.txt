I dreamed that I had emptied my cat litter box. The cardboard box that was rectangular and had the cat litter in it also had a small spout on the side that you could pour the cat litter out of and when I came out of the bathroom where I had been doing this, my mother, who had come over to the house said: "that was laundry soap that you put in there, not cat litter".
