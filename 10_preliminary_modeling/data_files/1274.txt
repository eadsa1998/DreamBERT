Now it's time for our group to perform. I'm sort of not in the group anymore. I've grown beyond their capacities and I'm moving on for more. Brett's in the group. Our audience is small and seated in school desks. Everyone goes up to do the opening song. I come up a little later, on the periphery. They sing and falter, forgetting the words. I sing out "We forgot the words and it's O.K.," to a nursery rhyme tune. The audience loves it and applauds. I go sit on the sidelines while Hector and his girl work out a new skit. I need my scripts. I go back to my purse and get them. I come back up on stage. Maggie sits next to me and says, "You're really matured. You were good and now you're hot!" I say, "Thanks."
