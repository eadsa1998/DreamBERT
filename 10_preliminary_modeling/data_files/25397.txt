 A kid that I know from my economics class and from the computer lab at Brimson, whom I don't like and think is a gimp, comes into my Educational Psychology class and says he lost his article for class when the server crashed. (Note: I was typing an article review for Educational Psychology today when the computer crashed and shut down.)
