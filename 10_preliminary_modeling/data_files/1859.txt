I step over a counter displaying onyx animals to get a better look. Some fall over. I reassure the salesgirl. Nothing's broken. I see a guy dragonet and like it (stuffed.) It comes to me. It has sharp claws. It flies. I put it on my head. Now it's like a lace curtain veil that will take in flying. I look for some string loops so I won't lose it when I'm airborne, but they are then sewing thread and very fragile.
