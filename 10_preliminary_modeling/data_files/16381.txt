I was in this elevator with Melinda and a couple people from the Wilcox Center. It was really big, and had these glass windows kind of like the ones from the pier. And I had the notion that we had to get to the 14th floor of this building and we were kind of stuck, and we had to kind of ride up and down for a little while until somebody called it from the 14th floor and got it to open. And down below there were these people bouncing balls in a courtyard. We were looking through the elevator windows and we saw. And I kind of shifted to another scene that I was like with the transition people, and I had these raw cucumber slices and I like put them up against my eyes and kind of squinted to hold them there, to get kind of goofy like they do in the cartoons, because I used to do stuff like that when I was little. And they got so offended, thinking that I was making fun of myself and people who had terminal legal blindness. And I don't know where all that came from. It was small, but it was kind of crazy. So anyway, I think I did a pretty good job of filling up this tape. For once I will have timed it so that I'm done when it's done. Now I can finally take off that little piece of scotch tape that I put on the one side to let me record over this "blah, blah, blah" tape, and I can take the tape off and it'll just be a regular tape. Anyway, you know what I'm saying. [laugh]
