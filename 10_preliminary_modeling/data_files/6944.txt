As I opened a package at the table I found it full of soda crackers. Offered some to a neighbor. Then found some were cookies. After a while I ate one sweet roll from the package. Then I went on with Shir, 7 or 8 years old, and her half brother, 19 years, to catch a bus. Just missed one. I said, "let's walk. I've done it before." So we started down the graveled road. As we came to a branch, Shir said, "this is a shortcut." But it was muddy and full of puddles. So her _ brother and I persuaded her to remain on the graveled road. (Shir, my niece, now 40 years has no half siblings.)
