In an auditorium getting seated. An earthquake that would cause much damage was announced to be on its way. I wish and said that I hope it would hurry and get it over. Trying to get to sleep again and pull up covers. I feel a door by my bed that shouldn't be there. Open eyes: bed and door still in the right place; perhaps it's that screen by the bed.
