I dreamt a lot, but I don't remember exactly what about (a strange thing happens in that when I am half-awake in the morning, I can remember all my dream, I go over it, and when I go to write it, it's forgotten, like now). Anyway, I somehow remember that they were bringing me a medical sample from the laboratory, which in real life is some medicine that I have been requesting with no use for an uncle of mine who is constantly asking me for it.
