Some crotchety old bastard was paying me to completely rewrite all of Douglas Adams' books, because he didn't like a lot of the things that were in them. And he wanted to get some things of his own in. I was instructed to give it a really long title in 18th century style: The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, or, the adventures of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent blah blah blahblah blah for twelve pages. <br/
