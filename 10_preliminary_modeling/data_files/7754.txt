I was in my bedroom and heard someone come in the front door. The alarm sounded but they silenced it. I knew it wasn't Matthew. I closed and locked my bedroom door. The burglar came to my bedroom door and was quietly trying to get in. He was trying to remove the hinge pins that were on my side of the door. I was pressing my body against the door and holding the lower hinge pin in with my fingers. The pin was missing from the top. He finally gave up and left. I went downstairs, locked the front door, and reset the alarm. The burglar tried to get back in through a dog door at the bottom of the front door. I held the point of iron in the hole to press against/into his head as he tried to enter. I told someone to call 911. The police arrived and arrested him. Two black women, my roommates, showed up. They didn't want him arrested. They had given him the alarm passcode so he could get in. So I told them they should not have done that and they needed to move out that day.
