We were at a restaurant, H. A. and I. I started to speak to H. who had papers spread on the table before me but she said, "I am talking" and when I stood before her waiting to speak, she repeated, "Even if you keep standing there, I am still talking." I feel hurt but sat down waiting to be served and trying to catch a waitress's eye to tell her I had no dessert. Several people pass by before a waitress comes and I can tell her.
