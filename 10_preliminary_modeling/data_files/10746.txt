This dream was sort of mixed up. At first the large room we were in was all dark. A mock wedding was going on. Later it turned out to be a weekend out at Camp Wise (I had just returned from there). Later it seemed as if I were in a dorm. I spoke with several counselors. On the back of my mind I kept thinking about my purse.
