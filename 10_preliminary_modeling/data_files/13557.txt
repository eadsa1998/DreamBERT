I made this chip that could let us do anything. Some girl stole it and Mom, Ezra and I went after her. We were driving but then we lost her. Her sick old grandma was in a car with her. We went to this place and there were lots of old people around. Ms Bigwood was there. Then it was a movie and this old couple was talking. It turned out that the chip had made everyone stay at their current age (forever).
