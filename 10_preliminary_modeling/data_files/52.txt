A LT event of some sort, in a small school auditorium - this one is not old, it's pretty much like the ones I went to (say 5th grade). John Boats is talking and I get called away shortly after it starts - I was sitting down front - and don't get back until it's almost over. He's doing Hot Potato, and I'm getting really pissed off because I missed everything. I'm struggling not to blame somebody else. Leaving, we're not going home, though, just to lunch, and I guess we're coming back - we're walking down the hall talking about what to do for lunch.
