 I'm crawling on the floor of an office building, going to a meeting at Armstrong High School. I enter a hallway. There are photocopies on the wall of some pictures of maps of a brain that are in a book. The book is there. It is black and has to do with the brain, mind, and maybe dreams. A teacher at the school is reading it. I pick it up briefly and look at it: It looks interesting, new. I go to the meeting. I'm ten minutes late. I'm the first student there. There are three teachers or administrators there waiting, one of whom is my religion professor Grace Kurkowski. I walk in and sit down directly across from these three, although there are other seats available. I sit firmly, plainly, and directly across from them, like I'm confronting them and mean business. It is obvious that no students care about the meeting.
