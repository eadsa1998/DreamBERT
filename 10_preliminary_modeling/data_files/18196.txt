I was on a bus going home to my hometown. I was talking to the bus driver who was a woman and I was talking to her in French because she was French, although she understood English. I wanted to sort of practice my French on her and I was telling her, she asked me something about witches. Did I think they really existed or what? So I was telling her that I thought they did, and their different qualities about them, and they really could work magic and all this sort of stuff. I told her how last Christmas I had gone up to the park in my hometown and had met a group of witches who had invited me to their meeting or rather had been forced to since I was there. I was supposed to not reveal their secrets or something. Then this woman, although she was the bus driver, got off at a stop which was quite a distance from where I wanted to get off, but I got off anyhow because I wanted to keep on talking to her. We were talking and I asked her if my French pronunciation was good and if she could understand me, but she didn't ever exactly give me a definite answer on that. The rest of the dream was sort of vague. It seems that I was going with her where her home was along the street. It isn't really a street in my hometown in actuality, but it is a street that's been in my dreams before.
