Mort (a client) and the girls are at a table. Ellie and I talk. I really listen to her and understand her frustrations. A good feeling of rapport grows between us. There is some kind of danger and we need to hide, underwater in a bathtub. Ellie and Paulina are there and I'm helping them so they don't panic. We talk about how well they did after they come up. There is something about their mother who left them. Ellie is a little mad at her.
