We were out driving with Carter at night. My lights would go out and it was dark. They would be out most of the time. We stopped by a friend of Carter's. I had on my old pants. I was embarrassed. We went to get some beer, but the brewery was closed because it was dark in the building. A sparrow flew on my shoulder. He was friendly. I held him on my hand. I came to a window and there were a lot of houseflies. He was having a feast on them. I watched him with his mouth open. The flies walked in and out, then he would eat them. I was on the street. I noticed a big tree was broken by a storm at night as we slept. Then I looked down by Renwood School and there lay a lot of big trees. One tree had the roots turned up and a house was tipped on one side by the roots of the tree.
