Me and Molly were playing in the street in [a vacation state] and her mom was there and we were asking strangers some questions and then a stranger asked us to get in a car. We got in the car, and then he drove us somewhere. I was in a car--mommy's--and he drove us to a house that looked like ours, but with different things. We wanted to get home so we called 911. I was only 4 in the dream.
