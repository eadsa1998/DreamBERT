I am playing a guitar on a stage and I play well. There is a man there who is in competition with me. I get off the stage and run hurriedly into the audience crowd to try to get away from the man. He teases me hard, or something. I run into the women's room. I come out and someone is interviewing the man, who is drunk, and he kisses me and the interviewer on stage says something and the man says, "Hey, I'm married and I am loyal to my wife." I am asked if he's a good kisser. I say, "Yes he is. He smells like shit, but he's a good kisser," and I see his mouth is full of duck shit, green stuff, and the cement corner he had been leaning or sitting in had shit on it too. It's nauseating. Now I see on the stage some animal act where the ducks are trained to raise their wings and gesture them like arms and they are told to find someone and cure him, like a doctor. I watch as they all line up at their spots against the side walls and put their heads to the wall like in hide and seek. I think, "How interesting." They probably had to train a long time to be able to do that. They have sacks over their heads. I feel gritty stuff in my throat from the duck shit kiss.
