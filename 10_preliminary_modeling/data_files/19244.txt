I dreamed that I was flying on an airplane to Paris. I was sitting there in my seat when all of a sudden Matt Damon walks up to my row and says "hello." I was so excited. My heart was racing faster than I could feel it beat! He sat down next to me and we started to talk. I also remember that I was in the middle seat with Matt on my right and this really big heavy man on my left. I had to squish closer to Matt in order to sit more comfortably. But I don't think I had any objections to that!! We talked and laughed the whole way to Paris. It was great.
