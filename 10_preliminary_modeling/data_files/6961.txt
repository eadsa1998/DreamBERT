Dressing for a party. Decide to wear my holomuu. First I go to the toilet off Dunlap's bedroom. I see all three lying on the bed asleep. No. Hilda isn't. I ask if she is sick. Yes, they've all been very ill, temperatures up to 142 and 173. As I return to my room, I ask nurse if such temperatures are really possible. She says yes.
