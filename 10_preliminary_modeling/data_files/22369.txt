I am in some kind of basketball court. There are a bunch of people I know. I am accompanied by Y., a girl from the university. I hug her because I am afraid that the basketball will fall on her. Suddenly I realize that it could also fall on me, and I raise my arm just in time to stop it from falling on my head. Once this is over, I let go of the girl and we continue walking. There was another dream, but you wouldn't understand it.
