I wasn't sure where at first, but it turned out to be school.  At first there were like Ferris wheels or something.  Then we were recruited into a half-constructed house/warehouse.  It was kind of like a Navy thing, kind of like a prisoner deal.  All wood, no windows.  Everyone was on the floor, except for those giving orders.  They had us do pushups and such, but I couldn't get my right pinky out from underneath my other fingers.  The girl next to me was counting erratically.  Then we were supposed to pair up and construct wood panels to add to make a very thick front door.  I was alone in the task.  Then I was at home, and my maternal Grandma Jane was asking whether she should throw some white bagels away.  I was then back at college, and passed the swimming area; like a summer camp.  They were playing some song about 'fat girls'.  I woke up.  I went back, and had a sort of continued dream.  We gathered around the outside of the building, going to put up the door we'd made.   When we went to put the door up, we were punished for one of the panels (sandwiched) coming off.  I was going to go on the side of the building to try and fix it.  The house was to be some sort of gauntlet.  I stepped off the side, and in the field, bees started swarming me.  More and more with each step, flying around, on my face, my arms.  There was one on my left cheek that sort of tickle-hurt.  Like metal in a mouth with braces.  I haven't had a bee dream for a very long time.  I thought it was interesting, and refreshing, dreaming at all.
