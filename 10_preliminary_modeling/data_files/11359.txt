I was sitting in a classroom of the Hebrew school. As I was sitting there the director came in and mentioned that he might be able to give me a permanent job. He then began going through his desk, apparently looking for some card or piece of paper which I thought was probably a report on how I had done with the class I taught. Before he found the card I woke up.
