 There are a bunch of warrior-type fighters in a circle. A "chief" or leader-type person is directing the fights. There is a young fighter who is really tough, who knows his stuff. The chief puts him up against a big, tough, thug-like opponent right away. There is also a scrawny guy who is sore all over. I think he may have bad knees. He goes up against the young tough guy too. The chief has a long stick with a clear gem attached to the end. It looks like a diamond, but I think it is too big to be a diamond. The fighters have smaller sticks with gems. One fighter uses bubbles to protect himself from the blows of his opponent's stick. There are also dice-like elevator structures that fling opponents really high and make them drop really fast.
