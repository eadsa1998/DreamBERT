["Helping man dies attempting to save the other."] I am watching a woman (me) painting the wall an off white color. All the pictures, many of them, just like my photos are on my bedroom wall, are still up and she is painting between and around them. I think that's stupid. She will regret it later. Then she starts on the next wall and I see a mirror with a reflection of her previous room she painted. I see her husband also there painting, but she had allowed him to sleep in even though she herself is very tired. Three rooms are done like that. She notices she accidentally painted on hardwood windowsills. She decides to wipe it off before it ruins the natural look of the wood. She tries to hide the paint covered paper towel she used to wipe it off so her husband won't be upset with her. Then she sits, tired and he comes to her and tells her to finish. She says she needs a smaller brush for the trim. He shrugs and says go get one at the corner market. She doesn't want to. She doesn't answer as her attention is caught by a man standing on the edge of a roof across the way. She sees him through the window. Then she sees to of them. One is trying to kill himself by jumping, the other one is trying to save him by catching his arm and holding on to him. Several times the man jumps and the other catches him, each time it is scary and she gasps. She is irresistibly drawn to the window to see the whole thing. She wonders why, as she would hate to actually see him splatter on the ground and die. On the third jump, the second man loses his grip and the other man falls to his death. The woman gasps, turns away and cries deeply at the tragedy. Because as the one man jumped to his death, it caught the other man off guard and he too fell to his death. It is ironic and tragic. She cries and cries.
