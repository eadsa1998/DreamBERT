["Taking Classes"]  I am taking some classes, mostly figure drawing. I talk with a woman who wants to know what classes I'll take next term. I have no idea, since I'm just taking a class that interests me, but I can tell she wants me to graduate and take all the required courses. I evade the question, saying something general like "Art Classes, I think."
