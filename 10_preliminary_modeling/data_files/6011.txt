I am driving my car, and I "just happen" to go past my parents' house. It is a fine afternoon out, and a few blocks later I park the car and go for a bicycle ride. I ride until it gets dark, and then I go to surprise my mother by paying an unannounced visit. She is pleased and we go for a walk together.
