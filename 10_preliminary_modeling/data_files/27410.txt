I walked over to T Library to look up a book in the catalogue. I went around to the entrance on the West Side of the building but the door was locked and there was a sign on the door giving directions to go around to the front entrance on E Avenue. I knew there wasn't any entrance on E but I went anyway. When I got there I found a beautiful building of Georgian architecture - long and low with about 10 pillars. It was beautifully landscaped with grass, evergreens and tall trees. I just stood and looked at it.
