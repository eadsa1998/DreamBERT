I was riding my pony when my horse trainer came up to me and said she'd bought me a horse. She showed me the horse. She showed me his tack and I got on him and jumped a six-foot high fence. My trainer told me she had entered me in a big horse show. I went to it and I won everything. Setting: At the barn I ride at. The barn was totally remodeled, though. Characters: A world-famous horseback rider who was my trainer, a chestnut pony, a dappled gray horse. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I was overjoyed that I was winning everything!
