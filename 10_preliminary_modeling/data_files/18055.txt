I had a sugar glider that looks like a hamster. I was gonna go swimming and I didn't want to lose the sugar glider, so I got dressed in my bathing suit, so I put it down the bathing suit where my butt is. I was in the pool and then this man said, "What's in your bathing suit" and I poked out the sugar glider and he said, "you know sugar gliders shouldn't get wet," and I went back home, dried myself off and I dried the sugar glider off too. Then we were going to the store so I had to put it down my pants. I thought I lost it in the store but I didn't. Then we got home and we rested around and then I flew up to the sky and I came back down.
