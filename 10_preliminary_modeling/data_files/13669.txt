It was the end of Saw 5 and the guy they played it on got blown up in a car. It zoomed in on the licence plate which was 8ZE-963. This detective dude was in his office and then Frank Whaley (who was the guy that got blown up) came in. Then we were somewhere. I realized they were going to blow up Mom's car. Mom, Ezra and I got all our important stuff out and went inside this house. Ezra was really slow and this guy was putting his hand in his jacket so I was telling Ezra to hurry. There were these cats inside and they kept going outside. One of the cats was that ugly one from Ugly Betty. One of the cats went out and I said "Not Christopher Gorham!". The doors were confusing. The car blew up. Someone had orange socks. This girl and I went to a house. It was Eugene's. His father (Abraham) was called Richard but liked being called Dick. I went to Eugene's room, taking note of the house layout. He was in his bed. He motioned for me to go next to him. He was watching TV. I was thinking 'Oh my God, I'm in Eugene's room'. I lay down next to him and he put his arm around me, then we were hugging and kissing. Later, I got up to draw a map of the house. Rodney wasn't in his room and there were school bags in there. His parents were in bed. I heard a noise like someone was trying to get into the house. I told Eugene. We got up and there was a guy in his parent's bedroom (they had a back door in there). They said something and we realized they were bad and we ran out the door. We were running on this roof and swinging from trees. Eugene saved me from the guys at one point, then I ran away when he was in trouble. This lady and another lady (who was a mole) were walking down a dark street. They told me to this old person's house and I had to use a weird hand held console (it was a game, but wasn't). I told Nana that people were coming to kill her, but she didn't believe me.
