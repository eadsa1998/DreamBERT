Riding in a car or train in a strange country: see huge lights being rolled in for a baseball game: come to a house where I see Shirley &amp; Ron R. look out and say "hi"; I see her dress Reynaldo - also see other girl who dances; then see Frank in a bookstore: wearing coat: he brings home some friends from book store with him; I feed them supper.
