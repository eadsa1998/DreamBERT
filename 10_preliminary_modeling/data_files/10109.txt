At a huge FACTORY with Frank and Wendy; we talk with the foreman, a gray-haired, older man, about buying something wholesale; he gives us a time when we can come to pick it up; We are invited to a Union member and their house is simple and neat; I play with the kids and put on blue pj's on one of the kids; We all sit down to eat and instead of saying Grace, an older child bongs on a gong and they all say D W E L L ("Lord Dwell with us, let us dwell in Your Love").
