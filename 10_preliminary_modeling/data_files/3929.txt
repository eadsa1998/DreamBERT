["Lesbian Hotel."] Paulina H. invites me to lunch at a nice hotel. When we arrive, we, must scramble down an embankment and she goes across the pasture field to get the reservations. The lovely tables are along the edges of the pasture. Paulina and I sit at one of tables. Jake joins us and our "Dad." Jake looks around, and wonders if this is a Lesbian hotel and hopes to overhear Paulina talk about her affair with another woman. Our "Dad" sits at the table with us now., listening intently.
