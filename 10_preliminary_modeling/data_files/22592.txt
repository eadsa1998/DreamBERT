I dreamt that a friend of mine, whom I like very much, was walking with a girl, who is also a friend of mind, in the direction of my house, but they turned the corner and went to a garage to take out a car. I was standing at the door of my house with a boyfriend who is much younger than the first one, but of the same age I am. When I saw them turning the corner, I hurriedly ran and told my friend to wait for me; before he had asked me to go to the cleaners with him and it was just when I told him to wait for me that he went to take the car out. When I got to the corner, I saw that Louis (that is his name) was coming out of the garage in a light blue car with the same girl he was with before, and they were leaving, and they made a turn the wrong way on a one-way street. At that moment I started to run, not the same way they had gone, but rather I took a shortcut which went straight. I must have run for about two blocks and I did not see them any more, but as I kept advancing, the place became more unfamiliar, there were trees and few people.
