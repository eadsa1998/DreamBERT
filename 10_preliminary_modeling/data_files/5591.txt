[1997-05-08] A strange dream. My husband and I were up at [school for blind children], it was New Years eve and they were going to have a big party but they changed the school all around. There were all people there we knew, but Pete and I weren't going to this party because we were getting ready to have our own party. The next day with Merv K. A friend of his family was going to come over on New Years day. Somehow the dream was all mixed up. I went into the ladies room there to use the ladies room and somehow our friend Joe N. was in there. I don't know why, and I don't know why we were going to this party when we were going to have our own party the next day. But Pete and I went because somebody told us we should and he and I were wearing shorts. We had shorts on instead of formal. Everyone else was dressed to kill. They all had fancy skirts and nice suits on, here comes Pete and I with our shorts on. I don't even know if it was January.
