Wednesday night, 4/21/93 I was in my room and there was a strange person there. I'm not sure if he was a baby or an adult. He had blonde hair long on the back above the shoulders but cut close along the front and sides. He was very small, smaller than a midget or dwarf in fact. His body from chest to hip was so small it looked like he had no body. He almost looked like the Head Detective from the show "In Living Color" only his arms didn't come out of his head. I heard some music playing. It had a Latin beat and I danced with him. I think I was afraid of him or more uncomfortable but we danced and it was fun. He seemed really sweet almost childlike. I remember telling people or wanting to tell people about the weirdest thing that just happened, me dancing with this little person in my room. I think he was a good dancer.
