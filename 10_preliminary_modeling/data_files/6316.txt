I had a dream in which I was out at a party and my girlfriend was with me. There was a kid she knew from my old high school. She was flirting with him and I tried to keep her from doing it. She just kept doing it. He kept flirting back even though I was right there. Then I remember walking into the bedroom and she was in there on the bed with her ex-boyfriend. She was having sex with him. I pushed him off and started to fight with him. He disappeared and she was on a couch with two boys who were both having sex with her. I remember very vividly feeling the walls and things in the room coming closer to me like everything was closing in on me. I was helpless. I woke up feeling very uncomfortable and angry.
