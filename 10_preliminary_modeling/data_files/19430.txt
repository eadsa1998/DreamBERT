Later that night I had the same dream as no. 22, except when I approached my dad, I grabbed his shoulders and made him give me his full attention. I said, "I love you, don't do this!" The tune changed and dinner continued. Also in this dream he was yelling at the boy, but he didn't have his fist drawn.
