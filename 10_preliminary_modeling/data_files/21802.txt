I bought a name and a number plate from Norm. The dr. from Fairmont Dairy for $5. Then from 732 the comedian a plate also for $3. All this was a violation of a law of some kind. Then later I was accused for buying this by 73 and he was the one that sold me it. He gave me five lashes with a  whip. I met his daughter later and I told her about this. We were prisoners of some kind. I was out of the compound, then I wanted to get back in, but was afraid the fence was wired for an alarm and I would be punished again for being outside of the compound.
