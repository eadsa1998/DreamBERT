A woman director is looking at the butts of the male and female actors. The woman's buns are big and heavy. The director says, "Ah! They don't make them like they used to." She admires them. Then the director gets up and goes to the door where a male worker is standing. She gives him a sexy come-on look and takes him off to have her way with him. Later, she returns. A fat Andy Divine guy comes and sits by her. He has on a small brown round derby hat. He says he's available should she be interested. She says she is. His hat wiggles up and down comically. Now I'm the actress. Josh comes up and says, "Dora's in the hospital and wants you to call her." I am surprised and concerned. I find a phone and call. A nurse answers. I hear Dora in the back ground say, "I'm expecting this call." The nurse says, "You can't talk to her." I say, "Wait. I was told to call her." The nurse is indignant that I would be so pushy and rude as to try to talk with Dora now. I feel embarrassed like it's not my fault, I'm just obeying a summons. Then I say, "Is it OK to come see her?" The nurse snorts derisively, "No, of course not." I get angry and say, "OK," then I hang up, slamming the receiver. Then I see Dora's daughter Daphne in a nurse's outfit and ask how her mom is. Daphne says she's doing better. I say, "What's wrong with he?" and Daphne says, "She's getting treatment for being a child sex molester." I am surprised and feel sad for Daphne and shocked about Dora. I'd never imagine she'd be like that!
