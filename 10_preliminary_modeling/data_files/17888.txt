My mother offered me a white container of some sort of peanut butter.  I dipped something, perhaps a cracker in it to taste it.  It was a sort of peanut butter, but with crispies and caramel so it tasted something like a Crunch bar.  I also had some train-shaped tart candies (like Smarties) in front of me, and I started combining the two.
