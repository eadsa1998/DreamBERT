 There is a house on fire. It seems to be where my neighbors the Shipp's house is. I help a fireman get the top off a fire hydrant, which is laying flat against the ground. We turn the top of the hydrant until the number 10 comes up. The spray of water out of the hose is weak. There are a man and a woman still in the house. I go to the door of the house and tell them to go out of the house. They have spilled alcohol on the rug. I get another hose, and go around the west side of the house, which, when I get inside, is the Drummond Bakery. I drag the hose along, knocking over baked goods. The spray out of the hose is a mist. There is no fire in this part of the building.
