Dad, Ezra and I were lining up for something. I was watching a Kenny vs. Spenny episode and Kenny was in bed with some girls and most of them were blurred. With one of them, he said "ow!" and another that wasn't blurred said she wanted a puppy and started crying. I laughed because it made no sense. There was a basketball thing in the games room at home. I set it up. Dad came. Kenny came through from the far wall. I was playing basketball with some people and the winner got something. I hurt my arm and I was playing this guy next, who was the last guy (the last round). I was playing with one arm, but doing ok. Then there was a team and the guy wanted to stab his friend on the other team. I took the pole off him so he couldn't. Some boy had drowned. Granny was packing stuff to move somewhere else. I was getting dressed to go to the shop. I put this tight-ish shirt on with this white see-through net-like material over the top and a pink hat. I decided to put a shirt over what I was wearing but my room was messy and I couldn't find a shirt. There was an episode of some show and I was trying to remember which episode it was from and then that episode was on TV. T-Bag (Prison Break) and others were on a street, and they would walk back and forth between these traffic lights (in a small area). He had batteries and was trying them on a light. This guy opened the one that had money in it and T-Bag went and flicked through his batteries and then walked away. He was twitchy and a thief.
