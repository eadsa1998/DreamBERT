I was in the basement cellar in 1103 E. 68 St. I pulled the loose rack from the floor and was that a nice high basement. I pulled some from near a support and it gave away. I ran upstairs and Grandma was there. The roof was falling down. I got hold of Gram's hand and the house seemed to be going underground. I got out and pulled Grandma out. The property went under, down. I heard a rumor that a Jew had a gorilla do that so the property would go down in price. Then he bought it cheap and what a magnificent building was put up. The place was inlaid floor, walls and ceiling all in blue. It was a long building a block long. It was to be a furniture store. A fellow came up with cap to sell me. I said I had hatless, don't need one. He said, "I'll sell it for 25 cents. The store sells it for 20 cents, but I must make some extra money." A bookie joint was raided and they hauled some glass on the street. Hank came up with my tire air gauge that I had 20 years ago and it had numbers on it. We had a garden of tomatoes. There were some plants where it was loaded with tiny bugs that were eating the plant. Two Jews were bidding for the property.
