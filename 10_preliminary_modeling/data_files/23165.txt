One of the classic college dreams.  I was living in a dorm, but had stopped attending classes.  I missed my wife Anita and wondered why I was there.  I hadn't even called her in a couple of days, and felt bad about it.  There was another older guy in a nearby room, and we had a conversation about the group who sang some song.  I told him it was the New Christy Minstrels.  Later I was in his room before he returned, with a jug of water on his bed for some reason, and he remembered the name of the group as "Dead Given."  When I was preparing to move out, I was shaving in bed, my eyes still droopy from sleeping.  I opened them only as much as necessary to look in the mirror from time to time.
