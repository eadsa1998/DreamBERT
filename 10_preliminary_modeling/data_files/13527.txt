Ezra and I were at a beach. We were watching this movie while walking through this carpark and recognized that the movie was set here. We walked onto the sand and met with this actor guy. We were walking with him and he asked us to be in the movie with him. Ezra and I were like "lucky we came to the beach". The water came up and knocked us down. I was carried a while away (on the sand). He said he was doing a talk soon. I was then naked and looking for clothes. Some lady said "Get it cut". I found some clothes and ended up at this place and Jemma was there. She was abusing me and then touched me so I started hitting her and she fell to the ground and I walked off. I went up these stairs and realized that she was following me. She said something like that she was going to punch me over the edge. She grabbed my leg but I managed to push her over and she fell. But when I looked she had only fallen onto the steps and was still alive. Some old lady was like "She's the victim here" and I said "Then so was Ted Bundy". Lydia said the Jemma's name was Madelyn and I said that it wasn't and that I didn't mind Madelyn. Lydia was like 'what the hell?'. I was worried about getting in trouble for it, but was hoping that she had died.
