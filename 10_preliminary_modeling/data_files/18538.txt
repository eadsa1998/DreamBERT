There was a little girl. She was an exchange student in a different place. Kids there had horses (that) they saddled and sat on, but didn't ride. I thought, "What I need here is a horse and then the other kids will talk to me." But when I got up on the horse the kids threw sticks and rocks at me. I was trying to make a cup of hot tea and I had the wrong kind of leaves in there. It was just water with leaves from outside I'd thrown in lukewarm water. There was a little boy. His name was Tiny Boy. I thought that (Tiny Boy) would not be such a good name when he was big and old. Out for a movie was a tiny little boy wearing my father's bright red coat. He had to stand on a chair so (that) the long red coat would not hit the floor. He was very intent on eating chicken legs. He had 3 in all. They were fried. I was hoping to see Dora. In the park near the river, the outdoor movie was $9.50. They did have chairs. I saw Paula there. She was training 3 priests. I sat on the curb in front of the house, waiting for the mailman. I needed to tell him about Dora's address and any left mail from people who didn't know yet (that) she was killed. She would come and play and make my mother and my father cry. I didn't want them to call. When Evelyn came over I was contemplating the spelling of: ketchup / catsup
