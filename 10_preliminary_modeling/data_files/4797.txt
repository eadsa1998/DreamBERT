My mother is in a manual wheelchair trying to move forward. I am in a funky white metal frame manual with four tiny wheels. I see Xmas decorations all over the floor. Like Xmas cards and tags and things. I push at them with my feet to clear a path for my mother. She starts to move forward and I am now standing, holding my chair upside down looking at the broken wheels. Now how am I going to be able to follow my mother, I wonder.
