I found myself in my house in the country, but I first saw it as it is: a house that is easy to break into. Then I saw a big dog and several small ones. The big one told me: "Don't come close or I'll bite you," and the smaller ones also wanted to hurt me. At that moment I saw my house like a ranch, with dust on its walls. Then I saw a man who looked like a guard and he told me not to come near or they would bite me. Then my aunt Esther arrived and told him not to speak to me that way, that I was the owner and the one who paid him. But I didn't like this and I took him by the arm and spoke kindly to him. Then I was in my city home, in the kitchen, and the little dogs were nice to me. Then the big dog came and wanted to bite me. I hit his nose with my heel; someone told me he was bleeding. I called my other who was in the kitchen with me making a cake, but she didn't hear. Then I awoke.
