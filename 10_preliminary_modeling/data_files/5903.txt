I walk into a washroom in the basement of a large building. The floor is covered with soap foam and it is piled like snow in a sink. I wash my hands in empty sink and when I press automatic soap plunger, a hissing stream of soap foam shoots out and dowses my suit. I move aside, but clothes are covered with foam, which I try to wipe off as two plumbers walk in. I tell them about defective soap plunger. They walk over and try and again it shoots a stream out about ten feet long right across the room. I jump aside.
