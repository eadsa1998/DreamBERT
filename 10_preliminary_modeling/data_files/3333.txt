A boy and a girl are going to do a bit of a speech from a play I wrote to show this man. The boy says, "I'd like to put in an explanation here," and I say, "It's not necessary. If you'd do the bit that I wrote just before it, it will be clear." The man questions me and I explain if he'd do it as I wrote it, it would be fine. So the boy starts. They ride off on a tricycle and I say to the man, "It went too slow. I didn't write all those words." He smiles and doesn't quite believe me. Then a woman interrupts, asking if I was the one that sold the beads. I say yes. She opens a backpack to look at the beads. I am seated on a couch and start to scoot to the other side to give her room to lay out the packages of beads. I am now smooched clear to the other end and she says to me, "Your girls said you were the one that kisses." I said, "I'm the best kisser." The girls do it too soon. The woman, who now is like a figurine on a trapeze with glorious beads all over her, is demonstrating different patterns and positions. I am impressed. The man is kneeling at the side of the couch near me as we were in mid conversation and interrupted. She says, "I'd like to kiss you." We'll then see. I say, "You would like to kiss me?" I continue to watch as se shifts into another dazzling display. I'm still trying to form the rest of my explanation to the man while being intrigued by this woman's transformations in crystal beaded color.
