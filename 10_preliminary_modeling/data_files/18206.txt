I dreamed about this older couple who live next door to my parents in my hometown. They're in their late 50's or early 60's, I guess, and I dream about them, but it wasn't at their house in my hometown that they were and I had gone over there to visit them for some reason and we wind up in the back yard where there were a lot of unusual trees, all evergreens. There were very big pines and some other types of evergreens which they weren't telling me the names of and apparently quarreling about the different names of them, and they were trees that I never heard of before. I hadn't ever seen anything exactly like them. It was as if they didn't have any type of needle and everything. From here it seems that the scene sort of shifted so that I was on a picnic somewhere. I was sitting out in this not very attractive place, this big open space sort of on top of a little hill and way down the road to one side was a lake and I was with my husband and a couple of other people and we were just sitting there. Apparently we had finished our picnic, but we just hadn't packed up our things and gotten ready to go yet, although there really wasn't anything on the picnic table that looked like food. There wasn't anything on it at all that I can remember and we were being bothered by these yellow jackets and flies and things that were coming up to the table and we had a fly swatter and we were swatting them. My husband had to urinate and he went down by the lake and there was really no place along the lake that there was any shelter so he swam across the thing over on to this little island and then came back which struck me as being awfully silly because he was sopping wet and had all this stuff on him from this lake when he came back.
