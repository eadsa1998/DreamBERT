Robert and myself seem to be part of an infantry company, the identity and location seem obscure. We sleep in canvas tents, which I conscientiously view as rather odd. The enemy is undoubtedly oriental, and it is at this point that I detach myself from my own person and either become another, or simply phase out and watch what follows, experiencing the drama vicariously, twofold it would seem, as this is all imagined. The enemy attacks and I become acutely aware of the feeling of being shot in the head. I am behind a wall of some kind, the danger of being hit is very great. In a fury I grab a silver object, which seems to resemble an rpg, and hurl it towards the foes. It explodes and immediately the entire area is shrouded in flames, even I (or the person I am watching) is/am enveloped. This is how the dream ends. I awaken with the all-too-familiar feeling that I notice each time I have a dream that ends with my own death.
