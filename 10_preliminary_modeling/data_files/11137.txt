I was in a huge living room in a house that was unfamiliar to me with a group of people which included my mother and father, my grandmother, my roommate and her parents and several other people. We were having a religious discussion and I was the only one who was arguing for the minority groups. The whole room seemed to be against me, but I used every possible proof that I could think of to prove that I was right. I even quoted something from the Bible. Finally I got so mad that I just started yelling and I woke myself up screaming.
