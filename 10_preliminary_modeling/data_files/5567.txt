[1997-05-21] I was staying in a suburb of Chicago with people who had some children we were there for about a week and we had to do a lot of riding, because it seemed that whenever they went anywhere, shopping, we would have to drive these very long distances and I remember thinking "gosh, I'd hate to have to do all this driving. I'm glad I don't have to drive this far all the time. The children were writing a poem and each one put in a stanza and the first child's poem was like ordinary and concrete and trite and I thought "well this wont develop into anything" and then the second child's stanza was kind of the same and yet they kept adding to it and finally everybody kept adding verses and as they did it became more and more the way real literature would be and it got really meaningful; and I thought "wow! When it first started out I hadn't expected it to become such a beautiful poem, I want to put it in Braille" and they said "okay we'll write it down."
