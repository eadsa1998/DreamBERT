I was moving bedroom furniture into a room where there was living room furniture, and the living room furniture into the room where the bedroom furniture had been. I was being released from a hospital. A patient named Yurrow was polishing furniture, and I gave him some mineral oil to use as polish. Other patients were surprised that I was leaving so soon after I was notified. They were leaving too and going to Alabama. I guessed they would stop at Missouri on the way.
