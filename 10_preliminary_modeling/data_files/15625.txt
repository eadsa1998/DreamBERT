I was at a Comicon type of place. Leonard and Sheldon (The Big Bang Theory) were there. There was a small game stand and I walked past them and kept walking through the store. I was walking with no real purpose, but walking fast. Then I suddenly wondered what I was doing. I began counting the stuff I had. I had a biscuit that cost $2.50 and then I went to the games stand. Then I was leaving the place and it was dark. I started going down the steps and saw this guy below me and I tried to scream but he suddenly ran up 2 flights of steps and put his hand over my mouth. I pretended to pass out and he took me with him. I planned to scream when we walked near somewhere that was lit up.
