I was in some TV studio just before time for the 6 p.m. news.  The guy who was supposed to do the news hadn't shown up yet, and they were looking for someone to take his place.  They liked my voice, but I had the feeling they wouldn't let me do it because I was bald.  It was about 3 minutes until 6 when they began scurrying around trying to get someone.
