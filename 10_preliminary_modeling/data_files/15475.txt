Foxtel had heaps of music channels. Some girls had been watching TV. Ezra and I took the remote and I saw something on Jean-Luc Godard. I said to Ezra that he wouldn't like it. The girls changed the channel, but I had the remote so turned off Foxtel. They left and I put it back on. The music channels played You Spin Me Right Round and In Dreams and I said 'ooh! Roy Orbison!'. They also had Electric Light Orchestra and OMD stations and sound bites from A Fish Called Wanda. Mom said she wanted to get another dog and I joked 'is Rover not good enough for you?'.
