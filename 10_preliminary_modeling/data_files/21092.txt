Ernie, Bill, G.G. and I were laying brick with a machine. All you did was push it and a row of brick was laid. Bill and I went into a basement for a drink. I took a cup and he had glass. We came to a small statue, the Virgin Mary. I tipped the image and water poured out. I washed my hands and Bill said, "Rusty water is coming out." I tipped the image back and the water stopped and the image started to sing. The mouth opened as a human being. This seemed to be like an evil lair. I saw images and they planned to get me in their clutches. I was in their territory. I started to run and there were images in my way to block me, but I fought my way thru them into safe territory. I was in Rivertown. I looked at the coke ovens, which I left about 27 years ago, and I could see them so clear. There were a few new buildings by the ovens. I looked at Arenda's house and I looked at #155, our house. There was a beautiful girl standing by the window and she gave me a smile. I thought I left that town 27 years ago and I became nobody in all those years. I was sad. I had a rubber doll that had a beautiful figure. It was an image of the Blessed Mother. Ann was covered with a plastic cover that you could see thru and she was nude.
