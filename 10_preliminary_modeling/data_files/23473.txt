I was at work and just heard that our newest employees were being laid off. I was upset about this. Then, I was with my mother and we were eating lots of different rich foods. Then I was with Ed and we were running from the law for some reason. I had Sunday (my cat) with me and we were in my car which is older and white so its pretty distinctive. We are driving towards the country to find Ed's cabin to stay in. We stop at a county fair to get some ice cream. The cops are there looking for us already. I am just walking around like normal and Ed is really mad at me. But the cops don't notice me because I'm acting normal and so they leave. We start shopping for different clothes.
