I am walking through a beautiful restaurant, white table cloths, lots of lovely, happy people, a pleasant undertone of people talking. I think, "How nice that the inn is finally working up to its full potential." I am digging worms out of the fur of cats and stuffing them into a small hole in a box. It's yucky! I turn a light on, a white round globe like my bedroom light. It stops them from escaping and gooily wriggling around on the floor. A white cat doesn't have any worms. He sits in my lap at the inn very contented. A man says, "Oh, I didn't know you loved the cat." He kisses its ear. The cat purrs. A happy scene.
