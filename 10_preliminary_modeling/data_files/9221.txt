I was working on an excel sheet. There were many rows of data. One row was a category column. I was going through, line-by-line, making sure the category was correct for each line. There were many errors. Some I had to really think about to figure out what the correct category would be. [This seemed to go on for a long time. I would partially wake up, go back to sleep, and continue the work. I know it was for a company, and it may have been ITI. But I sense that it was two distinctly separate dreams.]
