A group of people compliment me on my good work on "Barb's Follies," and nonchalantly tell me they would like me to create another one on June 5...3 or 4 days away. I call for volunteers. No one shows up to help me. I feel frantic and put upon. I voice my disapproval but still I try to do what has been asked of me. Rhonda comes in. A group of nurses are around a table (or park and rec students). One says to me, "Do you have a zip lock sandwich bag?," and then realizes I wouldn't because I'm not one of them. I'm disabled.
