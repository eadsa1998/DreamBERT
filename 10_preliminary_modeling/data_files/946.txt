Something awful happened to the Earth. I see oceans, no land. I'm like flying overhead looking for a place to land. I see some coral reefs peeking out of the water. I think about landing there, but a huge wave comes and sweeps over it, so I go on looking. Finally, I see mud flats. Then I decide to live on the water. Why not? I build a house on a raft. It's square and tight (compact). I have furniture. I realize that someone, a man, is coming to find me. He's from the other side (a war hero maybe)? I hide in a closet. He comes in and looks around. I watch him through peep holes. He senses where I am and opens the closet. I crouch down in a dark corner; he feels around and finds me. I am angry at him. "How did you guess? How did you know I was there?," I ask. He points to the cloth covering I used to camouflage the door. It was wrinkled. I straightened it out. He thinks I'm a criminal (being on the other side), but I know I'm not. I'm snotty to him, uppity. He sits on the couch. I start doing dishes. Then I put on boots to go outside on the raft. There's something out there. It's a pet, but scary too. I realize (again), that I must wear foot coverings because of possible poison things I could step on, but they've been stolen along with my can opener and other survival, important items. I go out pretending my bare feet are covered. I look out over the water. It's cold, deep, and dangerous. A white with black trim whale or dolphin slides up to raft and squeaks. I smile, I like it and I'm afraid of it. Then I go back in. Next we are at a party, on land. I see the man that had stolen my survival items. I ask him to dance; he doesn't recognize me. As we dance, I charm him and then look him in the eye and tell him the bad thing he did to me. He denies it and backs away. I decide it doesn't matter. I let him go. The man (who found me), has watched and now understands the difficulties I have had to struggle with and appreciates my courage. I feel aloof and independent.
