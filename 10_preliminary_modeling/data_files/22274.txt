I had left Lima with S. (a girl I was very much in love with a long time ago) going to Piura. We expected to get there hiking and each of us had equipment. We got to Trujillo and I decided to go see the Chan-Chan ruins. There we found a common friend of ours. He suggested we climb to the top of the ruins (many people did this, helping themselves with a rope). I said alright and we started to climb. S. stayed below, looking at us. We were about halfway up when suddenly I stepped the wrong way and caused a huge stone to fall. Terrified, I looked at where S. was and saw that a little girl was next to her, watching us climb. The stone fell in between the two of them, without hurting them, and left a huge hole in the ground. I felt uncomfortable thinking of what people who were seeing my clumsiness must think. Later on I was in the park in Trujillo and I saw B. (a girl with whom I flirted recently) going by on a motorcycle with N. (another girlfriend of mine) on the back. I saw them turning a corner and went behind them, leaving S. I arrived and tried to talk to N. B. was silent. Then a boy who is a classmate with whom I have a very strong and reciprocated feeling of dislike came over and hugged N. and she was very nice to him. Then I understood that she was his girlfriend and felt disappointed that she should have chosen him, of all people.
