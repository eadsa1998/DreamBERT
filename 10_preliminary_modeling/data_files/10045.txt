We are riding in a car near a sandy colored beach It is hot and I want to swim; See a woman in the water up to her knees; Frank touches her thighs, I slap him playfully and send him to an old woman who will give him lessons in KINDNESS and MANNERS. "But only 2 lessons," he says. Then she also hands him some KEY rings. -- Wendy returns and gives me a round basket with HOLY WATER, BLANKET and MIRROR. I see a black kitten jump out of the basket.
