I was climbing mountains in Japan-now with Jim Duggan, now with my wife Bonita.  We had one last one to climb, and it was too steep.  It was green, but not wooded.  We were about halfway up and afraid to go any farther.  Someone said we should go back to Tokyo and go up the other side of the mountain.  So we walked along the side of the mountain, along a boardwalk like the one above the St. Lawrence River in Quebec City, until we came to a ferry or a subway, which we took back to Tokyo.
