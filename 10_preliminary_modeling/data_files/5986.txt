Under a dark night sky, I am sitting outdoors at a large, popular music concert with a group of friends. The seats are the overly soft, somewhat worn, but very comfortable chairs that are found in many old movie theaters. My friends and I are all sitting in the same row listening to the music, which is very loud and is being perfomed by the "Mammas and Pappas". Their song intoxicates the entire audience. One row in front of us some people stand up and sit down to form a "wave". This wave is carried everywhere and I feel the chair I am sitting in rhythmically rise and fall every few seconds, as if it were floating on a sea with real waves of great height. This is a pleasurable thrill, a joyous release, and I am ecstatically carried away in the motion of the chair, the loud music, and the happiness of everyone around me. This physical high lasts for quite a while.
