I was at a small cinema. People from Red Dwarf were there. Someone said to a waiter how Rimmer hid. Ezra and I went in and it was a "fake alien" story. There were people in seats. We hid in the seats with Rimmer. I was sticking out and realized Rimmer was doing the same. This alien came and took him, but left me and Ezra alone. They pulled his pants down and raped him. It was funny though (it was an episode of Red Dwarf) and we laughed and he just stood up afterwards and pulled his pants back up. He had a serious, but sad look on his face and I was thinking he was a really good actor.
