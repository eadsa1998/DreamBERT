I was at Granny's old house. It was a bit dilapidated and very different. There was a door that had never been opened. Granny and Nana came and Ezra and I had to climb a wall to get in. We had to find dolls. Nana and Granny finally came up. There was this new shop. Gramps appeared and everything went black and white. There was something about Christopher Walken.
