Two salesmen are trying to sell a red, bow necktie to a middle-aged man. The 3 of them stand before a large, rectangular mirror, the prospective victim who faces squarely into mirror in the middle. The salesman to left, who wears a tie exactly like the one he wishes to sell, has hold of the customer's tie with is left hand, evidently to shape or adjust the bow. The salesman to the left is facing slightly to right; the salesman to the right is facing slightly to left. The red tie of the customer is not visible but its counterpart on salesman to left can be seen reflected in mirror.
