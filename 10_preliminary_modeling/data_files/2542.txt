A man is concerned because one of the women pilots has been kidnapped by the 11,000 slave girls and taken away. Another woman says, "Oh, my!" The man says (I think) that he doesn't mind it being women, whatever people want to do, but the drugs (stuff) is very bad. We have to rescue her. The woman thinks that's going to be hard. So the man goes to where she is, sneaks in and tries to seduce her. We, the audience, are watching the love scene like we're watching a steamy movie. He kisses her, very sexy, and we love it. Then he pops his penis in and the feeling is so good. She pops up to sitting. "Wow, made me sit up and take notice," she says. Then more steamy kisses. A woman says, "I don't mind, but boy, was the beginning part good!" Now they must escape. He sees an airplane outside, these huge, open glass doors. They make a break for it, but it turns into an older man who laughs and waves a book at us. He's got immune status and so we can't hurt him and he doesn't have to help us. We veer off into another building. They're closing in on us. (I'm the man now.) I see some rolls of TP and say, "Thank goodness." I grab a lighter out of my blue overall uniform and start to set it on fire. The bad guy is nearly upon me. I turn the flame on him and he keeps coming at me. I keep the flame on him at full blast and he gets redder and hotter, and finally, a metal button hear his crotch gets white hot and he's in extreme discomfort. I know I've won because he's going to burst into flames and I'll get away.
