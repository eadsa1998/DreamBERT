We seemed to have an atom or hydrogen bomb dropped on us. We were exposed to it, but we laid down for a while, then came to and moved around, the strongest of us. I started to fly around, then there seemed as though a hurricane came. It was blowing down everything. I saw a large spider close and it seemed to be blowing with sparks of fire, but I seemed to be mighty, but it didn't seem to bother me. It didn't seem to move me. I was standing on a small bridge looking into a small brook in the shore. I saw a green snake, then a larger one, and about 10 snakes, each one larger than the other one. The largest one was about three inches in diameter. I put my stick near him and he bit at it.
