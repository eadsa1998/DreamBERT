I was at a zoo.  There was a bullfrog there that could jump really high.  I took him with me when I went to have lunch with Bonita.  She worked less than half a mile from there, and they had picnic tables outdoors, so the employees ate outside on their lunch hour.  They had been able to see the frog hopping up and down from where they were; I don't know whether I knew this before I brought the frog, and I don't remember how they reacted when I showed up with the frog.  That they could have seem him from where they worked was interesting, because of the distance, the fact that he would have had to jump really high in order for them to see him over the clutter, and the fact that he was in a cage when I first saw him.
