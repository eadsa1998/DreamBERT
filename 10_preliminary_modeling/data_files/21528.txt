I was in Dill Mfg. Co. I saw about 5 or 6 new machines they brought in. They had only the table and not the top. I inquired if we had to furnish them. I meant the tools on the machine, and was told no. Then later they had all the parts on the machines. John Sarino was shaking the front slide showing a lot of play in the slide. Ed McUnis was having open house, so I asked Kolesar if he had his address, and he gave me a piece of paper with his address on it. I had on a white shirt without a necktie and I very seldom wear a white shirt. I saw Pro as winner. I was in Frank's home and he had most of his window ropes broken on the window sills. I drove off without Ann, then noticed she was not with me. I drove back and she was waiting for me.
