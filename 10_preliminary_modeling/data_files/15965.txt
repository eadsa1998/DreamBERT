I can't remember where I was but I heard Frederick say 'your girlfriend's in there' and saw he was talking to Fletcher which annoyed me. Fletcher asked about his stuff from the Philippines and I said, about the watermelon seeds, 'there's only two bags' and I gave him the shirt and he put it on. He didn't seem to get what it meant. There was an episode of Extras where Andy had told this guy he lived at this beach resort and the guy wanted to see it. I was there with him and it was Dad that lived there but I had a pass to get in so I let him use it. There were two sections of the place though, one was really posh and fancy - which the guy assumed Andy lived in, and the other was where Dad lived which was just basic accommodation. The room was small and it was just one room for everything and was basically just a bed. Later it was just me there and I went on Dad's computer to look for something and he had all these porn sites up and bookmarked and it was just all over the place. Then I was somewhere else in someone's room. I was friends with this guy who I liked, but he had a girlfriend. Something happened and he was saying something about who he wanted to marry and she realised he was talking about me and she was just like 'you want to be with her, so be with her' or something and left and then I didn't know what to do, but I was happy. At some point I was riding on motorbikes with Frederick and some other people.
