 There is a firing of guns occurring. There are two groups of people. It's dark out, with some lights around. Some of the people have knives. I have a knife. There is a lull in the firing, and I get up and walk towards the other group. I'm in some danger of being shot, but not extreme danger. There is no reason for me to have been shot at earlier. In the other group is my friend Jose Ramos. I get to the group, and it is light out. We fire guns at a man to use the rounds of ammunition up. We don't try to hit him, or we try not to hit him. There is a belt-like pattern that I see. It is a target, and I shoot to add holes to the belt. There is a bill, from or to Brimson, that I see and show Jose.
