I was cleaning up a room. There were lots of boxes and junk all over. Someone interrupts me, wanting me to be on their side. Some big guy with policemen and tough guys on his side was harassing my side. I stood up to him, feeling afraid. My friends were afraid and hung back. I insulted him. I said he only had one ball. I chanted, "We're winners and you are losers."
