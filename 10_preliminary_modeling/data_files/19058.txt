The name Toveson figures in this one. It's the name of an institute or a university in England. It reminds me of the Tavestock Institute. I think I'm reading a newspaper account of some kind of a power struggle between this American scientist and an English scientist. The English scientist has a job now and the American scientist is rumored to be going to get it, and it's because that he's giving six hundred and eight million dollars. He's a privately wealthy person, to the institute. The newspaper account is saying this poses an interesting problem for Toveson because this American does a lot of traveling. It's a time-honored rule at Toveson that no one ever leaves when they get there.
