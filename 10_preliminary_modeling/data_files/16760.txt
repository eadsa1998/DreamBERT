I'm possibly at Plainview High School, but I think I'm somewhere else, with friends from that school. There's a game we're participating in, possibly under Ponson's supervision, and the only person I remember being there is Eva. I remember being in this group and wanting to win. I also remember talking too much (not really too much maybe, just lots more than everybody else combined). I'm on a computer, in a building that looks a bit like a bar, on the QRS campus. Someone online (or maybe even "physically," dream physically) lets me know she "needs something". I don't remember what it is, except that it's a file for her computer. I find a game installed on the UNIX server, and I realize what she wants would be in the game. Next, I'm in my cellar, except there are about 4 computer terminals along the wall with people at some of them. I see someone is online and gets off just as I log on. Now one of the computers is empty, and I see that the person (I'm not sure who it was) I wanted to talk to had literally "left the room". I'm disappointed. I think I'll try this again a little later. This time I see a girl sitting at a computer next to me. It's Kerry, and she looks beautiful. I put my arms around her and we dance. Then I want to go to my bedroom to "make out," so we walk upstairs. I think the stairway is a little dark, but by the time we get to the top, she's turned into my brother, and I'm very disappointed. I want to fly out the window, but I don't want anyone to know I left. I see the air conditioner is in the wall and I don't want to make a loud noise taking it out. Also, something told me that even though I was dreaming someone might be able to tell I wasn't in my bed. I convinced myself that I was dreaming and my physical body would still be in my bed.
