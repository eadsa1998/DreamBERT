I am a young (18 years old) swimmer on a team. I am very good; I'm Olympic material, in fact. My coach and I are falling in love, but aren't yet to the stage where we can speak about it. I am jealous of his attentions to another young woman. I swim in a race and lap all the others. I am so good. In fact, I beat the male champion! I then show the governor's wife how to stand properly on the thing that we start the race from. My coach says, "So that's how you get your strength. No one else uses the stance that way."
