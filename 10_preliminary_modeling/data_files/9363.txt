I'm in a railroad yard, new to me, and a strange engine is on the ground beside the tracks. It has skis on front (making it look like a large snowmobile). The drivers and wheels behind are normal. They lift the entire engine up in the air with a large crane, slowly. I'm standing and watching and have one hand on the high rail and a right foot on the lower (impossible; well, that's dreams). I scream and pull out by fingers and toe of shoe before being crushed. The skid in both places is flexible so I escaped without injury. The engine, safely on the tracks, is oiled by a lazy guy who seems to oil empty holes and nuts and bolts that don't need the oil. No interest in his job at all, as if in a trance. The engine then goes up an (impossible) incline to check the power on inclines. There is an iron weight, pear-shaped, with pointer on end and a dial from 1 to 10. It is on 4 when dream ends. It's all very exciting to see the engine at a 45 to 60 degree angle up in the air on the rather flimsy rails.
