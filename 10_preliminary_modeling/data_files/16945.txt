Myself and several of my friends (Terry, Ralph, Reece, Saul, Tyler) and my brother, as well as celebrity chef Jaime Oliver are on a stag-do in a tropical jungle. We're staying in a hostel or a hotel. People are complaining about the hot temperature, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. Ralph and others keep warning about giant insects but I haven't seen any. The highlight of the trip is a 'jump' from the top of a very high hill, which slopes downwards gradually until it falls away allowing free fall. Somehow we can control our jump just with our arms and 'fly', which means we can stay off the ground by gliding, as if we were flying hand-gliders. Ralph is very accomplished at this technique and leads the group, flying the furthest. I follow just behind. Some of the others (especially Terry) struggle.
