 I'm in bed in my room at home. There is a window that looks out over the roof. The window is to the south of where the window actually is, but is still on the west wall of the room. There are two men with guns on the roof that look in at me. I pretend I am sleeping. When they are out of sight, I get up and run outside to try to find them. They are gone. I run around the house in bare feet looking on the roof. It is summer time. There is a brown station wagon there; different than the one we used to have. I think I might be dreaming, and I attempt to fly. I fall on my face. I keep running, and try again to fly with a strong will to fly. I start to fly. I go up in the air and try to maintain lucidity, but I lose it. (164 words)
