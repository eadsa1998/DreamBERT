I am looking for a cat. My family and I are in a big house. We come away with 4 cats and 2 puppies. I have a white full grown but small cat in my arms. I'm petting it. My brother Dwight has puppies. My father, driving the car, turns and says, "You're going to have to give them back or pay for the food yourself."
