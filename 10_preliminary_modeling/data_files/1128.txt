I'm at Mabel's house. They have offered to let me live with them for awhile. I'm trying to look up the name of the class I'm going to register for. I see "Side Role Stereotypes" and "Marriage." I can't find the right information. I get angry at her for offering to help and then not being any help. I say, "Huh! You said you could offer me alternative veggie foods, and a non-smoking, caring environment." She shrugs and looks helpless. Her husband comes in and says, "I've got a job in Bermuda. Let's go." I groan, "I have class. I can't go!" He says, "Well, go to your class and come later. Just drive there, but be sure not to take a boat. Of all the places where you take a boat, this is the one you shouldn't." I am surprised one can take a road and drive there.
