I dreamed I was walking home from school, and as I passed by the apartments used by the married students south of Dixie Highway, I saw Elaine Furst. (She is the wife of one of my classmates and they live in the mentioned apartments.) I said hi to her, and how nice it was to see her for I hadn't seen her for some time and how were she and A.J. (her husband) getting along? She said that things weren't going too well for them (personally) and that they were probably doing to be divorced. I sympathized with her and we went up to her apartment. We were sitting on the floor nude talking to each other, and I was still listening to her problems. I told her how sorry I was for her, and I kissed her gently on the cheek without touching her anywhere else. Later some people came in and we were all sitting around on the floor talking and listening to the stereo. It seemed to be a party of sorts. I was sitting near Elaine and how I wanted her physically. I moved up behind her and embraced her and kissed her on the neck. She didn't repulse my advances, and I began fondling her breasts. She showed no response and ignored me. I felt frustrated and woke up.
