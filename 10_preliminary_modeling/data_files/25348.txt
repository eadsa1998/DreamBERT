 There is a man being pursued. He'll be beaten if he is caught. It is medieval times. The persecutors have horses. The man flees and he can evade the people chasing him. He climbs a tree. I am now the man being chased. They are climbing after me. I think to myself: Who will win the major league baseball Most Valuable Player Award: Frank Thomas or Tony Gwynn? Gwynn is batting .390, but Thomas is batting .340 with 110 runs 140 runs batted in, and 40 home runs. Thomas' stats are conceivably Triple Crown numbers. So, I decide Thomas, hands down. I am not really worried about the guards that are chasing me. I jump off a branch and run away.
