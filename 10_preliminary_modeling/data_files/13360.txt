Will Arnett, but I don't think it was him, and I were going out. It was the future and we were walking. Police were around and we tried to avoid them. We went into a backyard, which was paddock like. Will told me that the first time we met he'd actually bashed this guy beyond necessary. I knew about the guy already as Will had stolen something from him. This guy came and told Will that there was a job for him. He'd get $900 and $600 for something, in August (which was next month). We left. We met with Mom, Clayton, Dad and others. Someone asked Will when it happened and he asked what. They said "got hitched" and he said "I'm never getting hitched". The person said "Oh, you're girl-kept". We were at this place and there were heaps of movies. I saw Battle Royale there and there were two different covers. One had all the people on the front and I looked for Shuya and Noriko, who I found. The other was random and had a female cop on it. I chose the 'proper' one and Mom was going to buy it. These people were in Paris. There was a gigantic bad guy who was throwing cars and stuff at us. My tooth was hurting.
