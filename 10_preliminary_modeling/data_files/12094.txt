Mom was looking after us. I told her we usually leave for school at 8am. When it was morning, I asked her what time it was and it was 9.34am. I started yelling and she said that I used to always be late for school. I said that I wasn't going to go to school. The next day, at school, people were painting rooms, including myself. Some teacher told me to tie my hair back. I said no. Evelyn was doing some juice advertisement. There was two of her. There was an assembly for Year 9 and 10. The amount of people only looked like the size of one year. The school was bushy and was on an island thing surrounded by water. Mom picked me up and I had to climb down a ladder.
