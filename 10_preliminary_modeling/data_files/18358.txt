The dream took place in Germany. I was helping the Jews in some way. It seems they weren't allowed to carry metal on the streets, except for watches or cigarette lights or something, occasionally some tools. I was getting some metal to them somehow and some little gadget also. I can't recall exactly what this gadget was except I think it was some sort of thing that produced heat. I don't know whether it was some sort of a weapon that produced heat or whether it was a heater for the house or what.
