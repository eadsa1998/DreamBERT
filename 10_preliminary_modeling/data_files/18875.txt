I'm staying a week at a friend's house (Aubra Helen Shiftner Caroline), and I'm going to take some drug associated with the number 258-658. I'm watering plants and there are shoots of evergreen next to the house. They're very dry. Then I'm moving a car, and there's some connection with "socialism." My mother is watching. I back one car up cutting it sharply. It hits another red car very gently, but I think to myself this is alright even though the side of my car could be creased because it's socialism. The other car is my mother's. It's all by itself and rolls slowly across the street up a slight incline, turns around and stops in a perfect spot. Another car comes and they start squirting water from a hose because the car is empty and driving by itself. I have a feeling of putting Body English on the car by remote control and being a little amazed at how successful the Body English seems to be since the car stopped in a perfect spot.
