 I'm at a boat landing with a fat boy. We're putting a boat in the water. There is a long line of people waiting to put their boat in. The fat boy keeps giving me rope. We need six ropes to get the boat in the water. I cut through the crowd, saying excuse me, while I wind up the rope. I say excuse me to twin girls named Mira. I get to the boat, and the fat boy isn't there. There are two women and a man in the boat, which is on the beach. I push the boat off and it promptly sinks. I think it is too heavy. The names of two of the people in the dream are Donna and Dennis.
