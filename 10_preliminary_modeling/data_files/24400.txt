I am an adult, and I am wearing a long white silk dress. I have brown hair in a bun. I'm sitting down, and I have a screaming baby in my arms. I have a feeling of kind of like wonder. The dress had a red sash. It was really pretty. I think I had a strand of pearls around my neck. The baby had a little bit of hair, and it was wearing a white dress. The baby was very young.
