I was at home out the back, around the side of the house. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) had to go somewhere and he went down a toilet. I was really upset. A little while later, I was in the big shed and I was doing a spell to get him back. He came back and looked pretty annoyed. But it wasn't because of me because we started making out near the wall across from the shed.
