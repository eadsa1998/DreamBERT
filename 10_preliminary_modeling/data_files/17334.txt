There were ghosts.  A young boy and a girl.  Siblings.  Their father was a very angry man.  I was to take the girl to school.  I had to get dressed, but couldn't find what to wear.  I had on black heels.  It was too risky to take any of their mother's things, despite how elegant they were, the blacks and reds.  I was led into what would normally be my brother Stuart's room, where the girl's things were stored.  She handed me a knit/crocheted type dress.  It was, of course, incredibly short on me, but apparently that was okay.  We were in a rush.  I had to teach at the school.  I went to get the keys.  I didn't know if I was taking my mother's new car, or mine.  Mine was old looking and rusted.  I took my mother's.  It was evil.  My mother and Stuart and I were standing in the kitchen doorway to the living room.  Stuart argued with us, and my mother seemed to be angry or uptight as well.  We had some green blob that we were throwing at the car to calm the evil in it- kind of like spraying the glop in the Statue of Liberty in Ghostbusters two.  Stuart was infected with evil, my mother probably was too.  I threw globules at all of us, and we continued throwing it at the car, still in a hurry.  I went out to the street where the car was parked.  The steering wheel was on the passenger side.  It was not a new car.  It was hard to control.  I had the brake with my left foot.  The accelerator responded far too easily.  I forgot the girl, and took off.  I was driving from above, going that speed, watching the curves in the road.
