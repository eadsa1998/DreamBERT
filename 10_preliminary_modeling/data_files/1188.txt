I am in a horseback riding class, for beginners. I am learning to gallop. At first, I bounce around poorly, but I quickly gain expertise and leg strength. I enjoy galloping and I try to race with others that have more experience. I run around and around the race track and win. Then I am aware that in order to win, I had to make my horse work very hard. I take my horse back to the barn. I get food and drink and a brush to rub the horse with. The horse is very grateful and I enjoy making it more comfortable. After all, we're a team. I can't win races without her.
