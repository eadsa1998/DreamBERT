I was awaking, I said 4 if C8R. I was taking bottles out of cases and I saw a case of pop. The name was Chit. I was home and my pants ripped from the waist to the cuff on one side. I put on another pair of pants and the seam came loose and they were open down all the way like the other pair. May Schneider was sitting on our davenport with one of her children. I looked at her and gave her a smile and she gave me a nice smile. My dad came home and said he was working in the post office and made $10 for 5 hrs. work. I had a dream of Ernest Koelpin, but I can't remember what it was about.
