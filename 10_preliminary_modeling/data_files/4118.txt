I am tired and decide to go into Ginny and Ernie's bedroom. I lie down in the big double bed. The door opens and Rigo comes in and gets into bed on the other (left) side of me. I am uncomfortable. I then open my eyes and look around to see that now this is Rigo's bedroom. He has a group of miniature furniture and objects he either makes or collects. I ask him if they are the 1:12 ratio. I then see most are not. They are cute and I admire them. Ernie comes in. I am thinking I should get up and go lie down in Ginny and Ernie's room. I am very tired and unwilling to move.
