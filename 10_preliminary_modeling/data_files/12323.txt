We had an excursion and we were on a bus. Seamus was there. Dmitri got on and sat near me. I was then at this place which was different from what we were actually supposed to be doing. I had been late to school (I had had a premonition) and I didn't get lunch so I text Mom. I was hanging with Seamus, Dmitri and Calvin. Some girl was running on these stairs.
