It was a wintry night and the highways were slightly slippery. I had a girl with me who was about 21 or 22 years of age. I did not know who she was. I drove up a hill until we reached the top. At the top of the hill I turned the car around and started back down the hill. About halfway down the hill I lost control of the car and it went into a skid. At the bottom of the hill several cars were parked beside the road. I was thrown out of the car and the car landed on top of the parked cars completely demolished. The girl was unhurt and the dream then came to an end.
