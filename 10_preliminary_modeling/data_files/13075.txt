I was at some school thing. I was looking for Eugene. Ms Newberry said my name. There was a room with cakes. A couple of girls came in and they picked a dress and they got the corresponding cake. There was some game thing where you find one coin alone in it's year. The bowl was almost empty, so I went through it. There was rabbit poo in there too. The window opened and this burglar came in, I was like 'what the hell?'. Someone made them go through the poo.
