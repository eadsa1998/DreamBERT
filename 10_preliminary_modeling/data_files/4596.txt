["Sorting used clothes for charity."] Patricia is running a charity where we have racks of used clothing to sell. I am helping her to do inventory. She is teaching me how to do it right. She shows me a pair of old corduroy white jeans with a frayed hole in the butt. She tells me to write exactly what I see on any tags or labels. I see a company name and an address and some numbers. I ask if I should write it all down. She says yes. Then I comment that some of these old clothes are mine. This pair of jeans, for instance. She says I like these jeans. I say so do I. Then I suggest she cut them up and use the material in something else. She likes that idea a lot. She is getting creative ideas about what to do with the material, maybe make a quilt. I go to the end of the racks lined up along the wall. There are hundreds of clothes jammed on these racks. This will be a long job. I begin to do the work.
