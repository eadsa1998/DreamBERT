 I am fishing in my boat. It is nighttime, maybe very early morning. The stars and moon are brilliant, and the horizon is a pink glow from the rising sun. I don't have any lights on my boat. I know I've been to the lake before, but I can't put a name on it. The shape of the lake was odd. The lake was calm. I am trolling backwards to my fishing destination. My hands dangle off the back of the boat, and I am holding a tube of Clearasil. I drop it, but it floats. I turn the boat around to pick it up. A big bass jumps ahead of me and to the right. I see it. It was floating near the surface of the water, looking almost dead. Its head was near the surface and its tail submerged. I trolled over it. It was a monster largemouth bass, at least 10 pounds, absolutely huge! I was going to reach in and grab it by the mouth, but I didn't and it swam away. I am then in a stream with clear shallow water, and it is daytime. I'm trying to hit the fish with an oar to kill it, but it quickly swims away.
