["Beautiful Music."] I am playing an instrument that is sort of a cross between a violin and a guitar. I am intuitively flinging my fingers around and manage very quickly to create beautiful music. The frets are broken into three sets of areas that create different octaves of sound. I am very pleased with the music. I smile.
