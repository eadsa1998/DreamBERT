My 15-year-old sister did not return home from a date until 10:30 the next morning. My mother refused to punish her and I was furious. I berated her, but was embarrassed because a Mather girl, whom I know slightly, was visiting my home. She began to telephone her boyfriend and at this point my brother with numerous strange boys entered the house. I then found myself talking on the phone to a Western Union operator who told me that someone had purchased a leopard suit and expensive purse for me. You wanted to know if I knew of the purchase and if I thought I ought to accept it. At this point I woke. I remained resentful toward my sister as this was the most vivid part of the dream.
