I was downstairs in our family room and I was working on some project. My rats were running around loose and every once in a while I would try to catch them and put them away. They were running around through clothes that were on the floor. They never went into any other room or into the holes under the counter, like they usually do (in real life, not in a dream). Setting: In my house (my real house), in the living room with piles of clothes on the floor. Characters: Me and my rats were the only people and/or animals. But if I hadn't been woken up maybe there would be more people. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I was worried that I wouldn't get my rats back when I tried to catch them and put them away.
