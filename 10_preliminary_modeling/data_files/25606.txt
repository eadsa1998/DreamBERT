 I'm in Alaska with my friend Norman Noman on a fishing boat. We're cleaning fish. There is little or no time to look at the beauty of the land. Norman and I are swimming. I have a knife. There is a lot of vegetation in the water. I see and come close to white-colored flashes in the water. Norman says these flashes are all muskies. I hear a very loud noise. Norman says it was a bald eagle. I don't see the eagle. The water gets shallower. It flows into a storm drain and into a ditch. A couple of small fish and a good-sized northern pike swim into the ditch. I go over towards them and they swim back into the shallow water. I throw my knife at them, but don't hit them. I'm at my friend Nate Nelling's house. Nate is not there, but his mother is. I tell my roommate Stephen Ramos not to touch Nate's father Walt's new motorcycle in the garage. There are some fishing poles there.
