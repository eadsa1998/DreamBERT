["Uncaring distant people."] I am in a huge gymnasium. A man and a woman are walking across the floor. Their cobra is with them, slithering with her head up high and hood extended. She is huge and impressive and scary. Now I see the man and a woman sitting together on the top bleachers. It is night and they are sleeping. A metal basket with a lid sits beside them maybe a few feet away. Inside that is a huge cobra. There are electronic red lights flashing on the lid. There is a mean man out on the gym floor the snake is afraid of. She stays inside the basket even though it is overheating and she is dangerously overheated. The couple decide they want to make love. There is some hesitation because the snake is near, but they decide to do it anyway. Later, I am on a couch on the gym floor with this cold distant man. He is going to stimulate me to orgasm. He impassively sticks his finger up my vagina and moves it around. I concentrate of the feeling and go for orgasm. It is devoid of loving feelings. Now I see some disk jockeys in a room. The man is one of them. He is lying on the floor writhing around in emotional agony. Silently. Another man says well, it is better this way than if he screams. The door suddenly opens and the cold man's father, "Big Daddy" comes in. He gives the man a left over peanut butter sandwich, even though he just came from a sumptuous feast himself. He then hands him an old pair of his pants, way too huge for the man. I use red thread and sew some stitches on the waistband to try and make it a better fit for the man.
