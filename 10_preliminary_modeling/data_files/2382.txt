I am shocked and sad. Howard's arm got amputated in an accident last night. I am carrying his dead arm around for him. I sit on a couch next to a man and feel the heavy dead weight of Howard's dead arm across my shoulders. I pull it off and behind me trying to ignore it. It is in the way. Jerome is around and I am attracted to him. I need to pack things up and put them in my van. He offers to help. I agree. He goes and I decide to change clothes so I'll look more attractive to him, but it doesn't work because I look pudgy, overweight. I'm getting tired of dragging around Howard's dead arm and besides it's getting rank by now, rotting. A woman says she put her dead father in a box. I open it and look. The father is still alive, with white hair. His eyes move. I feel sorry for him and help him out of the box. Howard, with a missing arm, comes to the door.
