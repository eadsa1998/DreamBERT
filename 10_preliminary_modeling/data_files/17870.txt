I was getting on a sort of Subway train, trying to get home.  A cat got on at the same station with me.  She wasn't extremely bright, and had to use the litter box.  I told her it was at the next stop and got off with her to show her where it was.  I had to hurry to get on again before the train left for the next station.  I almost missed it and thought, "Oh well, I'll get home 20 minutes later" but the train operator waited for me.  I got off at the next stop.  A man sent his cats to attack. Several black kittens approached, scratching at me.  I collected them all and started keeping some sort of notes on the belly of one.  Then I tossed them back over the fence toward the man, but I realized I'd made a mistake and wanted to keep the notes on the one whose belly I wrote on.
