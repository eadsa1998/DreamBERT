 There is an NBA Banquet in a large building in a city. I can go. All the players are there, including Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, and more. My brother Wally, Pat Keiser from my economics class, and I go. You have to dress up. My truck is in my neighbor Gary Stein's yard. My dad tries to start it up, but it doesn't work. I try, but it is already running. My dad must have gotten it started. I pull it out to drive away. A man gives me a ticket for a traffic or parking violation. It is bogus. I go into the kitchen and yell at this man angrily for being subjective. His ticket observation was subjective. My dad is driving. We're going to Redson to the show. My sister Ramona sticks her head out the bathroom window and asks when we'll be home. We are leaving at 10:00 am. It takes an hour and a half each way, plus the time spent there. I tell her we'll be home late. She is worried.
