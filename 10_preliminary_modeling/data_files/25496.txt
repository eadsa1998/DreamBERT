 I'm with another man, who may be Han Solo. We're in a vehicle that rides low to the ground. We are in an area where rocks and drift wood cover the ground. It is foggy and hazy outside. The sun is rising. The man I am with urinates. We drive. We're low on gasoline. There is a rocky shoreline. Near the shore are pirates in boats. We get near them, and we are attacked with guns and knives. I kill many pirates by cutting their throats with razor blade craft knife. There is a competition between two men. One of the men is tall and fat. The other man is smaller. The larger man is stabbed with a pen in the jaw or neck, stabbed with a knife, and cut with a razor blade. The man is unaffected. A vacuum sucks out a lot of the larger man's blood. He is unaffected. The smaller man is scared and runs. The area in which they fight is a v-shaped channel with water in the middle and metal on the sides. The large man writes two columns of lines. One column is entitled "winner", and the other "losers". Next to the column of winners her writes Manleys, and circles it.
