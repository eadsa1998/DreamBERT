I'm an Asian man. My woman has run away and I'm running to catch her. I hear a siren behind me and wonder if I'd done something wrong. I'm on a narrow sand spit with water on both sides. As I get out there, I see a violent teen boy coming at me and I turn to run back. I have a bag (black) with a baby, a crochet hook and a gun in it. He stops me and I know I must protect the baby. I reach in for the hook, to give it to him in appeasement and I clumsily let him see the gun. We grapple for the bag and I grab the baby out and throw the bag into the water. I step on it to make it sink faster and huge air bubbles escape. I feel fear, excitement and a sense of being trapped for a moment. I fear the baby is in the bag. The sand spit now is a deflated air mattress and my floating is precarious.
