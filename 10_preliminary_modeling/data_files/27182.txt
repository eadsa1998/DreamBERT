I was out in a large field with no trees or houses in sight, and I was all alone. Suddenly it got dark and a wind came up and it began to rain very hard. I remember I was in my pajamas and I was so tired that I lay down and went to sleep. Then I dreamt that I woke up in bed, and I did wake up in bed.
