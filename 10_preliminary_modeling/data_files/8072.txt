It was Wednesday and I was sitting in the living room, eating dinner while watching TV. Matthew came in. It startled me because I wasn't expecting him home. He had a laundry basket in his hand. He said, Hi mom! He told me that one of his friends was coming home that evening so he decided to ride along to come and pick up his car. I think his friend's name was Doug. I appreciated this because that would keep me from having to drive up to get him on Thursday evening and bring him back to get his car. After he walked out of the room I realized I was sitting there without a blouse on, so I grabbed a round laundry basket and held it up in front of myself and went upstairs to put a blouse on before Matthew realized I had been sitting there like that.
