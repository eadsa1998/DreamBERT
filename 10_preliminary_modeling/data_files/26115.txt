 I'm near my neighbors the Trammells garbage cans waiting for a man, who may be my childhood playmate Andy Jones, to come so I can seize him and make him pay for something he has done. My mom and sister Heather walk down the sidewalk of Home Avenue in front of Sand's and Roman's houses going towards First Street. There is wet and sticky snow on the ground. I make a snowball and throw it at the snowman that is near the front yard of the white house across the street from Roman's house. I hit it in the head. I go home where I wait. There is snow in the boat. It must be the first snow of the year. I think of getting a tarp from the garage and covering the boat. I walk in the garage and it is very warm there. I think keeping the garage this warm is wasting heat: it's like we're heating the garage! I look in the pile of wood for a tarp. I find lots of old torn up rain gear but no tarp. At the bottom of the pile is my green Nike duffle bag, containing my brown hat, brown leather mittens, maroon University of Montana sweatshirt, and blue USA sweatshirt. I take the whole bag and bring it inside with me. A man is with me.
