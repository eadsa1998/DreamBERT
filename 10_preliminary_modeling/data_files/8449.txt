I went to NTNS. It was a house with hardly any windows on the front. When you walked in the front door there was a very large room. No cash register. No counter. There were a few racks with coats on them. They were having a sale. They were selling consignment coats at 40% off and other coats at 25% off. This made no sense to me so I questioned it two or three times. I asked to clarify because it made no sense to me. I thought this was par for the course with where they were headed with the shop. Then I saw a woman standing there taking cash. She had a little metal cash box. That was when I realized that they had done away with the counter and the cash register in the store. They didn't have many customers. Maybe just one or two at a time. Now I'm sitting on the floor with Jane H and Janet S. There are two pieces of furniture, like a chest of drawers and a bureau in medium dark wood. I said something to them about them working there. They said there really isn't much for them to do anymore so they spend most of their time just sitting there. I realized that they probably didn't enjoy that but wondered then why they would stay when they like to stay very busy. I didn't say anything to them, that I thought it must be hard for them to just be sitting around all the time.
