I was at a nightclub place, but it was more like a computer lab/classroom. The lighting was nightclub like though. You could choose 'buffs'; one of them was choosing a hair colour that would be attracted to you -- options of black and purple, black, red, blue, brown and others. I stroked my friends' hair to find soft hair. There was one girl with short/medium black hair. She turned and I said she had nice hair. We kind of flirted? I went through everyone else's hair, but hers was the best. I was supposed to find someone. I sat down at a computer and Joel McHale was next to me and was actually very Jeff like. We started chatting and laughing. I didn't know his name, but I found it out and searched for it. Pictures of him shirtless came up and we joked about it. Everyone got up to go outside and he put his hand out and I didn't know what to do. He said something about it and then we held hands and there was this weird 'connection'. Then it was awkward. I was at a computer later reading trivia about How I Met Your Mother. Alyson Hannigan was pregnant.
