I was outside at night. Someone said 'help me'. A teenage girl was trying to get out of a shed and she pointed to her parents. I saw this pointy thing with a handle. This guy was being dodgy and I poked him with it. He came and tried to attack me. He took it from me. Then it was like a Donkey Kong game and I said to Dad "remember how you had all those sheets of paper with cheats" and he was like "... no".
