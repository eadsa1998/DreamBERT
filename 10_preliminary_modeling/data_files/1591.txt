I am staying at Grandma Mildred's. I go to bed. Dwight crawls into bed with me and then notices I'm there. He's embarrassed and says, "Oh! Excuse me," and gets out of bed. Later, I wake to notice Uncle Dale is in bed with me. I remember my bad breath. It's o.k. that he's there because he's a relative. He lays straight and rigid. I'm careful not to touch him.
