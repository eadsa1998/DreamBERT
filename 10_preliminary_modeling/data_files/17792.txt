My boyfriend Jeremy and I went to see the new installment of Lord of the Rings movie at night.  Leaving the theatre we ran into our friends Celia and Jake.  Jake told Jeremy about a new cell phone plan that was only around $4 a month.  I was skeptical but hopeful.  I had a flashback about being in a dingy little grocery shop.  I wanted to buy a couple onions.  I took one to the counter and notice a foot-long earthworm sliding out of it, and it touched my leg; it made my skin crawl.  Someone came to my side and handed me another onion, this one with little crawling bugs all over it.  It was disgusting.
