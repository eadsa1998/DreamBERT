This really happened on TV, but it was in my dream. They asked this woman who was from Sister Act what was the first show she went to or the best. She said, "The Doors." Then I was remembering it from last night in my dream. It showed Jim Morrison singing. I was just watching this. Then this boy, who was a little younger than me, was driving a car, and it was swerving all over the road. So I said, "Why don't you let me drive it?" Then I started driving. I was driving a car around this road where there were all these branches. Then I was in this house, a tree house. It was weird. I don't remember who else was there.
