I had a dream that I woke up to go to school and I put my high school uniform on. I walked down the street and went into a store to buy a bagel with cream cheese. When I asked how much the bagel was the woman said something like six dollars and change. I gave her a ten dollar bill and she gave me back ten dollars and some change. Then I left the store to go to school. No matter how hard I tried I could not get to school. People were stopping me on the street and wanting to talk to me, but I kept saying I have to go as I will be late for school. After that my alarm went off and I woke up.
