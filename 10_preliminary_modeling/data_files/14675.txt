I was with some people, some of them characters from Entourage. I was with some guy who was setting up a sniper in a hotel room. I wandered out into the hall and I saw the guy next door setting up one too. There were some people in the hall. The 'bad' people came and knocked on the door. I ducked down (behind the bed, which was near the window). They came in and I got back up. We escaped or something and I only remember Turtle and they were hiding out in this place which was owned by a crazy lady. There was a small fire and it started to burn this car that Turtle liked. I turned the power off and saved it.
