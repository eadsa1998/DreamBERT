I was at this party. There was food. This woman, who was serving drinks, gave me something to drink. I tasted it. I didn't like it. Mom was there talking with some other parents. I was outside. Judy (8-year-old friend) from my school, asked me if I could spend the night. Her mom said no. She had another friend with her. The next thing I knew, I was knocking at Wendy's door. I knew it was Wendy's door. I don't know why. She answered and said, "I can't play. I have a stomach ache. I think I'm sick." I said, "No, I have the same thing as you, and I'm not sick." I came in. I had this little rope. I wrapped it around my waist. In Wendy's family someone died. Her mother didn't care about anything. She was depressed.
