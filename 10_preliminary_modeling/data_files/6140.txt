One time I was driving to the store with my mother. I was really young, about three years old. She lost control of the car and her seat fell back and she fell back with it. Her foot remained on the gas pedal. I didn't know what to do so I took the steering wheel and took the car for a ride. Then I crashed the car into a tree and it took me into a place that I had never been before. So I drove around looking for my house. When I couldn't find it my mother awoke and drove us home.
