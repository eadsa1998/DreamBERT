I was in two places with Kathy Reynault-both times with a lot of other people.  Once was in a locker room -- I don't remember why -- and one of the other people was Evie Marche.  The other was in an auditorium, where there was some kind of meeting going on.  Kathy was involved in it somehow, but I was more or less just a spectator.  I was sitting near her, and she was rather chilly toward me.  Sometimes she had her glasses off and I was struck by how different she looked that way, and how much less attractive.  I finally left, and she was coming in just as I was going out.  She was wearing her glasses, and was all smiles and prettiness and friendly.  I knew I had just left her inside, and I asked her if there were two of her-both in a physical and a psychological sense.  I don't remember her response.
