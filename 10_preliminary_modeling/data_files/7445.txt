Mary and I are going somewhere -- a short weekend trip -- perhaps to Montreal. On our way we meet a group of friendly soldiers. There are about 6 or 7 of them. They invite us to join them, assuring us that they will get us to our destination at no cost to us. So we join them. They take us aboard a ship. Once aboard, someone tells us right away that this ship will take us where we want to go, but there will be a one-day stopover at another place/city on the way. We are disappointed. Also, we feel out of place because everybody is in uniform and we are not. However, there is a swimming pool on the ship and we are pleased to see other civilians. They are the officers' wives and their children. I talk to some children while Mary quickly engages in conversation with the women. But throughout this dream I am worried about Mary's health. I keep asking her how she is and she keeps insisting that she is OK. I am wearing bathing trunks under my pants, but I never do go in the pool. I tease the children that I will go in the pool, and open the top button of my fly to show them that I do, indeed, have on bathing trunks. But I don't go swimming. At one point during the dream it is raining and miserable. This was just before we met the wives and children at poolside. There is a scene where we climb down a flight of stairs and traverse a catwalk or walkway that runs along the outside hull of the ship. It is via this catwalk that we get to the swimming pool.
