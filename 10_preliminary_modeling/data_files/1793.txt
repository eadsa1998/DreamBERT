I had bought some gifts for the girls and was dividing them up. They are on the couch in a pile. I can't find the rainbow gift I got for one of the girls. I see Indian beaded belts and things (red beads. The kids are playing and I go out to the sidewalk. A man (Howard) mouths to me, "What do you want to do?" I mouth back, "Let's go someplace alone." He smiles and goes into the house to get ready. One of the children is playing in a red parked car and I get in the car to play with her, but then she drives us away. I am surprised and say, "Where are we going?" She says, "To this other place across town." I get angry and say, "No. I want to go back. We were going to be alone." She just keeps driving. We stop at a store and I go in. She says, "Come on, let's go. I say, "No. I'm staying here. I'll find a phone and call him. He'll come and get me." She shrugs and leaves. I feel very brave because I could get stranded here. I ask if I can use the phone. A little old lady says yes. I can't find the phone number. I look and look. I ask her to help me. She can't find it either. The name is Ted Wright. I see advertisements for the Disabled Students Union in the phone book.
