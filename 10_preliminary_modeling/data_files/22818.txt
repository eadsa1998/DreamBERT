John Raye is supposed to come by and pick me up.  Pretty soon I hear a horn.   I look out the window, see a blue Oldsmobile, and know it is him.  It is 8 o'clock, and I'm not quite ready.  I hurry, but nothing seems to go right.  One problem is that I can't get my tie tied right.  The knot is too big and the tie is too short, and other things.  This causes a 20 minute delay.
