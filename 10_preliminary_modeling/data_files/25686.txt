 I'm bow hunting. I see two men wearing blaze orange from afar. They come closer and walk by me, not aware that I am there. I draw my bow and aim at them. I get their attention. They have live rabbits and geese. They are going to kill them. I make them let go of the game (the rabbits and geese). There are some pornographic magazines in the forest. There is a large magazine, several feet long, with black people featured in it. There is more pornography that is older, "tasteful" pornography: not as revealing. We leave, and may come back because my coworker Megan Hughes and her friends are coming. I want to go back and get the pornography. The pornography is of a party at my neighbor Alvin Broud's house.
