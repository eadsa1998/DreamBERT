I was at school at the summer camp California Summer Music, and first I was with my friend Kim and my other friend Leah-Anne in the pool. Then I was at a dance with some people that I didn't know. Then I was in a dark dormitory with my friend from camp, Mary. Then I asked for a flashlight and she gave me one. After I got out of the dormitory, I saw people sloshing around in mud. I wanted to do it too, but then my mom called me to come get into the car. We went to the mall and my mom had to get all of these things in 15 minutes, so they were hurrying. When she was finished, I woke up. Setting: First at school, then at the Mall. Characters: My friends Kim, Leah-Anne and Mary. Kim and Leah were wearing blue bathing suits. I don't remember anything else except for I was wearing a black dress with pearls on it, and under that a bathing suit. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, surprised.
