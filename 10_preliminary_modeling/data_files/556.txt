I am an observer, like I am watching TV. Some woman takes a handicapped lover (he has cerebral palsy). They have broken up before and she was with someone else. They are traveling somewhere in a car and another woman is disapproving about this attraction. Something about two men in a foreign country being involved in a business she is in and she learns this handicapped man is also involved. That was how she found this handicapped man again. They are now somewhere in a house which seems to be in my hometown. A huge lightning storm comes up and it looks like bombs are dropping on autumn trees outside.
