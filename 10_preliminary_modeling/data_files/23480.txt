I was in a house with my brother and sisters. We were aware that my mother's boyfriend had died and his funeral was going on. For some reason we weren't at the funeral but none of us seemed to care. His children all walked in the door and disappeared upstairs then a huge white hearse pulled up in front and my mother got out. The casket was unloaded and I thought she wanted us to say good-bye to Ned but it turned out my dad was in there. We were saying good-bye to my dad. Mom said there were two stones on his eyes to keep them shut but they were pastel M&amp;Ms and my brother removed them. Then my mother said the real reason for opening the casket was because my great aunt had died and she had wanted my father to have a necklace of hers so my mother was putting it in the casket. But I put it in and laid it in his hand and it wasn't my father any longer; it was my son, and he wanted to suck on the chain and I told him that was dangerous and to go back to sleep, I'd be with him soon.
