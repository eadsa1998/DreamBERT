I was at the train station and I saw Dan Palmer there. I was trying to avoid eye contact and to not get his attention, but he had seen me. My train came and I waited for ages and then got on. The doors closed a bit later and I was annoyed he wasn't on the same train, but then I saw him behind some people. He ended up coming down my way and was talking to him. I asked him if FrightFest started today and he said 'no, tomorrow'.
