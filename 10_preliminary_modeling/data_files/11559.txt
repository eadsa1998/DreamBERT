I had been to a party and was all dressed up. I was carrying an umbrella and wearing a derby. On the way home I stopped at a very tough tavern. I bought myself a shot of whiskey and stood at the bar drinking it. Right next to me was a big, unshaven man who orderd a double shot and said I would pay for it. The bartender said, "Oh, no," and took it away from him. I then took the double, passed it down as if it were water, picked up my derby and umbrella and started on home. A little further on I passed a beat-up old building that seemed to house both second-hand and new stores. I went in to look around. The first place I stopped was the sports department and looked at golf clubs, golf bag, and golf balls. The bag was an exact replica of the one I wanted, had a zipper all the way down and was big enough to cover me completely. Since I had no money I said I would be back. The owners, who seemed to be one big family, told me to look around. I went into the toy and fabric shops. Lastly I went into a beverage shop where an old man, head of the family, was making coffee. He asked me to have some and I said, "Yes." He was just making a mixture of different brews when I woke up.
