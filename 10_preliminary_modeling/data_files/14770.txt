I was watching Supernatural, but I can't remember it now. Then, Ezra and I were outside at night. Jared Padalecki was walking down a path and Ezra went running down there, then freaked out and went the other way. We laughed. There was a big net thing, which you could hang on (like in the army training). I was hanging from it and it was hurting my fingers, so I had to keep getting off. Jensen Ackles was on there with Jared. I was then at a shop with Mom and Ezra. We were at the checkout and she asked "want anything else?" and I said "just my other stuff". There was a small hole to exit the shop and I realized we wouldn't fit.
