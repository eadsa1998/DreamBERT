I knew Castle and Beckett (both from Castle) and I was on a case with them. This guy was suspected of taking an ID of some other guy. There was as pic of the other guy and they looked very similar and had the same mannerisms etc. We were in an alley near a house and Beckett went down with a gun and said 'show yourself!'. The guy was there with his facial hair shaved off. We were in a car and the other guy was in the back and he gave himself up and looked scared. Beckett and Castle had to go somewhere later and she gave me the report and asked me to see if I could find out how they saved it. There was a picture of a clothes rack and dress? I went to Alexis and asked if it was because the dresses weren't on the clothes rack and she said yeah. She seemed shaken by the case. We were staying at the old house. Mom and Darren were there and asleep. Alexis had a nightmare about a guy standing at the door. I told her it was safe and that I'd had a similar nightmare. She ended up freaking out and I heard a car start. I went to Mom's window and called out "Alexis!" but she was driving off. Later, she came back with cash. We got food. I said something to Beckett and she said no but that something was in the lab report. It said something about pushing the clothes rack but people had been pulling it?
