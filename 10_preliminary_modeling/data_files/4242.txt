["Working the dream in the dream."] I am in a house at night. I am trying to turn off the lights in an alcove, so I can peek out the window and see what's going on out there. I'm on the second story. The light won't turn off and I don't want to be exposed when I peek out. I try to look anyway, but can't see much. I had had a dream and I am excited about it. I want to write it down. It's an important one that explains what I need to know. So I am reading a book with many short chapters. One is entitled "Propositions." One is written by Rosie McDonnell. It's a sweet children's story of a dragon and a collie dog. I see pages of color illustration of the collie lost in the woods with his cute ears perked up listening for the dragon. It's a fairy tale dragon in the pictures. But now I'm in the story and I know the dragon is going to eat me. That's not such a pretty picture I feel fear. Now I am in my wheelchair going to a store. Anastasia is with me. I need to write the dream and I also need to read these articles in a newspaper put out by Julie Osborne about dreams. I fold the paper and find the pages with the articles but my eye is caught by cartoons. One is entitled, "Two Old Queens." Two women in 19th century dress, young and pretty. I don't get the joke. I find the articles and excited, I begin to read, but interrupt myself to write my dream down. I struggle to dig out the dream book from a bag on the back of my wheelchair. Then Anastasia goes into the store and a biker parks next to me singing a sad tale of his wife Lisa leaving him. I listen as I write my dream down. And apologize to his little girl.
