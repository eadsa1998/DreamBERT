The setting was a large dining room where many people were preparing to have what was supposed to be a Thanksgiving dinner. I walked into the room and was surprised to see that the platter of turkey was really a large bowl of noodles and sauce. What was so unusual was that they were spilling onto the table. I picked one up as I walked by and threw it back in the bowl. At first I thought I was my family Thanksgiving dinner, but I didn't recognize anyone. Then I heard a man speak with a Yiddish accent and had what people type as a Jewish facial look. [perplexed surprised, neither pleasant or unpleasant, no color]
