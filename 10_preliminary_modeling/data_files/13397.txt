I was at school. There was a sleepover and Mom had made me go. I had lots of rolls in my bag. Someone told Elana to see Genevieve. Then there were zombies. They were Return of the Living Dead zombies and I was hiding out in the science room, which was different, with Evelyn and Calvin. We got attacked a few times and killed the zombies. I went out to find weapons and I found pipes in some mud. I found Eugene and Darius and others and told them to go to the science room. I went back too and there was this other person there and suddenly they were like "Brains!" and I killed them.
