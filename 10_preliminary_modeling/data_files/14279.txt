This girl got possessed by some purple smoke [happened in an episode of Torchwood I watched last night]. She became violent and killed some people. We were trying to find a way to save her. She took over Gizmo so we wouldn't kill her. Some stuff she had tried to gather was in alphabetical order, but also with numbers and strokes. I was doing a study thing like the MUPC and I had special study guides which were for after highschool only. Mom was somewhere. There was a quiz to see which guy from something you were. Whatever I got, 85% of others got him too.
