Dad and I and Mom were at the park and he found this book that he wanted to read to us. Lo and behold it was this, I had made up a story in my head in a dream that was kind of in this book, if you know what I'm saying. And what it was, was a story about a lotus blossom, and it was this leaf that died and in the next life turned into a little branch, which died and then in the next life turned into a flower and then a bigger branch, and then finally a tree. And it was talking about the venerable tree and how there's different trees in different countries, and how respected they should be. And then in the very last part, a bird lands on this tree and the bird becomes the friend of the tree. And then after we read this book, we went home and I don't remember, but something, I was in the tub and it was going, "Fwaaaaab!" I don't remember too much more.
