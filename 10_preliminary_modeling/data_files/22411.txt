I was in an unfamiliar but pretty place. I was accompanied by two friends, Raul and Isaac. Freddie, my ex-boyfriend, had told Raul that he wanted to start a fight, but Raul had told him that that wasn't nice. Freddie had wanted to fight with him, because he felt in love with me and couldn't stand seeing me always accompanied by Isaac. Then I awoke.
