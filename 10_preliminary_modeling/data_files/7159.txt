I am taking some new medicine in drops and ask if I should take my regular medicine also. "Yes." I hunt for it among several small articles and packages of candy, which last I sample as I hunt. When I tell Miss W. I have lost the medicine, she phones to Dr. J. "That's not my doctor's name." His daughter answers the phone and the doctor is out. "I'll see my own doctor tomorrow and I can get the medicine then."
