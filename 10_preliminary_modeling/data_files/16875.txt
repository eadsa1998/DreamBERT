I was involved in a complicated web of litigation - the FBI were involved plus some dodgy businessmen and several of my friends. One friend (Karl) was in particular trouble, and I can't remember why. He didn't know any lawyers. The only help I could give him was to arrange to meet a friend of a friend for a drink. I hardly knew him, but he was apparently a powerful lawyer. He was in fact based on an acquaintance from my youth. He turned up with an entourage, and gave the impression he wasn't there to see me, but was friendly nevertheless in an aloof kind of way. As soon as I brought up the subject of the legal predicament, he went on the defensive, as if he was sick of giving out free advice, so I swiftly changed the subject. Karl was less embarrassed, and didn't mind bringing it up. So I went to the bar and left them to it. They were sat on a leather sofa against a painted brick wall.
