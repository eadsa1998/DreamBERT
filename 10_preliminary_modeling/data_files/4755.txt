["Magic moment in magic apartment."] I am a 30ish woman with a son. I meet this good looking loving fun kind man. We are outside walking around. The sense of humor, the camaraderie is intense. I like him and he me immediately. It is special and wonderful. He's walking me home. I want him to see my apartment. I open the door. It looks like a reception area of an office. A male secretary is there. I say good afternoon, walk through the small room to a door behind his desk. I open it and we enter a huge cavernous room where wonderful large wood carvings adorn the high cave like walls. A young priest is there and we talk. We are old friends. The man I like/love is good with my son. He's wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. He is interested in everything about me, including my magic like apartment. I say you have to see this . I push open a slim corner cupboard door. This is very important says my son. I push a lazy susan shelf and it goes around showing boxes and a china tea set. A couple of cups rattle as I push it around to show him. I have a tea set I say whimsically. There had been some jealousy between he and the priest. The priest is an old friend of mine. I turn and reach out my arms to the man. We embrace lovingly. It feels so right, so wonderful. The priest is disappointed and leaves. As we cling to each other, the man says in a love choked voice, I think I'll wear a white jacket. My son says "Whoa!" I freeze and pull back slowly. He is confused and says what? My son shakes his head sadly. I want to marry you, he says. I pull back further, very sad. I love him. I love being with him but marriage is impossible. He tries to back track. It's OK. No man, but the moment is gone. It will be over and I feel deeply sad. It had been so special and loving.
