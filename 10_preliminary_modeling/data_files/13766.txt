It was Thursday night before the chemistry test (last night) and Eugene, Jeremiah, Darius and sometimes Bradley were staying over with Ezra. They were in the lounge room playing GTA IV and I asked Eugene what mission he was doing. It was one that I had done and I told him that. He followed Ezra to Dad's room at one point and he looked into my room. Jeremiah asked me if I had studied for my chemistry test and I said that I had forgotten about it and hadn't. He said they had forgotten too. I remembered that I was having the day off because I was sick though. Mom and I went to the school to do something and when we were leaving Mom had to drag me out because I couldn't walk. Ms Braun helped her and they took me to the car. The outside was decorated for Christmas. Ezra text me asking about a movie. Eugene thought the movie was one thing, but Mom thought it was another. One was about a girl who was molested or raped or something and the other about some Indian and chicken. The chicken one (Mom's choice) was right. Tigger had kittens or something. I put them in her mouth so that no-one would know. Nana made sausage rolls. We were confused about something. Evelyn was in some group.
