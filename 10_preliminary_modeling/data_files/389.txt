I'm in a foreign country, maybe Eastern Europe, with a group of people - we're here for a LT, this country's first. Right now we're watching a movie, maybe in a bus. At least it's a narrow and short place, not a theatre at all, and we're sitting close together. I've been out, and come back to find my order has arrived - Elsa is keeping it for me - there's a big bowl of hot fudge, a wide shallow bowl [abt. 4" x 14"], it's wonderful, dark, bubbly, still hot; chocolate-chunk cookies [big ones like you get at The supermarket], I can dunk them in the hot fudge; and some other chocolate stuff. It's an awful lot, and looks extremely self-indulgent. I can share, but still I wonder what the others must think of this pile of chocolate... Later, we go to our hotel and have dinner - the rest of the chocolate stuff comes with me - in a dining room with a long table. I get up to go to the bathroom, my room is nearby; the room and bathroom are kind of bare, cheapish, sort of what you might expect in a poor country. While I'm there, the toilet slides out from next to the sink and outside, down the street. This is not especially uncommon, although it is disconcerting. I think I should put it back where it was. I'm now next to a park, on a broad street. There's not much traffic, but people I know are nearby, and I ought to go along with them, but I tell them I'm going to push the toilet back into my room... At some point I'm concerned about Tree's food, where I can get the right kind of kidney food that he needs. I only brought one can with me and I don't think that'll last.
