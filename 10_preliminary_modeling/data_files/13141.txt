Some black kid and his father were really fast. It was a TV show. The kid was talking to the bad guy and said "leave Dad alone". The guy kidnapped the kid and he was talking to the Dad who he could see on this screen. He said the kid could see him and his mother was like "he can't see anything" -- the kid was blind. He was also really smart and did this hard equation in his head really quickly. This guy had to pretend that he died. He had a son who was about my age and was kind of hot. He knew that his father was alive. This girl who looked like Katherine Heigl and the son were hybrids and so they couldn't breed. The 'dead' guy's wife called the son and she didn't know the guy was alive.
