Lucy and I are talking. She is concerned. I notice that a baby is in a crib, but the walls of the crib are down and she could fall out. She looks uncomfortable. I feel compelled to help her. I hold her for a while. Then I put her in the crib and pull up the sides so she is well protected. She suddenly feels more relaxed and closes her eyes to sleep comfortable. I go to find some videos to show George and we all decide to order up a video movie to watch for fun. I ask everyone if they want to do that and they agree. I feel guilty about leaving the baby unattended for so long. She may wake and need me, but these people need me and besides I want to have fun. I uncomfortably put aside my nervousness about her.
