["Paul McCartney and me."] Paul McCartney and I are somewhere, I don't know if it is outdoors or indoors. A wooden platform, like bleacher seating is there. It must be after a concert. He and I are talking, flirting. He gives me some pills to chew. They are drugs. I begin to feel drowsy and happy, and a little guilty. He begins to kiss me and he wants us to make love. I am fine with that. I like him, I feel honored as he is such a famous guy and I like his music. I know this is a very practiced and normal thing for him and he will go away after it is over, but I don't care. We lie down on the wooden platform and begin to make love. Now the scene shifts to my business. It is after we've made love and I go in to see how things are going. I talk with a male employee. I then see that Paul McCartney is still there, still liking me. I am very surprised. He is staying with me. I am pleased.
