I was in NYC and was hungry; I went walking and found a store I liked and ordered two steaks that looked red and tender, lettuce and two carrots. I sat down beside the counter and ordered a meal--restaurant and market combined. The meat on my plate was good--lamb chop in shape. I opened the paper of the two steaks--shaped like T-Bone or large pork chops. All fat-tallow except a little lean on one side, and only in spots there. I call the waiter over and show him. He shrugged. I talked loud--almost yelling--and the man came from behind the meat counter. I said, "This is what I expect from you in NYC." "That's OK," no longer angry.
