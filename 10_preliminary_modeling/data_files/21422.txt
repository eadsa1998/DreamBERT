I was out in the field and I was breaking up grass with my hands, and I was eating grass. A girl brought me some of the sweet grass and I ate it. We had another baby son. I held him and thought to myself he would be 8 when I would be sixty. I had a hard-on. I was proud of it and was showing it to a lady as it trumped and stretched. It was night and I went by a shop window and looked in and saw a man working.
