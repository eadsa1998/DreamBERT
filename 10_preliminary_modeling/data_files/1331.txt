Bonnie and I are on a vacation, traveling. We meet this nice guy who shows us the backwaters of a lagoon. The water has debris and stuff in it like snake-like plants floating in it, etc. He says, "It used to be cleaner." We go to his cabin on the other side to visit. He gets food out, an egg, etc. for lunch. He and I like each other. We laugh and joke. It's fun, camaraderie. Bonnie gets sick. I sit with her and say, "If you were counseling someone who complained of pain like you do, what would you tell them?" I was trying to get her to be more objective. Then there is a big parade, with lovely Jamaican drums. I enjoy the beat. One of the gloats has a cook making spaghetti with hot sauce for Bonnie. I see Bonnie in the audience. We are sitting in pews. A woman says, "Wait, your turn is next." They bring the next float. It has a wedding cake on it. They announce sugarless cake for the guy and myself. I am pleased. I ask what they substituted. It was honey. I start eating. Mabel takes some of the honey away. She doesn't want me to eat too much at once and get sick. I remember eating honey on bread and not getting the irregular heart beat. It is really delicious. Co-worker Tyler is there, talking. Then I'm in a class. I choose a book of Elizabeth Taylor to analyze myself with. It's a study of contrasts, she's beautiful, successful, rich and sexually active... I'm the opposite of all that. There is a poem on the blackboard, something about zoo zoo's and I am trying to figure out the connection to me.
