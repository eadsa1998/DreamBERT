Wendy G (childhood friend) was in a swimming pool, as a young girl, cleaning the leaves out of the pool, and she got in trouble.  I think I was a young girl in this part too, and others, maybe my sisters.  We were all swimming at different points, or by the pool.  Some focus on what it's like to get in trouble as a child.  It hit Wendy hard, getting in trouble.  Then buying a sweater with Erin P (current co-worker), she tried it on, it was striped and had green in it.  It didn't look good on her.  But some focus about her figure, very womanly, large breasts, how they look in a sweater.  And there was a guy in the store, or from the store, paying attention or flirting with us, finding us in different departments.  Later we were at an IMAX theater, and that guy wanted to meet up with me later.  At some point I was in my black long dress too.  Either in this dream or on 10/9, I dreamed of Allen (high school friend), we went to meet his new lover, and Allen lived in a really wealthy house, brand new, we were impressed.
