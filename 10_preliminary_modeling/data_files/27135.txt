Two men, neither of whom I had ever seen before, were talking to me in a small, bare room. One was an oriental, and the other was a very normal looking white man. They told me I had my choice of deaths. Either the Oriental could stab me now, or I could go home on the train, and the other man would shoot me in the station. I took the latter choice and I went into an adjoining room where my cousin was playing cards. I told him the situation, and he promised to find a car that I could escape in. All through the dream I was afraid but calm.
