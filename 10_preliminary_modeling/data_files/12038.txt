I went back in time with two guys and a girl. She went in a cave and found her dead grandpa's grave. A grandpa of mine in the future (ie the present) was looking for generations of his family. Then we were somewhere else and they had this thing where you had to walk on this rope to get across the water. One of the guys looked like Jack Lemmon, and he and my other friend started singing. I found some videos and photos of me when I was little. There was this scary green dude in the basement of some old lady's house.
