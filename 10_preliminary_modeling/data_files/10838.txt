Glancing into the bathroom mirror, I was horrified to see that one of my bottom front teeth had a wedge-shaped crack in it. I reached into my mouth to examine it more closely and discovered it was extremely loose. As I tugged on it, I accidentally pulled out my entire lower left jaw bone. The teeth, however, remained in perfect order inside my mouth. Calmly I washed the blood off the jaw bone, which incidentally resembled that of a parrot beak calf whose picture I had noticed the day before in my genetic book. After the bone was clean, it very definitely assumed a different color and shape. It looked as though it were now made of pale blue painted wood, half my own size, and shaped like a rod about 1 inch diameter twisted around and around in loops. Tied to it was a piece of blue satin ribbon. I remember feeling very guilty about what the dentist would say when he found out I had removed my own jaw bone. Then the thought of how angry my mother would be occurred to me. Therefore, I folded the blue jaw bone in half and hid it in my closet. I knew that the dentist would have to pull my teeth since they were not held firmly in place by the jaw bone. So once again I reached into my mouth and ripped my bottom teeth out all in one strip. Again I washed them off with water and noticed with surprise that they were filled with tarnished copper--not silver at all. I was also amazed when I discovered none of the teeth had roots, but instead were held in place by little copper plates. Again I felt very guilty. How could the dentist fit me with false teeth when I no longer had a jaw bone? Suddenly I looked once again in the mirror and found with great relief that all my teeth were back inside my mouth. I remember thinking to myself that all this was only a dream and soon I would wake up. No words can express how thankful I was when I realized in my dream that it was only a dream.
