 I'm near a CD player, which is between the tennis courts and the biology pontoon parked next to the courts at Brimson. My classmate Robyn Masters walks by wearing blaze orange. She has been deer hunting. I kind of want to talk to her, and ask her about her hunt: to be social again. She walks by and I say nothing. I gave two CD's to my brother Wally. The CD's belong to my classmate Lexi Mondragon. I have three or four CD's to listen to, but nothing really good. There is a white plastic pipe underground that my housemate Stephen Ramos has drilled through. He stands and talks with some guys. I tell him he won't be able to fit through the hole he drilled.
