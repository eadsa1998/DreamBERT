I was on this big hill thing during Phys Ed. A little pit bull chased me down it. While we were in the Phys Ed room, Julius was in there watching me. I dreamt I was talking to someone then Julius looked passed me to a girl (who was me) and a guy talking. Then I thought he had read my diary so he could make me jealous of who I liked except that it was him.
