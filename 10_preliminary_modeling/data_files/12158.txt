I got a video of 'The Murder of John Lennon'. It was different from what actually happened though. It was all real video and everything had been taped. There was a part of the movie about these people from the future. One of them was bad at math, but was good with decimals. They knew that he was getting killed on 8th December at 8.00pm though it changed to 10.00pm. They were out partying and they got reminded of saving him ten minutes before it was going to happen. John Lennon was taped talking to people after he had just got off a boat and it was daytime. Then shown was John signing Mark David Chapman's book to 'Peter Milk'. Then he came back later and one of the people there cried out "Look out!". He mumbled it as if questioning it and then turned around to see Chapman standing there with his hand in his jacket. It was cold and you could see their breath. He pulled out a gun and said "I may be gay but you are great," and as John turned to run he shot him and he said "I'm shot," and collapsed on the stairs [when he fell the camera was actually him falling, like in A Clockwork Orange when Alex jumps out the window]. The stairs he collapsed on came down upon each other and John got squished. By the time, Yoko Ono and the others got there he was long gone. His feet were sticking out and the last part showed Chapman going through files about him. I was watching it with Mom and our eyes were both teary. She went away and I watched it again. I was really upset and crying. Mom said "I understand but get over it". [I woke up from this dream crying, and was really depressed for the whole day.] Later I was somewhere else and this dude asked if anyone liked any celebrities that had died before we were born. Mom said "She [me] does!" and he asked me when. I said "Ten years, four months after August 7 1970" and he couldn't work it out. He was the decimal dude.
