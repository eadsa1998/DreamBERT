I was in a school cafeteria and there were a whole lot of people waiting in line for food but there wasn't a whole lot of food available. All they had was this weird pizza that tasted like cotton with a little bit of tomato sauce and cheese on top, and some really delicious looking hot dogs. I'm a vegetarian so I'm wondering if I should go for the better food even though it's meat. In another part of the dream, I'm laying in bed with my cats and there are rats running around on the floor but my cats don't seem to mind. The rats want to jump up on the bed and cuddle with the cats and me and I feel like I may as well let them, that it will teach me something about tolerance.
