I went for a drive. Ezra and Mom were in the front and I was in the back with Roland. When we got back later I watched a movie. Then it was 6am and Ezra came in and said we were going for another drive to see someone called Dawn and Roland came again. We went to a house and I said "that's new" (about a gate at the side) and Mom said it wasn't and I said 'yes it is, you used to pull up on the grass there'. She thought and remembered it was new. We talked about pickle sandwiches and Vegemite.
