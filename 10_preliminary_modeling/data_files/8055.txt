There were mice in the apartment. Along one of the walls I could see the hole and I could see them coming in and out. They were different colors. I was surprised, actually, that I was not reacting to them in the way I would have thought I would, being that aware of mice in the house. I didn't seem as frightened or put-off by them. In waking life I am extremely edgy around mice, rats, and snakes.
