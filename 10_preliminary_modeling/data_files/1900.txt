I see Willie. He is deciding to live or die. I am taking pictures of him with my camera. He hops and makes hand gestures and then he runs excitedly across the street to my van and pulls out a large registration card that has my name and some numbers on it. It also has huge letters that say "SNOB-NOSED" on it. Then I know he has decided to live. [BL]
