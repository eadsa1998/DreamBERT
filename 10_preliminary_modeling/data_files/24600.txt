One day I went to school and the school looked normal, but all my friends were wacko. Meg acted like Aitara. Cara acted like Amy. Jean acted like Jessica. Then the next day everyone was wearing fancy red clothes. I thought something was really wrong. I was getting worried. Then someone told me it was spirit week so I felt better. Setting: In school. Characters: I can't/don't know how to describe Meg, Cara and Jean. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I was really worried when I saw everything was wrong.
