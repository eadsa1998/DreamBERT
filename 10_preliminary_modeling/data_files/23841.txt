I am working with others at a job.  I recognize things from Amwest, but we are working in a big warehouse or blue collar surroundings, dirty, garage-like.  At one point I am thinking about stealing from them, there is money sitting out, but I don't want to right away.  I think, maybe later.  There is something about the computer drives, the g drive, I am telling someone the different drives.  I am not too happy here, frustrated or disgusted with the way things are run.  At the very end of the dream, I see this guy sitting at a table by a window, and a troll-like monster behind him is pulling his face around to the side with its claws.  It's really tearing into the flesh and pulling hard.  The skin is tearing away and blood is coming out.  The guy can't get away.  I'm looking and thinking the monster will just snap his head completely to the side and break the guy's neck.  I have no feelings about this except the monster should just finish it off.
