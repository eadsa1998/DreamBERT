Last night before I went to sleep I was watching a TV program about the final episode of Friends. This dream was kind of an extension of that special where they were continuing to interview the actors and writers from the program. In particular they were talking about how some or all of the actors may reunite on the spin-off program. One thing in particular that I remember is that they should all reunite at Thanksgiving because on the program the six of them always spent the holiday together.
