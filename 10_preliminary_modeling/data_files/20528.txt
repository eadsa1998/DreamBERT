I was a hospital patient going to the dining room. I had no shirt on. But I saw one on the street and I put it on. At the dining room, the patients were being served cafeteria style for the first time. I sat by a heavyset woman, and we talked about the change. A patient (resembling a patient at the hospital named Zambella) came, and was nude from the waist down. He tried to hide his nakedness by walking across the floor in a squatting position.
