Something about a trampoline.  I was at a tan site; it seemed like some of secured, perhaps chemical processing facility.  There were pipes running overhead.  I was collecting some green chips or flakes, and some small red crystals.  I was going to use them to make some sort of drug that I had used to use.  I had gone back and forth across the facility several times, having to sneak a bit.  Then I was in my room, and I held the two shallow boxes (as if perhaps for a bracelet) of the chemicals in my left hand- I was trying to conceal them, as my father was standing in the hall talking to me, and I didn't want him to see my drugs.  Someone else..I think my brother Stuart was in the room with me.  He was trying to help me distract my father by pointing out the large insect (bee?) flying around the room.  Then I was back on the other side of the facility or campus.  A man in an old car was trying to sell '5 long-stemmed ___'- some cocaine form of cigarettes.  A girl on the other side of the street was wavering, considering his offer.  I internally urged her not to, and I was relieved when she tossed a basketball through his window, no longer considering the offer.
