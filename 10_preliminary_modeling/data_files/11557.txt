Riding along a highway in a friend's car (Loren, some town friend) to play a game of golf. Just after entering a fairly long straight away of an S curve we see a car approaching us at a terrific rate of speed. Just after it goes by us this car tries to pass another car at the time another car is coming along. The result is a terrible crash with the passing car getting squeezed like an accordian and the car on the left hand side having its side bashed in. No remembered damage to third car. Knowing full well that unless someone warns the people coming up from the blind curve that there will be more wreckage strewn along the road. Just as I started down the road the state cops came along. Evidently they had been following the speeder. A police helicopter hovering overhead ordered ambulances and other police to the scene. Most of the people I slowed down swore at me first until they learned what had happened. From the screech of tires, everyone was going too fast for the curve. There was also a bridge just after the curve. There was a lot of damage and quite a few people injured. The police drew a diagram of the scene of the accident to have us furnish proof of what happened. The three boys in the car that caused the accident were all young. Only one had a driver's license and he wasn't driving. What happened, I don't know. Woke up just then.
