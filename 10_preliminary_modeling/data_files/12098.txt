I was at this place with Calvin, Jayson and some girl. This guy came and Jayson found these astronaut-looking suits. The girl picked red tracksuit and black over the top. The boys and I picked all black. This guy came and he thought we were the proper 'astronaut' people. He believed us, until he asked me how my 'Dad' was, as he was sick. I said "Uh... yeah, I dunno," and then he got his buddies and they put us in this car. We got transferred to another car, and Dad was driving it. Jayson didn't sit in the car though, he held onto the door from outside. When Dad stopped, he jumped off and ran, but Dad let us go too. Calvin and I left and we ran and hid behind these trees. But the people saw and took us again. Then we were at some place with water, which had evil fish. These people would call someone out and they had to stay in the water and get back to their spot to win, or if they got bit 5 times, or 20 times, they could get out. I got called and I got bitten. At the end, someone random would get thrown in to die. Some person pointed out some Beatles stuff, so I went to look at it. Dad got a job as a design person at school.
