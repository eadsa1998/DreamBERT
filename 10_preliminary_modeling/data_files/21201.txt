We were traveling seeing sights. I drove my car on piers or boats and I paid 25 cents to take my car. One of my tires seemed to be off the rim. I tried to get it on and had a hard time doing it. Then there was a stranger's car on a rack. His one tire was off the rim, so I gave the car a little start backwards and forced the tire as it moved and the tire went on the rim. The car went backwards and I sort of held it back so it wouldn't hit another and, and it just bumped the other car a little.
