I was watching Monsters Inc. with Ezra. It was totally different and was also a musical. The little dude was sent to a place where they were keeping these aliens. The aliens looked human. They had been there for a while. The big dude came later. The little guy would hide out in rooms, but they could see everything anyway. Then I was there in a room. I threw a letter and something else away and straight away there were replacements in the mail. I walked past some pregnant ladies and babies. They said they sent them out, but killed them. Calvin was there. We were trying to plan an escape. This young kid called out to an alien and then hid behind some people. I went over and pointed at this brown-ish kid and said "it doesn't feel like [name] or taste like [name]" and poked my tongue out. They laughed and the people in charge were satisfied (that I was one of them, or whatever). Then Calvin, his 'cousin' (who looked like Dewey), and heaps of others and I were on a bus. His cousin looked like a raccoon because everyone was in makeup and dressed up for a play or something. We turned the corner and he fell on me. We had trouble getting back up. I saw a poodle. Then I was somewhere else with Ezra. Dad took us to Granma's to tell them we were staying with Dad.
