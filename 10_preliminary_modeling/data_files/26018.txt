 I'm with my friends Nat Miller and Tom Napper at the Wilmerton Hospital. We're in the maintenance shop. I'm fixing a phone. Part of it is sticky from a glue-like coating. I set it up to let it dry. I wonder if it will be in anyone's way, but Nat says the only person coming through is ___(I forget her name), the night cleaning lady. We leave the shop. I see my friend Kevin Simpson, who has really short hair. He works at the hospital. To have some fun, he leads us down a stairway to the basement where we exit out of a garage door into a parking lot area between buildings. We need to shut the garage door. Tom is close to it, but is too short, so I go back and close it. Kevin leads us to another building for which he has the key. Five security lights go on outside the building as we approach it. We scramble for cover, but not too frantically. I lean up against a wall to get out of the open. Tom runs away. Kevin, Nat, and I go into the building. We go up stairs and down hallways, just running around. We see security guards coming in their cars. It is now the daytime. I'm in front of the others. We scramble down stairs. Kevin directs me, but I don't know all the doors. We get to the first floor and go out the door on the other end of the building. We decide if security catches us we're going to say we're friends of a friend of a friend. We walk away, and go by huge tree stumps that are tan and white in color.
