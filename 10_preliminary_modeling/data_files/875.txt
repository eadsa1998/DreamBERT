I am having an affair with Pedro (dean at the community college). We are sitting at a luncheon table. I am in my wheelchair. I drive up to the table and my foot petal gets caught on the leg of the table and I cause the whole table to move. I am embarrassed and get wide eyed and cover my mouth with my hand. Someone named Mitzy gets squished a little and I ask her if she's all right. I have to go teach a class. Somehow, everyone has found out about the affair and I'm embarrassed. I decide to cancel my class, so at 3:00, I won't have to meet Pedro. However, I had ordered some books and they had just come in. Paulina and I go to the gym to get the books. The gym is in the same building as my class, so I sort of sneak in. I ask directions. I find it. I start looking for my sack of books. I see some needlepoint and I think it's mine. A lady comes up to me and asks how she can buy the books. I say, "Oh no, these are ordered. If you take some books you are taking them away from others." "Oh," she says, "I didn't know." Paulina and I leave. There is a big vicious dog, a German Shepherd with teeth barred. We run and get into the van so he can't get us. Some man in the van laughs and says, "Ha! So you think he's vicious, huh? I can handle him." He opens the door. I plead with him not to. He goes out there. I'm afraid. I shut the door so he can't get me and Paulina (the dog). I notice the keys are in the ignition and I feel a little safer. Pedro is with us now. Then a lady says she's going out there. The dog's been tamed. I plead with her. She goes. I hear the dog attack her, and rip her to shreds. Later, the coast seems clear, so Paulina and I scramble out of the van and into the building for safety.
