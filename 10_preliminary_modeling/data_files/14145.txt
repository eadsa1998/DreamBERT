I was in a motel. It was stormy. We had two rooms. There was a bunk in one and two single beds in the other. There was some loud thunder. I went out with Mom. Later she ran away from me so I chased her. We got to some trees and she stopped. We had to get inside because there was a bad storm coming. Eugene and his mother were there. Something was happening to her. I tried to bring her to the single room so I could share the bunk with Eugene but she went to the bunk. I asked some people for help to drag her. I got a chocolate thickshake from McDonald's, but it was strawberry. I was at a shop with Dad and we were trying to decide what ice-cream to get. I decided to get 'Chest of Nuts' but then the shop closed on us. They said they'd give it to us if we came back before Saturday (it was Thursday).
