I was at a restaurant with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Dad, I think. Spike was eating a bloody piece of meat. I think I was a slayer. This girl came and we started fighting. She held Spike at the wall, holding a stake at his chest and I told her not to do it and ripped her off him and told him to run. She had others with her. I ran out into a big shop. I ran into the stairwell and bolted down. I think Samantha was the girl? Someone was eating a hamburger on the stairs (I was above them, looking down). I ran out onto a floor and hide under the escalator. They were looking for me. She turned off this fountain they had inside. I then ran the other way. There were no shops with anything I could use as a weapon. I ran into a wedding shop. She followed me and we fought again. I asked if I could finish writing in some dreams before she killed me and she agreed. I text Calvin, saying "weps and camera. 20 mins, bush behind bride shop. Bring like 20 people". Outside, there was a bush/forest thing. I ran out the back door and hundreds of people were coming through the bush -- all the people Calvin had gathered. I ran in the direction they were heading. I got there and thanked Calvin. I realized I didn't have my phone and I went back and found it. There were teachers from last year there. Eugene's car pulled in too.
