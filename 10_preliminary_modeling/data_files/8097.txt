I was sharing an apartment with a woman named Sharon. She was getting ready to go out one evening. I was going to be staying in. She had been trying different outfits on. She tried on a suit, pants and a jacket. She asked me if it looked appropriate. I said it did. I told her it looked great. I thought she was going to meet a friend, I don't know if the friend was male or female. She leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek when she got ready to go. I thought it was odd but I kissed her cheek in return. After she left, I ordered a large pizza for dinner. I ordered a large so I would have leftovers for other meals. I took off most of my clothes because I was getting ready to do laundry. My pizza was delivered and I was ready to start my laundry. Sharon came home, very early. Her parents and her brother were with her. I was embarrassed because I didn't have many clothes on, because of the large pizza, and because I the apartment seemed a mess with my laundry out. I was grabbing up my clothes and said something about it all. Sharon was telling her family how wonderful she thought I was. I think I asked her if she was just saying that because my birthday was coming up on Wednesday. She said no. I don't remember what I said next but she said she was 61. I couldn't believe that she looked as good as she did at 61. I would never have guessed her to be more than mid 40's. It seems that there was something about romance between her brother and I. I don't know if she wanted to try to get us together, if he was interested in getting together with me, or vice versa. Just not sure.
