["Testing my employment capabilities."] I am at a Voc rehab office being testing for my employment capabilities. Lots of other people are there. Some paper and pencil tests. Now I am taken to a kitchen like office to demonstrate my skills abilities with homemaking jobs. I see bottles on the counter. I open a bottle or two and am told to find rips in a seam of a lace and cotton curtain. I find four or five of them. I attempt to sew one up by hand. She says you seem to be doing well. I say yes, but I have a travel now pay later plan. I am already starting to hurt here and here, pointing out some painful places on my hands. Now I am walking to another room on a narrow line in black open toed high heels demonstrating how well I can walk in heels. I point out that I will be hurting later. I show her how my foot slides over the edge of the shoe at the toe. I say this happens all the time. I seem to be going from one test after another of my physical capabilities.
