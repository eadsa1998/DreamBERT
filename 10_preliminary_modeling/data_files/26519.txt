 I'm in a van with a group of people. We're driving to go hiking. There is a leading man driving, who is a bit older than the rest of us. I sit in the passenger seat, which is on the left side of the car. The man drives fast sometimes. We follow cars very closely. He slows and stops abruptly, and I am nervous about his driving. We're driving in hilly/mountainous country with windy roads. We arrive at the spot we're going to hike at, and I know I've hiked here before. We walk a little bit. A dog runs up to us barking and growling. I'm afraid to be bitten, and I seek shelter through a door. The dog is then a bear-like creature. It stands on its hind limbs and dances with my cousin Rich Redding, who is in the group. The bear seems to be friendly.
