I was with a group on an excursion thing at a place similar to Hillary's. Once I got in, I realized I had no money. There was a drinking fountain with cans on it, so I took a handful after a guy friend I was with urged me to. I bought a ticket with 50c pieces. Then we went to this thing for water. I gave a $2 coin to the lady and said 'that's $2 a night' and she looked at it and wondered. She saw that it had some Olympic thing on it and she asked where I got it. A tracking thing said it had last been used at their water fountain. I said I found it on the ground. She started questioning me and said I needed to go talk to someone about it, but I ran. They chased me and I climbed over a fence with those sharp circular things and got to my car. She chased me down the freeway, which was very busy and different. She got pulled over by the cops as her car had 'stolen goods' in it (which they were going to use as evidence of my crimes), so she got caught and I was let go.
