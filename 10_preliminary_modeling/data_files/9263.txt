I had flown to MC to do some pre-event planning with Lara D. I was supposed to also meet Ben B. The three of us were sitting in a dining room and bar area. I was being very quiet, not saying much. Lara D noticed and asked if I was okay. I told her I was fine but was just extremely tired because I had not slept in twenty-four hours. She had suggested we do just one more thing and then call it a night. Lara D and Ben B went to do something and said they would be right back, but they were gone a long time. I was just about to go ahead and go to my room for the night when they came back.
