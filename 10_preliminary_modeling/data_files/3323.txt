I am in a room and there are alien beings in human form. They capture me and put me in a room to lock me in. My young boy and younger girl are with me. I see many bright yellow ripe bananas on the floor. This will be our food. I go to a window because I hear the sound of a monkey, apparently being enticed there by the bananas. The enterprising monkey opens and unlocks the window. I have a way of escape. The male alien comes in and I stand in a way that hides the monkey. I don't want him to know I can escape. He leaves. I now gather up papers on the floor and find one with money paper clipped to it, odd denomination bills, like $7.50 or a $13.50 bill. I am choosing what ones to give the children so they will have the resources with them as I send them out to get help. They leave and Rochelle is now in the room. Another woman is there and she asks Rochelle how she's doing. Rochelle says, "Oh, I was very presumptuous. This man was teaching the first grade and he made a mistake and I assumed that meant they'd fire him and I'd have the job, but people are behind him and supporting him." I admire her honesty. She has on a blue denim like poochy cloth hat with a bill on it and has several sets of lips, or several shades of lipsticks on.
