I am returning to the Retreat Center in a jet that turns into a bus on a crowded mountain highway.-- Much confusion when I end up in the home of a church member; much gossip and talk about Retreat Center people. Then see Father Andrew and Marissa in a Volkswagen and they drive me home: as we come to an intersection I say: "Oh Father, I don't want to travel anymore." Marissa says: "A very wise decision." As I get out, Father Andrew hands me a small photo album that I had left with him; he says: "I prayed for you every nite." He returns a folder with addresses to me, and a small photo of my ex-mother-in-law drops out to the floor.
