I was watching Red Dwarf and it was like season 7 (eg, drawn out jokes and not funny). Kryten lost his memory and found Lister on a raft and he didn't remember who he was and it went on forever. Lister also said something like 'work, slave, sleep, work'. I woke up at home because Amelia was singing along to some AC/DC song that they'd put up loudly. I was tired and annoyed. Then I had this life-size cardboard thing and it had a list of old TV shows that had been cancelled but were coming back.
