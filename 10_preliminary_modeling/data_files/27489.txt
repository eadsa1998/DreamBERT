I was in a ten-cent store, one that I was familiar with, except that I noticed one counter was misplaced--the comb counter. I was shopping for decorations and little nonsense gifts for a party. There was a man with me but he had no definite features rather like a shadow. The salesgirls were all very enthused about a book that had arrived that day with ideas on what to do with lace and fringe. One of the girls or I should say a middle aged, tall, emaciated woman had on a black kimono and was trying a pink net shawl over this in different ways. I told her to sew it instead of pinning it. I then proceeded to buy my gifts. I tried to get some balloons but was unable to get the color that I wanted. I next stopped at the comb counter to get a good strong comb but the selection was poor and the only ones that were left were too flexible.
