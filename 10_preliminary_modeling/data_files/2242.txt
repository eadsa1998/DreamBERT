I'm on a motorcycle on an asphalt path. A guy on a motorcycle ahead of me is going slower than I am and I want to pass, but he doesn't notice and is in my way. I finally get around him, and go down a side path down a steep hill to a curio store. I see Indian dolls; one is supposed to be Theresa. I pick it up and think about buying it and decide not to. I already have lots. I see agates and stones and jewelry, etc. I don't buy anything. I decide to pack up my car and leave. I remember I have a pistol and decide to find it and put it in the front seat with me in case I need it. Usually I don't think ahead and have things ready so I can't help myself. There is something about protecting against my father. So I think its in my blue backpack, but it's not, but I find mint chocolate candies and put a patty of one on the front seat. I look in my suitcase and find the holster pistol. Now I drive and see signs for a junction of Hwy 9 and Hwy 6. I can't remember which one I should take, so I get out and walk back to reread the sign. I look at two or three before I find it. 7 goes to E City and then down the coast. Both highways get to my destination, but I choose 7 as my route, regretting having to back track home first. I go back to the car and see Ben Mitchell dancing by himself with a radio in his ear (headphones). He's really rocking out! I walk up to him. He hugs me and says he likes me. He wants me to find two handouts from my workshops to give to his brothers who need the information. I look through lots of paper to find the copy. I don't want him to take my original handwritten notes. I'll need them. A woman, Rebecca, is the sister of these men. I tell her, "Your brother is inarticulate and intelligent. He will find his way." (I mean Theresa's brother.)
