It was my last day of school again. First I dreamt that I had to clean out my locker, so I had to carry several notebooks and this stuffed Kermit the Frog around school all day because my locker was going to be cleaned out. And I dreamt that I was skipping Mrs. Hollander's class in the courtyard. And then they announced that everybody has to report to the auditorium for a really formal assembly and they were going to talk about the history of man and radio or something like that, and they said, "If you don't have formal enough clothes to wear, stop by and we'll give you some." So we headed on over there and we were hearing the sound check in the auditorium, and then I woke up, never did -- oh, and suddenly I realized I was naked, so I'm walking around topless with newspaper kind of around my bottom. So I heard the sound check in the auditorium and then I woke up. I wasn't able to even get in there.
