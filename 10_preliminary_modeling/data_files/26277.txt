 I'm at a party. I talk a lot with my friend Terry Foss. There is a VCR there, as well as an Atari with the game "First Defense". A man is there who has also played that game. He may be my friend Niles Zelling. I'm going to disconnect the VCR and hook it up downstairs. Terry comes up as I'm about to do this. I feel guilty for trying to move the VCR. My friend Yvette Ullman is downstairs, so I don't move the VCR: I abandon those plans with Terry standing next to me. I feel thwarted and embarrassed. There are some onion chips and dip there. I throw an onion chip to my classmate Jim Brown. I have a really thick, huge, tasty sandwich. Terry asks me to go on a walk with her. I agree. We go outside. Snow is on the ground. I have bare feet. I think about getting shoes, but I don't do this. My friend Kevin Simpson is standing in the front yard. He looks cold. He has a cup of beer, and says he is keeping beer cold for women. He comes with us on the walk. Terry walks ahead of us. She starts taking off her clothes while walking. She has shiny smooth red panties on. A car approaches in the distance. It's dark out. Terry quickly puts her clothes back on. We walk up a hill, and my pants fall down. Terry holds my thick sandwich. Some of the meat falls out of it. I hold it in my mouth, trying to pull my pants up. She takes the meat that I have, which is several layers thick, and holds that too. She takes a bite out of the meat sandwich.
