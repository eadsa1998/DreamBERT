 I go to Great Clips with my mom and sister Ramona. My classmate Robyn Masters is working there. She is the only person wearing turquoise. I feel like a nerd because I am getting my hair cut here. Robyn reads a name, and then another name: my name, and then Ramona's. I go back with Robyn. Ramona gets a seat. I go into a waiting room. There are other people there. I sit on a chair in the corner. There is a player piano there. A tan colored cord goes into the piano and it plays a familiar tune. Then a man is there playing the tune, and my mom is teaching him how to play it. He and others know about piano, but my mom seems to know the most about it.
