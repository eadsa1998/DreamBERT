First I found myself sitting inside a movie theater dressed in a formal gown and my date (whose name I cannot recall) was sitting next to me. Then I found myself on Cedar and Lee Rd. walking with a person, but this person kept changing; first it was one of my girlfriends and then it ended up to be my sister who is 17 years old. Then 2 men began following us (one man I have never seen before; the other one lives in my neighborhood and acts strangely.) I felt horrified that the men would catch us, but the bus stopped for us and we got on safely.
