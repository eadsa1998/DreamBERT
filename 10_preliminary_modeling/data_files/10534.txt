Pedro is swimming and I get out of the pool earlier. He says he wants to stay and later joins the Unbelievers Club. I am very sad and disappointed. I try to dissuade him but he says he really liks the people. I leave, feeling unsettled. Also a brief scene where he criticizes some of Willie's drawings.
