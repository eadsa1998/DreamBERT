 I receive a phone call from my mom. We talk. As she speaks I understand that her mom, my Grandma Redding, has died. My mom talks about her. I feel my emotions sink, and I slowly start to cry. I hear my mom's tears on the phone as she continues to talk about grandma. I'm filled with grief and sorrow from the loss. I have an image of grandpa, being alone now.
