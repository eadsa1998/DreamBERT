Had a large-sized greeting card of some sort. Chief picture was of a lady seated in a chair and facing forward. On back of card was fastened a rubber tube leading down to about middle of lady's figure. By blowing on this tube, the skirts of the seated lady were raised, exposing her legs and her underclothes. Someone said we were not supposed to see chemise on greeting cards.
