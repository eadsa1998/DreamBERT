At a noon meeting, I am one of three people being honored. The two men go first. Dylan H is very sweet and tender toward me. They take a break before it's my turn to be honored. I decide to go find a bathroom. I walk down a long hall. I ask directions of a cleaning woman and she directs me. I find some small broom closet like stalls and go into one after startling a woman in another one by opening the door on her. I sit on a shallow square hole. I have lots of papers and am trying to sort out what I need to take with me. I see I only need a few, but decide to carry them all with me. I go back toward the meeting area to be honored. Now it is decided that I will marry this other woman's husband. She's upset with me. I'm a little uncomfortable. I self-consciously go through some things of hers to get "my" share: an ornate embossed letterhead, a book about the French men. (He's French) I say, "I should read that." She says snidely, "What's to know, you just maul them and ball them." I shrug, a little concerned that I'm getting into something I've had enough of before (Howard and sex).
