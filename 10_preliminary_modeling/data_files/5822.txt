There were a lot of people. There are a lot of people in my dreams. In this case we were sitting at this very very very large table, something vast like 20 feet in diameter or bigger. All these people were sitting around this big round table. I knew that it was round because it was rough around the edges like the bottoms of our chairs, the new chairs that we got and it was very thick and it was like the people were...there was no arguing, there was no...they were just sitting there not really doing anything, nothing ever came to pass. There seemed to be no purpose for the people sitting there and yet I can remember the vastness of the table. I almost think that they weren't sitting as much as they were just...suspended at the table. It felt like we were sitting, but the more I think about it the more I think that the chairs were almost suspended, they were kind of floating. My weight didn't feel like it was pressing on the chair but the people were just kind of talking, but there was nothing resolved or purpose to be there.
