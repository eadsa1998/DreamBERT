[1997-05-12] There are two clients I am working with, a lady whose name starts with a J and a man whose name starts with a Q. J is about 16 and in high school and Q is 17 because he's almost graduating and its almost the 30th of September . A place called me and they wanted me to fill out a form for Q, one that I'd never heard of before, so I was trying to find a copy so that I could figure out what they wanted on it I had to decide whether J should attend [famous blind school] or public school next year. It was up to me and my supervisor said if there was only one service that the person needed then J could stay in her home, but I was trying to figure out stuff like whether she could see the blackboard and so I said that I would have to talk to her and find out what she wants to do. So I was working in my dream and I said "oh, well, I better get this form done for Q by September 30th because they have to have it by the end of the fiscal year". Then I looked in vain, and said to person who was with me and said that we weren't supposed to be this far, that we had to go back to New Hampshire, we don't have the proper travel authorization to be up here, if we're caught we will be in trouble. At first we were laughing about it and then we decided that we better go back to where we're supposed to be. That was evening when we were in Maine and we had to get back to New Hampshire.
