I dreamed that I was in my car with some friends from the university when we found a girl who was hitchhiking. She got in the car and we started to talk until she started to hug me and kiss me and then my friends got out and left us alone. We made love and then I took her home and then I was going to pick up my friends (M) where I had left them.
