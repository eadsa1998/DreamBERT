A former patient on the ward named Romanolo was seated by me. I was standing. He was complimenting me about something I had done. (There had been a personality conflict between us, but something about him attracted me to him. His sophisticated air annoyed me. He was later killed while attempting a burglary. His constant concern about my welfare also annoyed me. When I showed annoyance, he insulted and derided me.)
