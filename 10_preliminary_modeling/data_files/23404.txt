There were a bunch of kids who were running through the neighborhood at night shooting other people when they walked out the door or through windows. They weren't killing them, just shooting in the shoulder or something until they weren't standing. There were two other girls sleeping at my house and one of the kids was in my room, and I was talking to him. I kept pleading with him not to shoot at me or my house later that night and he kept saying he had to. He was telling me things I could do to cover myself. Then later that night these guys were surrounding the house shooting through the windows. I think I might have been shot in the shoulder, but I can't remember. I went to the back bedroom because I was going to hide under the bed and as I opened the door, I saw guys at each window and all I could see of them was their eyes and the tip of the guns which were glowing red. They then began shooting at the bed like they thought someone was in it.
