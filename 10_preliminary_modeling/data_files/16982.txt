I'm at university or college. We sit at school desks - the old fashioned single ones you get in exams. There's some kind of deadline for the hand-in of a dissertation or something. I get the impression I am behind. My chosen dissertation subject is a brand of german beer. We have dorms on the premises - which are on the other side of the hall. At night we struggle to sleep because there's always someone making a noise. There's an uneasy feeling that too much excess it taking place and not enough learning.
