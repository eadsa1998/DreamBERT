A group of a dozen or so men and women, most or all of them young, are standing next to a rope barrier -- perhaps to rope off a golf tee during a tournament. Among them is a slight, dark complexioned young lady named Jacobs who is the sister of a well-known tennis player. She is with a tall, good-looking young man. Upon being introduced to this girl, I tell her that I have seen her brother play tennis; but someone then names several other tennis players none of whom I have seen.
