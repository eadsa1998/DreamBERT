 I'm in or around a big old house, which may be the Whitman house. Some men and boys are moving or changing something: altering cement pillars or metal rods, and carrying heavy bags of cement around. I'm willing to help, but no one seems to recognize me, so I don't. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. We kiss, and may start to have a sexual encounter. She then wanders through the house, and I follow her, wanting to have a sexual encounter. There are many rooms. I look in the attic, where I see my sister Heather.
