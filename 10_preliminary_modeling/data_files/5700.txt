[1997-07-01] I am talking with my niece who is very nervous about starting high school, she is nervous in reality and in the dream she was nervous. She kept complaining about back pain although in reality, she does not have a back problem. I kept trying to reassure her, I knew her back pain was due to nerves. And she kept talking about how she didn't want to go to school, she had back pain. The senses I uses primarily in this dream were touch, when I was hugging her, trying to make her feel better, I was touching her hair, her hair is very long and silky, she had just washed it and I could smell the shampoo in her hair, smell of course, and hearing, and I could feel my arms enclose her and squeeze her. I kept trying to tell her not to be nervous, she was so nervous about being a freshman in high school.
