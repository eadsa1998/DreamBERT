My partner and I are trying to conceive. We make love over and over again, in what seems to be an urgent yet passionate manner. Later in the dream I am somewhere with my family, perhaps a hotel, for several days. Every evening at the same time an attractive woman in her early 40s arranges to go to her room with a male person in order to have sex and attempt to conceive. The arrangement is apparently legitimate and matter-of-fact. The woman reminds me of my partner to look at, but is not her (she may be based on a woman who was on tv the night before). On one of these meetings, I am the invited male. For some reason my partner is fully aware of the arrangement, and furthermore approves of it. The sex with this woman is a little more awkward that it was earlier in the dream with my partner.
