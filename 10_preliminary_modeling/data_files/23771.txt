I had to pass by a house, back and forth, in the grass, cutting a corner.  Each time I had to pass, Lynn was spraying me with a hose.  He was acting like he was being nice, only for show for others, because really he was turning the water on scalding hot on me.  He was totally pretending, for others, making them think he was so nice to me.  It was really painful, the hot and cold water sprayed on me, but also painful knowing Lynn was dissing me so much and had so little respect for me that he only cared about others' opinion, not me.  At one point, it seemed the house was Sue D's house I had to pass.  [Sue D was Lynn's separated wife.]  I felt way too close/near to her house  [i.e. acting way too much like Sue.]
