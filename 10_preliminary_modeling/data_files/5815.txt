I had a dream about 4 to 6 o'clock. It seemed that there was a group of us and people staying at our house here, there were numerous voices. They stayed here and then we took a trip, it seemed like it was up in the Boston area. Its unclear why we did it and everything, but people stayed the night and seemed to be having a real good time and everything and uh, Gee we had plenty to eat...I don't remember cooking anything, we had something to do with a huge clock, it seemed like nothing I have in real life, we went up in this huge bus, I could feel the spaciousness, like a moving room and I could feel the seats by sitting on them or touching. On the bus there seemed to be food and somebody forgot something back here and it seemed like we had to come back. One of those dreams that you didn't want to have end really. I don't remember too many details there, but it was a pretty neat dream, I enjoyed it. It seemed like my father was in this dream and he was much younger than he is now. A lady from our church, KD was driving the bus. I still can't come up with why we were going or what we were doing, we were going to Boston.
