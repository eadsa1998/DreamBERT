In this dream I had murdered a girl I have known for some time. The actual killing however did not transpire in the dream, but my conscience lead me to believe that I did the deed. The girl's body was stuffed in a cardboard box which I stayed close to with a morbid fascination or fear of being discovered. In the next scene I was racing with another automobile to the one remining space in a parking lot. I succeeded in reaching the space first and was greatly satisfied. The third and last scene returned to the body in the cardboard box. Although I was positive that I was the perpetrator it turned out that another man confessed to the murder. Upon hearing this I was relieved and my guilt feelings absolved.
