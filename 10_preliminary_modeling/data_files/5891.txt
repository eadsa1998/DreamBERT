I am in a hotel where I am supposed to dance in the female impersonator show. Am dressed in full women's underclothes, but no dress, and am wondering why no one has given me a fancy gown for the revue. Someone hands me some material and at first it appears to be just folded remnant of cloth of a greenish gold color, but attractive, with a small print design. As I unfold it, I see it has short sleeves and is long, but needs ironing or pressing. I go to a hotel room where I know there are two irons. As I walk in, notice someone is using the smaller of the two and ironing on a blanket on a table. I turn to the other side of room where I know there is a normal ironing board, but then see someone also using that. I am impatient to get dressed and eventually am wearing the dress and realize that the show is starting. I look at wrist watch and time is 10:25 pm and know show starts at 10:30. I am in a panic. This is my first show and I must be on time. But my face is not made up and I know it takes much time to apply theatrical makeup properly. I ask someone to get my little white box with makeup. Later I am in an elevator, still dressed but without makeup, and people are looking at me strangely. I think surely they must realize I am in the impersonator revue.
