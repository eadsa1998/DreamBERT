I was walking with a girlfriend on a street by the sea, when the sea started to come out. When we had the water up to our knees, I told my friend that we should climb the wall that was on our right side so that we could go on walking, but then the water had completely covered the wall and we could not see where we were walking, when my friend slipped and fell into an abyss. But at the bottom of it there were people and she fell on top of a man. She did not die. I did not know what to do, so I started to walk and came across my sister and a friend and they led me through some walls where the water had not gone in, and when we were just about to get out of there, there was a great gust of wind. Then we got to the car and climbed in (my sister was driving). We got a flat tire, but we continued that way until we reached our home and we found our mother.
