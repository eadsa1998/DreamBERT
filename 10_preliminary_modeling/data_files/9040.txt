I was at my home with most of my extended family, though they were different people than in waking life. Matthew had gone shopping with me to buy a birthday present for one of my brothers. He decided that a tool chest was a good idea so that's what I bought. For some reason I thought the box had a combination of a tool box and a tabletop grill in it. Later I realized that I had thought that because the toolbox was made by a company that is known for their grills and has the word grill in their company name. The gift was actually just an oversized, portable, metal toolbox. My brother seemed to really like the gift.
