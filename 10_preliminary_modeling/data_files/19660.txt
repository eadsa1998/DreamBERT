My stomach hurts as I go to the collection to get a specimen of Dytiscus for Beth to dissect and describe. I also find a letter regarding this specimen and, with the letter, a sketch of the beetle, and an enlarged sketch of the dilated anterior tarsus. I ask Dave Hardy to look one up regarding this. Next I am in the depot at my hometown and can dimly see 2 or 3 people in the ticket office. Dave comes in and I begin to explain about the Dyticus specimen, endeavoring to justify Beth's spending time on this project.
