In this dream I was in sort of a bizarre situation. I was in this place where it was indescribable. I don't remember what it was, but there were bad guys. There was myself and two other people. I was a participant in this dream also. There was somebody that was kept down in a pit that was one of us, one of the good guys. The main thing was to try to get him out of this pit, so there was fighting going on and everything. And yet the whole thing didn't seem very serious like it was, like I knew the whole thing was kinda phony. But anyhow, we started fighting and everything, and one of the men that was with us, with me, was playing the piano through the whole thing. He was real casual about the whole affair, and then when the fighting starts to come to a head, he gets up from his piano and walks over and holds one of the main bad guys by the, gets him in a position where he could gouge his eyes out. So we finally get the good guy out, and when the other guys let go of the guy whose eyes are about to be gouged, one of the other men takes aim at him and this man who's the eye business, turns into an apple. And one of the other bad guys shoots this apple man with a bow and arrow and he kind of like splits in two. It was an all-male cast.
