I dreamt last night that I was at a friend of mine's house at a fairly large party. Everyone was sitting around drinking beer and some were dancing. I remember that most of the people there I hadn't seen for a long time. I remember no specific people but I seemed to know them well enough to talk to them. Then I went into the kitchen where there were several people, and I stepped up to one person (I don't know who it was or even whether it was a boy or girl). I remember I screamed but nobody paid any attention to me or the person I choked. If I remember correctly, they went right on talking and laughing. The next thing I remember was running down what seemed to be stairs that never came to an end. Then I tripped and fell headfirst down the stairs and woke up with that falling through space sensation.
