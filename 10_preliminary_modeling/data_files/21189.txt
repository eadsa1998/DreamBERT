I was watching boys play ball. I walked by a couple catching boys and one threw a ball at me. It got by me and I went for it. There were two girls, sisters. They had funny turned-up noses. As I was reaching for the ball, one of the girls, barefoot, tried to put her foot on the ball. Her foot was like one of these clowns, big and flatfoot. I pushed her foot off my hand and was it ugly. Her sister stuck her long, thin fingers after the ball and then pulled them away. I said she has six fingers or was it toes on hand or foot. Joe and Bill were playing golf. I went down into a big hole. I saw two balls. They were new. I hid one or covered it under the sand with my foot and I threw the other ball up high when one of the fellows came for it. Then I uncovered the other ball and put it into my pocket and intended to give it to Bob. A fellow was riding or walking with me. He insulted my wife. I got angry and was going to hit the fellow, but I changed my mind and told him how wrong he was by doing such a thing that he was sorry. I saw a streak thru the sky and it seemed to run down into the earth. Then a fire started and people were running towards it to see what happened. It was frightening. There was a stream of water running near the fire. It went into the earth.
