I was working at some Japanese girl's portable shop. I was learning Japanese. There was a photographer. This guy I knew was having a wedding and he died. His wife was looking at photos. I was at his friend's house and I caught him making out with this fat lady. Her father came home and we hid the fat lady. I was turning on the lights and none of them were working. I thought it was a dream and then they worked. Then there was this giant ice-lady and she grabbed me. I turned into ice. She was 'icing' everyone else. I managed to control her and then she melted.
