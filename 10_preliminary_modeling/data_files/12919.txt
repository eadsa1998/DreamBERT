I was at Nana's watching movies. There was some old movie that had something about champagne. Chloe (Smallville) was in it and was talking to someone about Clark (Smallville). This movie came on directed by Erik Stolhanske and I was about to ask Ezra if he'd seen Beerfest yet, but he asked first. It came on and all it was was farting and burping and doing moves from Banjo Kazooie.
