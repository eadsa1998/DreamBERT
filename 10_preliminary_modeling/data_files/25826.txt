 I'm sleeping. I wake up. I need to awaken at 6:00am. My alarm clock has broken. My boss Mike Hollow is in the bed next to mine. He says he'll wake me up. I need to urinate. I go outside. It is pouring rain and dark. I feel a hand on my back. It feels like it is scratching me. I am terrified. I later learn that my neighbors Wilma and Gary Stein watched this happen, maybe from my other neighbor Mrs. Shelly's house across the street at home in Oak Valley.
