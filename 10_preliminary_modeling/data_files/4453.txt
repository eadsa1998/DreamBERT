["Cult suicide."] I am with a group of people in a room. We are each given a small plastic cup with poison in it. We are supposed to drink it and then die. I hold off drinking it. I am worried. They claim it is painless and comfortable. I don't know why we are supposed to die. I watch as others drink. I wait to see what happens to them. I see a door that goes to a room where they go after they die. I peek in as it is partially open. I see a toilet first, then a jog around a corner and I can't see what else is in the room. I decide I won't drink the stuff. I don't want to die.
