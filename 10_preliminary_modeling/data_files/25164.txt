 There is a man in a locker room. It may be my girlfriend Annie's sister's boyfriend James. Annie's father Dr. Bill Thomas is on the phone as I walk downstairs in view of him. He says, "Hey, here's the other guy..." I think he is talking to James. James is an outcast in the basketball locker room. He is from Willowville.
