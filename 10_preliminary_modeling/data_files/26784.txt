 I see my sister Ramona lying on a bed. She is a person that I've been involved with intimately for some time: a long time friend and partner. We have not seen each other in a while. I go up and try to lie on her and kiss her. She puts her right leg up against her chest to block me from doing so. We're sitting on the floor in her room across from each other. She tells me that she doesn't want to continue the relationship. I say, "Fair enough." We sit in silence for a bit. I feel a bit uncomfortable because she has ended our relationship. But I don't feel that bad about the relationship ending. It's not something that I think I'll dwell upon. I look at a book of photographs. A bit later I get up and go into my room. This may be odd that our rooms are next to each other.
