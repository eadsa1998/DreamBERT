A man is helping me to get away. He's walking through thick mud and dragging me. He gets a stretcher so it's easier. I am annoyed and complain about how he's not doing it well enough. We come to a country border gun. He hands the woman guard my papers, but they aren't the right kind. She calls over this guy. I am using the man's name and I memorize it so I won't blow the crossing. The name is Abduhl Ram Neish. Twice we try to cross. Then they give me the correct paper and then another man comes out and whispers to my man and I ask what he said. My man says, "So, do I look Swedish?" meaning he'd chosen a Holland name but looked dark-complected and Arabian. An error. They take him away. Two small boys are with us and I tell them to stand over there, where they will be safe. Then several men come to me and say, "Come with us." I realize they are going to kidnap me and at first I feel like giving in and just doing what they say. But then I change my mind. I say loudly, "Hey! These men are trying to kidnap me! Why are you kidnapping me?" I loudly keep up this monologue. They are very angry and shush me but I don't stop. I'm attracting people's attention and the men give up and go away.
