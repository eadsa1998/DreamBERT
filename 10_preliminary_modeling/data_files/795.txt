A man had a newborn baby with him. It was very small. I felt great caring for the baby. I nursed it and cuddled it. The man took me to his house. It was the wee hours of the night. His wife came out of the other room and looked at us. The man was a picture of guilt. I bluffed my way through, trying to think of logical reasons why I was there and looking calm and collected. I felt guilty also.
