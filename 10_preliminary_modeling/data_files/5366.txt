I dreamed that I was at a huge party with Elias. We were just hanging out, but then we left because I guess we were going to leave together. We went to my backyard and he started tickling me and wrestling with me in the grass. Then my mother ruined it or something, so we went back to the party, but planned to meet up later. Elias had 3 sisters, who were all angry with him. Then it was spring again, and I was studying for exams with Pauline. Jessica was there and I wanted her to meet Alexis, who was also there, but first I had to finish my exams.
