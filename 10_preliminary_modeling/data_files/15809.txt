I was playing Sims 4, when a Sim was climbing down a long ladder and this white thing came out of its bum. It then shrivelled and lengthened and fell out and the Sim died. I went to tell Mom and I described it as a "cigarette butt" looking thing. She just kept giggling about 'Pluto' and not really paying attention to me, though I was really concerned about it for some reason. There was also something to do with a plant with a 'scary' snake in it. There was also something to do with Ezra, who had gone somewhere and we needed to find him. He had lots of money and was spending it all on drugs or something. There was a massive bus that Nana and Poppa had and we were all going on that. I was feeling sick and didn't want to go, but they said there were 13 rooms on it, so I could get my own one and I agreed. Granma was going as well, which put me off. At one point I was eating some food and stirring it, when suddenly it was sticking together and started rising and growing. I yelled at it, calling it a name (I think it was Nick), and ran out to tell everyone about it. You could hear it making noise/speaking from the other room, but no-one was taking it seriously.
