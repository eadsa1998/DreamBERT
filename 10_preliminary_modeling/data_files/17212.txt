We were doing something we'd done previously in a dream, and that was our guide for actions, although I'd never dreamt this before.  We were outside a building sort of in the woods beside it at night.  I ran back inside and told everyone that they were having a house meeting outside, and pointed to a boy and said he was on trial with some others, if they had any interest in coming to watch or to get him off the hook. <br/
