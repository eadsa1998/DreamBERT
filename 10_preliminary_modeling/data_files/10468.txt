I am at a big reception with people I don't know very well, and I wait for them by sitting at a table with Marissa Camden! -- She is wearing a very chic black lace see-through dress, so I see her back down to below her waist. We sit and talk and she asks about our kids, very friendly but brief. I join our friends at another party; someone says, "I made 2 desserts, but I don't take any."
