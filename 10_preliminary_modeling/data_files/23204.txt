My wife Anita and I had been staying at a hotel and it was time to check out.  We had a lot of packing to do, and I was desperately trying to get back to the hotel in time.  When I got back to the hotel, Anita wasn't there yet, and I didn't know how we were going to get packed in time.  Then my son Burt arrived, and he was complaining that Anita had hung up on him.
