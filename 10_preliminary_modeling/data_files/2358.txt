Helicopters. I am a whiz pilot. A man is impressed and teases me by flying close as I was water-skiing in a river from my 'copter. I get back in my 'copter and call headquarters, identifying myself as Lieutenant. I complain about him endangering us, and then have to do some fancy storytelling to explain how come I am playing around water-skiing! I start flying the 'copter, through the city. I am especially good at precision flying. I go under bridges, through tunnels and over and under wires. Then I go up in empty sky, but it's not as challenging. I see another plane and a 'copter. He's in the 'copter. I realize I'd better keep a sharp eye out to not smash into other aircraft. I then land. He wants to fly with me and I invite him into the 'copter, telling him to fasten his seat belt, and to not touch anything! I get out, checking the water, oil and so on and get in and we fly. He likes me and starts kissing me. It is very pleasant and I sit in his lap and we neck. We suddenly hit a swarm of birds that foul up our props and we start to dive. I see a body of some man falling out of the sky and listen to him scream as he realizes he'll soon smash into the ground, experience terrible pain and then die. I feel sorry for him and empathetic. It's the same feeling as watching myself being suffocated by the mud in last night's dream. We crash, but thanks to my skills we are uninjured. We get out and see a large rock cave that looks like a closet. There are suits and dresses hanging in it. I wish it to be a regular cave, and it is. Then Jay, an acting student, comes by and asks permission to use our bathroom and says he hopes we don't mind, but Josh is with him. I do mind, but shrug my shoulders.
