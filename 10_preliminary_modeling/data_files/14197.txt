We were in this sewer like place and there was a bit of a jump somewhere on one of the levels. Each side had these squishy platforms. Elijah was there. Gemma jumped across and hit her foot. I jumped and missed and I laughed. This guy had a vision of him under a table in his 'shop' class. He was working out how to do something with a piece of wood. I was thinking it had something to do with time travel. When the flash ended, he brought his mates down to show them, but the wood wasn't there. One of his friends was Sawyer (Lost). He had another flash of a tree outside and something on it. He realized that it was a different day he would find the wood. I was with them now. We were outside in this park like area. Calvin and I were walking across it. Cutter walked past and asked me if I was the one with "lots of rooms". I'm not sure if it was rooms. We climbed down some steps and zombies were coming. I ran out and there was another flash which we realized happened later too. The zombies were everywhere. We ran back. There were people running everywhere. We went up these ladders in the sewer place. As we climbed up this ladder, there was a movie review behind it. Michael Emerson was in it and they mentioned Cate Blanchett and said "things to consider" included Michael Emerson. I was thinking he was awesome. There was a photo of him included and he was bruised and battered. We waited on the highest platform. After a while I opened the door and there was a hallway in a building. There was room at one end of the hall, where a woman was sitting on a chair at a desk. I said hello and she said hello back. I said I was just checking that you weren't a zombie. She said she was and showed us the bite on her hand. I backed away.
