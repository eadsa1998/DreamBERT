I was in some kind of eating establishment, like a Friendly's or a Wendy's. I was having a cup of coffee with a lady who is in one of my classes. No words were spoken. She then looked out the window and said, "Look. There's Mike, Craig, Jason and Ed." I turned around to look and across the large parking lot in front of a building that looked like the NAPA store in my hometown are my fiancee's cousins, Mike, Craig and Jason and her Uncle Ed. They were dressed up in tuxedos and looked just like one of the pictures we have of them at a wedding. I remember thinking at the time that was strange. That's it.
