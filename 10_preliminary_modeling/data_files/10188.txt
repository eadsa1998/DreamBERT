We are at a RESORT with many doors and corridors: Frank slips out the back door, while I am inside with company; I follow him: He keeps eluding me and slamming one door after another; I finally catch him between two doors and I say "All I wanted was to say "good-bye" with a kiss." Frank gives me a very perfunctory kiss and leaves. He was wearing a long GRAY coat and matching hat.
