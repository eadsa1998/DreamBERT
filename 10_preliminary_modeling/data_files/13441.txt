I needed to wash my hair. I had to go to school on Monday because a teacher had called Mom saying I needed to finish my subjects. Mom came that morning and straightened my hair. Dad was asleep and I woke him up and said that I had school. He took me to Midvale High School. Ezra was there and he told me Dad was checking to make sure I didn't wag. The toilets were at the top of this big building, which didn't have walls and had a lot of stairs. There were lots of people lining up for both, though the male's line was longer, and there were people lining up way down the bottom of the building. I saw Dad's car. I said to Ezra "Why are we at this school?". Ezra had gone here before Brookland too. Kaitlyn was there and she looked like Kristin Kreuk. These two Asian brothers were around and one had blue hair and the other had purple hair.
