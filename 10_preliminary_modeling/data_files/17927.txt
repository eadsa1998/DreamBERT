My mother decided she wanted to have another baby.  I told her she could, they certainly had the room, but that I didn't want her to expect me to help out with a lot of the work- I was saving that energy for having my own kids someday.  I realized her sudden desire probably came out of the continuing desire to care for someone, the way she had our dying cat Buster and my maternal Grandma Jane with her broken shoulder.  My brother Stuart and I had each gotten black plastic drawing plates.  They were, somehow, sort of 'x-ray' kits.  You put something in it and perhaps trace it, and you end up with an x-ray picture.  I thought this was neat and didn't understand at all how it worked.  I started looking in the closet for some blank paper to use with it.  I found some colored pencils we'd forgotten about and lots of used paper, some of it from old 'science' classes (more like historical technology).
