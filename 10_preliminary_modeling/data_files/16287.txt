I was in a show choir like type thing, and Mrs. Dougherty was trying to show me all the different maneuvers that we were supposed to do. We were supposed to do like jumps and stomps and cartwheels, and I was just making a mess all over the place. And I had to have this test in History or something, and she still lived at the school, so in my dream she was having a hard time finding a place to go and read the test to me. And I told her there's two conference rooms in the library, so we went in the library and we sat down and she started writing out the test bigger on another paper. And she was telling me how concerned she is that I won't make it along in life. Now I know she doesn't really feel that way, but in my dream she did. And finally I woke up. And there was something about petting a chicken, but I don't remember what.
