Another person and I are on a raft in a wildly raging waterway. Several times we go under strong waves and cough and sputter back up. I am afraid! I look ahead and see it's much worse. Someone decides it's too hard for me and takes me off the raft and shuttles me to the side water. I look and we're all going to be overwhelmed with a big wave. I am less capable without my raft and feel anger at the interfering person. We are under for a long time! Holding breaths. Finally come out of it o.k.
