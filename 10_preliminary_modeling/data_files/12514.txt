I was at 'school'. There was this guy who looked like Gale Harold, I don't know his name, and there was this 'nerdy' guy who was a friend of mine called Eric, who looked like Andrew McCarthy (younger days). This Gale guy was a 'tough guy' and kept trying to go out with me. Eric was always around to distract him though. I liked Eric, and I knew that he liked me. Everything was covered in snow. I was walking near Gale's house and I was walking down these steps. Gale came down and started advancing towards me. Eric had this bomb thing, and it was counting down. It got down to 10 seconds and Gale decided that he was going to kiss me (he had me pressed up against a wall). So I grabbed Eric and started making out with him. He threw the bomb and it did something to Gale's legs. I had kissed Eric because I figured that the kiss from Gale was inevitable and so I wanted my first kiss to be with someone that I loved.
