We are visiting Sam and FRIEDA and about to leave on the train, but first help them with some household chores. Frank is obnoxiously INDEPENDENT. He refuses to hurry. I have to do all the checking and last minute packing, while he goes for a walk! I am angry and apologize for him to D. &amp; F. When Frank returns he starts to watch TV: I shut it off and we leave.
