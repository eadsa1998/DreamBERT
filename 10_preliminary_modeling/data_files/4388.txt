["Touring."] I am on a tour. We are being taken to a farm house that has been renovated historically. We are traveling in little carts pulled by cute warthogs. They talk and like their master very much. We go inside the farm house. Fresh blue paint. Large kitchen. Pork and beans in the trash container by the sink that the employees ate for lunch. I comment on how very like the V. house in A City this is in shape and placement of rooms. We walk through the rooms looking at the historical furniture. Then we go outside again. The warthogs take us back to the main area. The tour is over. We go into a tiny cabin near the master's main area. The warthog tells us this is the "Miss." That means the mistress of the master. She is a cheerful woman, an excellent hostess. We whisper about the scandal of having one's mistress located so close and open. The warthog is tired and wants to go home now.
