["Bette Davis and a dead father."]  I am with four or five other people. We are moving into an apartment. We are sharing a room. I am Bette Davis and I am trying to find my space in the room. The others are set up all ready. We climb up to the door using a metal ladder attached to the wall. It is a difficult climb. The rungs are thin and bend easily. I now find my space. My desk is set up right by the fireplace. I announce I like this space. The space to my right is my "father's." He's dead. I see a man's figure sitting at his desk. All I see is his back. I call out to my father's spirit. I then see a bright opaque swirl of colored lights on the ceiling. I tell the others this is my father's spirit.
