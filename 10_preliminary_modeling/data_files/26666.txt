 I see my friend Mark Long, who is dead, and realize I'm dreaming within the dream. I am dreaming of having a lucid dream. I spin and roll. I'm disoriented. I will myself to stop, and I stop spinning. A large woman, whom I seem to know as being larger or smaller than the last time I saw, her confronts me. I recognize her as Mark's mother, Murielle Long. One of the Long girls is also there: Tara or Shannon Long. My friend Gino Teavor is there. I may tell him of the Longs.
