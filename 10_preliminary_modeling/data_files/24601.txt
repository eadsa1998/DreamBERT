In my dream there was a crazy man who travelled to the North Pole and never returned. A few months later trees came shooting out of nowhere. Everyone thought it was the crazy man. So someone went up into space to see if the crazy man was shooting the trees, and sure enough he was. So everyone always stayed in their houses. Setting: There was no setting. Characters: A crazy man. Feelings and Thoughts: (Not filled out.)
