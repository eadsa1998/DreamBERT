I was working for a firm. Accidentally I found the firm's records that they were carrying on illegal activities plus their surface business. Somehow an official of the firm learned of my knowledge and held me in captivity. After a while in captivity I was able to get word to an outside person. However, this didn't have any results. But after a while I escaped. As soon as I got away, I went to the police and told them my story. Then the police and I went to this building and alerted all the innocent people who were working for other firms. The police then staged a raid, but still the criminals wouldn't give up. Then the police used tear gas, and the criminals finally gave up. Then there seemed to be some time elapsed, and the next thing I can remember is a photographer taking my picture in front of the building, and the picture was to be printed in the next issue of the newspaper. Then I woke up.
