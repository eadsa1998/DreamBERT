I woke up angry this morning because of my dream. It was a situation like in Blindness, where we all lost hearing instead of sight. It was total chaos. I somehow found my whole family in this huge city and was crying and kissing them and telling them how much I loved them. I got separated from them for a bit, but I guess I found friends and we all did homework together. Then we were lying down, and not surprisingly, Aaron was next to me. My father had told me earlier that he didn't like Aaron, and I told him that it didn't matter because Aaron and I were no longer dating. Lying there, however, Aaron and I were together again and we were touching and kissing until another girl came and lay down next to him. Then he forgot about me and went on touching her. I was really annoyed and left and woke up annoyed!
