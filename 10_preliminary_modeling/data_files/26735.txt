 I'm riding a bicycle that is difficult to pedal. I'm going somewhere to meet my friends Matt Yams, Binky Ahmed, and Sarah Reed. Matt has cut his hair short, like in his third grade photograph. I'm talking the Wilderness and Natural Area Management final exam. I have to answer ten short answer questions and one of three essay questions. For the essay question there are five cards. I get the ace of spades, and a 10, 4, 5, and 8 of different suits. I'm doing terrible on the exam: failing. My desk and test papers are cluttered and unorganized. The papers fall and scatter about. I grab them as they float down to the floor. I have only 50 minutes left to answer two essay questions, and I'm not done with the short answer questions yet. I'm extremely anxious. Some of the questions are about Darryl Strawberry, as one aspect of sports in Wilderness and Natural Area Management. Many of the other questions have nothing to do with the exam material. I take breaks from the exam to get refreshments even though I'm doing poorly and am pressed for time. I discover that my classmate Kevin Valley has torn up my exam paper! I panic, and go yelling for my professors Hal Banner and Larry Karstens concerning my plight, while I have a mouthful of cake. I know I will fail, but I do want credit for what I did have written. [ An interesting note: I had this dream after my exam was over, and I did all right.]
