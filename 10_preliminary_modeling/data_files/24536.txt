I'm in a big old-fashioned school.  I'm about thirty years old. There are no classes, just many high school students partying, and I join in. At one point I steal a large knife and walk through busy hallways with it, then hide it under my trousers beneath my sock. Then the school is nearly empty. I want to stay but I leave by jumping down a long staircase.  Now I'm outside in desolate highlands. There are no trees, only mounds and rows of dry earth instead of mountains. There are school children nearby. Everyone is happy.  I take a path that leads to many trees and branches that must be climbed up or over in order to get past.  I'm singing. There's an old man just behind me. We're both good at finding our way through this thicket. It's like rock climbing. The goal is to some other place. Recollection ends here.
