I was in a tape player and somehow I was controlling when it played and when it didn't. Something malfunctioned and I was held responsible for ending the music so I went to a plug and had to steal some of its electricity to fix the music. Setting: In a tape player. Characters: Just me! Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, guilty. I'm not sure what it means. I have not been feeling anything like this lately.
