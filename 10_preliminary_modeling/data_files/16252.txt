It's about 7:30 this morning, and I was having a lot of little tiny like fragmented funny dreams. The thing of it was, was Dad came up to open doors and windows and woke me up at that hour, and then it took me half an hour to get back to sleep, and when I did, I dreamt that I was in my bed and Mom was bringing up the personal CD player, and she had me listen to a Mick Jagger song, and she was telling me about something -- I forgot what. And then I sort of dreamt that I was seeing red and signs with red writing and I was hearing the first two notes of "Bluebird" repeated over and over and over, kind of at a fast tempo. And I was seeing all this red, and It was really scary. And I was sort of somewhat conscious to know that I was in my room, but I was seeing all this red. And then next thing I know I hear Dad's voice, and he said, well first, then I dreamt that the radio was on and it was playing this song from 94.1. Again I was conscious that I was in my room. And I heard, there was this one jazz song called "Turn Off the Light" and Dad was there and he was saying, "When you hear this song, sing lilacs and lilacs, because if you sing, "Turn Off the Light" at night, it'll make you think of dark and you'll be scared. That was kind of, I don't know, a little on the bizarre side. The other one was much sweeter.
