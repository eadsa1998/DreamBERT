I dreamt of being at a pantomime show.  The first act finished, and we were the second.  We were miming "Rubber Duckie".  My boyfriend Jeremy stopped it though, and started it in Spanish.  He sung Rubber Duckie in Spanish, and I squeaked when he poked me.  We hadn't practiced, so as soon as we finished we got off the stage and left.  We didn't get to hear how they ranked us.
