I dreamed that I went with a boy whom I liked very much to look for an engagement ring. We went into a jewelry store and I chose the ring. It was a very small diamond surrounded by glass. It was very large as the glass made it appear large. I liked the ring - but when my family and friends saw it, they thought it was very ugly. I felt disturbed about the ring after I showed it to everyone and I grew to dislike it then.
