Dad was staying out late and Mom wouldn't pick me and Ezra up. I decided to make some food. We had a new microwave in the cupboard where the toaster shelf is. I put food in it and went to my room. I was thinking that I should return the microwave and get a toaster instead. Later, Ezra said he smelled something burning and I remembered about my food. I went out and it was all smoky. The cupboard the microwave was in was burning. Ezra turned it off. We panicked and tried to call Mom. She wasn't answering. Later, I was with Mom and Ezra. Dad was in his van except it wasn't him. Mom got us a new microwave, which was huge and old looking; I said it looked "30 years old". We went to the shop and got a mudcake and a lamington. She was asking about some robotic thing for Darren.
