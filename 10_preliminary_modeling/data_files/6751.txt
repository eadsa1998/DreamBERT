Trying to climb aboard a ship from a stool to reach a ring and so up but the stool is too low so go around to gangplank. Ask for purser. Directed to him at a table in the corner and get a reservation for a stateroom which 3 are to share. Across one closet door is one bed. Look in closet and it seems only shelves. Others enter and complain that there are no closets. But here is one, there's a wardrobe with some hanger space and where is that one I saw? Look for it and find bathroom. Room is quite large but the plumbing fixtures are old, but this is an old house remodeled that used to have fewer closets. Guide calls, "Now, if you will follow me. Mrs. Cox will show you this rare red flower." I fall in behind them but they go so fast that I can't find them even when directed.
