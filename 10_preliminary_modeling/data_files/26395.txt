 I'm with several people. There is a fight between a black and a white man. I break up the fight. A boy is there with a cheese grater. He hits me, intentionally scraping me with the grater. I tell him firmly and calmly to stop. One of the men is belligerent. I'm in a cafeteria with my friend Matt Yams. Matt is going to eat. Normally I don't have access here, but I may try to eat this once with Matt. Matt mentions McDonalds across the road, and we decide to eat there. We walk across the street. My high school classmate Eric Spears and others walk across the road. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. I may beat up a white man. Something happens with guns. The guns are put aside in a fight. I walk outside at an intersection and use the discarded guns to get people's attention, by firing them into the air. I give a short speech, and then give the floor back to a black man who is with me. I talk about and promote the integration between black and white people. I walk inside and people start to form a group for which officers are needed. I am made president of this now society, and I get keys.
