Since stunt night is approaching, I went to sleep and dreamt that I was going. I went through the stunt, especially my part, and then dreamt about the dance and then breakfast at Haydn Hall. After it was all over (5 a.m.) my boyfriend and sneaked into his frat house and went to sleep on 2 couches. Only we had an argument as to whether we should sleep on the same couch or different ones. I think we necked some too. Then I woke up.
