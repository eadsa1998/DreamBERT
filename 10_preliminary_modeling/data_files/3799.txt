["Huge waves and violent man."] I am going to an audition or returning some clothes to an office. I am walking down the sidewalk in a city. I can't remember where the agency office is. I walk over the top of a station wagon car and it starts to move. I hop off and see that Curtis S. is driving. He is looking at me coldly and I worry he thinks I'm being a weird fan trying to get close to him. I try to explain my purpose but he drives away. So I walk on. I am going from building to building and I see huge white water waves coming up from the ocean. If I take the sidewalk I think I need to, I'll be sucked out with the waves. I go around the safe way. I find a door and a woman and I ask where the office is. She is unsure but walks up a very steep carpeted flight of stairs. She signals me to go with her. I point out I can't walk stairs and I will go around. I go around and find an office. I return the clothes and start to leave. I am walking down a flight of stairs and get to the door. I open it, by twisting the entire door and shoving it out. I see then that I would be walking in wet mud flats. This isn't good, I don't like that. So I start to go back u[p the stairs, again returning the door to it's proper closed position. Now a violent man with a knife has me. He threatens to kill me if I make noise or try to escape. I am afraid and do what he says. Now I seem to be a man and he wants to know if I am an IRS agent. Later he snarls, You're a lawyer, I can smell it. I taunt him a bit by saying which is it? IRS or lawyer? Later, he startles me and I fall grabbing onto his beard. It rips off in my hand like it is grass. I quickly put it back, trying to pat it back into place. He and I suddenly laugh because he had once said to me never touch my beard. Now it seems funny. We are almost friendly.
