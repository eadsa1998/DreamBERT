In this dream my partner and I have a brand new baby. Except it's not like a normal baby - it's like a very small person with quite long legs. Like a foal, it manages to stand up and even walk within hours. We dress it in trousers and a little top. There's another couple who have a little child - a little girl (we have a boy). Their child too can walk within hours. For some reason I'm in charge of them both, and they are both in boxes on a shelf. In the excitement I forget about them - i suddenly remember and realize they might be dehydrated or need feeding. Later my partner and the other couple return. My partner is scathing about the other couple - about how they are failing to look after their little girl properly, letting her walk off in a shopping centre with very wobbly legs. Both the 'babies' start to talk within hours - they start questioning us, putting together clumsy sentences.
