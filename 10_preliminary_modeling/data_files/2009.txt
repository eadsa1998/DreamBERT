I had taken a written test and the woman wanted the papers. I went over to the couch and got them and brought them to her. She says, "Oh, you haven't filled out the information part." I groan and sit to write. "The questions," I say, "are harder than the test." I see they want my mother and father's names. I write their names and then can't find the right line to put it on! There are a series of questions that require the answers "very" or "very much." I usually choose "very much," then some guy demands to come in and my husband and I refuse him. We are busy with this test and he is interrupting. He's very angry and tries to force his way in. We block the door. Then he pulls a gun. He holds it on me and threatens to kill me and also rape me right in front of my husband. I jump him and we wrestle for the gun. I finally get it and run outside and hide it and come back in and hide beside the couch. Some woman tries to cover me with an afghan while the guy's not looking. I hide behind the couch, sandwiched between two huge couch-sized cushions.
