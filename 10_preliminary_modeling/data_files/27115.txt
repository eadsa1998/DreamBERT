Coming home to my apartment from school, I saw my sister opening my kitchen window. I was surprised to see her and waved to her. She was very happy to see me. I had not seen my sister for over a year and this was an unexpected visit from her. I was happy at seeing my sister. When I came to the apartment however, I became disappointed for she began to be very critical of everything about me.
