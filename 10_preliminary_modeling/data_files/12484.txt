I was at 'school' and there were these dinosaurs there. They did different things according to their moods -- it was a game. Calvin, Samantha and I were together. If the dinosaurs got angry we had to hide in 'nooks' that were randomly placed. We were in a computer room. Samantha hid behind a curtain, which was behind some of the nooks. One of the dinosaurs came running in and I told it that a young dinosaur had gone past. It went out of the room to look, but Calvin said that it kept staring into this room. We went to the next room, which was full of computers too. We needed C4 for something and we also had to draw a picture of a guy that would be described by Mr Ripley. I decided to put my newly found drawing skills to work. I had to draw this guy within 15 minutes.
