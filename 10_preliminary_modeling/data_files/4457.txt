["Presenting my business."] I am showing my parents a way to cook bacon. It involves a computer. I transfer the file to a floppy. I am concerned that their computer is older and won't have a floppy. It does have one but I have trouble getting the disk into the right slot. Then I see the bacon which looks undercooked and transparent. I realize that I am so used to cooking just for me that I only made one bacon for everyone. Anyway, they seem impressed with my ability. Grandma Anne is seated and as I talk with her she leans backward and I am amazed at how well she can do that. I am curious why she leaned back so far. Then I begin to put my things out for display. I realize the money making man will be front and center. I am tired of not presenting myself and my wares better and decide to take the table right next to the man. I know this will cost me lots of money but I need to do this in order to sell my wares. Another man agrees to use half of my table. It will help reduce costs. I get a cart and haul my things over to the table and set them up.
