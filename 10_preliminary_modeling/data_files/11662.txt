I dreamt that my parents had purchased a house. We got into our car and went to see our new residence. The street was very beautiful and had many majestic trees. The house itself was very small, in fact it was only three rooms: a large front room and a small kitchen and bedroom. The house was wooden and didn't look very new. The most unusual feature however, was the fact that the house faced sideways. It was between two large houses. And when I saw our house I was very surprised and very keenly disappointed. I wondered how my folks could have purchased such a house.
