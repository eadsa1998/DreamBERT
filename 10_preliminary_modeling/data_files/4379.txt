["Paralyzed man and I go out."] I am at a house where a paralyzed man and his spouse live. He and I are going to spend the day together. I am getting dressed so we can go out. He leaves the room and I realize I can't find my bra. I put on a pillowcase like a tank top. It covers my breasts. My midriff shows. I also wear a short skirt. At first I think the day is ruined. We can't go out with me half dressed. Then I look at myself and see I am decently covered and it looks kind of sexy. I am slim and young. I open a drawer, looking for a pin. I find a thumb tack which I think I will use to hold the top on, then decide I am fine the way I am. The paralyzed man is a silent type that doesn't talk much. I guess we can go out after all. I then need to take a pill and can't find it.
