I am listing things I am upset about and thinking about them. I am interrupted by a group of children coming into my room and talking and eating my chocolate chip cookies. I get up and tell them to leave my cookies alone. I try to tell my mother my concerns and feelings. I don't feel like she's listening. She interrupts and lectures. I see a baby and I pee on her diaper. She looks at me. Then I go into the bathroom. I see a book written by a woman and start to read it. I then do my affirmations. "I am healthy. I am healing. I am a good writer." I then smiled and felt very good and continued, "I am an excellent writer." I felt very happy and confident. Then I hear Ellie telling her problems to my mother and I hear her doing the same thing she did to me. We are at Grandma Mildred's house. They go out on the front porch. I join them and tell my mother to be a good listener, to not lecture. I then tell Ellie to be more direct and ask for what she needs.
