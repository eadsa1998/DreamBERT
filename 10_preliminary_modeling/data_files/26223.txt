 There is a man who committed suicide. He stood on a ledge with a thick yellow rope wrapped around him and his neck and he jumped. He jumped, and landed on a ladder that was upright. The ladder gorged him more than anything else. I am there. The man is on the ledge, going to jump with thick yellow rope around him and his neck. The noose is loose: it hangs down on his chest and stomach. The event of his death is reenacted, but we keep the man from jumping. People from the anthropology department at Brimson are there. I see my old professor Harold Gunther. I take up the slack rope lying on the ground so the man can't jump.
