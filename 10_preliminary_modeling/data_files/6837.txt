I had been visiting a man in an iron lung. (I had been reading a book about such a case.) when a passerby spattered his face with red tomato juice. I said I'd wash it off. He said, "Not you, I'm not paying you $1.50 per hour." I insisted and asked the woman working on the other side of the room, "Where are the towels?" Found them and dipping a washcloth in a basin returned and began washing her face. Had to rub hard to get one red spot off her forehead. (Note sex of patient changes in the dream.)
