Dreamt last night of trying to sell my books back.  The store was a warehouse and there were some issues.  A fire alarm went off.  Then about before I left I asked if they had any Ondar CDs.  To my surprise, they did.  I was looking at the selection the old man handed me.  I decided to come back later to look at it since they were closing.  I believe it was this old man who partook in the second part of my dream, which seemed almost as if I were in my obnoxious roommate Chelsea's pledge class, I suppose.  The old man told us (there were 3, possibly Chelsea and my quiet roommate Sally) to grab all our stuff, no second trips (and we had tons of stuff) and go up the narrow staircase to a sort of attic.  There was a rail down the middle, and the right side was blocked with presents.  I headed up the left side despite the fact that the man was coming down with an armload of presents; he was dictatorial and didn't expect me to do something to hinder him.  Indeed, I normally wouldn't have, but I didn't like the treatment we were getting.  So I did not let him down but continued up the stairs.  There were racks of books, like chip racks in a convenience store or gas mart.  I was put in the back room.  Two glass panels were angled blocking off part of a screen that led into the dark of the backyard, I suppose, with a bit of grass and then a drop.  To the left was a fan, and I was putting my stuff on the right side.  I think Bob, my psych TA was there watching me, assistant to the old guy.  The old man came in and gave me more orders.  I was getting pissed off.  I started arguing up in his face, and backed him into the first room where the other two girls were.  The issue was something of a war, and he expected us to fight even though we had nothing to do with it.  I was yelling in his face, and he would argue back.  I got so mad I actually pushed him backwards, knocking him and a rack of books over.  With tears in my eyes I stormed back into my 'prison'.
