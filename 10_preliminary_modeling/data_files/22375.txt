It is possible that this dream is related to some purchases I made yesterday with my mother, among them I got a coat. My dream began so: I was in a car with an aunt and she was asking me to help her with some shopping and I refused because I knew that I would accompany my mother at 3:30 and it was already 2 o'clock. Then I saw myself at a club in Santa Maria, swimming in the pool and playing with an old girlfriend of mine. Later my aunt shouted at me from the club's dining room to come up because we had to go to Lima. I then remembered the appointment with my mother and dressed quickly. We left Santa Maria at 3:30 p.m.; I was telling my aunt she should have reminded me and shouldn't have taken me to Santa Maria. She laughed. My face was angry. Then we arrived in Lima. I got home, but my mother had already left and they gave me an address and I went there; it was a restaurant. I found my mother accompanied by some of her friends, whom I don't like very much. Then my mother shouted at me and scolded me for having preferred going out with her cousin. I gave her an explanation and she forgave me and gave me a bunch of packages to carry. Once inside the car, I kept throwing things through the window on the sly, among them her coat. When we got home, she asked for her coat to show it to my sister, and I told her that I had thrown it out the car window for having screamed at me in front of her friends and for not having bought me a pair of slacks I liked. Here the dream ended.
