 I'm in a hotel like area with my friend Niles Zelling. I walk by a swimming pool, squeezing by a man and a woman on the black slanting deck of the pool. I almost loose my balance, and the two people almost lose their balance as well. We regain balance, I apologize to them, and move on. I am a babysitter, while myself and others go and do _____ ( I forget). It is later then later that evening, and I'm at a party. My sister Heather is there. She and I want to eat. I want to make some grilled chicken and onions, and more.
