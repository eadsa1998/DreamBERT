I dreamt that my brothers and I had gone out to scale some mountains (Aurelio is the oldest and he is 22 years old, then comes Mark, who is 20). When the three of us were about to reach the top of the mountain, I slipped and started to fall, yelled, asking for help. My brothers did not know what to do. I continued to fall and scream and simply would not reach the ground. Suddenly something unusual happened: I started to fly, moving my arms as though they were wings, and little by little I got away from those mountains. In the meantime, my brothers were calling me desperately. I flew above a huge ocean of crystalline blue waters. Suddenly I was before a huge, long bridge which led to a strange city. I wanted to get to the city walking, but I could not do it until there appeared by my side a boy of about 27 or 28 years (his face was identical to that of a friend of mine), who led me by another bridge to the same mysterious city. In that city I found my mother who, on seeing me, started to shed tears and to kiss me. The boy who had accompanied me had disappeared. I cannot remember what followed.
