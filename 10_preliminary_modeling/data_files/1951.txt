I visit Shannon. She is with her boyfriend who is Bob (her ex-husband), only I comment that he was my ex-boyfriend's (Darryl's) best friend Darryl. We are packing up stuff. They are here to help me. I think, "How nice of them to pay for the gas to get here and back," and I feel a little guilty about choosing not to chip in to help pay for their expenses. I think, "It's OK. They are my friends. Let them do it." I start to pack my muffin tins and notice that her very ornate crystal rock is in the plastic bag with it. It's a huge rock with pocket holes in it where beautiful agates and crystals fit in. I think she got it from my father. I think, "Oh, oh. I better give her back her crystal."
