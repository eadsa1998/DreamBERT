I was getting into bed.  Above, there were three lines of fishing wire.  Two parallel, one across the face of the light fixture.  One ran down the left side by the bed.  On the horizontal ones was an anecdote.  A woman was talking about her conservative and protective father wanting her to wear two bras, but that actually made her look bustier.  She finished with a comment about the humor, or 'what you didn't laugh at'.  I hadn't laughed.  I rolled over to sleep.  A red straw that had spelled part of the act started sliding onto the vertical wire, back and forth like someone (a ghost) was playing with it.  I told it to stop.  It started towards me. I told it to go back and stop moving.  At first I wasn't sure whether to be apprehensive.  Just a spirit.  But I called for my mother.  The light in the kitchen was on, and I heard my parents talking about insurance.  I yelled, but I couldn't yell very loudly.  The straw moved back towards me and dangled.  Finally my mother heard me yell and shot back that if she came, she'd be up half the night.  I told her I already would be and didn't care if it would keep her up.  She was my mother and is supposed to be there for me when I'm scared.  The straw moved back and on the horizontal, gently tearing through the soft paper fixture.  Then, it all fell to the side of the bed.  Finally my mother came in and saw it.  I told her it did it by itself.  I opened my mouth to try and say more, but I couldn't.  My throat felt sore like I'd been yelling when I woke up.
