There was a planet that was part of Earth, but was separate or something. I wondered why I hadn't seen it before, because you could see it clearly and could almost jump onto it. There was some disease on it and there was no cure or vaccine except for this thing that you had to inject within four minutes of being infected. I somehow ended up on there and so did a few others. There was a professional tattoo guy and he was the cause of the problem. There was an alien frog thing which they wanted to breed with someone but there was no water. This boy was found in the shower. His name was Dmitri or something that sounded like it. I had to look after him.
