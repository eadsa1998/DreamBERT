My partner and I are in some large underground swimming baths - very old fashioned (Victorian or Roman?) with very high ceilings and tiled walls. There's a hand painted poster up on the wall - sort of in the style of Indian hand-painted billboards but smaller - it is very detailed, and slightly kitsch. It shows all the members of my martial arts club - each character is inscribed with a name and some text. The head instructor is the largest figure in the centre. He stands next to a god-like depiction of a woman - in the style of hindu gods. I notice I am depicted in the poster as a small figure near the edge with my back turned so that my face is not visible. Next to my name, in a hand-script, it says "Lawrence, please come back, we miss you". I haven't been for months, and have been planning to return, so I call the number on my cell phone. "Hello" says the instructor. I say who I am. He sounds unimpressed... "What can I do for you?" I say I'm planning on coming back. He sakes how often. I say I plan to come once or twice a week (knowing it would only be once a week maximum). "That's not good enough - you'd need to come 4 or 5 times a week to be welcomed back." "I see". That's the end of the conversation.
