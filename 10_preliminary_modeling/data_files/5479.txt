I was with my best friend, X and we were preparing for a 3 day weekend, like Friday, Saturday and Sunday only all I had with me was my backpack and I hadn't packed anything. We went to the kitchen and we chatted for a while and then we went into this huge bedroom. It had several king-sized or queen-sized beds scattered around the room. Lots of big windows, high up. It was really light or white in there. I was really agitated because I'd forgotten my medication, so she called her doctor and I was listening on another phone, and she asked him if he could get her some medication for while I was there and he said to her "I'm really glad you called, X, I'm really concerned about your blood work" and he talked to her about it. I pulled the phone away from my ear and thought that it might be a bad thing to listen or by listening something bad would occur. I went back out to the kitchen which was small and dark and confining. Like it was paneled with some kind of dark wood. And her 2 kids were there, in there 20's and they kept looking at me like I was something really strange and they wouldn't talk to me so I went back to the bedroom, feeling stupid for not packing anything. And suddenly there was my family, having a party in the kitchen, where I was hiding away from. This guy from a soap opera I watch, showed up and he like picked me up and put me on the bed and pinned me down and I wasn't scared, he didn't do it in a hostile way. He sort of pinned me down in a sexual domination kind of thing. I went back out to the kitchen and then the patio and there were some people there I didn't know, and I didn't want to be outside, but I didn't want to be inside by myself either, so I went outside. And no one even knew that I was there. That's it.
