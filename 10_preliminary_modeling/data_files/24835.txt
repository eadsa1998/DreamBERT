I was with my advisor (who is male) and we had just gotten back from a play/movie (I don't remember) and were in the Mark Antony Hotel (we stayed there in early October when the 7th and 8th grade went to Ashland, Oregon), and we had been discussing the way I present myself sexually, and how that makes others feel. Then we both got into bed (the same bed), and cuddled, like he might do with someone his age, and I am unclear if anything sexual happened after that, but if it did I remember he didn't think it was a big deal, and I was worried about what other people would think. But he made me feel relaxed. My brother was in the dream at the end. Setting: Mostly in the Mark Antony Hotel, in a room I recognized as one I had stayed in before. Characters: My advisor (I will leave out his name), who acted laid-back, and relaxed like he always is in real life. I think my brother appeared in the very end. He is 10, short, and looked like himself. I was also in it and for the most part I saw the dream through my eyes, though part of it I could see from 3rd person (perspective). Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Unsure about what I was doing, worried that other people would think I'm weird for sleeping with my advisor, relaxed because he though it was okay, uncomfortable because I'd never done it before, friendship and respect because my advisor is my friend and I have respect for him, I guess. (I've made it sound like it was awful, but it was really a nice dream and I enjoyed it.)
