This dream was a very disjointed one. I dreamed that I was at a Delta Tau Delta fraternity party. Here I was dancing in a beautiful ballroom of the type you see in movies and in a beautiful formal, with a friend of mine, Chuck Burka (25) who is a member of Reserve's chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Also present was Al Sanow (22), a boy I used to date from Case who is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. I was drinking a cocktail and walking down a long spiral staircase, and then I was having an argument with Chuck and finally went back to dance again. Then very early in the morning, my father (50) and I were in a very large and beautiful house out on the veranda by a huge swimming pool. It seemed to have been after the party, for I was talking to Dad about it. The pool belonged to Samuel Goldwyn who owns Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios in Hollywood.
