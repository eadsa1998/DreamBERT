The Royal Show was next to a big shop. Me, Ezra and Jayson went to the shop. My mobile was out of credit, Ezra's had no power and Jayson didn't have his. We also had no money. The bus guy said it would cost us $1.30 for all of us to go on the bus. Jayson ended up running away to go find Mom. Then Ezra caught a taxi and I wouldn't go because we had no money. I was saying "We're looking for the Royal Show", and all of a sudden it was in front of me and all of the show was on this railway and it was moving to get back to its proper spot. I jumped on. I met this lady who was married to Marlon Brando before he was in The Godfather. There was also this hot guy on board, who I think was Greg Mathew.
