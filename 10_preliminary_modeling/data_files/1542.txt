I work for an old man who is rich. He keeps a rigid schedule so when we aren't on duty upstairs we go downstairs and live our own life. I am surprised how free and fun people are downstairs and wonder how they dare because if the old man found out he'd be angry and fire them. There is a dance. I am dancing near an open door to the outside. I think what would really happen if I escaped. I know he's said there are terrible things out there. On an impulse, I suddenly run outside. People are shocked and concerned. I'm a little scared. Nothing happens. I imagine a snaky tentacle touches my ankle. I run back into the house. Then I see a giant building loom up over the wall and look in. It's the monster. I think, "How can a building hurt me?" I leave again. I get into a car and think, "I'd better take another street out of here." I look to my left and see smoke from a big fire. Then I remember that my parents and Judy are still in the building. I can't leave them. A courthouse building slides out toward the street to get me. I feel threatened, but go in anyway. I drive up fast and see Judy rush from work. They are escaping in another car. I drive up to them and they are so scared they don't know it's me. We drive in a circle, me chasing them running. I yell, "Look, it's me." Finally she recognizes me. I ask where my parents are. They are in the back seat.
