 I'm driving my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas home in my truck. We drive across the bridge towards Riverside School and continue going straight, through the lights. She sits close to me on the seat. I lean over and kiss her on the cheek. I keep driving. She puts her hands down my pants, touching my penis. We kiss as I drive. It's pleasant and enjoyable to kiss her. She straddles me, and we kiss. It's difficult to drive as we do this, and we both chuckle. I feel that any moment I could ejaculate, and I want her to give me fellatio. I do ejaculate, because I'm very aroused. I wake up on a bed and realize that what just occurred was a dream. I'm sitting, half lying, on a bed. There are women in the room. I sit up, embarrassed that I've just ejaculated. I say something to the women, trusting that atonia had prevailed when I was in REM and I hadn't moved. My pants seemed to be pulled down enough to expose my genitals. I cover myself up as I pull up my pants. We were all in this room studying, and we fell asleep. The women woke up when I did. Their mother enters the room and is mad because she's been looking for them a long time.
