Jane, who is my sister-in-law, and I are staying at the home of Maribeth, a school friend. Something happens and I damage the drapes. We leave. My father-in-law is coming to get me and two young men see him and mistakenly tell him to go another way. I see him leaving and am upset. I have a note for Maribeth that says I will buy new drapes and fix the other stuff that has happened in her house "because this often happens when the water freezes." I am in some kind of trouble and a cop takes the note and reads it to the other cop who suspects me and wants me to prove I didn't do anything wrong.
