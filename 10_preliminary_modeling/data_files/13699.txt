We had an excursion. There was a height and weight scale in this big clothes shop. It was really big and it went around in a circle and had spaces for six or so people at a time. When it was done you got this cool piece of paper with all this information on it. Elijah and Noelle were there. Everyone participated except for me. We saw Salim walking across this oval to get there. I wanted to ask if I could go on by myself.
