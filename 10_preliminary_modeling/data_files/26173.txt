 I'm in a hallway talking with a woman I seem to know about another man. She is familiar with him. I get the impression that he is a weird man: he works in odd ways. He's not psychotic or dangerous, but is not a normal guy. We talk about the possible meaning of some of the symbolic objects the man has left. I go into my bedroom alone. In the corner are a spinnerbait and a buzzbait, both large One is pink and one is fluorescent yellow. I put a yellow spinnerbait on my penis, so that the blades are on one side and the hook and skirt on the other side, while my penis is through or at the middle/joint. (See drawing in notebook.) I'm wearing a fluorescent yellow protective cup, and I start to pull a pair of fluorescent yellow stretchy underwear over the cup. It's a tight fit, as if there are plastic containers on the sides of my hips too. My classmate Annette Gollum walks in as I'm pulling up my underwear. I stop. We seem to have a connection. We flirt. She comes onto me and starts to pull off my underwear. We intentionally fall onto a mattress on the floor that has no sheets on it. I have my retainer, as well as another object, in my mouth, which makes my mouth feel big and clunky. She lays her stomach next to me. I want to have a sexual encounter with her. She talks about how her hair gets in the way a lot. I want to put my hand down her pants.
