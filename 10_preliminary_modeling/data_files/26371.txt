 I'm in a cafeteria or grocery store that is like Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. I'm sitting a table with a man I know vaguely from class, his girlfriend, and another woman. My classmate Heather Beckers gets up at the other end of the large room. She walks over closer to us to go through the food line. The man comments on Heather being cute. I say I agree, and I ask Heather's name, pretending I don't know her. He says her name is Gee or Bee, and I think this is different than Heather, like I thought. The man also says that Heather is really friendly and has a lot of friends. He gets up and goes to the other end of the room where Heather is. He gets some food, nonchalantly. He may talk to her. I get up and walk to get some food. He passes me by and indicates He may have mentioned something to her about me.
