I was riding in a ricsha behind father and mother and H., who was about 8 or 10 years. They were in a car. When we stopped my hand baggage fell out. I asked father if I couldn't put it in the car. He told me to put it on the other side if him. I put it in my brown hatbox, briefcase and small suitcase. They went on after answering my question as to where the coolie was. When he came up the ricsha was missing. In search of it he butts in on partly clothed women. Then he with a beard and naked is at the door. He wonders what transit company is looking after the trade. I go to see bishop to tell him I must let my parents know. When he thinks I can wait I tell him my vacation is almost over, must return to tell that I have no money and am on the way to visit sister R. Relieved that I needn't find the ricsha.
