I had this tall ledge in my room. I had made this thing which would tell you stuff about how you'd be in 20 years and it would send whoever did it, some mail with all the details. Then I had a quick one where you put your thumb on it, with this other thing up your bum or another orifice and it would give you a spiffy fingerprint thing. Mom and Ezra did it. He put a thermometer in his mouth. I wanted to take it to school and do people at school, specifically Eugene. Nana was getting rid of her pets. We got Simba and Fido in the car. This kid with cool hair was wandering around and this guy started getting rather close to him and so we tried to get the kid in the car. Another day, the guy was trying with some other kid, and we got him in the car too.
