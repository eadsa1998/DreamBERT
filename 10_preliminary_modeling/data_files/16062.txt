I was hanging on top of a playground kind of a thingy, and that I had fallen, I had jumped from it, and I got knocked unconscious and I was in the hospital. And Dad brought me this baby doll that talked and I took the baby doll's clothes off, and I was trying to figure, she had all kinds of complicated electronic things. She had a couple of ______ things and I was trying to figure how she worked and what she did. And I was sitting here experimenting, and all of a sudden Dad comes in the room, and I put the doll's clothes on top of the doll, and I put a picture of a wreath on top of the thing, and then he starts talking to me and I kind of drift away to another scene. Before I know it, I'm contemplating going to the bathroom in a chicken dish. Sorry, I had to use a tiny tape recorder on the last three entries, so they've been sounding kind of "blahhhh" because the boom box has been nowhere in sight. But fortunately I found it, so now I can use it and get better fidelity.
