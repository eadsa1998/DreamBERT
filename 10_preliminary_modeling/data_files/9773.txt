Dream about girl who looks like Mary Palmer's daughter Ruth = Susan Schlenker (neighbor) = Todd Schlenker (her brother); she talks like her father, Mr. Schlenker; very opinionated.. Then like a commercial: "Butternut coffee...." I get angry and try to shut her up by striking her on the cheek; wake up.
