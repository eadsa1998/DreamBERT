["I smash the evil magic woman."] I am a woman in a house. Another woman is trying to feed a baby girl. I pick the baby up and feed her. She has two teeth and doesn't suck on the bottle nipple but chews it. She still manages to get the milk. The other woman is surprised. Apparently the baby girl belongs to a third woman who already has three teen kids, two girls and one boy. And then she had this baby, years later. I am sort of her. She is exhausted. She goes to a narrow cot bed and tries to lie down. She remembers she needs to set the alarm. She calls the other woman in to help her plug it in, thinking she can't reach the plug in socket. She looks again and sees it is easy to reach but she is so tired she lets the other woman do it for her. Now she lies down. But the other woman comes in crying. She says the magic woman has fixed it so that the older three children no longer understand they are her children. She is devastated by this and sobbing. I get angry at this injustice. I see a naked brown man, a tribal person, being manipulated by the magic woman as well. I see his penis which is bell shaped, the tip the open area wide and oval like a cow bell. The other woman says she even put a spell on the Aztec totem. I see a wooden cupboard door open and a large Aztec clay figure floats past. Now the magic woman is trying to put a spell on me (the sleeping woman). She/I am upset at her and make the bed raise up and float at her in an attempt to smash her into a plate glass window. I hit her and the window does not break. The magic woman smirks at me. I back up and try it again. I still can't break through the glass but I am managing to roll my bed over her up and down which is flattening her into a paper doll. When I have her flat enough, I light a match and burn her up. She looks very shocked I was able to accomplish this.
