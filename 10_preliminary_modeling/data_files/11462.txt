I went looking for the negatives that Dick had lost. [See dream report of April 9.] I started out in temporary building and proceeded down a very strange theatrical setting style Reserve Campus. I was looking on the ground for negatives. I walked towards 105th Street, but found myself on 9th Street. I thought that someone was following me. I stopped and looked into a store window. There were I noticed two theatres on opposite sides of the street. I felt someone following me. I crossed Superior and went into a leather goods and optical shop where I escaped pursuit by leaving by a side door.
