[1997-05-08] It is morning and I am walking to work. Somehow I have to go a different way to get there. Instead of crossing where I usually do I get to a different corner where on my right, there's a big, metal container of some kind. Its tall and it makes it hard for me to hear the traffic because its tall and is blocking the sound. But somehow there's a way that I can talk to a police person who is up there working, I'm not sure how, I had a radio or something, And I could hear the police person at work talking about this situation so we talked each other through it and then the police person is there at work, putting in paper work for different things that have to be done. Then we went to another building where the new work shop is going to be and it was kind of set up in different ways, where we had to go through all these doors where everyone is standing around talking, there are a whole lot of people there.
