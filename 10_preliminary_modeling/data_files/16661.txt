Was I was at a lesson with Mr. Dawson. And I was trying to play "Thine Is the Glory," and I was getting all messed up because, I don't know, I just wasn't playing the right notes and he was saying, "Well, I think you should do more ear training. I think maybe your audeation is not quite up to par." And, you know, he was saying that in a pedagogical manner, you know, just sort of a normal thing that needs improvement. And meanwhile people in the music center were bustling around and bustling around and bustling around, getting ready for the musical show Rent, which I think we're going to go and see. And he was a bit perturbed because they were making all kinds of commotion while we were trying to do a lesson. And somehow I went, was away from the organ, and the stage was like this huge, you know, one of those blow-up raft things that was a major incline, and somehow I realized I was sliding backwards down the incline and I was yelling for help. And one of the crew members managed to pull me back up on my feet, so I wasn't sliding backwards any more. And so then I was back over by the organ and the bench was kind of high so I could hardly reach the pedals, and we were doing something. I don't remember what we were doing. But I realized I was stark naked, without a stitch of clothes on me, and I thought, "Oh gee, I hope Mr. Dawson will forgive me of this and not think it was too odd," or whatever. And there was a photographer coming to take pictures of the set and all for Re__, and kind of very professional. And Mr. Dawson just kind of stood behind me and covered me up while the photographers took pictures and everything, and was talking and going on with things as usual, and kind of reaching over my shoulders and playing a little bit, like he does sometimes, just the most chivalrous, the most professional thing -- just covering me up until the photographers left. And then I woke up.
