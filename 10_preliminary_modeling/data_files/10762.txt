Upon entering a ballroom where a big costume party was taking place, I was confronted with many people and much excitement and confusion. The place was gaily decorated. Hanging from the ceiling were streamers which were all entangled. Upon looking around, I saw that all the men there were wearing the identical tie - it consisted of a red, white and blue design with a horrible man's face superimposed upon it. In addition, replicas of this tie covered practically every inch of the walls. Wherever I turned, I saw this very tie. I was very upset about it because I had bought this same tie for my brother that afternoon. It was without the face, however. I disliked the thought of giving him something that everyone else was wearing.
