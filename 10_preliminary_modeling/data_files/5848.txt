[1997-08-07] I remember playing cards with Claudia and our youngest son, but the funny thing was all the cards were in print and he had to read the cards to us and he of course won almost every game. We were teasing him, accusing him of cheating. He got rather annoyed at that and threw all the cards on the floor. And just as I yelled at him that he'd have to pick them all up I woke up.
