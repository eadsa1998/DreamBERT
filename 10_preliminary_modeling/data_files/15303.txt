I was playing a game where you could pay cash to buy a special kitten. Mom had enough so I asked to use her account but we couldn't transfer the kitten to my account. Then it was real. Home was different. The kitten went outside and I heard it meow and I had called it Gizmo. I went out and there was snow. I called the cat back in but the door wasn't locked. I tried to get help but no-one could be bothered. I asked Ezra and I said "I don't want a crazy murderer to come in".
