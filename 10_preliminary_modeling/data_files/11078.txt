I was swimming at a lake with some boy around 27 years of age. The lake itself was not familiar. It was one which had swamps on one side. It was nighttime and a full moon was shining. This boy and I went swimming. Suddenly a large muscular Negro man started chasing us. We swam towards the swamps, the man following. In the middle of the swamp was a house. We ran into it and hid upstairs. The man followed us there and entered the house. The dream ended. I have dreamt this dream 3 times -not in successive nights.
