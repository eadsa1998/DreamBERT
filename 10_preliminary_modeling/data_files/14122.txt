I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We got to her house and it was different. Quincy and a friend of his came over and his friend was made to stay in the car with me. Mom wanted to keep an eye on him as she said no friends of Quincy had been good. There were some biscuits in a bag and Mom said "I want some biscuits" and the friend jokingly took them. Mom was telling him a story of someone coming to the door to tell us to watch Supernatural.
