I was in my hometown, at our old house.  Mother had just bought and moved into a house (probably the same house-it was on that side of the street, anyway), having just vacated one on the opposite side of the street.  I also felt some nostalgia over a car involved, so that I was trying to remember which ones I personally had had to part with-and I could think only of my first car, the '57 Chevy.  I was in the driveway alongside the vacated house when I heard a phone ring.  I ran to the front, thinking it might be a call for Mother, but it wasn't coming from inside.  The house on the other side of the street was close enough that I could ask Mother in a normal tone of voice if the telephone had already been changed, and she said it had.
