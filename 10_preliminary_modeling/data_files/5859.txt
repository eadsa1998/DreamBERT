Am aboard a ship or a land base as a sailor in the US Navy and am looking for a bunk or bed, while at the same time conversing with some other sailors (all strangers). We are all in white uniform. I feel reassured that I have a bunk and continue talking until the lights go out. Someone points out a bunk nearby and it is empty. I am relieved since I was quite anxious about having a place to sleep. I roll into bunk.
