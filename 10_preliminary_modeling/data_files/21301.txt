A couple dogs were chasing me. One of them, I think, bit me. I picked up something and kept them away. We came to a pile of advertising pictures. I threw a rock at one of them and hit it. Boy, did the dogs come at us, but we kept them away. I picked up Kogler and when he came into our house, Ann kissed him. When he left, I got angry at Ann. I was jealous. I bawled her out and she said I was not dressed nice. I was walking down the street with Andy Palider. He walked down the center of the street. Two cars came speeding on either side of him. He was between them and got all excited when they passed. I was in Rivertown. Dad and I were going to fill in a spot in the yard that was low. I was going to get the dirt from near the rubbish box because it could be filled later. I was walking down the street and Ann was watching me. I gave her the eye to come hither and she gave me a big smile. A fellow backed up near my car and gave it a little bump when I looked at it and I had a small dent in the fender.
