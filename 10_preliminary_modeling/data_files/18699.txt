The city was filling up with water. We lived on the 6th floor of a loft under the Manhattan Bridge. Water was coming up fast. Water started trickling over the window sill and the waves rolled over the window, rolling waves. Our ankles were wet, then up to our knees--water was running fast. Over the chairs and desks--I looked around. The boys who cut the telephone wires were there too. I was still miffed they had cut the telephone wires and electric wires and cables. The window opened onto a wall of another building. You could climb ??? ??? wanted to. The water was getting higher and higher. I'd missed kitty. I hadn't heard her for a while. I said, "Rudy, where's kitty?" and he said, "Oh no, O left her in a cage on the bench next to the door." I reached under water and grabbed the cage. She was barely still breathing but she recovered. I ran out the door and decided if everything worked out OK, but now it was war if they retaliated. Lock it from outside. Lock in the mean boys who had cut the wires. I knew they could escape if I didn't lock it. I went back to the loft when it was back to OK. A girl, a dancer. After the rains, she was stretching out ??? stand up in the grass still wet from the rain.
