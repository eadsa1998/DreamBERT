 I'm at my high school, Armstrong, down by the math and science rooms with my sister Ramona and my brother Wally. Ramona has Geometry Advanced with Mr. Carson. I know this, but I ask her if she has that class anyways. I feel uncomfortable in the area because I am older than all the students. I feel like I am an intruder. I try to act appropriate. A woman who is a year younger than I in school, Analisa Paulsen, is there.
