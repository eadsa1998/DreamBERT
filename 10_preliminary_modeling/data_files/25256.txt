 I arrive at home. My brother Wally, his friend Mryle Madden, Monalisa Miller, who is Mryle's girlfriend, and another girl who is Wally's girlfriend get back from picking mushrooms. The mushrooms are huge, and are hard; they can't be eaten because they're too hard. The couples kiss and the females leave. In the house, my mom is talking about my classmate Ryan Pitz. I say that I know him. He is then standing in front of the sink, while I am looking into the adjacent refrigerator. I say, "Hey, Ryan." He is wearing red underwear. He is staying at our house. When he goes into the dining room he has pajama bottoms on. My mom is talking about a kid whose name she thinks is Loess. I realize she is talking about a person I know from working at Grocery Getto, whose last name was Loesch. I say that kid is a dork.
