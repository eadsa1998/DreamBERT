I was looking at a new two-story building built of rock. The rocks were about three by four feet, large ones and some were set so they stuck out like it was a bad job. It was set that way on purpose. Then there was a silo built with smaller rock. Ann gave me some money to pay a bill and I said, "It will be about 50 cents more," so she gave me two quarters. A nickel dropped out of her hand and rolled on the ground by some sort of bench that ran on the side of a building. I looked for it and found a dime beside it. So I started to look around and I was picking up a lot of lost nickels. Ann gave me an extension and I used the light to look for the nickels that people lost as they take out money and a coin falls out and they don't know it has. I saw a name of a horse I can't recall now which paid $109. It started with an L like Lorance, but I'm not sure. I was in Rivertown looking at Swaney's Hill and I saw two young and two old hunters going up the hill. I heard a shot and I looked and a young hunter shot at a rabbit. The rabbit rolled, then sat up for a second and keeled over.
