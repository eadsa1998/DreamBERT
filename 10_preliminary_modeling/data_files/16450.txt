I was going with Dad to this big expansive, empty parking lot to take the Peavey system and practice my speech. And he said, "Okay, we're going to leave in a few minutes," and I realized I didn't have my personal CD player or any of the other accessories that I need for here to give my speech. And so I figured it would be better to delay things and make them wait a little than to get there and be totally unprepared. So I took a paper bag and I dropped in my personal CD player, the mini disk recorder, some cables, my wireless mike receiver and the wireless mike itself. And then I was thinking, "Okay, I'm ready to run out the door." And then I realized I don't have the XLR cable to connect the receiver to the board. The wireless mike receiver connects to the board with an XLR, and I realized I didn't have that so I had to dig it out of my drawer. And also I realized I had to dig out the transformer that powers the wireless mike receiver. I had to look in a few places and finally I found it and I threw all that in a bag and I was running out the door, and then I realized it was dark out. I had taken most of the day to get this stuff ready. And each time I would put something in the bag, I would turn and run out the door and, I mean, out of my door and halfway down the stairs and realized that I had forgotten one more thing. And I'd come back and I'd put it in and I'd run down half the stairs, and then I was, "Oh, I forgot one more thing." And by the time I was all done with it, it was dark, and we just decided that we would go tomorrow. And then I woke up. [laugh]
