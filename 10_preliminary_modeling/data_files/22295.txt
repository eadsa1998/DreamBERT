This time I had a short dream which turned into a nightmare for me and I wouldn't want to tell it, but I will. My mother, my brothers and I saw my father at a crazy party through a window. We saw the fun he was having at the party, dancing with several girls, drinking, dancing, laughing, dressed all in black. My mother and my brothers and I called him, in tears, but he didn't listen to us.
