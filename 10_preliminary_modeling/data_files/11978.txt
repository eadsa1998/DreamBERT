I was at Midvale shops except they now had a beach thing in the carpark. It had waves and stuff too. Ezra and I were getting into the car and I noticed all the water was gone. I didn't say anything and we got into the car. Valerie was there too, and she was with us and her and her kids wouldn't get in the car. I then realized all the water was built up in a huge wave. I screamed for Dad to get in the car but Ezra said "We're gonna die aren't we?" and I said "Probably" and then I decided I didn't wanna die so Dad got in the car and drove off before it was too late. We were safe. We went back though for some reason and it was all calm again, we went back home and everything was fine, but we realized it was happening again so we drove away. Then somehow I ended up in a car with Mom and we drove to this place that was causing the problem. They didn't do anything but they gave us a wireless computer mouse [my mouse stopped working last night]. We drove back again so that I could get my Monty Python DVD's and then it happened yet again and we drove downtown and I asked if we were going to stay at a hotel and we were. It was smelly though, and I was in the garden (it was night time) and there was a cubby house thing, and an old man, that looked like the 'It's' man, was or had told some boys to come up to prove their bravery. One boy did and the man told him to pretend he was getting hurt. So he started screaming and then his friends were laughing because they had set him up and then they had to jump off into this mud pit.
