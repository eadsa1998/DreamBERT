I was in a bowling alley.  The lanes proceeded towards a stage, and many of the lanes were curved, not in the least uniform.  There were two gangs there.  Somehow I seemed to join one of them.  We were outside hanging, and the rivalry began.  There was no violence.  One group would provoke the other's affection.  It was playful, treating the opposing gang member as a girlfriend and belittling them that way, more subtly, rather than direct insults and a sincere angry tone.  It was interesting to watch.  In the middle of it I befriended both groups.  Then they left.  One went to the right towards the library, the other to the junior high on the left.  I didn't know which was which group anymore, or which way to go.  I ended up following the leader toward the junior high.  Somewhere in climbing the fences, I'd decided against following any further, and turned back the other way- but the group was gone.  I came across the leader at a sort of clinic.
