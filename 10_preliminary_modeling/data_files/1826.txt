My father and I are in a car and we take me to school. I carry books. He puts a book in a locker. It's a Learn German book. A man and I are rehearsing a video promo on disability awareness. I do a cheerful, charming rap. Some people come in. We are talking about relationships. I am dancing alone and enjoying dancing to the music. I start to join another woman dancing alone, but then chose to dance alone. Then this man and I discuss what kind of relationship to experiment with. He says "good friend and boyfriend first." Another guy and I laugh and say, "Wouldn't it be better to start with an educational relationship and then move to girl/boy friend and then to marriage?" I grimace at the idea of marriage. [BL]
