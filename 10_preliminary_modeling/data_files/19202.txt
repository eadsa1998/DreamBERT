I was on my way into a place that appeared to be a restaurant with a girl. We were joking and kidding, the girl and I, very lightheartedly. It seemed that we were discussing some political problem or political situation and then it was serious in nature. I did appear slightly humorous since we both had separate views on the subject. I don't know exactly what the subject was or what the views were, but only that such a relationship existed in the dream. We pull up in front of the restaurant as one would a hotel, and the doors were open. I stepped out. This was something like some kind of gangland operation. I proceeded the girl as I was walking into the restaurant. I was laughing about something that she had said. She too was laughing and was in the middle of a word when she broke out with a sort of strangling "eck" sound. I turned around and there was a young man, in his twenties, with his one arm around her neck choking her. I turned to him very angrily and moved toward him threateningly and he disappeared just as though into a puff. I stood there in that same spot for about 15 minutes waiting for him to come back because I was going to beat him up.
