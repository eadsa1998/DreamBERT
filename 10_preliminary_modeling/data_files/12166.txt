We went somewhere and there was a barbeque shop, which I remembered seeing in a dream. People from school were staying in a motel. I knocked on Daryl's door and I ran around the building. He ran too, but he didn't see me and I got back to my room, which I was sharing with other people. He checked in the room and I screamed and fell. I was recording stuff. We were watching Back to the Future 2 and I remember seeing Michael J. Fox. Then we had an assembly. Nana was there and we watched Mary Poppins.
