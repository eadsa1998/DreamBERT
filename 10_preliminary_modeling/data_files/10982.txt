I was in a living room which was decorated in a very old-fashioned style. With me was one of my friends, a boy who is 21 years old and a senior at Reserve. We are very close friends, even though I am engaged. We were waiting for something and then an older woman came out. She was a secretary and told us that the judge would be with us very shortly. The judge came out and he was very jolly looking, had white hair and whiskers, a very large round belly, a veritable Santa Clause. He was clad in a wine colored satin dressing gown. He then proceeded to bawl out both me and my companion, although I do not know about what. Then his secretary came in and told the judge that his bath water was ready for him.
