I was playing a game, although it wasn't. I went into a house and there were helicopters and cops outside. I had this sniper and was shooting cops that were on the stairs outside. I ran out. The house belonged to a guy who was friends with the previous owner, who had been killed by the guy (who was me). I was at a deli and I bought a chocolate. When I left I realized I had all these other chocolates. This guy bumped into me to take them (he had put them on me so he could later take them). I kicked him in the nuts. He called out to the shop lady, whose name was Valerie, to say I had stolen chocolates. But we knew her so she didn't believe him. Later she was waiting for a date with this other guy was also a thief. This disabled friend of hers was with her. Dean and Sam (both Supernatural) were outside and this guy tried to shoot them. There were dogs sitting in the snow outside.
