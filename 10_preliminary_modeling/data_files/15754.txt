I was watching Big Brother. Kim was on this platform thing and Chris was sitting below with sunglasses on. There were tons of other people around though and it was noisy. Chris said to someone that he "likes her ass" and she was like 'what? What did you say" and he said "I like your ass" without flinching. She seemed shocked that he just outright said it [oddly, the episode the next day he said that he liked her ass]. Matthew had cerebral palsy and that explained all his weird twitches. He was always bleeding from his head/face and looked really sickly. Someone got me this flat thing in London. It was like a house, but in a group of them and it was only one storey and small. It felt empty. People were having a lunch party thing outside. I was checking the locks and they were all unlocked. I had to find the key to lock them. I was looking in the dishwasher when a lady came through my back door and I was confused because I thought I locked it and then I wondered if she had a key.
