I am at my parent's house and it is late at night. For some reason it feels like high school and like I am still living at home. I walk out of my room and into the hallway toward the bathroom. As I near the bathroom and my parent's room, I can hear my dad talking in his sleep. I cannot see him because the door is closed, but somehow I know he is talking in his sleep. I cannot really make out what he is saying, but he is obviously angry and the tone of his voice is very pissed off. I listen to him for a while and then I decide it is all pointless gibberish and I walk back to my room to go to sleep.
