Amazing dream set in a Mexican or South American hotel. This hotel is like a film set, gloriously rundown -full of texture and color. It is full of artefacts - dusty objects and decorations of south American origin. There are ceiling mounted fans with old-fashioned decorated detailing. The bathroom is equally old-fashioned - Victorian perhaps with fittings from the 1950s. High ceiling, decorated cracked tiles and large sinks. High up on the ceiling are dozens of enormous insects - stick insects, moths, Beetles, Cockroaches. They are disgusting yet structurally beautiful - architectural. It looks like they are attached by their jaws, hanging off the ceiling like ticks sucking blood. I'm shocked and disgusted, yet fascinated. I look down and realize a couple of them are attached to my bag. It's quite dark in here, and I can't tell in the half-light whether they are alive or dead or in fact fake, so I take my bag carefully from the bathroom to my room to attempt to photograph them. I'm too squeamish to get too close, and there isn't enough light in any of the rooms, so I try to use the camera flash to take some close-up pictures. I look at the images on the camera view finder, and it seems that they are indeed made of plastic. I'm horrified as to the motives of the hotel owner for putting them there.
