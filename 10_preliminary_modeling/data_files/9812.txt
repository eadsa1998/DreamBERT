We move into a new apartment: a "Palmer" apartment: modern furniture; 3 parts to it: corridor for kids; a walkway and an apartment; see Isaac Palmer in a booth with bullet-proof window: "So no one can take a pot shot at me," he says. I take 2 books to their house and leave them there, so they will be there when we move in. V. excited.
