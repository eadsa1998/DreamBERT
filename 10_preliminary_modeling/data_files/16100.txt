I discovered this tape (Wee Sing tape), that we were at a little house that we were staying with Mrs. Hollander in and two other students, and I discovered this tape that I just described. And I put it in a boom box, and I started playing it, and it had "Battle Hymn of the Republic" and a couple of other patriotic songs on it, but it was totally different than what I just described it to be. That was strange.
