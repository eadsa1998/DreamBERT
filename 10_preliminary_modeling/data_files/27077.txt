In this dream I was Skiing, yet I didn't seem to be at any Skiing resort. In fact I seemed to be around here. There was considerable amount of snow and there seemed to be high hills. I was with a woman doctor who I have frequent contact with. She went before me, and she fell. When I came down I asked if she had broken any thing and she replied she thought she had broken her hand. When we looked at her hand one of the bones was bend up, she laughed and said perhaps she could push it down which she proceeded to do. However we both decided that she should go to the hospital which we did - Later on I dreamed that someone had a little puppy dog - I don't recall who the friend one. It was a small thing with hair which covered its eyes. The front left foot was missing, and when I remarked of this the person said that it didn't stop him from getting around because he had an extra foot at the side. When I looked further there was a small foot by which he could certainly get around with - To demonstrate to me he ran quickly up the stairs.
