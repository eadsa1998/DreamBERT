I was at school and it was really weird and like Hogwarts. Someone said that it was a 'magic' school. There were big waves and me and two guys climbed this thing, but when we got to the top, the wave was gone. We went into this 'building'. We sat in chairs and this guy whistled and a wave came over. My ears felt funny. We had to move as other people were getting seated. The chairs were really comfy. There was a whistle, and then an earthquake. Some people were testing out weapons which were causing the waves and earthquakes. We had to keep moving. Orlando Bloom was there?
