A man gives his girlfriend a single joint. Somehow, they are caught, and after a long, absurd trial, they are given concurrent sentences, but special sentences. She is sentenced to live in a solitary cell for seven years and he is sentenced to bring her all of her meals. The catch? He can only eat once he's brought her the food, and he can only stay for five minutes. So, three times a day, he's faced with the decision: "should I stuff my face, or should I go hungry this morning and be able to talk to the woman I love?" BLAH!! Creepy dream.
