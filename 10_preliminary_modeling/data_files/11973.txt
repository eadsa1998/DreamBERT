I saw this movie called Puke, which was a true story about a guy who got killed by a shark when he was on a pole and the shark jumped up and bit his head and then the shark died on the pole (it went through his middle). It was a hammerhead looking shark. I was telling Mom about it and I said that there was a real picture of it on the net of him, but I hadn't found it.
