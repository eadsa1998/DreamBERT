I was on the beach in Hawaii near the ocean. I was talking to several people. I don't know who was there except for Kendall B. He was there with his wife and kids. There was some other man there as well. I was talking to them. Kendall B's wife and kids got up and left. I continued talking to Kendall B. He said, we have to be very careful here like this. I thought he meant that he didn't want to be seen talking to me with no one else around. So I got up and walked further up on the beach and sat down. Kendall B came back up to me and asked me why I had left. I said it was because of what he said about being careful. He said, that's not what I meant. This is very sketchy. We talked some about what he meant. I'm in my hotel room and he comes in and we talk some more. I went back out to the beach and the palm trees were very low and very thick. I had to push the branches away to get down to the ocean. There were other people around but I don't remember any of them. I spent a little time in the ocean. Either Kendall B and some of his family or just his family were there. I went back with them to their room. I spent time with all of them there. He had two young boys. I was playing with the boys and they asked me to spend the night with them. They were all sharing one bed. I said they didn't have room for me and his wife said, sure we do. So we were all lying horizontally across the bed. His two boys wanted me to sleep in between the two of them. I don't remember if I ended up staying there or not but I did lie down in the bed with his wife and the two boys.
