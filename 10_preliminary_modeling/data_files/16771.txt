It's snowing, and my family is flying to a Vacation State. We miss the flight, and then try to convince a lady who works at the airport to find us another flight. We ask if we can use their computer server. She shows us the room where they keep their computers, but refuse to give the password to their computers. My father is on one of the computers. I find myself looking at a bunch of postcards or something of the sort that are hanging up with photos of Brittney Spears on them, and listening to a Billy Joel concert, song, or something like that. I couldn't hear the lyrics very well, but I was at a computer typing what came to me as good lyrics for that particular part of the song. I mean, while Billy Joel is singing, I'm typing some of my own lyrics for the song.
