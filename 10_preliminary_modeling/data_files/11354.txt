I So to the house of a music teacher to take lessons. On the wall he has a chart (like an oculist's letter chart) with which he is going to test my musical ability since I have never taken lessons before. These charts have pictures on them. For example one shows a rocket and the question is whether I know how the rocket works. He also asks me whether I know Spanish. Later I ask him whether with the violin or the piano and he says that we'll begin on the reed instruments. I am very nosy in his house and examine all the papers on his desk.
