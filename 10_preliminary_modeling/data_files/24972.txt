 I'm near Grassy field in Wilmerton. My friends Stephen Ramos and Sherman Andrews are in a soccer game. I am with a sort of "family, which includes my friend Kristy Puffy. We have a big recreational vehicle. Kristy asks me if I have a knife. Of course, I say, I always have a knife in my pocket, and pull it out. I shove a set of my classmate Fred Slick's oars into the back of the RV, and they break the windshield. I have the feeling of Harry and the Hendersons. There is an old man there and we are both chasing and eluding this "Harry" creature.
