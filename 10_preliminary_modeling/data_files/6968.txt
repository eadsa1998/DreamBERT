We were going to have Thanksgiving dinner and as R. and I had our initiation for 5 p.m. postponed, we would dine at 6:30. I began to help M. bring enough chairs. Some were theirs. I took back two of theirs and he said, "let me help carry them." I took two of ours and said, "these are lighter." Finally we were eating. The desert was applesauce with raisins topped with small candies and cream. I thought we'd have had a better dinner out.
