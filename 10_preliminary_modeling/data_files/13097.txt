I went to Midvale for some excursion type of thing. There was a teacher called Ms Clarke. I was with a group of girls and it was a sport activity and we were making up rules and throwing a pillow and getting points. Then we were talking. The teacher was complaining about me. She also said that I must be doing better without Derrick and I was like "Who is that?". I went home. The next day, I got home and I realized I'd forgotten my bag. I went back and searched everywhere. I found my DS, iPod and a Rayman game for the DS and another DS game. I realized my bag had been stolen. I somehow got into home and called Mom. We called my phone and this guy answered. He said that it was his girlfriend's phone. He asked me what the number was and I said "040440440, sorry, 38". He thought that I lied because I sounded nervous and I said "Well, I just had... stolen". I smashed Ms Clarke's car and burnt her house and got my stuff. I was at Mom's and the table was outside. I was on my laptop. There was this program thing where you can change a movie character to a person or something. I got Grimani from Casanova. I was like "What the hell do I want him for?! I want David Tennant!".
