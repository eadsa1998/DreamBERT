I was at a friend's house, there were 15-19 people there, ages 16-21, male and female, all but four friends of mine. There was one black and white dog. I felt fine during the dream. One girl (my best friend) got in a fight with another girl. She beat the other girl up and she (my friend) fell like three times and kept on hitting the other girl. The girl ran away and went home. My friend was like 5'2" and petite and the other girl was like 5'7" and HUGE!
