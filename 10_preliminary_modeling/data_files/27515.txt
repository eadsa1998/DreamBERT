I received an invitation to a bridge party and I got all dressed up to go. I remember wearing my blue suit. When I finally got to the party, there were many girls there, but few who I knew. I stayed there for a very long time when I realized that we were not playing bridge. I then thought to myself that I might be at the wrong party. I was very confused and embarrassed. I realized that I didn't know my hostess and that I had to hurry out of the house. I ran for hours till I finally got to the right party.
