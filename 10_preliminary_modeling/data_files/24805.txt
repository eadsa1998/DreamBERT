I was staying with Patrick for the summer. It wasn't his house, though. It was way out in the middle of nowhere, and his parents weren't around. He could drive (he backed out of the driveway at 50 mph), but we both rode mountain bikes to some dimly lit store where he wanted to buy a wooden model airplane. It was a long dream, but in most of it I seemed to be changing clothes. I would just get out of bed and change from sleepwear to normal clothes, or vice versa. I had a broken leg. Setting: At some old house that I've never seen, but that I thought of as Patrick's, and at a dim store. Characters: Patrick, my 15-year old cousin, lives in a small town in Missouri. He wrestles, plays in the marching band, and has a broken leg. His leg was broken in a wrestling match when the other guy didn't stop when the referee blew the whistle. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, neutral. I don't know why so much was unreal. I think "middle of nowhere" came from something I was reading. I was embarrassed about changing in front of my friend yesterday. I rode bikes with a friend yesterday. Also, yesterday I thought about driving for a while. It was a very long dream.
