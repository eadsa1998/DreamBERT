I dreamt that I was going to stay overnight in a fireman's house up north, and that I was packing my bed and stuff and getting in a tiny little car and going. When I got there, there were three other girls, and they had a swimming pool, but the house was real tiny, and it was a two-story house. It was kind of like I was living in this -- you know how movies are kind of gray sometimes? Well, everything looked gray. And I got there and there were three colors (?) by the front door, and a little scary thing in the back, and those things scared me a little. And I was talking to these girls, and they said that when you went to sleep, you would see ghosts and yellow things and I can't remember exactly; let me think. You would see ghost girls in yellow dresses singing a song. And sure enough, I did. And I wanted to get home because I forgot my bag of clothes and I forgot my lunch box at home. So the next morning they took me home again, and it was a Wednesday morning, and all of a sudden I had to be ready for school.
