I walk between a man and a baby. He hands me a book. I take it, saying, "I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were playing with the baby. I didn't mean to interfere with your game." He has warm eyes and watches me. I continue shopping. I find a bin with things in it. I find a black graduation tassel. I look up and see the man watching me. I have a hard time making eye contact. I feel a little flustered and embarrassed. I see the baby on a couch propped up with pillows drinking a bottle. She starts to sit up and falls off the couch. I run to catch her. So does he. I pick her up, cooing to her. She's all damp from spilt milk and sweat and urine. I say, "Let's get you cleaned up, then you'll be more comfortable." I hug her. She has dark, curly hair. The man approves.
