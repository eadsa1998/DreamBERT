Going upstairs in a long blue velvet veil, a bridal veil, made up of curtains back from the cleaners. I am being teased about getting married in such an outfit. I say, "Well I'd do it for my second marriage, since I couldn't wear white." Shift: It is raining. Kids playing in a garden. I see Marita caught in a fierce torrent of a mill stream, am barely able to rescue her.
