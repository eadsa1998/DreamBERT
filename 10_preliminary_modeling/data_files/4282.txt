["Gay man is my protection."] I am in Duffy's tavern alone. I see Tom Hanks sitting alone at a table. I sit down with him and say "You are gay. He is startled. I then say I'd like to sit with you so it looks like we are together. I don't want to be hit on. I just want to have fun and dance and maybe meet a nice guy. He thinks that's an OK idea. We are alibis for each other.
