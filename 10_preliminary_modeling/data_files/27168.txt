I dreamt that I was at the C-- skating club at a carnival. I don't remember being with anyone in particular. There were a great many people standing around however. I remember sitting on the built up stands and watching the skaters go through their various acts. And then the show was over and all the people were slowly leaving and it was getting later and later. I was sitting on the steps that lead up into the coat room. Everyone that went by me seemed to not see me although I was sitting there with no clothes on but some kind of a blanket over me. I remember asking everyone to bring me my clothes so I could go home, but they seemed not to hear me. For some reason I had the feeling that I couldn't move. Finally there was no one around but I still couldn't move. At this point I woke up.
