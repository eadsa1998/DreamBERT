I was waiting in a boarding house with my daughter (a toddler) for my husband to arrive. My brother and his wife were there, as was my father. I thought everyone had agreed on where and when we were all going away on a short holiday, but everyone began changing their minds. My husband was running later than expected and the others seemed to be packed and ready to go somewhere else. I felt uninvited and unwelcome in their plans. My daughter and I went outside into the dimly lit street as we thought we could see my husband's car.
