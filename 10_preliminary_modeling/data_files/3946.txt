["Upset with Mary Sue"]  I have knitted some sleeves for a sweater for a costume and we trying it on the actress and they didn't fit right and Mary Sue was very upset. She said these sleeves have to be done right, no matter what. So I got the sleeves, I was annoyed with the actress who was not being very cooperative and I said are you sure these don't fit. Let's try them on one more time and she says Oh, I'm tired,  I feel too warm tonight, so I try them on her again and I see they almost fit.. but I'm going to have to redo both sleeves over again, because  I have to make the cuff wider and the sleeve itself a bit longer and wider in the shoulder area. This was going to require a couple of extra days of work for me and we had a deadline.  Mary Sue was a little bit upset with me and said You've got to get them done, that's all I have to say.
