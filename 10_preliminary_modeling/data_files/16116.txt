I was celebrating my birthday in the middle of October. I was trying to show Mom how to draw the amplifier in the living room and how to make the perspective when some people started showing up for the party and I realized that I forgot to call my friends and invite them to the party. But there were people showing up to the house that I didn't even know. They were really rough teenagers and stuff, and they were bringing presents. And one of them brought me a little church ornament from Spain. I remember I was going to tape the party, so I went up to get the recorder and I put a tape in it and it started making this squeaking noise and that meant it was getting eaten up. And I just put it there and I decided I didn't have time for that.
