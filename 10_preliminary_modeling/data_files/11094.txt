Several people were telling me of somebody's death. Evidently he had been killed in an automobile crash. Everybody in my group, consisting of B-W students, seemed to know this fellow. He evidently had been a student here, but I couldn't quite catch the name. The next week I discovered it was Jack Obert. He was pinned to a sorority sister of mine, but she didn't seem to be affected. I remember going by the Lambda Chi house and I wondered why they didn't have a black wreath on the door. In what seemed to be the next week in the dream, I learned some of the details of the crash such as it happened in Euclid and a truck crashed into a car in which Jack had been a passenger.
