L.Z. (analyst). We are at a big wild party and I see L.Z. dressed as a fisherman. Large slouch hat, red/black striped t-shirt. He is standing at the counter. Then we kiss and he holds me very close. Later talk with him in the corridor. He compliments me: "You have beautiful hair." And I say, "You don't look so bad yourself. Better than in the office."
