My taxi driver takes off his clothes and dives into his own river. He is happy and relieved to be in his own river and not mine. His river has forked off mine. He calls his river "Pegasus." He floats along in oblivion. His nose hinges up so he can lay face down and still breathe. He's not watching where he's going and I see he's headed into a slough with lots of brown foam on it. I pull him out and save his life. He is appreciative.
