There is a bad guy that can emanate some horrible, painful sound or radiation that keeps everyone his prisoner. Just at the moment he turns it on, I as a superman kind of being disintegrate and disperse my molecules as I fly up and away. He's upset I got away. But now I must go back and fight him in order to save my family, now frozen in his power. I go, via instructions from some feminine voice, to a platform up in the clouds and there are some remote control-like game boards in a basket. I pick up one. The voice says, "This one can be adapted well." I look at it closer. It is a chess game, electronic. I say "Ah, the good old chess game," satisfied it can be modified to fight this powerful man and save my family. I turn it over and look at the back side of it and see the tiny shapes of the black "men" or pieces. I want to review the rules of how they are allowed to move. [BL]
