I was in a room with a ledge near the ceiling, kind of as if it were an indoor pool with a low ceiling, but there was no water. I had a pink balloon animal of some sort.  It slipped out of my hand and floated to the ceiling.  A white ball floated up too.  When they touched the ceiling they shrank (didn't pop, just deflated) and came back down.  My coworkers from the flower shop told me I should take vitamin C.  I think I said okay, but didn't really want to take any.  I left the room and talked to our neighbor (female) about a song of some sort.  Then I was in a parking garage with some old high school classmates.  There was also a tall man, who introduced himself as "Reno", supposedly the husband of my old coworker from the detox facility Leela.
