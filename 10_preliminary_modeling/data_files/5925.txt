I am running for a train or a subway, am not sure which. A long fence runs between the tracks and I realize that I really wanted the train, but that I am on wrong side of fence and cannot get back to train side. I go to the subway station and buy a New York Times. Price is only 5 cents and I wonder why still the old price of years ago. At station I show a letter with an address (have trouble opening the letter) to the change clerk. I get on, but am not sure I am still going in the right direction.
