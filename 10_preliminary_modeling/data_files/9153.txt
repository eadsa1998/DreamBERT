Cliff S returns. I was one person on a team that was helping to run an event. Cliff S was also on the team. He was single again and had heard that I was too. He came up to me and gave me his high school class ring. He had ordered two of them, way back then, and had been keeping one to give to me some day. He was wearing one of them and it looked normal. The one he had saved for me looked just like and it didn't. The stone in it was a couple of inches high, reminding me almost of an obelisk. The stone was ruby red, just like the stones in our class rings. I was thinking about the fact that we never did get that first date that he wanted so long ago. I was actually kind of happy about the possibility of finally spending some time with him and seeing how we would get along.
