Don't remember much.  Scanning the houses below from the cliff.  They weren't so much houses, just simple gumdrop sort of dwellings.  No decor, simple blocks with rounded corners, a few cracks, a bulge where the door is.  Very nondescript.  Descent to a mint green building.  Desolate barren area, like the rebuilding after a huge war.  No windows on the dwellings, as they were impractical.  The houses were small as most of the living space was underground, away from the desolation and heat/radiation.  I was a lonely man staying in the mint green house, the other houses seemed to be empty.  There was a strange woman with an odd aura of periwinkle.  Don't remember the rest, it was too strange.  My boyfriend's brother Jeff was there.
