I dreamt that I was coming to do my sleeping, sleep research, but instead of being here, I was in some downtown area outside. It didn't look, I didn't recognize where we were, where I was. I met these people, a man and his son who lived in the area, and he let me borrow his truck to go home that evening so that I wouldn't have to call anybody. And he said that I'd have to have the truck back by 10 o'clock the next morning, but that I could have it until then. <br/
