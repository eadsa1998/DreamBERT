Al from Dill's said, "I'm going to play Sidewalls and he is and was a good horse." I asked him where he was running and he said in Kentucky. I looked at the tracks in a book and I saw the Kentucky track. I looked at a couple races there and didn't see Sidewalls and I awoke. Ann was driving my car. We were riding. My sister Ann was with us. I looked out in a distance and saw Al Lasko's wife Eleanor. I said, "Look, there is Al's wife." Ann said, "She looks like you," my sister Ann. We came close and I saw another woman that looked like Al's wife, but she was younger and prettier. I seemed to be at a Florida track or tropical now.
