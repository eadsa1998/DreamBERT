I was running through the forest in the back of our house and I met animals that could talk, not in words, but in only some way I could understand them. I figured out that only I could understand them, because when I brought a bird home and it started talking to me, my mom couldn't hear it. Only me. Setting: In my house and outside my house. Characters: There was two deer, a few raccoons, many birds. There was also my mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad. I felt happy in the beginning of the dream because I found the bird. Then I felt sad because I had brought home the bird yet no one could understand it but me.
