 I'm delivering newspapers in the early morning. I don't know if I'll have enough newspapers to deliver to all the houses. It is the Metropolis newspaper. I try to remember the correct houses: which houses cancelled subscriptions and which started subscriptions. I may be one newspaper short, for Mike Cherry's house.
