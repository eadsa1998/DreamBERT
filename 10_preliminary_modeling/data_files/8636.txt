I'm at the computer working on an Excel sheet. I have columns of numbers and I keep moving things around. I'm cutting and pasting groups of numbers from one column into another, but not always the bottom. Sometimes I'm inserting them into the middle of a column of existing numbers. I'm getting frustrated trying to make it work. whatever it is that I'm trying to do. It almost looks like a card game like Solitaire or Free Cell. It looks like that kind of numbers and it almost as though I'm trying to put them in order like you would if you were playing one of those games.
