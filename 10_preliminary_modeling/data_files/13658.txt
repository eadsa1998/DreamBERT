We were at some place. This guy and I were in a cubby house out the back of the place. We decided to bash up this cat to get at the owners. We pretended that it fell off the roof of the cubby, but I had actually kicked it a bunch of times. I was worried that they would notice the marks weren't caused by a fall. They couldn't work out what was wrong with it but suspected that it was us that hurt it. It got better and she made it follow me, by using smell. I could smell too. We were then going to the road (from Nana's) and were trying to hitchhike. A big van stopped and there were two people in the front, but the back of the car wasn't very big. They realized it wouldn't fit people and left. The police kept coming. We started walking down the street towards home. Elijah was then there and he reminded me that Mom had to straighten my hair. There was something about mini golf.
