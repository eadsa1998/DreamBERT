["Scary forest."] I am with a group of teens. In a house in a scary forest. I am packing for a journey we will take out in the forest. I look out the open front door and see a large body of water. In it are some of the teens trying to capture large eels that look like giant tadpoles. I am concerned for them. Those eels can be dangerous. But the teens catch them by their tail and drag them onto shore. I continue packing. I put some sanitary pads or diaper pads in my purse. I remember I hadn't removed the used ones from yesterday. I take two out and throw them away. They stink. Now we go out to the edge of the forest. The main entrance will be very dangerous so we decide to go around to the side. We enter and I am worried the forest floor will cave in under us. Pitfalls. And we don't know where they are. There are monsters in the forest. They are already coming closer to attack. We are concerned but ready to defend ourselves.
