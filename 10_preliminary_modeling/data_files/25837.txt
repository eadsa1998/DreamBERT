 I see my friend Nate Nelling. He is happy to see me. There is a room of kids taking the ACT test. The kids are too young to be taking the test. The boys seem young. They cheat by looking at each other's tests. They cheat in such a way so they will fail the test even though they cheat, because they cross out and scribble over the multiple choose answers that they don't want, and put a check mark by the answer they do want. They are dumb. I may hear from Nate that Scottie Pippen has committed suicide because he was forced to or unknowingly received an injection in his ankle to operate, remove, or repair his anterior cruciate ligament. Michael Jordan is at the free throw line. He misses two free throws. He walks into the locker room with a suit and tie on limping. He shakes peoples hands as he walks.
