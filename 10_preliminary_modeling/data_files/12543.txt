This guy met this girl, Sarah, in a club. She was a 'bad guy'. Then they were in a carpark and he said "Let me in your car" and then he tried getting into the car. This black guy started walking towards the car and they got scared, but he was just asking for directions. Then there was this place near this beach. There were little plaques along the beach; one of them was 17 July 1909. There were lots of them from 2003. I was then at Nana's and she had a skipping rope of Mackenzie's. She had given it to me a while ago and asked me if I'd given it back to her yet and I said that I hadn't yet. But I didn't plan to because I didn't like and because she was always being flirty with Dmitri.
