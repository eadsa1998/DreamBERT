The chicken was acting real broody, sitting on the nest and being real ornery, and there wasn't really any eggs for her to sit on. [laugh] And so we went to Rosa Hickam's and got some eggs that we knew were fertile. Currently they just kind of sold fertile eggs in my dream, and we put them in the nest for her to sit on and there were about six of them. And all this was in a cardboard box in the garage, when really the chicken usually sits on some sheets out by the sink. And one time during my dream I was looking into the box to see what the eggs were doing, and the chicken pecked my face. And that was really it, and then I woke up.
