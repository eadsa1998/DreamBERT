I was at some place. I was in some group with Liliana, Classmate-F-18 and some other randoms. Liliana had driven to the place we were at. I was walking around some of it and I walked past Ms Hampson and I think that guy, I think his name is Classmate-M-25, was also with her. Then I past that other Darren guy playing tennis by himself, and he hit one backwards and almost hit me.
