This dream took place in a large room which is unfamiliar to me. In this room was a long table and on it were some presents and some graduation pictures of me. The room was filled with people - neighbors, friends and relatives. Two of my neighbors, who are 8 and 12 years of age, were standing near the table passing out my graduation pictures to anyone who wanted them. I was trying to stop them and at the same time I was wondering how I was going to pay for them. The gifts on the table were for me. I opened them and each gift seemed to be a deck of playing cards except the last one I opened. It was yarn for knitting, knitting needles, and all the necessary implements needed to knit socks. I remember thinking to myself that now I would have to learn to knit.
