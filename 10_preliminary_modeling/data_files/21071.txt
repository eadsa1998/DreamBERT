I came to the school door weeping and there were handkerchiefs hanging on the door. I walked into the hall and went into a room where there were all girls but one man. I made a sign of the cross, knelt beside the bed and started to pray when I noticed I had my hat on. A lady was monkeying with two lamps on the window sill and couldn't fix them right, so I got up and tried to adjust them, but had a hard time getting the shades right. Boys were playing ball in the schoolyard. I found a nickel with a hole in it. I saw a truck loaded with broken glass. I bought a flashlight. The button slid all the way down. It was a zipper. It opened up.
