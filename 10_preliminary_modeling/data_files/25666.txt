 I'm waiting in a place for a man to meet me. We are either meeting at 11:00am or 1:00 pm. He is late. He then pulls up in a big, white, dirty, country truck. He says he didn't remember the time, or he got the time confused. With him are his three sisters. One is about 15 years old, another about nine, and the third about five. They have another truck there. We are supposed to go to Riverton for a basketball game. When I remind him of this he says we'll have to go home to his house and get the van to drive. His two oldest sisters take one truck. I go with him and his youngest sister in another truck.
