My analyst Mitchell has shaved off his beard, and he is hiding behind a brown curtain and underneath some pillows; HE LOOKS LIKE TRITON. Mitchell's friend comes in wearing brown pants with a rip in the back. Later I see Mitchell with his beard, emerging from the bedroom; I laugh and promise to tell more in the next hour. -- I am steering a boat down a winding chute: very fast; thrilling; I LAND ON THE WATER.
