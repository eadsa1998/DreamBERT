I am working at my alma mater.  I am in charge of a storeroom where I have stored lots of boxes which I hope to be able to use for a future move.  A man accompanied by a couple of higher-ups at my alma mater come to me and ask if this guy can use one of our boxes.  I don't like to give up my boxes, but what can I do?  I show him the boxes in the storage room, and fortunately he choose one which I would not have used anyway-a large wooden box with a hinged top.  He is going to use it for shipping some kind of old-fashioned computing machine, which I remember having seen in his department.   A little later, two women come by to pick up something which I made for them-some kind of model castle, I believe.  I have also made some kind of costume for them.  One is an Asian woman-perhaps an older student-and she puts a colorful basket on her head; it looks pretty good on her, and she likes it.  The other woman is Arab.  She already has a head scarf, but whatever the other costume is, she is happy with it too.  I have already been working past the hours I was hired for, and it is about 4:30 in the afternoon, but I notice that the supply room in the department where I am working is a mess, and I think it will make people surprised and happy if I clean it up.  The floor is covered with leaves and trash, and I begin looking for a broom.  Then I come to my senses and wonder why I should offer to do this for the people who fired me; I feel almost disgusted with myself for even having thought of doing it.
