I'm at home but not my real house. It looks like I'm in the countryside. I looked to one of the boys at my mom's daycare and I see this blonde little guy (he's American) with red dots on his face. They look more like paint. But I knew they are not. I began telling my mother that the kid had "chicken pox" and that he was going to give to my daughter. I said, "chicken pox," just like that and in English. So I said to my mom that I was going to tell the boy's father before he leaves for work. I caught him just as he was getting into his car. (He looks a lot like Professor Divine.) He said that he was going to check on his kid . . . Time passes and he never went to check upon the kid.
