I was watching Le Samourai but it was different. It started off with Alain Delon working in a sushi place. There was a long fresh spring roll on a plate and he pointed at it and said "Le Samourai" and he sounded Japanese. A friend of Dad's on Facebook said it was awesome and said that he 'kind of wanted to have sex with Alain Delon'. He also ranked the 'of the Deads'; Day of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead (original), Night of the Living Dead then Dawn of the Dead (remake). I said Dawn of the Dead was one of my favourites and that the remake was good too. There was a movie with Eduardo Noriega and Vera Farmiga. Dad complained about Farmiga. We went on our holiday and I felt like orange juice. There was a lot of it around. There was a self-serve machine but the cups were like, folded up paper and I spilt it. I put some chocolate in my pocket and went into a shop. A security guard asked me about it and I pulled it out and they asked me to leave it outside.
