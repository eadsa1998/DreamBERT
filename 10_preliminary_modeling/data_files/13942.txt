I was at school and Calvin called me to ask if it was a pupil free day tomorrow. I said yes and then said no. I had a text from Evelyn asking the same thing and I said no again and then said "sorry, yes I got confused". At the end of the day, I was waiting for Mom at a different spot. I went to the other side of the road and Eugene was there. Mom walked up to me and said she parked the car somewhere else. Eugene was playing with a manhole lid. Mom said to him "be careful" and introduced herself and Eugene was looking at us.
