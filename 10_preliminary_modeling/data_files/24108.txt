I had this dream at the beginning of the school year, which is my first year here at UC Santa Cruz. In my dream I'm leaving a party or gathering of some type that was being held at the Stevenson dining hall. I told my friends, Clara and Linda, who I recently met at the time that I was going home to get something that I had forgotten. On my way to the door, I ran into the Stevenson College provost who asked me where I was running off to. I told him I'd be back. I remember him handing me a banana. On my way home, I was walking through a forest, well not a forest, but I was walking through some trees here at UCSC. At one point I was walking at a very narrow side walk with nothing on each side of me, but tall trees. I looked to my right and there was a huge snake. I was very, very afraid and I jumped back to my left and when I did this I looked down and I was stepping in a pile of rattle snakes, so I ran home. When I ran home it ended up being my home in LA. And I felt safe there. The last thing I did in my dream was call my new friends at UCSC and tell them I wasn't going back because of the big snake I saw.
