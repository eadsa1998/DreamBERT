On our way to the cafeteria, Mrs. Lind and another woman left their wraps but I carried my raincoat along. Then I realized I had no money with me and asked Mrs. Lind to lend me $1.00 until after lunch for my money was all up in my third-floor room. She did and we walked along in the line, she ahead. I decided on a drumstick and rice. Mrs. Lind asked what kinds of dessert. He named two strange kinds, one of which was with green peppers.
