I was at this place with my "friends". There was Mary (House of 1000 Corpses) and her boyfriend, this other girl and Mike (The Young Ones) except he didn't have the same personality. Mike and I were dating or something. I had known them for a few months and I was staying with them for Christmas. Some strange stuff happened and we ended up in the basement or something where this big evil ghost guy came out and was going to kill us. One of us burnt him but something happened and the other girl that was with us got possessed, and then she died. We then got out of there.
