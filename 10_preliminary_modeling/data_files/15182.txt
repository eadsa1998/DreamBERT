Something happened and heaps of people got powers. Some people got kidnapped. One guy's legs weren't working, presumably because he was getting used to his power. His girlfriend was Japanese and she was on a ship. I was one of the kidnapped people. We escaped. She returned and had a power. Then she and the guy were at a Laundromat together. A guy, who was Death, was in court because he was going to die? Rainn Wilson got into an argument with him and it was in all newspapers. Death was with us and was sleeping on the couch. Gizmo and Cuddles were sleeping near him. I grabbed a newspaper and read a story next to him. He woke up and wanted the paper and I threw it at him. He asked if the guy [Rainn Wilson] was "Dwight Schrute from The Office" and I confirmed it was. I was reading something that said Alexander Skarsgard was only 19 and I didn't believe it. Someone asked what my power was and I said 'I guess you could call it women's intuition' -- I could 'feel' others' feelings. Mom and I had bought/rented a shop in a shopping centre.
