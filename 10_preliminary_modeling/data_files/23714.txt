I am taken hostage by a young woman with a gun.  It is a school-like area.  She had taken others or killed others just before me.  She makes me go into a bathroom.  We go in one stall, stand on the  toilet.  First she says she wants to watch me pee.  I do this for her readily.  Then we press up to one another, we start to kiss, necks, ears.  I really like this woman.  I want to be a lesbian.  Some kids start to come in the bathroom.  We yell at them to leave or take the consequences, i.e. being shot.  They scurry out.  We get back into each other.  I am sad because I really like this woman and am torn between this feeling and knowing she is a killer and psychotic.  At one point she asks if I was going to kiss her on the lips, looking at me like that would be too intense.  I like being near her femininity, her softness, slim thighs and lovely waist.  We go to a stall further down, the walls are higher.  She has to pee.  I wait in the next stall.  I think of telling her "I'm right here."  I care for her a lot.  I want to know what it's like to have a woman lover.  As we were walking down to the higher stall, a young man pops in the door - whispers - "Tara! - Lions, right here!"  He gestures to an area of the bathroom.  He means that in a few minutes they are going to bust in and have a big shootout and I'm to scurry to that area because that's where the protectors, the "Lions", the good guys, will be.  I look at the woman;  she seems to either ignore the statement and the man, or to have not heard him.  This is why I am protective and caring when she goes to pee.  Because I know soon will be the big shootout and she'll be shot.  I wake up slightly.  I think of escaping out a window with her and running away with her.
