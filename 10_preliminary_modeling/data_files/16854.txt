I go to visit a client with my colleague Karl. The client exists in waking life, and is eccentric yet pedantic, and a bit of a control freak. In the dream his offices are bright, white and modern, and he has a host of attractive girls as staff. He takes Karl and I to a restaurant, which we walk to over some distance through fine powdery snow, even though the temperature seems very warm, like high summer. At the end of the walk we all gather on a playing field on the edge of a village, together with a hundred or so other young people - mainly girls. Karl, who is single, attempts a backward somersault in front of everybody to get attention and impress the girls. He rather clumsily manages it and gets a round of applause. He creates a puff of powdery snow when he lands (which may be dust instead of snow due to the warm temperature). Next my clients, Karl and I go for a meal in an Indian restaurant in the village. My client drives us to a car park round the back of the restaurant in his brand new car. He leaves me the car key to park the car while he gets a table. I somehow manage to roll the car down some steps towards the entrance to the restaurant, but I manage to pull it back up. I take out what is meant to be the car key from my pocket, but instead the key looks like a brass desk key, yet totally smooth with no protrusions. I put my hand in my pocket again, and this time pull out a normal car key, and I lock the car. In the restaurant, for some reason my client has segregated Karl and I from the rest of the party. We are to eat alone in a cubed, disused hallway at the back of the building. Karl and I are sat several paces away from each other around the bend of the hallway, so we can't even see each other. We have a set of personal stereo headphones with a very long cable and perhaps little microphones and headphones on either end, which we use to communicate.
