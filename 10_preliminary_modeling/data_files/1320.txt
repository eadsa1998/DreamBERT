Dovre, Ellie, and I are going to take a walk to a gift store. We are in Mexico City. I decide that I could use my wheelchair and find downtown and really shop. Ellie argues with me and I give her a lecture about not spoiling things. I look at earrings. They are very expensive. The next store has bottled pickles or something. We leave there. We ask a man where the street is to go downtown. No answer. We walk down the hall. I see Zoe gardening. We ask her how to get to Mexico City. She laughs at us and says, "Over there, highway 101." She and Mabel get in an argument and keep looking at me like I'm the mediator. I don't want the job. I decide not to go.
