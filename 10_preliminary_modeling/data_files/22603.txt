The only thing that I remember about the dream is that they were building a bridge for cars, and when the construction of this one was over, they built another one for people. The bridge that was already in existence was terrible. Three men "tried it out" and they fell several times, and they ended up being extremely tired. The surroundings and the people were unknown to me, and I don't remember being in the dream.
