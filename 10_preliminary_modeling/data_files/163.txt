I've brought Tree, who is elderly and not well, "home" - as if we've been staying out in the country somewhere - as well as 3 baby possums. I'm looking at a picture book of nursery rhymes and (fairy tales, I guess) - it's quite large, with color pictures. The babies and Tree are perched at the top as if they're tucked between pages, and I'm turning them, to find some story with possums in it (or are they foxes?) where the babies can live. And one for Tree, so I can give him a nice home to retire in. I'm trying not to think about that - it's too painful. I don't want to let him go, don't want to send him away. And I say to myself, "he's only 12 years old! He could live a long time yet!" Cats can get to be 16 or older - that's another 4 years, maybe. A couple of other people are with me and we're running from some bad guys, gangsters, in a place like a warehouse, with barrels and bundles in it. They're going to come through the door and it looks like we can't get out but by the time they come through we've got up to the ceiling and through a trapdoor or something into the room above and we're away.
