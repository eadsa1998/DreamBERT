I'm at work but maybe not actually my office - doesn't look it. I'm on the phone with a branch manager who's trying to handle a book returned in some way she couldn't handle - wanted to know how to handle it and somehow it's turned around - it's Friday and she can't raise anybody for advice. She's pissed, she's gotten me by trying to locate somebody "official" who'll know what to do. I tell her I used to work at PF and OL and I know what to do more or less but I did know I could get hold of someone who could tell me for sure - thinking of Ann rather than Alma. She keeps rattling and the connection gets bad - I have to keep asking her to repeat. She's dubious about whether I know what I was talking about - if I really worked at a branch? which branch? - like that - till I had to be firm and try to get her to let me either put her on hold or call her back.
