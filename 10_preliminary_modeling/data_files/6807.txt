Start to wrote notes on a paper and then realize it was someone else's paper so stop and apologize to the owner. Then I can't find the notes. Turn the paper and see ads, say there was a blank space in midst of pictures of houses. Finally find words written in yellowish green. People are leaving now. I gather up my things, five articles finally manage all in one hand, my steam iron and 4 smaller articles.
