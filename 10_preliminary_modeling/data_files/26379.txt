 I'm sitting with my friends Kristy Puffy, Kevin Simpson, and Jackie Hunter in an apartment on the east side of Wilmerton. I eat an apple out of a small refrigerator. The door falls off the refrigerator. It is unattached, but will still stick to the refrigerator. I make conversation with Kristy, asking her a question about the party with her and Fred Slick. She answers. I say that Jackie was in a dream I had recently. I really want to talk with Jackie, but I feel uncomfortable, like the bad guy, because she never talks to me and is never friendly.
