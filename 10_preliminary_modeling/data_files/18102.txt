Two nights ago I had a dream that we were in New York City and I had to take this little kid named Eric -- I had to take care of him. And we were in my school, and the school was deserted. So I put him in a stroller, and we and my mother and my father, we were walking around because we couldn't find the exit, and there was my Master from Tae Kwon Do and we said hi. And then all of a sudden I saw a big plane up in the sky and one of them ran into one of the World Trade Centers, and so then we started running and we got out of the school. And then we went to the streets of New York City and one of the World Trade Centers fell down. And so my mother and me and my father, we went to the train station and there was a lady sitting there, and she said, "Okay, I need your social security number." And my mother told her whatever, her social security number, and then the lady just sat there. And it was really weird. And then the second World Trade Center fell down, and I woke up. This was a really bad dream.
