There was a rumor that somebody had killed a teacher up on the third floor of the Media Center, and some boys, who were the suspects, were riding the elevator and kind of playing on it for like two hours. And all of a sudden the elevator started making these funny sounds that it had never made before, and I thought, "Oh boy, the elevator's getting mad." (laugh) And then I went down to the courtyard in front of the Media Center, and I smelled this toxic chemical, and a boy said that it would make us realize our knowledge of acoustics. And I woke up.
