In this dream I was crawling on all fours across a number of railroad tracks. As I scrambled over each successive pair of tracks I remember looking down the shiny rails and seeing locomotives approaching from a distance. I got across the five or six pairs of parallel rails unscathed and found myself walking on a bright steel platform. As I walked along, the steel sides of the ramp angled in until they joined in a small room. I entered the room and found that it was an elevator. I was vaguely conscious that there were several other people in the elevator besides myself. After our descent seemingly underground, I found myself a prisoner of soldiers who I took to be Germans by their uniforms and incoherent speech. I was marched down a long corridor and finally confined in a small room with a guard. The dream ended here.
