Our class was leaving somewhere (they were very excited) and some kids were going on these airplanes and some kids were going on buses, but the last 10 kids were going (on) gurneys even though they weren't hurt, and they were going on a bus. Setting: School. Characters: I know all of them. They were the people in the 5th grade class. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, mad. I don't know. It was a very weird and random dream.
