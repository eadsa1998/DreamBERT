Frank and I are at a restaurant where there is a very NARROW space between our table and the wall; I feel squeezed. Our friend Jonathan's poems are projected unto a chalk board; also some of WALLY's paintings; John complains because it is too "commercial" but I say there isn't anything we can do about that. I think it is OK.
