During my dream I was at home working on something. At dusk I had almost finished my work. I decided to go look for a friend at his home. When I got there, he was in the garage of the house, which is very big. I rang the doorbell as though I hadn't seen him, and nobody came to answer. I was looking at him out of the corner of my eye to see if he had seen me because he was talking to someone inside the car, his mother and a friend. I kept on ringing the doorbell and while I waited, his servant started to appear, but suddenly he came over to me and hurriedly lifted me and he greeted me with much friendship and effusiveness. We went to the car talking and he told me to get in, and his mother also greeted me very nicely. We started a pleasant conversation and then the brother of my friend came out. I was surprised to learn that he was living at home because he had married a few days earlier and they had told me that he had an apartment near the house. I was more surprised when we went with him to his wife who lived across the street, and they greeted each other only as friends. Then she came over to the car and greeted all of us. Suddenly my friend and I got out of the car and while we were walking, a servant who works next to my house and who is rather fresh, came over. He is about my size and he started to ask me questions about my family, about what they did, that is, as though he were investigating me. And this irritated me and I first slapped him, but I was too angry and hit him several times and asked him about the questions he was making and he just stammered. I forced him to answer me and warned him not to ask about my family, especially me, and I grabbed him by the lapels. And at that moment he looked like a boy of 12 or 14 and I pushed him away from me, and I calmly went on talking to my friend as though nothing had happened. That was the end of it.
