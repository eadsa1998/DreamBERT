A few days ago I watched half of this movie that had Joshua Jackson in it. Then it was today and I watched the rest of it. At the end he had turned fat and this girl had turned skinny. Everyone fell to their stomach. Some people melted because it was hot. I was watching it with Dad. There was a battle between Joshua Jackson's character (who was not him now) and Maryann (True Blood). It was in like an elevator. She did something with air and fizzy water and she said she was "a water Pokemon". He attacked her for a while but she was fine and attacked him and he got owned. He brought comic book characters out to help, one of them was Batman. In real life I was then at home and Joshua Jackson or his character was there. Some friends turned crazy and tried to kill us. We locked them outside and we ran next door. We knocked and they let us in. There were lots of people there all lazing about. A guy was on the phone. A friend and I picked up the other phone and were listening to his conversation. He was talking to a guy and it sounded like they were in a relationship.
