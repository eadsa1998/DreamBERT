I went to visit Terry D. He and his wife lived in the country, but I don't know what town. I was talking to him but I was also outside with his wife, talking to her while she hung laundry on the clothesline. Primarily what I noticed her hanging was underwear. It didn't really bother me but I thought Terry might be embarrassed by that. Later we were in their town. He and some other woman were showing me around town. They had all of these underground passages, where you could walk around town and be safe from the elements. You wouldn't have to be cold or hot or get wet or anything. We were talking about the pros and cons of that versus walking around outdoors. Carriage rides wouldn't be as much fun there. But it was nice not to have to deal with very cold weather. It was as though all four sides of these passages were all brick. but a finished brick that was very smooth to the touch and very pretty colors. Yellow is the color I remember. They weren't just straight walkways. Some of them curved and some were hilly, for lack of a better word. I was with Bob F and we had these little cars on a sort of map. We were racing our cars and the map or path was very windy and such. These little cars had things sticking out from the bottom, similar to toy racecars my brothers had when they were younger. This map had a track. I was automatically going to win because I was in front of his four cars. It was just one lane. We also said something about his four sons.
