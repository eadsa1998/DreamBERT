We (residents of K. D. Home) were eating breakfast in another dining room around one long table. I asked Miss W. if there was any bread for toast. "No." And these muffins aren't so good for me. May I have some more butter? as I butted a muffin. "Yes." So I took a pat from a saucer containing 5 or 6 pats. (Yellow. Then I remembered I had been forbidden butter by doctor.) "I forgot too," says Miss W. Then I will get some of my marmalade and go into the old dining room for it but my table there is bare. I go back and say, "My marmalade is gone which I bought just the other day and it was a full jar." I sit down and reach for a corner piece of cornbread. Pieces of it and of muffin are scattered on the tablecloth. Miss C. pushes my hand off and takes it and when I reach for another corner she grabs my hand. I protest that as she has one corner, she should let me take the other.
