I am playing a guitar with Rolling Stones, sort of an audience member asked up, and I surprise them by being very good. Now they will let me be a member of the band. We go to the trailer that we travel in to sleep. There are three bedrooms but many band members, so I must share the bedroom with Mick Jagger. There are three beds and he sleeps in one and I the other. As I sleep, he gets up and stands next to my bed, looking at me. He likes me. It is gentle. Then he gets in bed with me. I wake up and am upset. I "knew" he'd try something. But he doesn't try anything. He just watches me.
