I was in a mall with my cousin and ran into one of my old male friends - I didn't want to talk to him but we ended up going to a movie and he annoyed me and I wished I hadn't come. Next I knew I was in the mall, alone this time, and I was walking into a candy store. I didn't recognize the place but in my dream I knew where I was. The boy was 16 and we were good friends until we had a fight and haven't talked since.
