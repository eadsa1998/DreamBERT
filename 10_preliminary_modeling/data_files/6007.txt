There is a woman who is the wife of someone else appearing earlier in the dream. Just to do something wild, she throws plastics bags filled with English Muffins into the swimming pool water and then she goes underwater herself. Inside the water it is peaceful and very quiet and she enjoys just sitting there, isolated from the outside world. She stands up and stares at the surface of the water which has now become a vertical wall rather than a horizontal ceiling. "It's nice here, but I can't live without oxygen", she thinks to herself, and she pokes her head through the vertical wall to the outside world. Now it is suddenly quite noisy.
