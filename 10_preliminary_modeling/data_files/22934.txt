My wife Bonita and I were in a house somewhere down India Grove Highway..  It was a very small house -- more like a medium-size trailer -- and it sat well off the road, with nothing between it and the road.  It was early morning, and Bonita was getting ready to go to work, I to class.  Apparently we had to be at our respective destinations at the same time, and were going to ride together.  It was one of these dreams in which I can't get ready on time.  I don't remember what all the problems were until it came time to leave and turn out the lights, when I found that there were more lights on in the place than there should even have been lights, and I couldn't even find the switches to half of them-but that was only one of a long string of frustrations.  By then, my class was about half over anyway.  Somehow it also turned out that I was going to have to ride a motorcycle, either alone or with Bonita, which I wanted to do, but when I tried to put on my helmet, it wouldn't fit for some reason, which meant that I was going to have to make a complete change of clothes.  I woke up feeling exhausted.
