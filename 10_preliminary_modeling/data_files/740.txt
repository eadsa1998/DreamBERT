I received a package. There were lots of letters in it and a pair of frozen hands. I started reading the letters to figure out what happened. It was addressed to M. Ford. Apparently, a guy I had met there (blonde, blue eyes) had been sent to Vietnam and "bought" it. He had asked the army to send his hands to me so I could have new, transplanted hands.
