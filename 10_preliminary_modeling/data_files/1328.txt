A man was ill and in a "hospital." He gave a lecture to us. He told people he was mad at them or at least disappointed because they would come to the store and "buy out the store and then would be too tired to come visit him." He'd like people to put him first, not last! He turned to me and said, "Except you, you need to learn the opposite."
