 I'm donating sperm. I'm standing at the counter where a woman is getting my file. My sister Ramona is at the counter. I feel embarrassed with Ramona there. The woman looks at my file, which is a pink folder, and says my sperm were 90% dead. I say that I know that. I'm uncomfortable and embarrassed. She gives me the things I need to donate: the cup is shorter and wider than the one I had before. I think it will be easier to aim into. She points me to a room across the hallway. I go out into the large, wide hallway. There are many doors. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to go into. I walk down the hallway, looking into rooms. One room is large and empty: classroom-like, and has religious artifacts around it. I wonder if it's a good idea to ejaculate in that room. I'm near the end of the hallway. I see my friend Simon Naver walk by, around the corner. He sees me and after pausing, he comes over and we talk a little bit. We shake hands: I don't get a good grip. I ask him how much money he made this summer, because I hear he made a lot. He says he made $9,000! We talk, but are uncomfortable doing so. Our high school teammate Tony Kramer may be there. I leave, and walk back down the hall to the office area. There are several famous movie stars in a room: a man and a couple women. A woman was raped earlier, though she didn't realize it. As a result it hurt have to have sex when the group was donating sperm.
