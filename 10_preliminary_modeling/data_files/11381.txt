I was on a hot deserted country dirt road with no trees in sight. I was walking back to New York so I might go to Europe. I had been home from Europe and was now going back for a second time. I then came to a large island in the center of the road. The island was in the form of a perfect circle, and on one side there was a bleak house. I walked behind the house and got a drink from a well. Suddenly, I was walking along another country road only this was a cool and tree-lined road.
