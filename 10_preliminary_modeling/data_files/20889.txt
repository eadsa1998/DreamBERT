A druggist made a new advertising display about ten feet by twenty feet. A heating pipe partly obscured the sign. He only had room on the sign for his telephone call letters (two letters). His call letters were UNITY. Later I borrowed a manikin from the druggist. I had to climb a wall to return it. A woman complained that the head was not right. I said I would buy another one.
