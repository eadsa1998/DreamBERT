I'm in the bedroom of an apartment lived in during adolescence. It's morning. There's something on the windowsill. The kitten resembles a cat from N town, where I lived a year as a child.  It must have entered through a window. The answering machine picks up a phone call. I think, "No one calls me; who is it?" I don't recognize the voice. It's hard to tell what she is saying. I wonder how long the kitten has been here. Where does it relieve itself? I tell the kitten I don't want it here.  I open the front door. The cat scurries down the steps, then runs outside. I'm bare-chested and conscious of my abs. As in life, they are strong from exercise. I wonder if my downstairs neighbors will see me.
