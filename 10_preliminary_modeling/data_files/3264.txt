Howard has a camera and a woman is trying to convince me to let bygones be bygones and take advantage of this and work with Howard because I need a camera. Howard stands on my left and I say what kind of camera? 16 MM? He grins and says bragging, "No, 32 mm." Whoa! A professional film camera. I am tempted, but really am disgusted with the idea that I'd have to work with him. Then I see a wee baby crawling on the grass and see her bottle next to her and say to her playfully, "Hey, you're too young to be smoking," calling the bottle a cigarette. The baby has no sense of humor and bursts into tears, crying. I pick her up to soothe her and as I am walking with her in my arms, over my shoulder, I feel how skinny and loose she is, not compacted like a healthy normal baby is, wobbly like a doll. I say, "Hey, we're going to have to make you plump." She bursts into wailing tears again. I pat her and say soothingly, "It's a good thing. You need some fat. It won't be too much." What a fussy, sensitive baby! Now I am arriving at the studio in Hollywood where I'll be learning how to make a movie, with Howard's camera and Howard in tow. I enter a big room with a bank of video machine like things I'll be learning to use. I walk the length, looking at the dazzling machine array. This is exciting and will be fun. I sit at a table with other interns or students. A man calls out "B." I say, "That's me." He says, "Can't be. He holds up a purse he found that belongs to a B, with a funny, artistic face etched or carved inside it. It doesn't belong to me. He's the teacher. I'm going to learn a lot here and have the advantage of my own camera. Lots of other students will not have the use of a camera and won't get their projects done for a long time.
