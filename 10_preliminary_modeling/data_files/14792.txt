Mariyam talked to me on MSN. She said a friend told her about some movies ages ago but wondered about some music video. She was sometimes Tanita. A song called Brain Brain was first and it was by Madness. I went on LastFm and it did something weird to my plays. It said I had listened to a song by 'Psych'. I put Heartbreak Beat on. It said that my most listened to song this month was 'PF' and other stuff I don't listen to. Everything was named wrong.
