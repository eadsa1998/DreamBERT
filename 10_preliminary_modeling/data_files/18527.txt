Kitty cat was in the darkroom with me. A piano was in there too. I had a $5.00 coupon for food but I'd apparently already used it for candy. I stopped and looked at the curling activator kits that were stacked up on the display. The girl on the box looked seriously coy, but she did NOT look fun. I was walking to the thrift stores in the U.S. national forests. They were on top of a mountain down a dirt road. At the first one I found 2 pairs of sandals that I LOVED. But they were tiny little kids' sandals. I hit them with a stick, in hopes that that would zap them up to my size, but no luck. It was 10 minutes till closing, so I left to see what was there. I had to check my bag and got assigned "B" shelf, and saw that the clerk lady had made inventory notes: "Nothing good," on it. I was sitting on the wood floor of the auditorium stage behind the black velvet curtain waiting for cartons when NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS went by in the ocean. The deck was ship-shape! While I was sitting there the ceiling collapsed. So they bought in cranes, wrecking balls and aluminum columns, of rectangular shape. I was sitting in the grocery check-out with my pants down; Wesley Cook, a Jehovah Witness, was staring at me because I didn't have my pants on.
