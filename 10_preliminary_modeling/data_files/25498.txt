 I'm in a physics class in college. The teacher is a woman. She is not a great teacher. She gives us a handout and we look at an overhead projection. There is a woman, who I then realize is a man, sitting next to me. We are in the front left portion of the classroom. The man next to me talks in a high-pitched voice. The class gets out early because the teacher has no material to present. The man next to me caught chickens. I think he is from Yardville
