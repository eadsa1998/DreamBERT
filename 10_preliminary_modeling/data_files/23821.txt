Mom was helping me do the lottery.  I had a ticket and she was matching up the winning numbers.  She had these silver stars to put in the numbers I had picked if they were winning numbers.  They were three-dimensional stars you put on the numbers on your ticket, and she matched all of the stars, I think it was 15, it was more than the normal 6 numbers.  I realized I had won.  I thought I had won the whole jackpot, which was 15 million dollars.  But later I realized I couldn't have won the whole thing.  I don't remember why I couldn't have won the whole $15 million, there was already a main winner, or maybe from my particular numbers.  The next morning I went to work at Amwest, in the trillium building, into the lobby/elevators.  I was wondering if I should tell anyone yet.  I was so happy I could quit work there, move away to Colorado or Utah, do what I wanted and be set for life.  I was ecstatic, so fucking happy, I needed and wanted that win so bad, to save myself, my humanity, to be able to do what makes me human and content, to be able to quit this job.  I found out what I had won, it was $400,000.  Still a good win, although not millions.  That $400,000 could still keep me pretty free and happy for life.  I started planning what to do with it.  I talked with Dad about investing it, buying stock, opening a CD.  I asked him if he would invest it for me.  He advised against investing it, which surprised me.  I started telling a few people at work I had won.  I was planning on quitting and leaving pretty soon.
