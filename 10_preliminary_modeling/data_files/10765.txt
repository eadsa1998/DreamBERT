I was sitting in some sort of classroom in the first row in the next to the last seat. It was an intersorority council meeting and my roommate was officiating and sat at the teacher's desk. This I couldn't understand because she isn't even a member of a sorority. I was sitting sidewards in the chair and it probably looked as if I were talking, but actually I wasn't. My roommate started to scold me for it and in front of the classroom of people. I tried to explain that I was completely innocent. She wouldn't listen to me and it turned into a mild argument. We let the matter drop and she resumed the conduction of the meeting. A short while later the girl sitting behind me began to speak to me. I listened to her intently but never uttered a word. Again my roommate scolded me for talking but didn't say a thing to this other girl. At this point, I was just furious. I tried to explain what had happened but she wouldn't believe me. She insisted that it was my fault. The result was a vehement argument, but nothing I said could change her mind.
