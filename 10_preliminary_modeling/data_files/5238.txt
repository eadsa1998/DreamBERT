I dreamed that Camilia, Ed, and I were all jumping on mattresses in the main building. They asked me to join them, but I didn't want to. I went to the dining hall to make a cup of tea. Mrs. Frank was there and wanted me to babysit, but I really didn't want to. So I hurried to make my tea. Then I went to the back of the dining hall, and there was this Harry Potter game open and there was a scary monster in it. I wanted it to leave, but it wouldn't. It was terrible! Then I woke up.
