I was a ballerina; wearing a frilly pink dancing dress. I was dancing in, supposedly, Reserve's new student union. There were lots of kids standing around the grill and at the booths. None I recognized however. At the top of a double stairs stood Bill, an old boyfriend wearing a black overcoat, which had the collar pulled up around the neck. I was trying to impress him with my dancing. Everyone else smiled and commented how nice I looked and how well I was doing, while Bill merely glared down at me. Then I whirled around the other direction and two men were sitting on a marble bench and doors shut behind me to separate me from my friends in the other room. I danced before these two, didn't recognize either one, then one of them came over, grabbed my arm and said, marry me, and suddenly his face cleared up and he was a fraternity brother of Mac's whose name I don't even know. I felt very badly because I knew the man was married.
