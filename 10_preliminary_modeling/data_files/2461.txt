I am concerned that the door be locked and fixed tight against Howard returning. Meanwhile a man peers into a "closet" window and asks if he can work on it to fix it. I agree, glad it's going to be fixed and then get worried that he may mean me harm. I realize he's a bad man and I must defend myself. I shoot him over and over. He won't die. I knife him, twisting in the blade. Still he comes for me. He's going to use my knife on me. I feel fear.
