It was a big house that one sister had just bought. Not my sister, but a new family that had moved into a house where my family used to live. The visiting sister was pregnant. Very pregnant. She was helping the sister sand the floors in one bedroom. A lot of remodeling needed to be done. They were talking about how the place was had at a good price partially because someone died on the stairs years before. A roll of tape or something dropped and rolled out the door and went down the stairs and stopped halfway down. The pregnant sister went after it. For some reason, nails covered the stairs. Some were sticking up without explanation. The sister got a foreboding feeling and told her pregnant sister to hold onto the rail. The wood on the steps was scratched and had chunks missing from it. She reached for the door, but the seam was gone. It wouldn't open. But then she double took. The seam was back. She opened the door and let the light and outside air come in. She led her sister by the hand to the bottom and outside. She insisted the stay there for a while. The pregnant sister thought she was being silly. Then very sinister sounding rock music with a steady, deep drum and base picked up just inside normal hearing range. There were noises of sex and violence intertwined. She looked inside and felt death. The older sister ran with her younger sister to her old car parked out front, got in, and started driving. The younger sister was starting to get afraid after her initial reaction of skepticism. As they drove away and looked back, the house looked like it was burning, like a gothic building burning in a dim, ashy haze of fire and smoke.
