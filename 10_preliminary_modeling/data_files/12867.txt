Mom kept buying new houses. One of them was just a square block. I was in the lounge. Samantha, some other girl and I always sat in certain chairs. On the back of the chairs there were 'shop' shelves. This footy game finished and all these people came in. Darius and Eugene were there. Mom found a house worth $70000.
