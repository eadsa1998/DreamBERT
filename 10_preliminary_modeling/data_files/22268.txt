I dreamed I was going on a trip to Cuzco with some boys and girls, friends of mine. We lived in a hut near Ayacucho and we always saw beautiful green scenery. Even when I had sexual intercourse, there was a green background. I knew the place from really having gone on a picnic to Ayacucho. It turned out that we didn't go farther than Ayacucho and we stayed there without going to Cuzco.
