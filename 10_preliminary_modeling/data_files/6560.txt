Letter received from L.N.H. telling that he was joining the Adventists. Three post scripts in pencil. Addresses me as sister. Starting out in ricsha. Overtake Meads who salsa me to walk with them but they are going to garden. I to Fong-Dsen gai so we separate at a very bad road. Lighting and preparing a bonfire. Go to fire at distance to light stick for match. Handicapped by baby I'm carrying, so have great trouble not to set fire to trees and clothes.
