I am going to see some kind of event, maybe a fair or a sporting event. Jake may be with me. I walk down many, many stairs, looking for the place. It doesn't seem to be that many people around. I go into a room and a fun ride is there. I want to go on it, so I sit down on the dresser. There should be a basket like thing to sit in, but it's not there. A woman goes and gets a wire basket, white, and places it so I can put my feet in it and have better support that way. The ride begins and it is actually fun as the dresser swirls and twirls around the room. It is more exciting than I usually experience with this kind of ride.
