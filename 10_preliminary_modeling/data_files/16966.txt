Myself and my father (and perhaps some other family members) had entered a tv show as participants - it was a dance show. First we warmed up dancing freestyle altogether on a dance floor to pop/disco music. I was trying not to stand out. Later we had to perform individually to different themes, then there was voting by judges. Some of the female contestants went into 'diary room' mode and burst into tears complaining about the harsh judges and how much this means to them. I walked off the show because I was fed up with how seriously everyone was taking it. I thought I'd look cool, but when watching it back on a tv monitor afterwards, I noticed that I'd sounded like I was doing it for attention too, and worse, I noticed a tear rolling down my cheek, and my voice trembling. I was humiliated.
