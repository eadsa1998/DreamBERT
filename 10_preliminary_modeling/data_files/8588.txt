My alarm went off, in my dream. I hit snooze and fixed some html code at the beginning of a line of coding. I wasn't in front of a computer and I didn't seem to have a paper and pen with me so I don't know how I was doing this. I did this probably a dozen times. Then my alarm went off in waking life and I shut it off and went back to sleep. I thought I should finish this coding all at once rather than doing it one line at a time the way I was.
