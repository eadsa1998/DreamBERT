I had made love to my "husband" who is like Richard L of playwriting class. I go into the bathroom to pee and realize this will be an opportunity to take a look at my husband's penis, which I now wear. I peer down into the toilet bowl, as I am seated on it and see a small weeny hung suspended by a hair, like it was a bowel movement. I gingerly pull at the hair until it all falls into the toilet bowl. I look again and see a small penis. I expected as much - small -- a bit disappointed. I see another bowel movement come out. It is soft. I then look again at the penis. It is bigger and I think, "Oh, am I getting an erection?" I think that would be fun or interesting. I am curious. I look again and it is a bit bigger, still semi-flaccid and has a fingernail at the end of it. "No wonder," I think, "that it felt funny when it was in me." The sensation wasn't painful, just interesting. I pee and pee and l look again and see a few blood spots and remember I haven't had periods for years now. Maybe I'm spotting. I feel a compelling need to pee and get annoyed with myself and say to myself, "Go ahead, let it go." I do.
