I was going to visit my old school. I was running late because my school started at 10:00 and it was already 10:05. My clock was an hour off, so I was really trying to hurry. Setting: In my room at my house. Characters: Me and my parents. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I didn't want to get a tardy slip on the day I visited.
