One fellow had a half on one side mustache. There was a lineup for a man. He was a bandit that was looking for a jewel that was supposed to be hidden in the mustache. I had on my hunting clothes. We were lined up in front of the man. This man with the half or one side mustache had the jewel hidden in his half mustache and he had an idea that he was going to fool them with the half mustache and the man would let him go. We were buying carpeting for a big room. It was like a hall or auditorium. I walked thru it and inspected it. It sure would take a lot of carpeting. Ann was going to divorce me. She was going to marry Mr. Shun who was about 70 years old. In fact, she had already married him before she got the divorce from me. I was a sad man. I loved Ann and the children would be bounced around and have no mother. Mr. Shun was counting his money. He had a fifty dollar bill in the bundle.
