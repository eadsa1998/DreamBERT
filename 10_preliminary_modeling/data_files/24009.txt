I was at the Boardwalk with all my friends and we all had boyfriends. I couldn't see my boyfriend, but I somehow knew he was cute, nice and treated me good. He was a little older and wore a black sweater and blue pants and he had his hair slicked back and we were going on rides and we were having fun.
