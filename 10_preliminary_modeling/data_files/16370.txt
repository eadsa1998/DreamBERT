We were having some kind of party in the living room and that there was some kind of difficulty going on. I think we were going to watch a movie and have the sound system on, and the VCR wasn't working or something, and there was some kind of commotion about somebody dropped a glass of water. It was very vague. And then, since the VCR wasn't working and we couldn't watch the movie, then I decided I was going to set up the mixer board and stuff, and I like, I think I dropped a glass tube of some kind and it shattered all over the floor. And then I could finally sit down and eat the taco thing, and I don't remember too much else. That was dumb.
