I had a dream with horses in it and war. There was a small school. I was ringing a bell and the war started. I wanted to stop the war. I saw a Native American, and he had a red headdress. Beside him was a fox, except it didn't look like an ordinary fox. It was blue and purple, and it was floating beside him. Right next to it was a cat that was white and striped with blue. They were both floating by. I was ringing the bell and thought, "Oh, my god! Am I seeing things?"
