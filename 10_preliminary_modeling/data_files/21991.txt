I had a lunch period at work, so I went out to buy a newspaper and I heard a paper boy yelling, "Press and news." I asked him if the paper had the results and he said they did.  I asked him how much the paper was and he said 4 cents. I gave him a nickel and told him to keep the change and he said, "I thought I could make some extra money today," so I gave him an extra 2 pennies and he said, as I was walking away, "He is just like a woman on his tips." I walked down the street fast and looked for a place to sit and look at the paper. I was in the shadow. The sun was shining bright that day.
