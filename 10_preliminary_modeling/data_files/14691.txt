I was watching Dawson's Creek and Dawson and Joey were friendly again. I think they got back together. Someone killed a pet or a person and Pacey had blood on him. He wanted to talk to Joey and went to her but couldn't tell her. Dawson was talking to an old friend. It was then late and I was with Mom and Ezra. I realized it was only 10pm. We needed to get in Dad's house and we were saying that we should just wake him up. We went to a bed and breakfast and they joked they had "no bed". Dad was then there and they played a song.
