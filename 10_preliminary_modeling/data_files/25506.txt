 My sister Ramona is posing as my grade school classmate Misty Ryan at a hair cutting place. They're trying to make her hair go "out" more. I have a Flintstones stick. It has two parts. I'm coming back from a casino with my roommate Stephen Ramos and friend Kevin Simpson. We're on a road that signs saying Highway 7 and Highway 15. It seems like the east side of Wilmerton at the intersection between Stephen's house and the Honda dealership. There are a group of cyclists. The leader of the group has one arm tied down in a white sling. He turns off, and the group splits. I'm near Wilmerton University. I see my old classmate Dan Boyle. Stephen, Kevin, and I are returning from a concert. I'm on a bike and I jump a curb where the cement is cracked and crumbling. My friend Tom Napper is there. Stephen and Kevin have gone somewhere. I am in Jose Ramos' apartment. Stephen and Kevin are drying out their clothes after the concert. The dehumidifier is "wet", which is the highest setting. My old classmate Buck Green is there. It looks like he is wearing lipstick. Jose has a sprinkler-like carpet-cleaning sprayer. We get wet when it goes off. Stephen knocks salt and pepper shakers on the floor in disgust. I think this action is dumb: it doesn't help at all. Rent at this apartment is $170 per month. Buck and I say that the rent isn't bad. A videotape is being rewound. It is of a basketball game. The tape is rewound past the game: there are recordings of music stuff before the game.
