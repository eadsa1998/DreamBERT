I dreamed that I was driving down a main highway and turned off the road to take a short route. The second road was dusty and full of lumps. I progressed about halfway when I noticed a funny noise under the hood. I stopped the car and as soon as I got out the hood raised automatically. The engine appeared as if it wanted to fly out and I could hear it creak and squeak. Quickly I jumped upon the hood and tried to hold it down. At first I was very successful but as my strength ebbed the force of the hood against me became stronger. I was fighting a losing battle and just as the engine was about to break loose I woke up.
