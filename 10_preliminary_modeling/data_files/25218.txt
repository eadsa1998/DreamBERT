 I am in a church at a funeral with two other men, one of whom may be my friend Simon Naver. The funeral is for my mom's cousin. Three bodies on stretchers are carried up to the altar. The bodies are of old men. One man has duct tape over his mouth. I think this is to keep the odor to a minimum, because he is dead. I see that the other two men on stretchers aren't dead. The men are made knights at the altar, with swords and red cloaks. An usher comes up to us and says we are sitting in the seats where the next three men will be chosen form to be carried up to the altar. These men will be dead. I don't want to do this. I want to change seats. The usher will escort us to the bathroom for one Franc, thereby getting us out of this situation. But we just go and sit in a different pew. The pews are form Sacred Heart Church in Farmington. I sit on a piano or organ bench that is facing the back of church. The two guys I am with don't sit with me. A talkative man sits in front of me. My mom sits in front of this man. The front half of the church is empty: people sit in the back half.
