 I'm catching chickens that are running around the back yards of the block to the north of the block I live on at home in Oak Valley. There is a large open space behind the houses on Home Avenue. It seems that I have just caught chickens and removed them from a house on Home Avenue. Now it's dark outside. I run and collect three chickens, and one really small chicken, almost a peeper. I do this in an area that is off-limits, so I have to be sneaky: it is in other people's yards. It seems there is some sort of exchange for the chickens: either getting something for removing them from the house, or for bringing them to the house. I go to the house with four chickens. People I know are watching television. Ernie Els (the golfer) is a short bald man. He is playing basketball against Kareem Abdul-Jabaar. Ernie makes a shot and is going to win. This constitutes a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game on television. I see a very long, birch-bark looking canoe being pushed across the basketball court.
