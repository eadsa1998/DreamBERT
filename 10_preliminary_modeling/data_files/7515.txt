I have just purchased a large quantity of meat. There is so much that it fills a pillow case. I shove the meat-filled pillow case into the freezer compartment of my frigidaire. It is so large a quantity that I had to force it into the freezer and had trouble closing the freezer door. The phone rings and I answer it. While I'm on the phone, I can see two older women at the other end of the line. They begin the conversation by asking me to guess who they are. I am irritated by this, but remain polite and tell them I don't know. They identify themselves as aunts, or relatives, of Mary. I still don't recognize them. The women then tell me that the purpose of their call is to tell me to quit "harping" on Mary's illness -- to quit talking to her about illness. I am very puzzled by their remarks because in this dream I don't know whether Mary is dead or alive.
