["Beautiful dorm rooms."] I am going to college again. I moved into a dorm. I am amazed at the spaciousness of the suite of rooms that I will share with a roommate. I walk from wall to wall looking at the beautiful furniture. I look out the windows and see spectacular views of mountains and trees. I walk into the bedroom and see two king sized beds, 2 pianos. 2 stereos. A woman comes in, my roommate. She and I are unpacking our things. I try to play on the piano. I want to take lessons to improve my skills. She suggests we share our things with each other. She writes some down on a paper. She shows a picture of a harmonic as she is suggesting we go to music events. I say Oh, I forgot my harmonic at home. I love the blues.
