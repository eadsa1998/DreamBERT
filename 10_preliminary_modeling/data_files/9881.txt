At Church: it is an open-air church; Spanish architecture, similar to the one I dreamt about earlier. I am waiting for Father Andrew to show up: Frank and Zena are with me. Zena gets tired, while we watch a big ballet with huge white flower petals be performed. "Thus the angels rejoice at the conversion of one sinner." Frank and Zena drive away with Mrs. Z from the Choir. Then I see Father Andrew, in the rear of the Church talking with a Catholic priest, who is very fat; and Father Andrew says to him, jokingly: (patting his fat stomach in a white cossack) "you really ought to lose some weight!" Waiting for the liturgy to begin: I ask Father Andrew "Where is Frank?" "Oh, I saw him standing and waiting, so I drove him home." I say, "Oh, and I had just gotten him to go to Church, and you drive him home." "Perhaps he was not yet ready." With Marissa Camden at her house: helping her and talking I return to Church for a beautiful liturgy and ballet with flower petals.
