I am in a car. It speaks to me in a woman's voice. It says, "You can make the decisions about where to go and how fast, but I will make the decisions on what soap to use in your bath." See a bathtub in the back seat (Venus de Milo on a half shell style) 2 squares of scented perfume in gold foil appear. I think she's a bit uppity.
