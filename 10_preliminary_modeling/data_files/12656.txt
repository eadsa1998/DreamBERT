I was at Nana's. She had a horse. It started attacking me because they attacked their mother's first and because it had seen me first, it thought I was its mother. I got it outside (we were in a room) but it could get back in, so I ran off. I ran down to Nana's house. The outside was different. Daryl was standing in a path. I was locking the doors and I told him about the horse and he suggested I go up to Granny's place. I ran up there. Poppers and Uncle Wilbur were there too.
