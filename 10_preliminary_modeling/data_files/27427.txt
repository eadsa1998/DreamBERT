I was attending a wedding in our church at home. The maintenance men of the church kept interrupting the ceremony by doing odd jobs around the altar. Then suddenly I was the bride, and there wasn't enough food for everyone at the reception. My husband found some turkey in a refrigerator and made me a dark meat sandwich which I didn't like.
