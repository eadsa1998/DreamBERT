I was in the UK after having moved. Dad was with me. I was texting Benjamin on my phone until I realised I hadn't gotten a UK sim yet, so I stopped. I had messaged him about my accommodation and house mates and he sent back 'what about me? It's my turn!' and I was confused and wondered if he was somehow asking to share with me and I hoped he was. An old lady offered me a room in her house so I didn't have to put up with a roommate snoring.
