My mother wants a cup of water, good distilled water. I remembered seeing some on a shelf at a store so I go to get it. I can't find it. I look and look, then I ask for it. The clerk takes me to the first row of shelves with laundry items. That's not it. Then I see it on the 2nd row of shelves. I get it and have to sit on a round cylinder that unhooks and I am precariously hanging on to it and the cup of water. I get down. Now I'm looking for a cup. I ask Kay. She points out a large pitcher. No I say. Then I see a blue cup-shaped like a flower or a plant. I take it and sit it on a table next to some people I know. Then I go outside to sight-see for a few minutes even though its nearly midnight and the clerk is tired and wants to go home. I think I'm in India. A man with dark, long hair (hippie length) walks by and stops and looks at me. He smiles and says, "Oh, I thought you were someone I knew." I said, "Oh, I thought you were Merle," he goes on. I see very ornate carvings all over the building's walls.
