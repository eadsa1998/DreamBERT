Mirabelle and I have special tickets to a big Star Trek conference presentation in an auditorium. We go in close to where the speaker, Jonathan Frakes, will be. At first I don't like sitting there, because of my old fears about being in the middle of a crowd, but then I decide it's OK. We'll get to hear him interviewing all the special guests, like Capt. Kirk. We are excited. This will be fun. The staff pulls up a cart and goes through the crowd giving out promotional gifts. They put it on your left foot like a shoe, but it's a padded bag full of gifts. He kneels and puts it on my foot like it was the glass slipper and I the princess. I then bend down to see what my gift is. It forms into a turtle, a large one, like a tortoise.
