Dream was very hazy. It had to do with Stunt Night. I remember waiting backstage till it was our turn to go on stage. Before we went on, there were other people performing - like an amateur show. I saw millions of chairs, little children's chairs backstage. It was all dark. I felt sort of a cold chill in my stomach. I was quite petrified. After the others finished, our leader said come on. Let's show em. We went and performed the whole stunt perfectly.
