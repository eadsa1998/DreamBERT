Prior to awakening it seemed that I was in the process of, well, I thought at first, learning to use a communication system in flying small aircraft. However, after awakening and trying to recall the dream, sort of gathering all the thoughts together, the thought of possibly, instead of learning to fly that I was, let me see, was playing golf, but it's hard to explain the situation, playing a green, in the sense that everything the area of the dream was confined to a limited space, such as marked off by the green on the hole where you have rough grass and then there's a perimeter and there's a small area of well kept grass. This is the feeling or the sense I got, that there was a surrounding of something. However, it didn't seem to be as small and confined as the circle of the green. More as you look at the picture, wide at the top and only one side was evident, and it would come around like a bump and then to the bottom. It seemed that there was someone else, not so much being seen physically as just I was, he was the point of my attention, sort of like the conversation, the person I was having the conversation with. It's sort of scrambled and difficult to distinguish whether it was flying which was my first impulse or it might have been golf. I'm inclined to think it's more the latter for the simple reason it's the latest of the two I have engaged in.
