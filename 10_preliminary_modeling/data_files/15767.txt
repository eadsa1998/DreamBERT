I was at a shopping centre with Mom and there was a rack of stuff that I somehow noticed was infected. I put some stuff on it to stop it and we left. Then I wondered if it would actually stop it and if there was infection anywhere else. We went back in for some reason. I went to the toilet and locked a cubicle. Not long after I'd sat down, I saw two hands come down under the door and then a zombie girl suddenly came at me from under the door. It was really fast and scared the hell out of me [IRL too, my heart was pounding when I woke up]. Her face was quite graphic, a white eye and rotting flesh. The only thing I had as a weapon was this thing that was like a giant straw. I stabbed her in the face when she came through again, I put my foot on her face to pull it out. I heard other zombies in the toilet, so I readied myself and opened the door and started stabbing them. I ended up in the male toilets and there were some other people still alive in there. They had forks and I was annoyed that I didn't have a fork. We got to the main part of the shop and found some other weapons. There weren't that many zombies around here. While I was looking for a weapon in a corner of the storeroom, one of the women with us started bending over weirdly and she suddenly turned and went at me. I started whacking her but couldn't stab through for some reason. One of my friends killed her. Someone suggested this was like a judgement day scenario thing, where the bad people turned into zombies and the good guys were ok.
