Some people and I and my middle sister were cutting down a palm tree.  All of us knew that when you cut a palm tree, the inside starts to burn and smolder and gets very hot.  All of us except my middle sister.  After we cut the tree, she reached inside and took out its heart.  It looked like an artichoke heart (hearts of palm).  She was holding it, and she suddenly got a look of panic and pain on her face.  The heart was burning her hands.  She dropped it.  I cried out to her, went and got her, took her inside and wrapped her hands with wet toilet paper strips.
