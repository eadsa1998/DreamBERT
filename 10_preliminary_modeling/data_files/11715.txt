Gavin was staying at Mom's. We got to Mom's, but Mom had to drop me off at school (it was during school) to get something. Teacher-F-04 was there and then she wouldn't let me leave. I found Gavin and we got Mom to get us (I didn't have my phone with me). We went for a walk and something happened with these kids, but I can't remember.
