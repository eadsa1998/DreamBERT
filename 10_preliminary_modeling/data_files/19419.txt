I was with a friend and I met this guy. He was cute. He said he was a musician and I said I could sing. He then suggested that we get together. The next thing I knew I was blow-drying my hair. I was entered in a pageant and I had to get ready. The guy showed up to wish me luck. However, I was not lucky because my dryer burnt out and I borrowed one and it didn't work either. I was upset, but the strange part was that the same girls I ran against for May Day queen were in this pageant too.
