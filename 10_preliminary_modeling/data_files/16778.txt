I remember seeing Rachelca and telling her, "You're the first girl I ever kissed in a dream," (and she was). This was somewhere in the middle of a seemingly extraordinary long dream sequence. I knew perfectly well that I was dreaming, but I don't think my conscious mind ever became active enough so that I actually become lucid. I remember being in the dream and thinking, "This is a long dream!" I don't remember how long it seemed to last, but I can guess at the time it seemed like hours. I was glad I wasn't waking up, that's all I can say. I remember getting to this classroom where a teacher (who I thought was a substitute teacher) called me such things as the "textbook man" and had me put textbooks on every desk. I had eaten before in the dream, and I recall it getting close to time to eat another meal. So, I was a little upset that I might miss my meal time by passing out textbooks. Riley was there, I remember. There were candies on a table- they were caramel, about 75 or 100 of them, and I took them all. Then realizing I'd never eat them all, I put about half back on the table.
