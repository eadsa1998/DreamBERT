I am involved in a family presentation of a play, perhaps one of mine. I can't find my script. The presentation time is in two hours and I search over and over, all around. Paulina asks me what I'm doing. I say, "Looking for my scripts." I can't remember my lines. I feel apprehensive. No one is very helpful. I ask where we are going to perform. I need to experience the stage area so I know what I'm working with. She shows me the back yard where a line is drawn. I say, "There?" pointing to a small cement square. "No," she says. "That line." I say, "That line? Is it the back stage boundary or the front?" She says, "The back boundary." I keep looking for the script, getting more desperate as time passes.
