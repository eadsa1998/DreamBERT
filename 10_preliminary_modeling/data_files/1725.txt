I am intrigued with a huge mirror on the outside of an already interesting house I've moved into. I comment on how many mirrors there are in this house. I also see a box that has glass all over it (made of glass) and has miniatures inside. I look and like them. They are pretty. I go inside the house and see a girl with three keys. I am concerned, so I ask her how she got in. She smiles and says that Shane gave her a key. I don't believe her and am suspicious that she's going to steal things. I go outside and tell someone so they'll be warned. Now a neighbor comes up to me and we greet each other. One of us asks if we had done our greetings correctly. Something about travel.
