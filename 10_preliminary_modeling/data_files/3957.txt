["Weird train tracks and Mrs. Snowman's son."]  A man is talking to us. He points off into the distance where I see train tracks and roads going perpendicular to us. He is complaining about these roads and tracks. He says this is what I don't like about them. Now he drags me onto the track which are unstable, no ties holding the tracks together and a long drop off below. It has bumps on the metal tracks so that I am very frightened I'll fall off as we go. He doesn't notice or care and drags me along lecturing in a complaining tone. He says this road isn't safe either and now I am next to a set of long shelves with food stacked on it like a grocery store. I am to find hand and toe holds where food isn't to hang on while a train passes so I won't get run over. I move carefully from one hand hold to another. At one point, there is no handhold and I say to the man I guess under these circumstances I just squish the food. After all, the only other alternative is for me to get squished. He nods in agreement. I get back on the path and am returning to where we were. Now we are walking out of a cafeteria where a man is at the cash register. I look back at him as we get to the doors. His back is to me and he is gossiping with the other employees. He is talking about everyone and specifically I remember he said well, I guess Mrs., Snowman's real proud of her son. Apparently Mrs. Snowman is his nick name for a cool well endowed woman that works there. He is being sarcastic. People don't really like his constant gossip. It puts people down.
