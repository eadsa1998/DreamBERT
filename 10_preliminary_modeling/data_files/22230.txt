I was standing on a street with a sports bag. The school bus appeared and Mary (a girl I am in love with) got off through the back door. I left the bag on the floor and went towards her. She looked at me with surprise. I wanted to speak to her, but couldn't. I wanted to follow her, but when I saw she was so near her home, I thought that I shouldn't. I turned and saw her sister and I kicked my bag and threw my glasses. I was angry at myself. Then I sat on the sidewalk and thought, "I won't budge from here until she comes out." The dream continued and a herd of elephants with riders passed by. The animals and the men were dressed in Indian fashion. Then there was a stampede. Then there was a giant fire and I thought of going to Mary's house, I thought it was my chance to meet her.
