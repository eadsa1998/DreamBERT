I have a gun. Two bad guys and their woman boss chase me. I grab one guy and hold him underwater and let him up for a few seconds of air. His buddy has a bandaid box with air and tries to get it to him. I pinch a nerve in his hand and break his hold. They give up and I march them to their boss. Then I see a lot of people lining up for a "group shot," a photo, and I realize they are going to be shot dead. My parents, myself. I run screaming and crying. I choose a bunny rabbit to curl into bed with me and I pet it and cry and cry.
