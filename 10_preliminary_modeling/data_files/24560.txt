Our whole class was going on a camping trip. My friend's dad was in the dream. May, my friend, was not feeling well, so I took her to the hospital. She did not seem very sick, but the nurse said she was. Then I started to feel sick. I looked in the mirror and saw a bag full of blood. It was draining. Setting: At a campsite and at a hospital. Characters: May, and my friend's dad. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried.
