I am living in a nice community.  There is a very narrow dead-end hallway with a ceiling so low that you can't stand up in it.  I crawl into it and think how difficult it will be to paint it when I move.  I decide that I will have to have someone else do it.  The surface is rough and irregular like stucco, and it gives me claustrophobia just to be in it, not to mention painting it.  There is a opening, apparently to the roof, which I remember having used before but which someone has sealed up now.
