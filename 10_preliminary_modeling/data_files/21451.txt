We were in PA. I went into our front room in the dark and looked thru the door. I saw four young men. I yelled at them what they wanted and they didn't hear me. I knocked on the door and yelled out, "What do you want?" and they answered nothing. I looked thru the side window in the kitchen and I saw two boys sneaking by the windows. It was thundering outside. I could hear a storm coming. It was still night. We were sitting in the kitchen. Ann brought some drinks. Carter took one and I reached for one and I got a small tray with liquid in it. I was going to drink it and Ann said no. So I spilled it on my shirt and necktie. I said, "Are you satisfied now?" I got up, picked up a rag and there were a lot of rags tied to it because I pulled and pulled up rags and finally gave up and threw them down the stairway. I put on a light in the kitchen and it wouldn't light. I looked into the lamp and there was a couple burned and melted candles filling the sockets and no bulb. Ann got a bulb and turned it thru the wax into the socket. I turned the switch and the lampshade began to swell. I shut it off. Someone was looking at the entries. I looked and the print was small and I saw a pair of human eyes drawn above the entries.
