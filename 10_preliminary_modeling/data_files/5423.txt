I had such a realistic dream last night. First it was my last day at my job, and for some reason I was having trouble figuring out my time card. I couldn't add the hours up properly or something. I guess I figured it out though. Then the blonde girl upstairs (the one who reminds me of Aaron's Britta) was crying because her boyfriend's mother had died. So then I walked home (my job was near my house I guess), and on the way I heard someone putting down women. I ran over and started shouting at them before I realized it was Jackson. I later learned that he was speaking at his mother's funeral, and that I had misunderstood what he had said. I found him later that night to apologize, and he took me in his arms and kissed me. And I kissed him back and we were hugging and grabbing at each other. I was trying to remember if we had been doing this same thing years ago and just continuing it now, or if this is the first time it had happened. I must have thought it was the first time, but in any event, things began to heat up really fast and I remembered we were supposed to be at a funeral, so we broke apart. And then we were sitting in a golf cart, and I felt so...in love. No one around me mattered. I kept fixing his tie or holding his hand. Gabby (random) saw us and either was jealous of me, or wanted to protect Aaron from getting hurt, because she really disapproved of Jackson and me. I wanted to come back later to continue hooking up with Jackson, but when I got home I realized that I had to go back to school right away. Everything was so real though.
