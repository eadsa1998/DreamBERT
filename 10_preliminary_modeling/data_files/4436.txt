["Plane crash."] I am in a little plane. I keep looking out the windows. On the right side, I see the sky. On the left side, I see the reflections of empty seats. I look on the right again. I see trees and feel fear that we are too low and will crash. Then we manage to land and I see we are on a street. I wonder what happened. I am concerned the traffic will hit us or break off our wing. Then I see the wings are retracted into the plane. This is apparently a government special plane and it is taking me directly to the hotel where the conference is being held. I hope they don't find out I don't have any special governmental job.
