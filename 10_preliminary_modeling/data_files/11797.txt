I was at some place with this guy and girl. We jumped into this car and drove away. The guy went into the back and the girl went to get in, but zombies (Dawn of the Dead remake like) got her. I drove off. I got out of the car, and the guy died. Some girl helped me into a big dark underground thing. She told us to stand, then didn't let others stand because zombies were watching. We all got up and went up this slide. She left and told us to stay there. The others wanted to go but I made them stay. She got back and we ran outside towards the sea. We swam and a zombie bloke came after us. We drowned him and got on a boat. [note: I referred to the zombies as 'DOTD ppl' LOL].
