I don't remember the start of the dream, it might have been related to the X-men.  Someone (me?) with two baby sheep were high above a body of water on a beam protruding from the side of a Truss bridge, and approached Elaine from Seinfeld, who was asleep.  I handed her the sheep and put them against her to suckle- I was here for her help (I think I was a man and unable to suckle the sheep myself).  Elaine said they weren't suckling, and I told her that was exactly what the problem was.  Then, from a sort of sky-view, I noticed someone walking across the bridge with a leash on something in front of him.  I zoomed in to see it was Wallace (from Wallace and Gromit).  The leash was on Shaun, and there was a whole herd of sheep in front of him.  I was hopeful and went down to talk to him.  Somehow the dream related back to the X-men dream and the young sheep showed their heritage.  Black sheep, with a Zoidberg (from Futurama) face.  (I guess Zoidberg was the bad guy).
