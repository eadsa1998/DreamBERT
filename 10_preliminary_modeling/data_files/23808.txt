I was at Arches National Park with my family.  My family was mistreating me, ignoring me, not caring when they did things that hurt me physically, rushing me, paying no attention to my thoughts or feelings, just dissing me in general.  I was getting sick of them.  I felt hurt and lost, like giving up.  We went in a mine cart on some tour.  I was sitting next to my middle sister in front.  We sat in this mine cart and it went slow down some tracks.  But there was some construction or the tracks were broken, we were having difficulty getting through.  There were boards across the tracks, it was messy and unfinished, and then we came to a big drop off.  There was no way the cart could continue.  There was a man there, some Park employee, telling us to back up, and moving boards off the tracks.  My middle sister started to back the cart up and I was helping push us back with a walking stick thing, but she was moving too quick, and my arm was stuck on the stick I was holding, so it almost tore my arm off and it hurt.  My middle sister paid no attention to my pleas to slow down, hold off.  I was by this time thoroughly sick of my family and what I perceived as a total lack of attention for my being.  We got back to the Visitor Center, and I thought, this would be a good place to buy drugs, here at night at the Arches Visitor Center  I was planning on doing so.
