I am going to the beach. I have my 2 piece swim suit on but the top is a little loose and the nipples show. I go inside the building. I can't find my towels and then I find them in my hands, dragging in a puddle. I go to the bathroom and think, "Now how am I going to get my top back on?," (I had taken it off to go to the bathroom). Mirabelle comes along and ties the strings for me. We start to go outside. Now I see a woman sort of dancing. As she dances, she transforms herself into a series of plastic shapes. Finally, there is nothing left but objects de art. A chubby faced man with bad teeth, notices this and starts wondering out loud how to make the most money. He asks me to move out of the aisle so customers can get to them. I go up first and see a plastic square that has her picture in it. As I look at it, she winks at me and says things. I ask how much and pay $2.00 feeling I've got a good bargain. I show it to Bonnie and say, "Watch this!" She (the picture), doesn't move! I say, "Oh great, now Bonnie will think I'm crazy." I advise Bonnie to stare at it until she does move. She finally does. It's a wondrous gift. She can tell me things I need to know.
