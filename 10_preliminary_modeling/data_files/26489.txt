 I'm with a man my age whom I know and seem to be friends with. We're in my truck. He is about to drive, and I think he has the truck in the wrong gear, either reverse or first gear. I grab the stick shifter, stopping him from driving. I am driving. I see that he had the truck in the correct gear. I drive with my sisters Heather and Ramona, and our acquaintances Julia and Erica Cobden, to Armstrong High School. It's winter. The roads are icy. The snowplow just came through and piled high banks of snow along the roadsides. One plow has plowed a car in, covering it.
