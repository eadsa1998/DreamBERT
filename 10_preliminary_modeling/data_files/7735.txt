I was in this very large house. It belonged to very wealthy people. Some young people were having a party here. I don't think their parents knew about it. Perhaps it was an after-prom party, but I'm not sure. Many of the kids were making-out in several of the rooms. Particularly, I found a couple in one of the bedrooms. I was wondering through the house, simply because it was such a large, expensive home and I was interested in seeing all the rooms. I would go up a flight of stairs and the only room would be another bedroom. Another flight of stairs, one bedroom. Etc. I did this several times. On one floor of the building, the bedroom was all white, the furnishings, and everything. It was more like a suite. The front room, I think, was the bathroom and then led into the area where the bed was. In the bed area, the walls seemed to be covered with white billowy curtains. For some reason, I think there were two beds, side by side, instead of one. This doesn't make sense to me because this is the room where the owners of the house would go to make love. Maybe I'm not remembering it right but it just doesn't feel right. I don't know if it was one large bed or two twin beds. Anyway, the bed(s) face an extremely large Jacuzzi. It is the walls around the Jacuzzi that have the white billowy curtains. I thought what a beautiful room this was. But there were no other furnishings or decorations in this room. Just the beds, the Jacuzzi, and the curtains. I think I may have been with someone as I was later checking all the rooms. I don't know if I was checking to make sure everyone was gone or if I was looking for someone. Actually, I think I was looking for someone, but found individual people in more than one bedroom.
