Howard and I are moving furniture in a tiny house of mine. We are trying to make it safer and better for the babies, a baby girl and a 2-year-old boy. We put the baby girl's bedroom near us. I feel happy that Howard is there and we are working on the house. It feels right. Later a Ricardo type boy (man) is playing ice hockey. He makes some very extraordinary moves that are complicated. I am impressed. Now there is a tiny, little, furry kitten-like animal with black and white spots that was just born a few minutes ago. I wonder if I'm the mother and Howard is the father, but I realize it is an orphan. We adopt it.
