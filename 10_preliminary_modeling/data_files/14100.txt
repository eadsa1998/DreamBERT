I went for a drive with Mom pretty far away. We went to this shop and Mom bought some stuff and asked if I wanted to get an ice-cream from the shop. I said I wanted cookies and cream. We were at the top of the shop, and there was a big slope going down to the bottom, so I slid down that. It was also really cool in the shop. There was an ice-cream shop at the bottom as well. Mom didn't get one from the shop, so we were looking in there. There was other random stuff in there and pies. I asked Mom if the one I wanted was in date and she poured pepper and other spices into it, because she thought there was a lid on top of it, and this would tell you if it was ok. She had ruined it so I told her we should go. Outside the shop, I had a bicycle. I was getting my licence. We were riding it and people were in my way and I kept almost crashing. This lady was stroking her hair in front of me and wouldn't move. This other guy smiled at me and also wouldn't move. The L-plate came off. We finally managed to get out of the carpark. Mom had to go back to get the car. This British guy was hanging around. It was 3.24pm and once we started driving we realized we had forgotten to get Ezra and we were supposed to pick him up at 11am.
