I am reading a book on college scholarships and it is a mess with many typos and errors. One line of type ends with "icans-" and beginning of next line starts as "Amer". I decide to edit these mistakes, but the light is poor. Walk around looking into rooms and enter one filled with men at desks, all in business suits. A man tells me to go to room #3, but I don't hear him right away. Finally it registers and I say "Sorry!" and go to that room. A man there wants to discuss my qualifications to obtain a scholarship and I start to tell him I didn't come there for that.
