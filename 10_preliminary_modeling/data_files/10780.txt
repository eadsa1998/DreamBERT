I was shopping for lipstick and was with a girl with whom I had been close friends in high school, but now am unfriendly with. I wondered why she was with me since I didn't like her. She was helping me choose a lipstick and I wondered whether she might not want to hinder me. The girl showed me a counter where my brand of lipstick was sold, but the lipstick cases were red and I usually got a gold case. She said that they had changed the color, but the lipstick was the same. I wanted to streak each lipstick on some paper to help me choose the right shade but the lipstick was covered with red paper. I streaked it and the color did come thru the red paper. I remember being quite surprised.
