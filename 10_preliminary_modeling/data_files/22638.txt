I had agreed to pick up a friend (Nelly) after work. When I was coming close to the building (which was on the corner of some big avenue), I met another friend (Martha), and I thought that she had also agreed to pick up Nelly, and she told me that she hadn't seen her. We both went in and in the lobby I found a cousin and his sister who came over later on (I was alone). I was happy to meet them, even though they left afterwards, and then I continued my search. Many employees had already come down, but she hadn't. I got to a floor where the offices were modern (without exaggerations) and cozy. I looked at a girl (whom I don't know very well) who seemed to work there. I was like looking for something, and she did not see me when I went into another area. At that point Nelly and Martha appeared from some door, talking enthusiastically, and we went down together. The lobbies at the office had interesting magazines and pamphlets. One of them advertised a well-known resort, but the name was misspelled (from the point of view of phonetics). Nelly is usually not punctual in what she does and one can never have any confidence in her. That is why I didn't look for her with a lot of enthusiasm. But in spite of everything, I wanted to comply with her, looking perhaps to have this returned some day in the same way.
