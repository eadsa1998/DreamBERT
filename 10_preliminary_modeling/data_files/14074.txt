A ghost was either getting visited by or visiting girls to kill their boyfriends if they were cheating or betraying them in some way. This woman and her boyfriend were in a building and the ghost came for him and she said "you're not cheating on me" but he was and he was killed. Mittens was in an underground area and someone, possibly me, said "you know I'm shortsighted". On One Tree Hill, all the main characters were gone. Anna was back and I was annoyed about it. There was a movie with a wave in a building and it had good effects. I showed Mom. I was trying to get Ezra to say "kill me" on the phone so it would allow the ghost (who was a girl) to be able to kill anyone. The ghost was in a kitchen and was controlling ghosts or maybe people. There was a knife in the toaster and it got hot. This lady didn't want to kill this girl, so I killed her.
