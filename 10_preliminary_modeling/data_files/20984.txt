We were on a high cliff looking down. Bob and Barbara came over to me. They ran over a small path near the edge of the cliff, at my command, because an avalanche was coming. I stood behind a cliff and held Bob and Barbara close to me so the rocks wouldn't hit them. There were two baskets. Barbara said Aunt Mary was to use one for ashes.
