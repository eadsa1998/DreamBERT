Something about my being in the Russian embassy, and I was being informed that we had surpassed the moon (I suppose they had gone further than the moon). Afterwards I saw myself in a car with Armand and the Russian ambassador, and we addressed ourselves to a bunch of people and gave out orders. I have also felt something violent, as though troops were fighting, and we were directing one group.
