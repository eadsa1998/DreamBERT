I passed a newspaper's building. The sign read, "The Sun." A canopy of metal and glass was hanging precariously about three stories up, and it looked as though it were about to fall. Some pieces of glass were on the ground. I told someone, then I picked up the glass. I was glad the sign had not yet fallen.
