[1997-07-03] I dreamed I was at work and actually I was seeing a client in his house. The client became very violent and took me hostage. They separated me from Sammy and I said to them, "Please, I can do without food and things like that but please don't take me away from Sammy. Sammy means a lot to me and I wouldn't do that to you." They laughed and told me that I didn't need Sammy and they needed her more than I did. I told them that Sammy was trained to work just for me as are all guide dogs. And they said that she'd work for us or they'd kill her. The person decide to try and work with Sammy and when she didn't go with them, they said they killed her. I heard a gunshot and so I knew they did and I started weeping. I could not believe that somebody would do that.
