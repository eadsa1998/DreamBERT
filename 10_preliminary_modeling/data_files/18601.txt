There was an empty swimming pool. The first day's photos were from slides, but nothing was there. Just blank slide frames where an image should be. There were unappreciated business opportunities and then slides of empty hotels and hotel swimming pool and I went swim, slip. A pound of prevention. I tried to put the slides in order like I was suppose to. The thoughts and images were starting up in my head:... ???... ???... ??? most things it seems like. I needed to finish putting the slides in order. Empty swimming pool photos and pictures of me, age 4, and a hotel. I had to stay away from side-tracked Christmas surprise him. I had to go to the shopping center to set up the hospital appointment. He acted not scared but he was.
