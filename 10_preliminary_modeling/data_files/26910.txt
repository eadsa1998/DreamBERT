 I'm in a restaurant that seems to be like a malt shop with my friend Melanie McDyss. The waitress shows us a list of all the shakes they offer. I point out which I would like, pointing to flavors of Dum Dum lollipops that are on the flavor list. I point to several, including blue raspberry, which have wrappers that are partially unwrapped. I ask Melanie which flavor she wants. She points to the second flavor on the list, which is the Giant Tootsie Roll. I tell the waitress that we'll take the Tootsie Roll flavor shake. She tries to get us to order a steak. I am reluctant because it's early in the morning and I don't feel gastro intestinally stable. She tells us to call her if we want to order. Melanie and I move to a different, nicer table because someone else has moved. I squeeze through the space between the seat and the edge of the table, which is a booth. It feels like we're on a date. The waitress brings our shake, which is like a brownie sundae on a plate. We both it eat it with forks. We're overlooking a city park with tall trees. There are some people under a big tree. A branch is high above them. Melanie makes a comment about doing something mischievous with the tree branch, tricking the people. I chuckle, unexpected to hear this, and say something along the lines of her comment being her shadow side. I walk with her and encounter others. We go into a house where my friend Tim Zelling lives. My friends John Thomas and Tom Napper are there.
