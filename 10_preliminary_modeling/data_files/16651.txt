I was in an elementary classroom as a teacher's aid, and it must have been a Christian school because we were talking about what sounded like it was the "Acts of the Apostles," but they were calling it "The Journey of the Early Christians" or something odd like that. And they were talking about different stuff. And these kids were supposed to make posters about something like that, or going to a country and being a missionary. And I was supposed to make one, like as a model, to show them how they're supposed to do it, and it had this border, it had this square within a square, like a frame almost, drawn on the posterboard. And I had colored it orange and I was taking a big fat marker and I was trying to draw around the frame and make it like a 3D look, you know how you put a black on a side and then at the bottom to make it look like there's a shadow? Well, I was doing that on the bottom and the left to make it look like the light was coming from the right, and as it turned out, instead of a line, it turned out to be this big blob, and this really, really, really heavy line that was like running off the page, and it did that at the bottom too. And I was thinking, "This is just so terrible. I feel like I really messed it up." And Mom was there, and she was like, "Oh no, you didn't; oh no, you didn't. You to finish this up. You have to keep drawing this. You have to keep doing this." And I said, "No, I'm not going to keep doing this." She said, "You have to finish this up; you have to keep doing this and you have to use this one." And I said, "No, it's the worst thing I've ever drawn in my life." And we got into this shouting, I was shouting at her and she was shouting at me, and she was trying to cover my mouth and I bit her hand. And then I snatched the poster and I ripped it up. And then I woke up.
