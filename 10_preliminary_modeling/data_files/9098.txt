My class was scheduled for 9 am. On the day of the first class I didn't wake up until 8:15. Even though I realized I should be there already, I was feeling so tired that I decided to lie down for just another few minutes. Unfortunately, I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 9:16. When I saw what time it was I was just frantic. I was rushing around trying to figure out what to do and the quickest way to get ready and get there. I decided I should call Judy A and tell her what happened, though I didn't know what I was going to say to her. This was so major, so bad, for me to do this. I went to the computer to try to find her phone number but then quit and asked Matthew to find it for me. As I was getting ready to go I realized that I had not even finished the preparation for the class. I didn't have my PowerPoint slides done or my structures. Matthew was telling me to calm down, but I thought that was just preposterous.
