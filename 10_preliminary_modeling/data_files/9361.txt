I am adding salt to a waterbed to keep it from leaking or spoiling--but the bed is outside--larger than a king-size bed and above a neat green lawn that extends about four feet from the platform of the bed on all sides. The bed is about five feet above the ground. When I have added about ten tablespoons of salt, I feel it is enough. Suddenly the water of the bed is a quivering jelly mass about a foot high, greenish grey and beautiful on its plywood foundation. It is above me when I step to the sidewalk to admire it. Since it has no covering of rubber or plastic, I fear it will trickle from vibrations of busses or if I touch it--a flood is possible. I think about trenching the grass with a V to the street so not all of grass will be killed from the salt water--sacrifice some grass to save the rest. Nothing happens except it gets smaller, down to four inches from evaporation when dream ends.
