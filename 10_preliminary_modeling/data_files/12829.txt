I was at home. People kept breaking in all the time. Mom said that we (Ezra, Valerie and kids and I) should leave the back door open. This guy came and attacked us. Mom came and stopped him. He had stuff of ours in his car. Kevin Heffernan was there, but he hadn't taken anything and we let him go but then stopped him again. He had my toy box in his boot.
