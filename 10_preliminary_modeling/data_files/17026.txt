It's the end of year show at the college I either teach at or went to. The building starts off in the dream being an enormous 1960s tower block of endlessly identical scruffy corridors and studios. The place has been boarded up and divided by the students into a rabbit warren-like series of exhibition spaces for their show. It's scruffy and confusing. Next I'm with my friend Toby. He seems to know where to go. He says we have to catch a train. We do. It's an enormous train. It now takes on the form of the college. It is altered inside - all the seats have been taken out, and there are partitions like the art school show. It's also scruffy, and I can't see any actual artwork - just the occasional video screen. I bump into the head of the college. He's rather enthusiastic about something. Teenaged girls (probably students) run through the train drinking.
