It starts as a sweeping view of a new snowboarding mountain, and it's as if it's some sort of video game where you can do stuff that's unrealistic. People are popping their feet out of bindings and doing graps and riding away clear on one part of the hill, though there is this suspended moat that a shark tank for this huge monster shark that has this disgusting mouth that opens up like this [drawing of a shark with huge open mouth], almost like some plant would open up like a flower to eat you. And people are jumping over it. All the sudden I'm sitting right next to the tank with some grandma (not either one of my grandparents) and we see it swim around. Then some old man climbs in the tank and gets eaten and I wake up.
