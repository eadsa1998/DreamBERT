A woman with a manly hairstyle and a thick, muscular body is trying to kill my sister Lydia. The woman wants a box that Lydia has. The contents are valuable. I don't know what it is. There is a conspiracy going on between Lydia's husband and the woman and her husband to get the box and kill Lydia. I try to snatch the box and the woman is coming toward Lydia. I step in between them. The woman laughs and warns me to stay out of it or I will be killed. I say, "I can't let you hurt my sister." I have to try. We struggle. I yell out to a blind woman like Becky to break the windows and unlock the doors. She slowly walks toward the window, being very inept and saying testily she wasn't being inept. I manage to capture the woman, yelling to someone to help me hold onto her. I manage to get her handcuffed. She is a tricky, wily woman. I smash through the glass panes of the door windows and I pull her outdoors and down the country village road. I call out, "Where's the sheriff's office?" No one is helping. The sheriff, a pleasant-looking young man, saunters up and asks what I want. I am desperately holding on to this almost escaping woman and explaining the situation. I realize that while we are talking, her husband is cleaning the broken glass panes I shattered to get out of the house and they are setting me up to look like I am harming them.
