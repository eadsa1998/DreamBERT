 I'm with my uncle Brian Vincent at his house. Other family members are there. I go into the bathroom to defecate. People outside the bathroom joke about breaking down the door while I'm defecating. They knock and pound on the door, and I jokingly yell, "No!". Someone outside fidgets with the handle on the door: they have the key. The door bursts open and Brian comes in. This surprises me a lot! I stand up from the toilet with my pants down and my hands up, as if he were pointing a gun at me. Part of the toilet is broken, and has fallen on the floor. Brian is mad this has happened, and he thinks I broke the toilet. I put the part back, and the toilet seems to be okay. Something happens with my aunt/and Brian's wife Janice Redding and other family members.
