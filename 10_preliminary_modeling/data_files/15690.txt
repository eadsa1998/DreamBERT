I was at this like 'camp' and we had a hotel thing, but it was in the middle of a village and it was run by the same people. I think I had bought the McDonald's? Except it was like a supermarket and I owned like half of it/invested in it or something. We had to line up and we were at the end of the last queue and I said "I thought it would be a good idea to invest in McDonald's, because you know it's not going anywhere" and joking about having to line up. There was something weird going on there, like people were going missing. I was with Dan Palmer, and we were investigating. We went into one building where we thought the dodgy stuff was going on. I can't remember why, but there ended up being a lot of severed fingers [reference to Stalled] - I think there was a 'rite of passage' and people were turning into something else and part of this was having their fingers severed. We managed to escape from there and went back to the hotel. One lady kept going on about needing lights in the bottom row of the store and continued going on about it even at the hotel. We went back to our room, which was next to their room. Dan got into bed and I reached over him to reach something and he grabbed me and I laughed and jumped back. I got onto the bed and leaned over and started kissing him. I went on top of him and I felt him get hard. We took our pants off and started having sex. I heard some noises and could see shadows of people behind the door and I tried to tell him, but he waved it off and we continued. I woke up part way through.
