 I'm at a downhill skiing place. Sleds are being used instead of skis. I go down the hill after watching someone go before me. It is a big hill, and people start sliding at different heights, or points, on the way up the hill. I don't want to go all the way to the top. I slide down the hill from a point that is pretty high up, but I slide really slow and stop before I get to the base of the hill. I jokingly whine about the slide. A woman who seems to be a conglomerate of an acquaintance named Mary Phelps and a classmate of mine from Brimson named Heather come and jump on me. A man I know from Brimson named John comes and picks up my glove or mitten. It is dark green in color. I quickly grab it out of his hand. My friend Hilary Nano is there. She tries to assure John, who is mad at me, that the reason I took the glove was because I was nervous.
