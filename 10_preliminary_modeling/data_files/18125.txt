I just finished reading a play in which the two principle characters take poison at the end and die on their wedding night. This was the subject of the dream I had last night and can only remember part of, in which I was one of these two characters. Only in this case an old woman found us and gave us some sort of an antidote for it. I didn't think it would do much good because it was about 12 hours since we had taken the poison or something. But then both of us knew we were in a play. My husband and I--I don't know if this was my husband really or a character in the play--we knew that we were in a play, but we also knew it was real and we didn't know how it was going to come out. But I figured that since we were being allowed to talk about it, to talk about our future and whether or not we are going to die, we probably are going to stay alive and not be poisoned. If we were dead, somebody else would be reporting about it. we wouldn't still be talking about it.
