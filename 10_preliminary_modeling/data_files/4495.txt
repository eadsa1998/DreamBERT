["Cleaning out the carbos."] I am in an office building. I have an office. I walk down a hall and see an opened cupboard. It is my old one but some one else opened it. I see it is stuffed with boxes of Oreo cookies, breads and other high carb foods. I think they've been there for several years and may be stale by now. I wonder if I should give them away to Charla or someone and clean out the cupboard. I see a set of keys in the lock with the identifying name of Babbles as the nickname and Adore somebody as the real name. An office manager here who opened the cupboard without my permission. I also see my old desk in the middle of the hall and phones. I lift the receiver and see the phone line is dead. I really should return all this stuff so others can use them as I have my own office now and don't use these things. I see several secretaries and wonder which one I should talk with to get this taken care of.
