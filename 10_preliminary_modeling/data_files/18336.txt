A series of adventures on my part against a master criminal of some sort who was a beetle. His name was Sartog. The last one in this series is what I dreamed about just before awakening. It went like so. My wife and I were staying in a cabin in the woods somewhere. Sartog, this evil beetle, was there with us. I think that I had finally conquered him in the venture before this and I was keeping him around just to save him, or something like that, for old times sake. One morning I woke up in bed and my wife was smoking and this upset me very much. I sort of attributed it partly to Sartog's influence. So for the rest of the day I sort of alternated between looking around for Sartog, although I really wasn't blaming him entirely, and being as nasty as I could to my wife. Sartog also had grown by this time too and was now a little baby girl, like my daughter, about a year old or something like that. The predominant mood of this dream was quite unpleasant. I was both unhappy and being extremely nasty. One other incident in this dream, between being nasty, I was trying to cook my own breakfast. I think I was cooking oatmeal in a very big pot on the stove. I was having some difficulty in cooking it. Thinking I needed the help of a high school physics teacher or something like that, who would probably know something about cooking.
