I was playing Minecraft [I started playing it last night] except it was real. I was in it and everything looked normal but I could shoot blocks out. My home as similar to the one I built in a cave. I had trouble with the door when the zombies came at night. Then people turned up and tried to steal everything, but I convinced them to join up with me instead.
