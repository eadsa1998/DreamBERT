I was watching Doctor Who. Rose had come back and she wouldn't say how. Martha and The Doctor (David Tennant) were there too. They were at this place and there some evil blokes. They all got separated and could talk to each other over these speakers. Rose thought that she was going to die. There was some washing place with clothes. They tricked the bad guys, but then they caught on.
