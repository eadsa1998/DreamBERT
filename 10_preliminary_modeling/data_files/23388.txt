A dark house, hazy, scary -- cats with big eyes -- not red, but evil. A very evil presence but could not see it. Tried to leave. When I turned, I was outside the house and there was a field with a light shining on it and corn fields at the end of the field. I tried to run but when I started running, I turned into a beast -- white and thick, maybe hairy. I stopped and turned to look at the house and was myself again. So I turned to run again, and again I became the beast. There was a windmill in the field.
