I was watching the second last episode of Lost. There were two Jack's. Charlie dragged a guy 200m through empty space. He was still dead on Earth, but everything was black, except for people. They were in a forest. The real Jack had died and someone said that 'dead Jack's right there' (not in front of the other one) and Kate was upset.
