I went to the bank to cash a bond, then walked down the street window shopping. In one of the stores, I noticed a woman sitting tied and gagged in a chair in front of the door. There was a chair under the door knob on the outside and as I tried to remove it, the woman shook her head no. I then realized the store was probably being robbed, so I tried to get out of that doorway and into the one next door before the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally the man came out and saw me, but my legs wouldn't move. Finally after what seemed to be a great struggle, I did it. I stayed there for a while trying to make myself small. The store wasn't open and there was no one on the street. I began to worry that the man would come out and see me, so I decided to venture farther down the street. Again, my legs wouldn't move. The last thing I remembered was that I was glad I didn't get the money for the money I cashed in.
