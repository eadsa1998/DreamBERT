I am walking down the street and it begins to rain. So I go back to the house. It is a huge house. I see my mother sitting in the kitchen and tell her I'm going to my room. She tells me to take the other stairs. We walk through a laundry room. I look up at the stairs and say, "My goodness! Look at all those stairs!" They are wide and lots of them. I go to a room. Then I see a large play car in the hall. I go to my brother's room. They ask my advice about the needlework they are doing. It's for Rochelle's wedding, but they heard maybe she's not getting married. Should they do the "A" or not? It's a beautiful picture of a bride with an ornate initial in blue threads. I don't really offer any answer. I return to the room and start unpacking. I put my yellow nylon nightie in the top drawer of a dresser. Then I decide to leave. A man says, "O.k., clean up and repaint the walls." I refuse to repaint saying, "I could understand it if I'd been there a few days, but how dirty can it get in a few hours?" I leave; they are shocked. Rochelle complains.
