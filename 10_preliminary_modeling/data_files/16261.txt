I was setting up Halloween things, and I was, I had this one witch candle, and I had this like ghost thing that was a candle as well. And for some reason I was setting these things up in the garbage closet instead of on the porch and I also had my other little c_______s and stuff like that. And I was afraid that if we left the candles in there too long, they were going to start to melt down and set things on fire. And so I took them out, and I just took everything out for the time being. And then next thing I knew, we were up on the roof doing a play about some Halloween characters. We were like acting it out, and I was just like a spectator watching all of this. It was Mrs. Dougherty's class I realized, and she was like sitting perched in a tree a few feet away watching us as well. This was in front of my room. Part of the roof in front of Mom's room, we heard Al Jerot playing on a tape player and we heard people singing. And Mrs. Dougherty said, "Wait a second. My class is supposed to be up here." And so she kind of got out of the tree and walked over there and saw that it was Mr. Girard's class over there, which really this was switched around because our class should have been doing the singing and his class should have been doing the acting. So then she comes back from talking to him and says, "My class over here." And she has us climb out onto the tree and down, and then we're like running around our back yard, which is like four times bigger than it usually is. I think this is going to auto-reverse. I can't believe this thing can't even auto-reverse on its own any more. I have to help it along. But anyway, [laugh] that was the basic point of that. Then we were just running around and playing around. Oh, I know, this group of girls said, "Jasmine is so good. She only talks to her boyfriend and to her mother." And we were like holding hands and saying little crazy stuff like that. And that's all.
