In a city like VIENNA with Pedro (?) or Frank, we are looking for an apartment. We move in, but then he finds a "better place," not on a main street and less noisy. I look out of the window and push aside the lace curtains and look out onto the stairwell, or air shaft, like in Vienna, from the toilet. -- I see the bottom of a balcony whose plaster has fallen down and peeled off. (vivid image) I think to myself that if it has lasted this long, even many centuries, then it will last a while longer as long as I will live here. See a young man who shows me the fuse box which looks clean and new and begins to give me a tour of the house. As we talk he tells me he knows Alex -- (?), who used to teach at the Art School...."What a coincidence." I decide to go sight seeing, but wake up before I go out......
