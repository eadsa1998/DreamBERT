I was watching a movie which was kind of dull, but it was also somewhat hard to follow and it didn't really wrap anything up until the end. It was kind of a thriller and at the end, this old guy (about 50-60) who we thought was the bad guy confronted this guy at a speech he was giving and it was implied he was actually the good guy. I was then in a room on one of the top storeys of this building in a city with the other main characters and a lady was like 'oh no' and I moved to look out the window and saw a mushroom cloud. A shock wave hit and we saw a building start collapsing. Some people started climbing out of this building onto another one that it was connected to, but we decided to stay in here and wait. But the building started to sway and the room began to collapse. We tried to climb out the window and then somehow ended up in the ocean or a pool.
