I am living next to a church. My refrigerator is there and I need meat. I go there and there is a party going on. I tell a person there that the refrigerator is unplugged but it is okay because I have to clean it. A friend, who is a physician, is among the guests. Carole, a friend from high school days, tells me to look at him. She says he thinks he is smart sponging off everyone. I try to quiet her. It is now like this is my house and I have decided to let the party continue. The party is going on and it appears we are celebrating a new church basement. I see a boy whom I had a crush on in the eighth grade and tell him I hadn't planned the party but I am enjoying it. His face turns very angry and he says it was okay until I said I enjoyed it. Now he doesn't like it. I try to explain and he walks away. It seems he is someone I care about or want to impress. Now things start to go wrong. He begins making fun of people there and pointing out why they are bad. Some girl gets caught in an apparatus that folds out from the wall and it appears her chest will be crushed. We call an ambulance. Next we are home and my husband can't understand why I am angry about the mess and the embarrassment. He goes back for something and learns different people from our old hometown have put huge amounts of money into fixing up the mess and it is going to be okay.
