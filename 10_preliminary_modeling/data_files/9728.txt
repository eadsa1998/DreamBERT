With people from Church: visit Marissa and Father Andrew, under difficult circumstances. - Later on a train, during war: I find a boy, can't find his mother; I help with laundry: pink, fluffy pillow cases; - Talk with Ron and Shirley Roland; Shirley does not like me, he says; "Why?" "Because you haven't been nice to her."
