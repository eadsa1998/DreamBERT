 I'm with my coworkers Amy Rancher and Jenny at my cabin near Fishing Haven. I'm in bed wearing white brief underwear. They are in the next room or in my roommate Sean's bed. They get up at 6:05am, which is really early I think. It is 6:00am now. Jenny gets up and goes towards the stairs. I say to her, "I like you, I really do." She replies, "Then dump me." She yells out because she sees a bear at the bottom of the kitchen stairs. I jump up and run over to the stairs. I look down and see it is the grill. We see it from the flashlight she is using, which is pretty dim. I get a better flashlight and shine it down the stairs. We see a sow bear and her cub! I close the first trap door, which still enables me to see the bears from the top of the stairs. I pound on the wall with my foot. The bears stir. There is a second trap door, like the one we actually have, which closes the stairs off totally from the kitchen. I try to close this door. There is a hinge and chain which doesn't allow it to close all the way. I stomp on the door, pull it, and break the hinges. The trap door then lies flat. I think the bears will come up the stairs. The bear starts to come up, nudging open the trap door. We run. I get some pots and pans and clang them together to scare the bear off. There is only one bear now. I almost hit the bear with them, which would be a mistake, but the bear runs off from the clanging pots.
