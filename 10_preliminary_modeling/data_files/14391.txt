I was playing this game and I was a spy/detective in it. The first thing you did was choose a husband and something else. I chose the first guy I saw, but he was really ugly and had blue eyes. The role of the guy was to take the kids to school? Everyone there was weird and had a 'handler'. There was a mini game with items and one of them was a cigarette and I took up smoking. They had a strange flavour and it felt weird and it was hard to breathe. I can't read my notes, but there's something about a robot which had another robot in it. The weight was like 94.5kg. There were Staffy's and toy plates? There were stupid places like a wall? I quit going to the Cat Haven and was annoyed that I wouldn't have a chance to develop anything with Preston (that's where I'd met him).
