["Lunch with an Indian Chief."]  I am seated at the head of a long dining table. An older Native American man and a small girl (maybe Charla) is seated at the far end on a side. We are going to have lunch. I ask him to have lunch with me. My mother begins to set the food before us, mostly by throwing it from where she is seated on a couch which is not facing us. I say to the man, I feel uncomfortable so far away from you. I'll change my place. I move myself over to right across from him. I quickly drink my soup not really looking at him or talking. I get up to put the dishes away in the adjoining kitchen. I talk a bit with him as I carry the glass dishes into the sink. I put the pretty glass cake plate with the circle place for a cup of tea on it into the sink. I move two empty soda cans aside. As I return to get more dishes I see my mother standing at a sink full of water in the dining room, near the foot of the table. She is going to dye her hair with hydrogen proxide. She asks me how much to put on. I tell her I'm worried she'll bleach patches of her hair if she pours it out of the bottle straight on the hair. I suggest she pour it into the water in the sink and wash her hair in it. She doesn't like that idea.
