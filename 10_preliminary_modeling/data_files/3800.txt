["Doing the right thing."] I am in an open area with several other people. This is a kingdom and the king and a woman are there. He wants me to do something and I do not want to do it because it is wrong. So I stand up and walk away, down a stairway path and around a curve and into another kingdom. The older king there likes me and he is honorable and I am honorable. There is a young man as well. And a woman like Kira of Star Trek. We do good things for the kingdom and they want me to stay but I feel the need to return to my own kingdom, and finish up what I had started. I return and they are still dishonest and I fix things and return back to the good kingdom for a visit. I try to maintain some distance with those three but end up in a bathtub (outdoors) holding hands with the old crippled king (who is in the tub with me, manual wheelchair and all) and Kira, who sits outside the tub. The young man, who I am very attracted to tries to move his face close to mine and I gently push him back and ignore him but he persists, I am happy he does. Later, Kira and I and another woman shower for a long time together we are good friends and have much to talk about to catch up on the current events of our lives. I realize I've been talking good things about the young man and he may be there in the men's shower (we are at a swimming pool.)
