 There is a fishing contest game on a computer. A line is on the screen, which is the shore. A player casts and fishes by extending a line on the screen. Someone says you've got to work the shore well. Then I am in a country area. I am shirtless and my farmer tan is prominent. This is a punishment for something, but it doesn't seem to be a bad punishment. I see Herb, the long time Fishing Haven customer. He says he got two small fish.
