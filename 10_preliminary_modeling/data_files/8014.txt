I was at a meeting or conference. Someone was making a presentation about the Maori Drawing. I had an Aha of a way to make my use of this drawing better with dreamwork. I left quickly and went to get my files or something so I could make notes of my idea. As I was thinking about it I realized that wouldn't work anyway as it would be no different than doing a regular Maori drawing. I think I'll see if I can talk to Kendall B by phone and discuss an idea about this with him. Maybe I'll just wait until conference.
