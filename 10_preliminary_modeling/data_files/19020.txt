The setting was scenes of advertising layouts and determining their appropriate slots. In their commercial use, most of the advertisements were such as hamburger, coke, these usual, everyday advertisements. These layouts were in certain phases of production. Some of them were completed and others half completed and so forth. Upon completion they would be inserted into certain slots. Neither I nor anyone else was in the dream as far as being seen. The pictures all had their own distinct setup and position in the dream. There wasn't just a floating about of like flash card pictures of these different layouts. They seemed to be fixed in a certain position for a certain reason and there were empty spot that were waiting to be filled by probably predetermined advertisement or picture or whatever. There were other products besides those named, hamburger and coke, however I cannot recall their identity.
