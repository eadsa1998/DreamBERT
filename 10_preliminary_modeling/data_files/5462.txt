I had the most vivid dreams last night. I can't remember the order exactly, since they all seemed to be happening at once. First of all, I was going down to a store to interview again. My father was writing out this list of things I should wear and say in my interview, and it was really stressing me out. He told me to bring this special coat from Vienna, and I couldn't see how that would make a difference, but oh well. Then Tony and I were skating and playing hockey in the arena. We were sort of scrimmaging one on one, but we were also hooking up on the ice. It was a sort of violent passionate event. I would try to get the puck away from him in the corner, wedging his body up against the boards as much as I could, and then we would be on the ice, helmets off, going at it (not sex). Later, when I was changing in the locker room, I discovered that my entire right thigh was covered in hair. I was horrified, not understanding how that had happened. It wasn't even just regular leg hair that I could shave off; it was like fur. But it was only on my right thigh. Anyway, next I think I was down in New York for this interview at a store. Eleanor was there teaching a class that I may have had to go audit before my interview. There were 2 other girls who were identical to me who were also interviewing at the store, and I became very discouraged. I didn't know how I was going to make myself stand out. I had my alarm clock with me for some reason instead of my phone. Bryson and Tony started chatting with me through G-chat, but I got nervous I would confuse the two of them in my chats. Then I was in a Hallmark store trying to find an appropriate thank you card for the woman who interviewed me. This part was very vivid twenty minutes ago, but I can't remember much now. I think there were some kids from abroad there, but I can't remember.
