The dream seemed somewhat familiar, like I'd had it before.  My mother and I went to a play and went up into the loft of this home-like theatre.  But I couldn't get in past my shoulders; the floor and ceiling were only about 2 feet apart.  So we left and it was like we were trying to keep me hidden from something.  Walked around the back of the block kind of covertly.  I hid in a shopping cart.
