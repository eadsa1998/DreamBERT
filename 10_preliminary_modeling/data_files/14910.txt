I heard about some puppies that were available. They were cute as hell. At some house the dogs were blocking the door. This guy had to speak with Mom. The pups were Akita Inu's. I told Mom that a Shiba Inu was what I had wanted originally. They were small dogs but they were cute. The males weren't very nice looking though but I was going to get one.
