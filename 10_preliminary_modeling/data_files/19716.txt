I owned an acre of land. Later I was greeted by some friendly girls about ten. I met my mother and sister. They went into a crowd down a stairway. A woman was standing behind me and I felt her body against my back. Then I felt something against my hips and had an orgasm. Then in my dream I awoke and was very troubled by the dream. Another dream followed in which I again awoke in my dream and was troubled: I left my mother and sister in a room where we had been sleeping. I watched some children were who lining up at a dressing room. (When I awoke in these dreams, I felt a remorse as though I had through indiscretion lost an opportunity for an illuminating experience.)
