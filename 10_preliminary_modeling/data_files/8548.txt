I was doing computer work for an association of some kind. It seems that they had a number of chapters in the association or they served the public in some way. I'm not sure if the thing I was working on was purely on their website or if I was working on something that was part of the website or that they or I thought should be on their website. It feels like I was trying to make sure this thing was available to people, or that it was consistent with-or compatible with - another thing that belonged to other people. Maybe it is some kind of an online quiz, or survey. But it seems that there is one bit of information that I feel either needs to be inputted into all versions or that what I am working on needs to be able to accept this one bit of information. That doesn't feel like an exactly right description but the best I can come up with.
