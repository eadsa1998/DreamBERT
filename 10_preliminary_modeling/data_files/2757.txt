I am in bed with a little girl. I get up and try to brush my hair and see huge bald pink spots on my head. I am appalled. I try to brush my hair to cover it up. It's a mess. Then I see my breasts and they have huge dark nipples and a deep purple rash under one breast. Then I notice the same rash under my knees. I am sick, thinking this is some awful disease. Then the purple starts disappearing like a skin color would when the pressure is off (like my ankle). I think to myself that I should spend more time looking at myself in the mirror.
