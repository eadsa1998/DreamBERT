I was going to Uncle P's visitation. I walked into the room up a middle aisle between rows of chairs that had been set up. I got halfway to the casket and stopped. It didn't even look like him. I was taken aback by how different he looked. I remembered seeing a picture of him at Christmas and I never would have known it was him if someone hadn't told me. He looked so different because of his illness.
