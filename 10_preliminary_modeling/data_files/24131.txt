My boyfriend's house was just down the street from mine (even though it really isn't), and he and all his friends were living there. My dream was about me wandering from his house to my house, just walking around the houses. I think I was looking for him. My house was really strange. It has all these hallways and rooms and wired colored lights. Then I walked into one room where my boyfriend's friend Tom was and I think he asked me to get together with him. I'm not sure how it happened, but I ended up kissing him. I don't think I ever did find my boyfriend.
