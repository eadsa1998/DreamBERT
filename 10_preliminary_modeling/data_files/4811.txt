I am walking into a filled auditorium from the back. I am to teach a performance class. The crowd is excited. I get onstage and begin to teach doing performance to keep it interesting. I use a mike. I get word that I am to fly with a pilot to Germany for a drop. A woman notices the pilot is my boyfriend and she threatens to tell the commander. I order her not to so that when she tells on me, I can get her in trouble. She doesn't care. She knocks (raps) on the commander's door. I let her, knowing I can get her in trouble later. This is the night shift of the performance class. There is a day shift as well. I teach a class on army scheduling of health runs to the war zone. I use performance as a method of getting information across.
