I'm stuck at a petrol station without a car or any money. The station owner also runs a convenience store and an off license. It is evidently very popular - there's a massive queue to get beer and groceries. I queue up to buy a bottle of wine for a party (forgetting I had no money). For some reason I never leave that place - perhaps the party didn't happen, or perhaps it happened there. In any case, now it's the next day and I can't get home. The owner, who reminds me of a London Cabbie, lends me a car to get home. But first I must fill out various papers. He's not just lending it to me for nothing - he's hiring it to me. I end up at a family gathering in a hotel. My mother is there, worrying about the cost of hiring the car, and getting stressed out about it on my behalf.
