I am like Olga, a Spanish-speaking wife of a TV show personality. I am shy and sweet. My husband arranges an audition for me. Jerry Lewis is the producer. He says, "Start the camera," and I go camera shy, hardly able to speak, then he says, "Camera off, " and I feel better. Only he left one on so I nod and talk and everyone thinks I'm great. My husband and I are going to do a show together.
