I am in Derek's house and it is dream group time. I see a woman standing with her back to me and I say, "Hi, Lisa." She turns and it isn't Lisa. I feel embarrassed, especially since that might make Derek know I was thinking about him and Lisa. Derek decides to go to the grocery store. Then an overweight man sits on the couch and I sit next to him and then Eric comes and sits on my right. It's very cozy. I am explaining to them what we did at the last meeting that they had missed. I am telling them and then I ask for my notes. Derek is back and he hands me my note pad. I open it and laugh realizing that I thought I'd written words but I had only drawn pictures to remind me. That's not going to help the people who weren't there. Then I pick up another note pad and see writing. I try to read it, but I see I've only written a few words or phrases to remind me. One says, "Three strikes and you're out," then a space and then two other words, "jerk" and another word. I say to the overweight man, "I can't remember what this was about." Derek comes up to me with a silly grin on his face and I say, "What's with the Kirk Douglas grin?" I then look over next to him on his right and see the real Kirk Douglas. Derek had met him in the grocery store and brought him home to meet us. Kirk is interested in me and is flirting. Derek is a little jealous of that and of how I let those two men sit so close to me on the couch.
