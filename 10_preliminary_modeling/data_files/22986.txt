Joe Duggan was going to share the driving with me on a long trip, like from an East Coast city to my hometown.  It was night, and he stopped at a garage to have something checked.  I guess I went somewhere else for a while, because I remember coming back and hoping the car was ready to go.  Instead, he said that the car had a rear wheel bearing that was on the verge of breaking, and they didn't know if they had the part to fix it that night.  I was disappointed.  The guy who drove it into the garage seemed to suddenly remember the possibility that they did have the part after all, but I don't remember what came of it.  <p
