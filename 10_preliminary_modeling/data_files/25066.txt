 I get the feeling that I'm at the intersection where the Sinclair Gas Station is, exiting the Uptown Mall in Oak Grove. I'm waiting at the stoplights, going out of the lot. I'm in a car with some people I don't know. We're going to the casino. We get there. My friend Stephen Ramos is playing on a slot machine. One kid gets a full screen of Red and a few symbols. He wins 400 quarters. Another lady wins some nickels. I have a bucket of nickels and some cash. I give the people I'm with my nickels, and don't spend any cash.
