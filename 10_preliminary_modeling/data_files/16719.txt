I am in a (video?) store. I don't remember what I was doing, but I thought to myself, "If I'm really lucid, why the heck am I doing THIS?" The lady behind the counter was smoking, but she said the rest of the place was non-smoking. I thought this was strange. Well, I thought, again "wait a minute, I'm lucid, I shouldn't be doing this!" (standing there doing nothing) and then I thought I'd conjure this girl that I remember from 3 1/2 years ago. I remember using my hands and saying her name, trying to get her to appear. Nothing happened. Then I thought of another "method of execution"- (I'd decided once in waking life that, if you want something you can't do yourself in a dream, you've gotta ask somebody else- especially a wise man or mystic or someone who knows what they're doing!). So, I'd ask the lady behind the counter if she knew where this girl was. So, the lady walked to the other end of the store, and the girl appeared in the room, yet didn't look much like she did last time I saw her. She ran away from me.
