I couldn't make the elevator work. Had trouble first to bring it down and then even when I pressed three buttons, it didn't move. Two men came to help. Then I am walking along a slippery grass path on the high bank of a stream. Then I cross a gravelly field thinking it's lucky I have on my old shoes. I ask the woman with me how much further. Is it to that new building over there? "Yes." As we approach I see indications that the field is being prepared for a lawn.
