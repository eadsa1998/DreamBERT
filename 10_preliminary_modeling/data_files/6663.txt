A plot was on. We placed an ax at the transom so when the door was entered the ax would fall and strike him. I was holding it in readiness but my arm became tired so I fixed the ax on the door. Then I went to find Jo to ask who was the victim. Had some difficulty locating him as he was in the toilet. Then I find the victim is O.M. I exclaimed, "What idiots you are to get me to help you kill the man I love." Then I wondered if he heard. He cane and went into an empty room to talk to mother. I went and got the ax and put it in a pail. O.M. came out and began to talk to me. I said something about wishing to play again but not so often as last spring because I was really crowding myself too much and getting nervous and irritable. He seemed to understand and it was agreed we would play again and I was very happy.
