I had been married two days and, at the time, was cleaning a house which I did not recognize as any I had ever been in before, but one in which I felt perfectly comfortable. My mother was directing me, as she does at home, and I was working vigorously. I had no idea, at this time, of anyone else in my family, such as Dad or my 2 older brothers. I hadn't seen my husband for 2 days, but I felt that I could make it up to him and I was determined to try.
