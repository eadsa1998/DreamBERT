Coming out of my house, I found a beautiful jewel and I took it upon myself to find a buyer for it, and nobody would buy it until I went to a pawn shop. There the person who waited on me gave me thousands of dollars and I was the greatest millionaire. I had many properties and money fell out of my hands.
