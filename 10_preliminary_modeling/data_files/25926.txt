 I'm at basketball practice. It has been a long time since my high school team has had a game. There is a new man there who has red hair. We are warming up. The coach sends me down the road a ways. He says 50 miles, but just means for me to go down. I go down a road and stop where I see a blue X on the ground. I'm on Home Avenue in Oak Valley and have just walked from near home to past my neighbor's house. The coach throws a light stick at me, the kind one cracks at Halloween so it glows. He throws it up in the air. It is a game of some kind. My classmate from Brimson Ivory Alshire is there.
