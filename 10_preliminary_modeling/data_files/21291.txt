I was working and when I was thru, I couldn't find my clothes. I looked high and low and couldn't find them. I came over to Ernie Koelpin. I picked up a piece of leather. It was thick. I said that would make a pair of soles for shoes. My shoes are what I was really looking for. I was in Rivertown. Eddie and Elsi were living next door to where we used to live. We were looking over the yard. I said their yard was larger than ours and they could have a big garden. We intended to have a garden also. I was looking the land over.
