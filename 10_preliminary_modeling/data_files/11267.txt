I was at a co-op house meeting. There was some sort of a complaint. The guilty person wasn't known. A girl at the meeting seemed to feel guilty or else felt that the implication was directed at her. She related her story. In this story, she told how someone called her. But she didn't say who. How it happened in the dream was that the person who called her was me. Someone asked her who called her. (This someone is unknown in the dream.) She told him. This someone confronted me and accused, implied, or told me. I immediately came to my defense saying that I did call, but for such and such reasons, and that I did stop back at the house, but for a few minutes. This defense in the dream seemed to be a satisfactory defense or story as it seemed to clear me.
