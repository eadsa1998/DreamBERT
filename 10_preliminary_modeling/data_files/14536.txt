I was on another planet, and I assumed it was a Cylon planet. It was abandoned looking and I was there with some others. There was a building that was falling apart. There was a weird language written on the walls. I went over to this park bench. Helo and Athena (both Battlestar Galactica) were there. I liked Helo. Athena had these bits of tree and was folding them in half and then using this thing to cut in the middle of them. She stopped as she and Helo were mucking around. They went off to have sex, so I took over. I looked over to where they went and they were lying naked with a blanket on the grass.
