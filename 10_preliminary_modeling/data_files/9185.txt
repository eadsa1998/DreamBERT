I was going to be getting married in a few days. Rachel S jumped into a pool with her clothes on. I was concerned but no one else was. It was a small rectangular pool. She could stand on the bottom anywhere in the pool and still have her head above water, but just barely. It was about four by six feet. Something about Darren.
