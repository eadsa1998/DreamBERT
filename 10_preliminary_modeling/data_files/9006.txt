Bruce W was in the hospital and I went to see him. When I walked into the hospital, the area that I was in had an escalator and was open to the second floor so I could see a lot of people in the open area of the second floor, some standing around the escalator. I immediately noticed Bill F standing facing the escalator and leaning on the half-wall next to it. One of my nieces or nephews was standing next to him. I went up the escalator and was surprised to see how many family members were there. My parents and all of my siblings were there as well as some of my nieces and nephews. Bruce W's mom was there as well as Aunt H and Aunt P. There was a fourth woman there that I referred to as one of their sisters but it wasn't my mother. The open area on the 2nd floor was fairly large. I went over and spoke with Bill F first and then some of my other immediate family. Then I went over and spoke with my aunts. They were all standing side-by-side in a row. I put my arms out and around the two on the end giving them a group hug. I noticed they were all wearing all black. At first I just thought it was odd then I became concerned that Bruce W was in a more serious condition than I realized.
