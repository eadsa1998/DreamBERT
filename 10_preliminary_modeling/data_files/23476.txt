There was a series of long shallow pools that I decided to clean up. The rain and mold had settled in a few areas of the pools and the water was not equally deep. I had a long-handled broom that I was using to swish the shallow water around with. I swished a big wave over to the far side of the pool where there were rich people (or people better off than me) and my father was over there and he came over to tell me now to do that anymore, that I was disturbing them.
