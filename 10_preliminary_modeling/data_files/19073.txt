In this dream I recall that I was with a friend, but I don't remember his name, and I vaguely remember what he looks like, but he was supposedly a friend. He was in trouble, some sort of trouble with the law, although I'm not sure what it was. It seemed as though we were both very young at the time, say around 16 or 17. He was running from the law for some reason. I remember that I was with him. I also remember an accident. We were driving in a car. We pulled into a gas station to get some gas, but we didn't have any money. I remember that he had some type of power that he could actually with the end of his finger, he could make the handle of the gas pump come off and go over to the car and start gas coming in. He could speed it up and everything else he could do so that he had some magic power in his finger. I remember that he did that and got this gas and pulled off real fast and never paid for it. That's how I remember we must have gotten rid of the car because we were walking along what seemed to be the outskirts of a city. There were weeds and so forth. Then we were coming into the city and I remember that there were certain neighborhoods that we didn't want to go into because the people there knew us and we wanted to keep way from them. Finally we got in nearer to the neighborhood where I used to live, and I remember that we were at what seemed to be my house, but it didn't even look like my house. I remember seeing one of my neighbors working on his yard. I went over and started talking to him and pretty soon this buddy of mine came up while we were talking to him, and I remember that he was stacking logs or something. I guess he was stacking logs. A friend of mine, he had $39,000 invested. We were helping him stack his logs and that's the last I remember.
