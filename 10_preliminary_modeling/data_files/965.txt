I get 2 free coupons and I'm at the jewelry counter in a drug store. One is for 50 pounds of 50 shells (sea shells). The other is for a watch band. I have a $5 bill and a couple of ones. An old guy comes in, throwing money away. He's drunk or crazy. Others run and pick it up and encourage him. I stand at the counter and feel embarrassed. He gives me some coupons and some $l bills and a $5. I'm concerned that he shouldn't do that, he'll regret it later. Yet, I need the money so I just stand there. I push away the coupon and feel sad because I don't get much money. Finally, the woman at the counter comes to wait on me. She's harried because another person has a coupon for 50 shells and it's tedious work. The person has to sift through and pick out each one and then she has to examine each one because one might have gotten a valuable one and she's very conscientious. It's a family store. The drunk man turns into a Mickey Rooney type with a gun. He's going to rob the place. Now I stand a chance of loosing even the meager $8 I had of my own. I see watch bands and I'm looking for a cheap one that would fit a watch face I have at home. The guy is waving the gun around. The father of the family that owns the store tries to help the Mickey Rooney guy who is now a baby named Tom. He gets him pinned at the door. I run to a phone to call the police. The father says, "No, we're not going to call the police because I want this baby Tom to set things right and straighten out." At first I am worried; the father's really dumb and will lose. Then I see that Tom is touched by this and gives up his gun. Now Tom is a member of the family. A brother gives up and introduces himself to Tom, a smaltzy happy ending like in a Father Knows Best show.
