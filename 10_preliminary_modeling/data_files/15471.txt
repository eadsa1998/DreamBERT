I was at university in a computer room playing Spider Solitaire. I had an achievements window open. A guy had used hacks to get them all. I found a phone sim that had everyone's birthdays on it. University was big and was like a shop on the inside. I walked to the carpark and there were lots of red cars. I realised I was in the wrong section because I had gone to the shop section. I went back in and then I was with Ezra. There was a zoo section with big tigers. There was a shop and the clothes were all like 2XL+ and Ezra was trying on 6XL and when he came out the shirt was nowhere to be seen. He reached up his shorts and it was there. We got food with Dad. We got some meat and I had fish with tomato sauce. Mom watched a clip of a re-enacted scene from Community with Chevy Chase. I told her to go to the proper one. There was a place at university which people from Firefly -- including Nathan Fillion and Adam Baldwin. Meredith (Grey's Anatomy) was on top of a cupboard. I took a photo to upload to Facebook.
