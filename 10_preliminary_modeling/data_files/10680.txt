The government was obligating people to register for death trials. A series of tests were devised to measure how good a citizen an individual was. If we could pass the tests, we would live. Otherwise we would be executed. It was Maria's turn and I was afraid she wouldn't make it. I walked out of the testing clinic and I see a quarter. I realize that I am about to have one of my recurrent dreams. I see another quarter and begin to pick up quarters. I am getting happy. Someone tries to move in on my quarters. I stop them. I tell them not to fuck with my quarters. He picks some dimes, then goes for one of my quarters. I grab him by the collar and take all his money. I run towards a building where a gang of young kids await. I scream for them and they pick the kid up and throw him in between a crack in a gate to a swimming pool. I thank them and decide I want to swim too. "No problem, Molehill Annie," one says. I wonder why they always call me that. (I am a six-year-old girl.)
