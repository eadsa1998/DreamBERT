In this dream the figure of the place of central hall, I had had a debate with myself earlier in the dream as to whether or not her hair would be parted in the middle and combed down on the side of her head so that it was long and sure enough later in the dream, there's a very clear image, crystal clear image, of her with her in this style. Her hair is blond, bleached, I believe, and she looks exactly as she does in all her pictures. The feeling upon seeing her as I had predicted was one of slight disappointment and she somehow appeared vitalized because of it. The female that I'm describing is the contemporary jazz singer, Peggy Lee. There were activities that led up this image, but I don't recall them. As I saw her. It appeared to be something akin to an interview in which there was visible a picture of her from about the middle of the bodice up, and she was engaged in conversation with possibly some interviewer. She was smiling warmly and even radiatingly as is often seen in her pictures on record albums and other places.
