I had been to see Dr. Ar. He showed me a record of someone with many complaints who yet took only "this much space." Then he said, "I'm going to have you talk with Dr. S." I ask what kind of doctor he is. He doesn't answer but leads the way. I follow feeling irritated and wonder if Dr. S. is a psychiatrist. We pass through an office whose setup makes me think the doctor is an oculist, but we go on through the crowded waiting room of another office. I find myself outside looking at some books. Dr. S. comes out, remarks about those old records of his, tells me he didn't like psychology. One book is marked Oubong, West Africa. So he had been there too and the pictures wouldn't indicate he had been working as a psychiatrist there. I wonder how he became prepared but I do want to talk it over with him anyway. I go back to the waiting room which is now empty, try the closed door which is not locked and look for the doctor. Hear him talking to the last patient in another room. At last my turn is coming. [I had been disappointed in talking to Dr. Ar. In my last office call on him.]
