My "roommate" kicked me out and I had to leave without any money or my clothes. I came back and packed my things so I would be all right. I go out to a living room. Pete and Maggie are there. Nate comes in, all excited. He has a formula, an answer. But he can't figure out some of the symbols. He asks me what they mean. I look at them and say, "I don't know." I give up and start to walk to my room. He insists I try. It is a shaped thing and he says it means guilt but he doesn't know what the "B" means. I say, "I don't know." We all sit on the couch and as he's talking, I caress his back and hair. Maggie looks surprised and Nate says, "We used to be good friends," or, "We're old friends." I am aware of Pete. He feels jealous. I get up to regretfully walk away, a small two-yea- old child clings to my legs. It is pleasant, the closeness, and we walk away from Nate.
