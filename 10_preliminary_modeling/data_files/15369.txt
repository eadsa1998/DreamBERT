My car was out the front of the old house (on the grass in the middle). There was a note on it left from these people who lived across the road. Dad left a note about Zalgo and the next day they put Zalgo stuff all over it (like 'he comes' etc). I went to work and Ezra was there. We finished most of it and then we started chatting and I realised I hadn't done the floors yet. I quickly got to cleaning them but the place was bigger and different and there was a small office room. Ezra left to wait for me and Isaak came out. He looked in the sink and asked if I had relatives here and I said no and then said Ezra was here for a bit. He said something about my car and the police. I ran out and there was more writing on it with 'fail' on the door. I went to some place with a bunch of people and some of them were in the group that did it. Everyone put their feet and hands on someone else and a girl asked to leave to take a pregnancy test.
