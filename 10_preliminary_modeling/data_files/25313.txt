 I'm playing basketball in the gymnasium at Brimson College with a bunch of guys. I sit out while my friends Jimmy Youngman and Sam Crimson and the varsity basketball players have a game of four-on-four. Another guy arrives, so we start playing five-on-five. I play well at first. I haven't played in a long time. I jump a couple heads higher than everyone else while rebounding. People are dressed in blue and in green. Then the first year players come in. I start making bad decisions when playing; make some bad plays. I have a blue bandana and a hat on. I take these off.
