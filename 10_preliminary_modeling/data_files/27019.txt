I remember being told by the boy who sits next to me in P&amp;A, that his mother had died the day before. All the other kids were laughing and telling jokes and I thought they were acting terrible considering that the boy was feeling low. I got real mad at the kids and finally told them that Whit's Mother had died. I asked Whit why he had come to school and tried to console him.
