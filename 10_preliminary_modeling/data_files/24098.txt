I am at work and I am busy doing something. The wife of the owner of the restaurant, whom I really dislike (almost to the point of hatred), walks up behind me. As I am paying attention to whatever it is I am doing, she comes behind me and kisses me on the cheek. I spin around in disgust and it is no longer her standing there. Instead it is my girlfriend and I am very surprised that it is her. Actually I was relieved that it was her and not the owner's wife.
