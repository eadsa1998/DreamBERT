I am standing on the mud flats looking for the ocean. I'm up to my ankles in mud. A male, soft, sweet and gentle, almost a spirit, stands to my left behind me. I ask him where the ocean is. He smiles and points forward. I see a slit in the land, like the birth opening on a whale. Two "people," one male and one female, are together in a circle, the woman coming up through the slit like a flower growing (see drawing). The man smiles and says, "Ah, you have seen the infinity holes." I ask again where the ocean is. He points and I get ready to dive. I remember I won't be able to breathe. He smiles again, walks up to me and French kisses me. It is so gentle and caring. I realize he's given me the "kiss of breath." Now I'll be able to breathe underwater. I dive and find myself in a narrow channel full of murky, deep water filled with a swarm of naked swimming people. It's a school of fish. I swim among them comfortably.
