We had a tree that had grape vines on it. The tree had a shape of a big cone and about 20 ft. from the ground the cone part above was about 15 ft. high and this was solid with blue grape. It looked beautiful. Some colored man came close to Ann. He brushed against her purposely. I yelled at him and gave him one punch. He said something to me. I can't recall it now, but I said, "You will get more if you don't watch yourself."
