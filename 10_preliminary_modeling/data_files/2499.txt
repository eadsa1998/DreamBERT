Valerie is very angry at my mother. She's following her around yelling at her for being a bad mom. There is a small baby. She's crying, so I pick her up. I go into a living room and lie on a couch with the baby girl on top of me. The girl cries "Why is she so mean? Why doesn't she love me?" "She loves you, she just doesn't know how to take care of you and show her love." (I think of Ellie and I think of me.) Then I'm coming home from an all-day festival or fair. I'd stayed until the last act was almost through and now hurried home to pack. I knew Lucy and Mary would be upset for me not coming to pack up until the last minute and I walk in saying, "I've got it under control. You won't have to help." I go to each room grabbing up sacks and boxes of my things. In the bedroom, Charla is there too! Lucy comes in from taking care of Clarisa and rolls up my sleeping bag for me. I ask Charla if she could help me carry some things and she says no. I feel angry and powerless but choose to not respond that way. I cheerfully say, "OK," and I pick it all up myself, trying to make a game of it, to entice Charla to help.
