I was at school. We were in the common room, which was different. Someone liked this new kid. Scarlett and some others were talking about him and they said he liked someone else. They she asked who and they said "He likes Izzy Conell" and I asked who. They said the weird new kid, who likes "dead things". He came in later, but I didn't know if it was him or not. Calvin was showing people something and he tried to show Darius but he ignored him.
