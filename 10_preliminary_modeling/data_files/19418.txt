I was back at my old house; it was a duplex. I was moving from one apartment to the other and the neighbors in the other, Sam and Donna, were moving into mine. They were asking me to help them measure the walls to see where their furniture would fit. I was helping them. I got hungry and I said I was going to order some food for me and my children. Donna said she would pay. I said no thank you. I got it and she yelled, "Let me pay. I have so much damn money, and I'm paying!" This made me feel bad. She acted like she was so rich and I was nothing.
