["Mad at Howard's spirit."] I am a spirit with many other spirits all hanging out waiting in some large attic room. I see a chimney space where some spirits are being lifted up to a lighter higher level. Howard's spirit is near me. I become very angry at his spirit. He'd some how tricked me so I won't go up to a higher lighter level yet because I didn't let go of my anger at him. An older man spirit is talking up at his wife's spirit. She'd already migrated to the higher place and the man wants to join her. He gets frustrated. His anger makes her start to move away and up. He begs her to stay. He couldn't bear it if she left him alone. She is gentle and stays, waiting for him.
