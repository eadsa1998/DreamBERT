 Others and I are on a field trip to play basketball. I'm on a bus going to the school for a basketball tournament. My old teammate Simon Naver is near me at the front of the bus. We arrive at the school, which is really new and high-tech. I ask people where the gymnasium is. I go past a cafeteria-like area where I see my high school classmates June Meeker and Tracy Noles. I talk with them even though we didn't talk much in school. My schoolmate Aaron Webbed is there. I'm told the locker room is five blocks down the hall; this school is huge! I pass my grade school classmate Ryan Vaurnet as I go down the hallway. There is a man scrubbing the floor. One person slips on the wet floor. The person is all right; the cleaner stops until we pass. The hallways are smooth, sealed, tan or off white in color: really space age looking. There are large areas on each side of the hall for entertainment or food. There is a place where people shoot footballs like one would a basketball. This school seems to have everything! I make it to the locker room. I see other teams there for the tournament. I know I'm an important player on our team: the other teams recognize who I am.
