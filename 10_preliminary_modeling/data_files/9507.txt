Father Andrew saying liturgy at Newman Club and explaining to Catholic boy the diff. with orthodox of "Confiteor" - all kneeled and he had to kneel too; also "mea culpa" was incorporated, but otherwise Greek liturgy remained. Also remember getting my hands v. dirty and washing them and see Father Andrew smile at me.
