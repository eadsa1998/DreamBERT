 I'm playing the card game Euchre with my sisters Heather, Ramona and another female at home. Heather gets up to go to the bathroom. Ramona bids four and takes the kitty prematurely. I stop her, saying no! I have a good hand, and will overbid her and anyone else, since I have the last bid. I tell Ramona to wait for Heather, because I want to play the hand. I'm going to bid six spades. I'm eating a pear. I walk to turn off a light, which may be in my mom's room. I go to the back porch to close the door, and the light is on. I see a person get out of my mom's car. It's Heather. She is sneaking around somewhere. She seems to have sneaked out from my mom's bedroom window, outside, to do something covert, and then was going to sneak back into my mom's window. My brother Wally is then with Heather. They are dangerous. They may be imposters: are not my real siblings.
