My boyfriend was home on leave from the Navy. He came into the house in his uniform, which he never wears at home, as son as he arrived. He held a box in his hand which contained matched wedding bands. He kept begging me to take them so that we would be married. I tried so hard to refuse because I didn't want to marry him, but yet I didn't want to hurt him by refusing. We stood in my living room arguing about the rings until I started to cry.
