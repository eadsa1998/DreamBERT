I am in a house. Grandma Maude is there. She doesn't quite look like herself. Her face is rounder. Chester was supposed to have taken my vote and registered it. I find out he forgot and didn't do that. So I try and find the floppy disk with the information on it so I can vote again. I see a huge puzzle picture of the United States. He apparently created that when he was supposed to be taking my vote in. He is apologetic.
