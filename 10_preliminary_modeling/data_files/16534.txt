I was back in the Westport High School building, but everybody acted like they were taking college classes. I was in this class where we weren't really doing a whole lot of work. Then I was kind of pretty much just finishing a couple things and handing them to the teacher, and then trying to go through and organize, and I had that black g______ thing that I bought for Modern Media College and I had my book bag and I had three or four big bulky magazines on my desk. They were like women in business magazines and stuff. And [laugh] we had a duck and cover drill where ____ said, "Okay, _________" and instead of everybody having their own desk, I was jammed in with four other people and I could hardly breathe. And I sat up before it was time because I just couldn't stand it any more. And then everybody went back to normal doing their thing, and people were just sort of leaving whenever they wanted to, just like a college class, they finished what they were doing. And actually they were going to take a lunch break and then they were going to come back and do some more. Well, I thought I was going to leave all my stuff there and just go take a break. So I went with these two visually impaired people. One seemed really competent and one seemed really, "duhhhhhh." And they were talking to me as we were walking up and down the halls, and we were thinking about going to the cafeteria, but I decided I wanted to go get my stuff first. And I said I was going to meet them down in the courtyard. And I met the teacher at the door and the teacher said, "Oh no, you can't come back in here; we had a fire drill. They aren't letting people back in yet." And I was like, "My stuff's in there." And then I woke up.
