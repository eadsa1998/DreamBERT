Am in the recreation room of some shore resort hotel. Note a young couple seated with knees touching and supporting some sort of game board. I take a chair nearby and watch. On the board are numerous small objects, such as a pin, pencil, piece of chalk and object of game seems to be to place them like dominoes in some sort of order, either from most expensive to least expensive, or vice-versa I leave and walk outside. I see a hotel nearby which is shaped exactly like a large can placed on its side. It's some three or four stories high. I am afraid it might slip any minute and actually roll on down the beach and into the water. It occurs to me that only those lying in the sand sun bathing would be safe, providing that their position coincides with the large rectangular openings of the can-shaped hotel as it rolled over the sand, crushing people. Later I hear the hotel actually did roll down onto the beach.
