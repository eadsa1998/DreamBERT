I dreamt that I was lying in bed dying and was suffocating by the sheets and blankets. My mother and father were standing there crying, but they couldn't help me. I kept telling myself that I wasn't going to die and not to be afraid. What made me be afraid was the fear of how awful my parents felt. I kept telling my parents I was all right and I was really dead.
