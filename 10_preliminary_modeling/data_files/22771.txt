I dreamed that I had a huge clock at home which signaled the hour by means of bells, like they do in church, and in my dream it seemed very agreeable to me. but now as I remember it, I don't like it. I was dressed in green and (in the dream) was looking at the street from a very high window. It was sunny, but I saw the shadow of my house on the street.
