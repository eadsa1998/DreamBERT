I went to a camp. We got sorted into two groups of five; two of the groups were nerds and weirdoes. I got put into a group of "weird people with nothing to do". Jason Lee was put in there too and he was really quiet. Some ten year old girl, who was the daughter of the camp runner, was put next to Alan Rickman, who was actually Josh Duhamel. He had to give her a kiss and said something about himself that was like "Godfather or secretary". There were cabins. Will Arnett was in one. In the one I was in, Farrah, Jamison and Ariana were in bunk beds. I was locking it up. Will got shot and I was talking to Ezra on MSN. The font kept going stretchy and unreadable.
