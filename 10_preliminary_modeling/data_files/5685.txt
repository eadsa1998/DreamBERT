[1997-07-02] Everywhere that I touched, I was finding clutter. There was a lot of dirty laundry. If I touched the floor I would feel a small pile of dirty laundry. I opened up a drawer of a night stand and pulled out a rolled up dirty dishtowel. The scene changed then and I was at my daughter Robin's house. Where she was living in the dream was not her real house, it seemed that her house was a good sized house and for some reason my son and I had to walk home. We were in a very small entryway, I knew that I was going to be carrying something as we walked home. I don't know what it was but I knew it was going to be cumbersome and so would interfere with easy walking. I considered taking a bus. Anyway, my son, knowing that we were going to have to walk home, or because I had led him to believe so, he walked out the door and it was raining so I brought him back inside because I realized he was in his stocking feet. I bent down to help him find and put on his shoes and I felt that his little socks were wet naturally because he had stepped on wet ground. Then the scene changed again and however we got back here, we were back in our own apartment and there was someone here to visit and she was sitting on my son's bed. She is a very good friend of mine, a lady close to my age, and she greeted us and I knew by her voice who it was and I knew at the same time that I was thinking about my son's grandmother. In the background, in another room, a radio was playing. I also heard the phone ringing. The phone was on a wall, not where it really is in my kitchen. I reached to pick it up and that's where I woke up because my phone was really ringing.
