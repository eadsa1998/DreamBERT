I was leaning over a balcony watching two women converse. One was young and fair with a cute nose. She had a profound expression on her face. She was telling the other woman about an emotional problem she was having. The other woman was older and stockily built. I tried to get closer so I could hear what she was saying so that I could perhaps help her. But she shied away from me.
