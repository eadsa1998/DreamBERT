I was watching Seriously Weird or something but I could touch stuff. I was touching Ryan Cartwright's hair and stuff (nothing nambla). I was thinking how cool this was. Then, we had known each other for ages and we were going out. He went to this school and I wanted to go and an interview was required. I was late and kept getting interrupted. There was a Chicken Treat nearby. The guy saw a photo of me, with Calvin and Silas, except the order was me, Calvin, Silas, and Calvin again. Silas and I were standing close and he asked who he was and I said "Silas, a friend" and he said "I don't believe you". Someone had an ear infection.
