I am at some kind of resort with a few people I know-maybe three girls and at least one other guy, all of them younger than me, maybe students.  We leave the resort and are on a bridge high above a very large river, something like the Largo River Bridge in my hometown.  I wonder how deep the water is at that point.  We assume it was deep, and we all dive off.  When we come up, we start swimming back to the resort.  When we get there, it is time to go home.  After I begin to leave, I realize that I have left a towel or something behind, and I go back.  I have to go up some stairs, and when I come down, I see Doug Sterme.  He introduces to me to his son, "Iran," and to his wife, whose name I can't remember, but she is a small Japanese woman with a round face.  I am surprised that his wife is Japanese.
