 I'm playing poker. My high school friends Lyle Zeffman, Tony Kramer, and others are there. In this hand, threes, nines, and fours are wild. There is a big pot of poker chips, money, and candy. We have many cards. I get a straight flush with the 5,6,7, and 8 of spades with a four in a red suit. I say we should order our cards and flip them over. Everyone selects his five cards. Lyle starts flipping his cards over. He has a good hand but doesn't see it. He flips some kings and aces, and then four wild cards. He must not realize what is wild. He is out then because he thinks he hasn't beaten my straight flush, which I have showing. Tony stalls, so I start eating some of the candy in the pot, as if I've won. People get mad at me for this. I tell Tony he's got to show his cards to win. He starts to flip his cards over. (I forget the outcome.)
