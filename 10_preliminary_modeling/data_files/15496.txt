I was at school. My seat was next to Eugene's. Ms Solomon started writing up codes and numbers for us to copy. She checked them and gave the people who finished this hot, flaming tea. She asked who lived in Midvale and Eugene put his hand up. She gave me a list of people for him to seek out to give information. There were big pieces of paper and lots of stuff was written on it. Darius got up and was being silly with it. Then I was with some people at a basketball court a while away. Some people from another school came and had these little marker things and were creepy. Then we were in a different class and I was still next to Eugene. I had to climb around the back of his chair. He was wearing a Spongebob shirt. Then I was at a shop and there were zombies. A baby was turned and it started talking and went rabid. No-one wanted to kill it.
