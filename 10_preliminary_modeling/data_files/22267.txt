I dreamed I had won a Volkswagen in a raffle and that my car got bigger each time I went out with girls. Then I was in a familiar street in Lima with people that I knew. I could see important people from the international cinema, such as Elke Sommer and B.B. Then I was somewhat embarrassed when I saw a professor from the university who was looking at me without saying anything.
