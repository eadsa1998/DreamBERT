 I'm in a large room. There are a bunch of tables set up, with two or three people working at each table. I'm with my friend Stephen Ramos. At the first table are Jackie Hunter and Susan Flound, who are two women at Brimson that I find very attractive. There is a third woman there. I sit down with Stephen. The third woman asks me a question. I have my mouth full of beef! The two women I like, Jackie and Susan, don't say much. Stephen and I talk about our friend Kevin Simpson and drinking alcohol.
