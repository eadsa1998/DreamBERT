 I go into a house. My high school classmate Carol Stilten is there. She greets me and we talk. I realize she is married. She leads me around the big central room of the house. She leads me to meet a man. The man offers me a job somewhere in the north woods. The job has a 10-year commitment. I turn the offer down.
