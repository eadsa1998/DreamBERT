I dreamed of a girl at the bank whom I like physically. I went to a hotel with her to get a room. Suddenly Topo Gigio appeared, saying to Braulio Castillo, "Now, to bed." Well, I laid with her and it was no longer the girl in the bank, but a relative of mine. Suddenly I felt that the walls were shaking, the bed was shaking, and the lamp was shaking so much that it fell. We went out desperately as we were, naked, and not only her and me, but also everyone who was at the hotel. Suddenly I saw a very strong light which lit the whole place, and we were scared because we didn't know what it was. When I saw this, I awoke. Then I closed my eyes again and didn't dream any more.
