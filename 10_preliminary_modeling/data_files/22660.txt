I was in a classroom at the university and I had to take an oral test. I remember that the committee was made up of a man (about 30 years old) and a woman (a bit fat and with glasses). I was seated in front of them and they toyed with their hands and they asked me several questions, but I answered none. Then I came out and it was nighttime and it was raining, and I found myself in a street that looked like an arcade. I saw that the people disappeared. the street was lighted. The houses were small and unpainted; they were old houses.
