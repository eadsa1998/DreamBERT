I went to Sears looking for a particular type of toy. It was a four-inch clear square box with something inside it. I knew some people might think it was something for Christmas but I knew it wasn't. I also knew it had something in common with another type of toy and if I mentioned that toy to people working at the store they would know what I was talking about. I asked one employee and at first he just said they didn't have it. Then I mentioned the other toy and he nodded his head yes and said I could find it on the ground floor. I walked off thinking that I could just take the escalator to the ground floor but after taking the escalator down two levels it ended there and didn't go down to the ground level. I kept trying to find the way myself. I finally asked an employee and they gave me directions.
