["Miniature Honor guards"]  Rigo and some boy scouts are practicing for a big event. Honor guards march in elaborate movements. Three different sets of them in a row. Some other group of boy scouts were practicing some other maneuver, but they are tiny. Like 2 inches tall. and one of them was a midget and then was miniaturized so he's really extremely small. I am trying to practice the honor guard march too. We are in a very large gym. With a stage. The curtains are closed.
