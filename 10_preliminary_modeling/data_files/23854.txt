[The night before my middle sister called and wanted to come stay with me for a while. Also, although I was in a relationship with Mark, I had been getting to know another guy, Scott, online.]  I was preparing for Barbara M's wedding (my best friend in early childhood).  So much to do, clean.  I wasn't ready.  It was at my parents' country property, in a long meadow.  It felt like Risk was nearby.  My middle sister or someone said, wow, it's about to start, how exciting.  I'm like - no, I'm still not ready, not set up yet.  But we started anyway, time to start.  I was to accompany Barbara down the aisle.  Not like giving her away, but like maid of honor.  I was chewing gum and just before I went to walk down the aisle, I threw it at my middle sister's feet, smiling at her like joking:  I had to put it somewhere, couldn't go down the aisle chewing gum.  Barbara was so nonchalant.  Like this was her second marriage.  The first wedding she tried too hard, fancy stuff, image was important, so this one was more real, and more casual.  She was wearing a hippie-bandanna, an old worn print wrap skirt, totally slobbed out, but really happy, chattery.  She talks to me all the way down the aisle, which feels weird during her wedding.  She tells a long involved story about Popeye and Olive Oil and tenant/landlord problems.  I am aware of people watching us talking, a long walk at the property down this meadow.  I realize this is a really long story she will tell, will it end before we get to the end of the aisle?
