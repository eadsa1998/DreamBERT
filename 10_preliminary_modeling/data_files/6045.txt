The other night I had a dream that I was with an old high school classmate, Randy. We were sitting at this bar and this girl Tina, who we both disliked, came in. And Randy goes, "Gee, you haven't changed. You still have big boobs and you look like a monkey." Well, we both started laughing. And Gina replied, "I don't know why I came here anyhow. You are both still obnoxious and I hate the both of you."
