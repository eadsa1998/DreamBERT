It seemed to be Sunday morning. My father had gone to church and I was about to go. I supposed the house was empty, but as I started downstairs, I saw a young girl -- homely and dressed in black -- cross the hall from one room to another. She resembled no one I can think of. I stood still in perplexity and my eye fell on her hat and veil lying on the table. I thought she must be going to church and that I should wait for her. So I waited. Shortly doors began to open all over the house and more strangers appeared. Three men came clattering down the attic. I thought they might have been sleeping there. They passed me with wonderful speed and left the house. Women and children also flocked by me. No one spoke. I went to church and found only four or five people there. M. E. W. K. -- sat by the middle aisle and I stopped to speak with him. Then I went on and found my father. I asked him if he knew our house was full of guests. He showed much annoyance and said he knew it and that they are "an obnoxious, mercenary lot." Forthwith they streamed into church and I was jammed up against the end of a pew as they crowded by. They did not look at me or speak. I remember especially one middle-aged woman, florid and portly, in a gray dress. The throng seemed endless.
