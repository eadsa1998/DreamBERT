I dreamed about drugs. I was in a forest with a group of boys and girls. Undoubtedly it was an orgy, a big one, in which I was really enjoying everything, in which life presented itself to me in a different manner. I felt a happiness which I had never felt before. The only thing the girls offered was pure and sincere love.
