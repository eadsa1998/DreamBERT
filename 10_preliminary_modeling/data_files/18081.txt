These guys were putting us in hot hot steaming, wavy water going through winding tunnels. But I didn't die, of course so I went through swimming to the other side. When we got to the other side there were monsters everywhere. The biggest one was chasing me. Then I went to the other side of the water again and got to the other side. And then I started to walk and then I got to Katie's house and she said "look at my new pet" and right in her big big backyard was a big big black owl. And then it said mooooo really loud and then I left Katie's house and I started to walk. Then I saw Mark [the supervisor] from the Community Center. He picks me up and we went to the Community Center. When we got there a friend of mine wasn't there, so I was disappointed, but I had a fun time because we went swimming and somebody I don't know made me put on those tubey things. I jumped in, but when I got in the water I did a forward roll under the water because the tubies made me. Then Mark said, "why don't you take them off?" and I did and that was much better. And then a few minutes later Mark said it's time to go in so I got out soaked and then we went inside.
