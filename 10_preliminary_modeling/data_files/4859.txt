["Leaving Charla behind."] I am holding a small white kitten in my lap. I wonder if I am holding it too roughly in order to keep it there and safe. I have some packages on my lap as well. Now I am in a bus and we are leaving. Charla I now see running behind the bus trying to catch up. Her face is contorted as she cries very hard. She is angry at me for leaving her behind. I tell the bus driver to stop to let her in. I was teaching her a lesson about being responsible for herself.
