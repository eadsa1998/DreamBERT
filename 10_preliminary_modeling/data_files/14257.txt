I was outside at a school. There was some new thing to do with the Government and people were celebrating it. There was an assembly thing and I was carrying a big flag, which was folded up (I didn't know it was a flag at this point). When I got in the room, there was a smallish audience and there were people standing up in rows at the front. The door was near the front, and I ran behind the people and handed this girl the flag, which we unrolled while I ran back, and it was the American flag, but it was upside down. I saw Elijah in the audience.
