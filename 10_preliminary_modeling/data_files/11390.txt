A friend of mine introduced me to this girl who had a very sexy appearance. Immediately I managed to get a date with the girl for that evening at 8. The situation was very pleasing. I made arrangements for my transportation, money and everything else. A friend was going to lend me his car, which would be parked around the corner from the Daily Times (our local newspaper office). At about 20 to 8, I started to go to pick the girl up. This gave me plenty of time. However, I stopped at the pool room and ended up talking to the proprietor, whom I know quite well. All the time I knew that I had this date, but I kept on talking with various friends whom I met there. I now wanted to leave as it was 5 till 8. I had the girl's. telephone number and had to call her to find out out how to get to her house, as I had forgotten by that time. I tried to dial her number which I had on a piece of paper, but I kept making blunders. I couldn't seem to dial the number correctly, though I tried numerous times. This became very frustrating. I decided to start out and stop off on the way to call, because I knew in what section she lived. Yet knowing this I started out in the opposite direction. I stooped to call again with no better results. My moves were clumsy and finally it was 9 and too late to get her so I had to give the venture up because here the dream ended. I wanted to take the girl for sensual reasons, but my body actions seemed to be competing against me.
