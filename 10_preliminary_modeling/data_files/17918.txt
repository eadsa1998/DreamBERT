I was in a commercial for an annoying movie, walking through a store in a ghetto sort of run-down part of town.  There was something about a hat, and being picked on by some large black men.  The second time through, I decided I'd had enough.  It was annoying and it was just a commercial anyway.  This time I walked through the store, I spit on the men.
