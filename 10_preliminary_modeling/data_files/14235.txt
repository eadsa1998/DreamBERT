I was watching a bit of Twilight. Edward and Bella were in the forest and I was thinking that the movie was lame [last night, I'd been flicking through it, thinking it was lame]. I had read something which Kristen Stewart who said that Robert Pattinson was a bad kisser. In an interview she was demonstrating the kiss. She made a noise, a pause and then a snotty sound and that's what the kissing was like. I was like 'ok...'.
