I was running in the marathon. The route went through the woods and over the rocks at the creek. 2 guys had finished long before I did. When I finally finished I went to talk to them. They didn't want to talk to me. ??? I thought they would be my friends now! They were sitting on the bench outside. I went to talk to the other finisher but he was swimming laps underwater so he couldn't hear me anyway. Then we were walking on the beach. my father was leading a horse. He loved the horse. Sometimes waves would come up and go over our knees--to the horse's ankles. I was worried this would upset him but my father kept walking slow and steady. There were little lines left in the sand when the waves slid back down. My mother said this was from rats that were underwater dragging their tails. I said, "There aren't any rats in the ocean," And she said, "Yes there are. See those lines." I walked more careful. I looked back to find my father and he was gone. Then I spotted him far away sitting on the very edge of the bleachers on the sand. I could tell it was him by the way he sat all loose. There was a volleyball game that was going on the beach. One team needed another player so I played. Then the game moved inside the gym. I came in and right away it was my turn to serve. I said the score, "1--20." We were close to losing. The ball was too flat. It wasn't even a volleyball but that didn't matter as much as it needing air. The first time I went to serve I missed the ball altogether. Then I hit it over and it touched the net and went over. Like a let in tennis but I didn't know what they called it and their rules were confusing how it was OK in tennis but not OK in volleyball. We stopped playing and the other team, the good team who won, told us we could sit on the floor in the narrow part until the next game. They got to sit in the bleachers.
