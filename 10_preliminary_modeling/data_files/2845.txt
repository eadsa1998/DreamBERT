The baby needs a bath and everybody out, this house hasn't been cleaned for years, the blue stairs. I receive the baby from Ellie and I see she has been neglected. Her ears have crud in them and her hair is dirty and her skin. I feel sorry for her and decide to bathe her. I go to an old, big sink and start the water. I see a bar of ivory soap. I talk soothingly to the baby saying, "I know you don't like this but I need to get you clean." She doesn't resist and I clean her up good. "Where are the Q-tips?" I ask and she tries to struggle. "I guess I shouldn't have said it out loud," I say. She relaxes. I clean her ears. I notice I haven't rinsed the soap off her hair and face well enough and rinse her under the faucet. Now I wrap her gently in a blanket, and we go out to the main part of the house. It's a mess. There are lots and lots of rooms with building blocks (child's toys all over the floor and lots of clutter). I get angry and call out, "Everybody come here in a circle in the living room. We have to talk." I think there sure are more people living here than I thought. Three old homeless types lay on the couch and refuse to help or participate. I say, "Look, either move into the circle or I call the police and you're out of here." They grudgingly start to move. I walk down some weird rickety blue stairs that overlap themselves and end before they reach the floor and then I see more to the floor. I step into the center of the forming circle.
