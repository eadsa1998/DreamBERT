I heard about a job opportunity through the university, I think through the observatory.  We went through some of the paperwork and there was some sort of physical I had to go through, which entailed me getting naked.  Something happened and I wouldn't be able to finish.  I went to a small closet.  Then a week later I was getting another job through the university, which was more of a sure thing.  The same thing happened though, that I was instructed to get naked, and I was uncomfortable and kept procrastinating, leaving my underwear and white tee shirt on.  I was excited about the job and would have to call the flower shop to let them know I wouldn't be coming in anymore, and wondered if my first day would be tomorrow.  But the same thing happened again, and for some reason I wouldn't be able to finish the physical or paperwork necessary.  I asked when we could continue, and they said not until next week.  I was disappointed, and a bit worried that the offer would then fall through, like it had the last time.  I went and got a brown folder of some sort, that I had left there from the previous time.  It had originally been embossed with gold lettering but the gold had been worn away and now only the indentation was visible for trying to read it.  Two of the men involved in the paperwork process walked away on a sort of overpass.
