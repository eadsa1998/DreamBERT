Oh! my goodness. Since I have been living in this country for this long I have never gone back to my country. I feel very exciting because my parents are going back to my country and they also buy me an airfare ticket already. I feel very surprise because I have never think they will spend that much money to go on this trip, and I am the only one can go out of all my sisters and brothers. I cannot believe it that I can go, then I start to think of the beautiful views of the places. My parents tell me that we will be leaving in the summer. I am too overexciting then that led me to wake up with a depression.
