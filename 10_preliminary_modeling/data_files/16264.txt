Ms. S_____ and I were going to a pool party, and that they were swimming around and swimming around in the pool. I was kind of trying not to touch the bottom with my feet, thinking there was a pool cleaner roaming around, which a lot of time is what I do anyway. I try to grab the side because I don't want to reach down and find anything buried down there. So then we got out and we were walking around the side and there was this kids' slide that had stairs leading up to it, and then the person would like slide through the puddle and then out and down the slide. And there was this pail of plastic potato chips that really smelled real with a shovel and a couple other play things that kids could play with. And then I went inside this like club-like type place and the lady said that she does birthday parties and things, and I gave her my card and said, "Call me if you ever need a DJ." And then I dreamt that I was home and Mom was telling me this big secret, that there was something that she had that was really secret and not to ever use it until her and Dad went out of town. But I don't remember what it was, but it was something small and electronic like a camera or a cell phone, or maybe she was referring to the mini disc recorder, I don't know. But then her and I were dancing around in the living room because we were so happy about something; I don't remember what. And let's see, and then when Mom and Dad came back from being out of town, Mom confided in me that the car had automatic horns, whatever that is! [laugh] And that would mean that whenever somebody's singing in the car and they hold a long chromate at the end, the horn will start honking after you're through! [laugh] That was crazy, man!
