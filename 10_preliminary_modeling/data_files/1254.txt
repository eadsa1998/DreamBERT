I go to a concert to see Frank Sinatra. I am surprised to see that he's a very small man. He's 2-3 feet tall and sometimes l/2 foot tall. Some large woman steps on him and says, "I brought you into the world and I can take you out." I'm seated in a front row seat with park and recreation types all around me. He comes over and sits near me. I see he has 3 eyes, pretty brown eyes, then 4 eyes, 0000. He sings a beautiful ballad. I feel attracted. He's giving me eye contact. I drop eye contact and think to myself, "Now you've done it. He won't think you like him and he'll go away." Then the "governor" comes in. He's gorgeous, tall, sexy, and good-looking. Everyone around me rushes to be close to him. I don't. I'm alone on my bench. I look up at the ceiling and tisk tisk. "Frank" watches me. The governor makes a joke. He says that the next time Frank complains about paying taxes, he should remember that the governor contributed to his income by paying to get in. Then the governor gets on his knees and hits piano keys with his chin. Everyone laughs. I am aware that I'm sitting because I'm disabled.
