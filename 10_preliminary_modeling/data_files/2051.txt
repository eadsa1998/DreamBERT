Saturday. I go downstairs to a room that is in the basement and sort of secret. I'm hiding. I lay on a table on my tummy. It's like a massage table. I'm facing the door with a window. I see people coming in search of me and hope they don't see me, but they do. They ask me why don't I choose one of the "roomettes" nearer the bathroom. I look around and see like partitioned spaces and choose one fairly close to the bathroom. Now I've been captured by a girls' school and am inside. I look around for a way to escape. I look out the window and see lots of bumpy rocks in a steep incline. We're on the 2nd or 3rd floor. I say, "It would be hard, but we could get out this way." My friend says, "No. They'd see us. It won't work." I give up. They come to take me to another room. As I leave my friend, she says, "I'm pregnant." I grin and say, "Good for you. With who?" She says, "With Timothy. I'm one month along." Just previous to this, I flew out of the room like I'm in a helicopter and hovered over a secret place in the rocks where naked men and women are together. So I see a big auditorium and the woman says, "Your group is called_______." I say "Do you mean that the Birds are now captured and will work for you now entertaining and that's our new name?" She says, "Yes."
