I was at a water thing. I went in the water with my head popping out of the jetty. I was then at a park near it. I was friends with Froggy, which was a green crocodile. Some guy came up to me and tried to steal my phone. I was trying to punch him but it was slow, so I kicked him to the ground. His mate said something about his mother, he cried and then left.
