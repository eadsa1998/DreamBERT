I dreamt that this girl that I knew in New York two years ago, when I worked at the Texas Pavilion at the World's Fair, I was with her in an unidentified place and there was, I remember there was a crowd around and she was playing around with my comb. And she had my comb and she was twisting it and turning it and I told her to stop it, to stop twisting and turning my comb. And she eventually bent it all out of shape, and I went to the mirror and tried to comb my hair, but my hair wouldn't comb right. And I told her to the effect that if there wasn't all these people around, I'd smash her in the face. And then there was a transition there, I don't know how, but this friend of mine that I know, this guy John, got some of the blame some way. All I remember is the next thing I was talking to him. He's a friend of mine in drama class. I was talking to him and blaming him for it, and he denied any knowledge of it ... of it, meaning this girl, why she would want to bend my comb all out of shape.
