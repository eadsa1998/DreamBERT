A "Donald Trump" guy takes a special super fighter jet to fly an Arab princess where she needs to go. I'm surprised the government let him get away with that! We land. There is a lake. I think I escape and run for the lake. I slide down a talus slope and just as I get to the water, Donald's body floats out of a cave. He's on his back. His eyes flutter open. I thought he was dead. I was safe, but no. He lives. The first thing I saw was his huge, strong hand. So I run for the place and get in. He runs after me, yelling, "Wait. There's something you need to know before you fly." I figure it's a trick, and get in and fly away. It's hard because the jet is so complex.
