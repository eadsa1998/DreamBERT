Some time later Andy and I seem to continue our journey in the auto and eventually reach Alexandria , Va. Wishing to stop overnight we ask about hotel accommodations. Our informant, a lady who seems to be one of the hotel staff, tells us there is only one hotel in town, an ancient hostelry built in (here she mentions the year, possibly in the 1700's ). Without saying so in so many words she lets us know that the hotel is a 2nd class one. It now seems that a man, evidently the manager of head waiter of the hotel, has been standing near by. He hands menu and order back to Andy (here it crosses my mind that I rarely take the responsibility of making out an order except for myself alone). Andy begins to write down our meal order, and has 3 items listed, the first of which is "wax" (which is beeswax and that in turn is honey) 55 cents. This is an order for our breakfast and not for the evening meal as I first thought. Next we are in some building and are getting ready for bed. I wander about from room to room, and presently find myself in a bedroom which at first seems unoccupied; but soon I notice a stirring in the bed and realize that under the large quilt Mary and Charles (her husband) are sleeping, and the stirring indicates that I have disturbed them. My hand is covered with phlegm (I seem to be suffering from a very severe cold). Presently I find a lot of paper napkins, each one partially opened out, and each lying by itself, on a square, cardboard tray which is resting on a box about 1 1/2 feet high. I use several of the napkins to clean my hand.
