I am Eartha Kitt. Another woman and a man and "I" are in a room. The woman and I had done a dance. Now she and I are changing clothes. As the other woman takes off her bra, she is being sexy and attracting the man. I stand up completely naked and say guess I'll leave now. They begin to make love and I walk into another room (a dressing room). I lie down on a couch to rest. Then suddenly a man is there wanting me sexually. I try to escape, to put my clothes on. He grabs me with intent to rape me. He is madly in love with me and says lots of sexy things. I fight him but he's got me. I see a woman standing at an open wall by a pillar. I get close to her and say don't move or say anything. I need help. But the man sees I talked to her. He grabs me and I turn to him and bite his face as hard as I can. He yells in pain. A security guard comes in. I tell him to arrest this man. He actually does. Now the man is jailed for 14 years. After a few years, they let him out giving me lots of papers and letters he wrote about his obsession with me.
