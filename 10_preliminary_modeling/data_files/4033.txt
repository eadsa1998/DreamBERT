["Worthless package and a round ocean wave"]  I am lying on a beach by the ocean at night. Ginny is off swimming or walking. It begins to rain and storm. I look  at the ocean and am concerned that the waves are so big. They are oddly curled so that it seems the ocean is coming at me from two angles, perpendicular to each other. Like the wave is coming at me and curves around to be surrounding me. I get up, trying to move my sleeping bag and things into the house. Ginny walks up and helps me. Now I am in a house and sitting on a couch. Ernie comes over and sits beside me. He sits unusually close and I am very aware of that. It feels comfortable and yet there is tension. Now I am packing and I pick up a small pretty box with a price tag of $20.99 on it. I open it to see what is worth $20.99. I see lots of tissue paper and a small address book. I leaf through it and see where you can write birthday dates and so on. I rummage around and don't find much else. I decide this isn't worth much at all. But by now it is a big suitcase. I find a large wad of pantyhose, musty smelling in one of the compartments.
