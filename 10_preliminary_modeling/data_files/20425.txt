Some boys put some objects about 2 by 6 inches on a railing about two stories above a lawn. I was afraid they would fall, and I was afraid I would fall. Later there were furry animals. I saw one nude body of a man below me. His organ was pressed against me. I was excited and I pulled down my shorts. But when I felt below me with my hands, I did not feel anyone there, even though I still felt his body against my backside. As I was pondering the mystery, I heard my sister stir in the next room, and I hurriedly covered myself. She said, "It's drizzling outside." (I awoke then, and saw that my sister had actually said that, though I seemed to hear it in the dream. And it was drizzling outside.)
