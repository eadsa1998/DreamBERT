I am in charge of setting the family feast table. I run from one end to the other overseeing. People bring in dish after dish of good foods. I try to organize them in some way, the main dishes here, the salads together there, a bowl of lemon slices at each end of the table. Across the table and facing me is a man watching. He is pleased with me.
