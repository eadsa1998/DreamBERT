I was with two guys and they could turn into dogs. This guy was following us. I held onto them as they ran (as dogs). We were on a dark oval. We hid behind a tree. He caught us. Then we were in a house. The two guys had been hung up by their hands and the people were getting ready to tie me up. I can't remember what happened but later I asked for a drink. They gave me some cold water but it was gross and I spat it out saying it tastes like pee and he said it was pee. There was a pool behind the house, but it was down a hill. There were lots of people. We managed to escape but he found us. Ezra wanted to watch The Little Mermaid.
