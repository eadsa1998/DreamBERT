The only dream image that I can think of from the entire evening was the view of the parking lot in the back of the drug store, in the back front side of the drug store. There might have been some Spanish kids sitting around, but I couldn't say. It might be from something else. It seems they were a hood type of kids, hanging on the cars, leaning so to speak, but I can't remember it clearly enough to testify to that.
