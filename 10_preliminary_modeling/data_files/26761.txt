 I talk to a woman that seems to be a medical professional. She asks specific questions about my urination. I tell her that my urine stream is fragmented: the stream sprays out in different directions. She tells me or indicates that this is not good. I may have a defect in my penis. I'm embarrassed because she says this to me in front of another woman.
