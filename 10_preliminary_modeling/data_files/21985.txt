We were getting photographed -- Ann, I, Peter, John A., my mother and some friends of ours. We were elected to political jobs. I stopped at St. Andrew's parish and I wanted to go to the washroom, but there were so many things that were washed. I couldn't find a toilet. Then I went around the other or backside. There were women and men there. The toilets were exposed. The women could see you when you sat on the toilet. I was embarrassed.
