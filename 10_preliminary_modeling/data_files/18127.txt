I dreamed that my husband and I were in my husband's hometown, where his mother still lives, and that his mother and I had gone to the laundromat. On our way back, she turned the car around and started driving the wrong way up this one-way street. There were quite a few cars on this street and one car, when they saw us driving up the wrong way, pulled over to the side, only perpendicular to the street, and two other cars crashed into this car and, of course, it was our fault that this happened. But my husband's mother didn't seem to be very upset by it, but I was really indignant. I thought, "When we get home, I'm going to tell my husband what his mother had done." When we got home, he had been out shopping and he brought some strange clothes of very weird and very childish type of windbreaker, and suit and everything. He was acting very childish. I kept thinking about telling my husband about the car accident, but I never got around to it. While we were still there, I started helping somebody work on a jigsaw puzzle. It was a rather strange jigsaw puzzle. The two of us, whoever this other person was and I, were sort of having a race to see who could put the most pieces in right. Then the scene was that on the puzzle became real and it seems that we were up in the Arctic and there was a band of some sort of uncivilized people. There were Eskimos living there, and I was trying to persuade the wisest people of the tribe that I should be allowed to teach them some of the basic things, reading and writing, etc., because it seemed that they knew these things but their knowledge had been allowed to deteriorate over the years. They were listening to my arguments and they were going to let me do this. The emotion in this dream is generally neutral except I felt indignant toward my husband's mother and sort of felt it served her right because she was going the wrong way on a one-way street.
