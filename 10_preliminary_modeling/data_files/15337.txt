Mom was watching Law And Order. Alain Delon was in it and I said excitedly "Alain Delon!" And she was like "what". We went for a drive to see an accident but there was a lot of traffic. A guy, who turned out to be a cop, came up to the car and recognised Mom. He said "what accident" and that it was over a hill. He gave us paper with houses where we could see it.
