I was going to Minnesota to give a dream lecture. The company I was working for was sending four other people with me. Two men and two women. They were going along to share driving duties. There was some discussion about how long the drive was and if it was worth it to make the drive to do the dream lecture. It was decided, though I don't think everyone agreed, that it was a 24-hour drive and so we would go. I don't remember actually giving the lecture. At the end of the lecture, all five of us sat around a table, yet all facing the audience, to answer audience questions. I ended up behind some of the others. One of the men in our group, Terry [unknown in waking life], I had a real problem with his behavior, his dress and the way he talks. He ended up in front. My dreamwork manager rushed out to the stage and had Terry and I trade places. My dreamwork manager was Tom Selleck. At one point during the Q &amp; A session, Terry was standing behind the rest of us rather than sitting at the table. I turned around to look at him and realized his pants were unzipped and his penis was half sticking out. One of the girls in the group saw it at the same time, jumped up, went over to him, and zipped his pants up. We needed to call someone, a woman. I said I didn't know her phone number. One of the girls in the group got smart with me and said, What? Are you incapable of remembering a phone number? I was hurt and mad. I said I have too many things to remember. That is why I didn't know her phone number. Tom came out and took care of things.
