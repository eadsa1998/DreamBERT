I had a dream about watching a show where a dog went blind. It was too sad and I couldn't watch it. Then the dream switched and my cat is blind. Then we had gone to the vet where he sewed something together in the cat's head. The cat could then see. The cat became blind again. Apparently the thing the vet had fixed broke. The cat then had trouble getting around. My mom said he would have to be put to sleep. I refused to let this happen, because the cat was perfectly healthy except he was blind. I believed he would adapt and be able to find his way around without a problem. I remember hugging the cat, realizing they might put him to sleep. I then told my father the cat couldn't be put to sleep, but all he said was he would ask the vet what we should do. I was looking at the cat's eyes. They were bloodshot. My mom said maybe it was just a fluid buildup and it would go away soon. I remembered hoping it was, so he wouldn't have to be put to sleep.
