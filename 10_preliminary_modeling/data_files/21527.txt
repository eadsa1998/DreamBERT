I was looking at shoe prints on the stairway. We could see a man come up and went down the stairway. I walked into a big room and at the other end of it there was a man finishing up his dressing. I said, "Do you live here or did you just come in here?" He said the same to me. I walked up to two other fellows and asked how they were doing, and one of them said he's doing good. He's got $9,500 coming on this race. I saw the results. It was like 9. 40. I looked good and then it seemed like 9. 04. I then could see it, 40. 40 was the results. I said, "This sun shining on it makes it hard to see," and he was surprised when I said it was 40. 40. I saw Red Chip Bond winner.
