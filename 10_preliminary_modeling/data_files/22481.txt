I was in the living room at my home and I was writing the word "homosexual" on a piece of paper. I wrote it over and over, but I didn't know what that word meant, though I thought a lot about it. Then an uncle of mine arrived and I asked him to explain to me what that word meant. He read the word and he also didn't seem to know it, and he told me that it wasn't in the dictionary. But I knew that the word existed and I insisted, and he talked about other things and didn't get to tell me what I wanted, this being what I most wanted to know.
