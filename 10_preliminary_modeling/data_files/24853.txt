There was this buffalo in my house and his name was Moose, and he went downstairs to my basement but he peed on my stairs as he went down them. I was really mad so I went down the stairs to catch him, but I was too scared, so I sent my friend down to wake him up. When he came back upstairs he was this tall preppy blonde guy. Setting: My house (den and basement). Characters: Moose: the buffalo. Moose: the man. Julia: the friend that went and got him. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, mad. I was scared of Moose, but I was also mad at him for peeing all over the place.
