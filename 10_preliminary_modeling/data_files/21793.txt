I was driving thru the downtown. There were people sitting on the street. I couldn't stop because I was sliding, so I had to go between them. I was downtown. I looked at the spot where the square is and they had some old buildings torn down and were going to build new ones. Then I walked thru a street where there was no traffic. The street had debris on it and it was not used for traffic. I could see the use of traffic was going on the outside of the city. I walked and came to an embankment. I had to go over a couple of fences and over some rocks till I got on a level street again.
