A spaceship landed outside Mom's. Ezra and I went in it. We accidentally started it up and we thought we'd just go along for the ride. Everything was automatic and it set the pressure and stuff for humans. We ended up at this little planet with people who looked like us. They spoke English but although they could make a spiffy ship, they couldn't read or write. They hadn't even heard of reading or writing and they were somewhat primitive -- they had no TV's or any of that kind of stuff. I told them that I would teach them how to write and stuff, for historical purposes. They wanted me to bring stuff from Earth for them to look at. There was this guy there who I liked. We had made a big list of stuff that they wanted. I was in this room and there were lots of people in there and this girl was going to have sex. I was like "Don't you guys want to leave the room?" and she was like "Why?". It skipped forward and the guy I liked came to Earth. He was driving a car and Darren tried to stop him. He, Darren and Mom got into a fight. Then he told them who he was and said he wanted permission to date me. Mom said no, but later I told her we'd been going out for a year.
