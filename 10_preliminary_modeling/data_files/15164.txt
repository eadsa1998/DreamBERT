I was doing my week of work experience, though it was doing cheerleading. I went down there on Saturday wearing my school jumper over my Woodstock shirt and pants. I got to the court and there were guys in jock outfits and cheerleaders in bright orange shirts. I asked if wearing pants was ok and she said shorts were preferable. I was thinking I'd text Mom and asked her to drop off some shorts, but it was only for an hour, so it seemed like a pointless trip. Someone called out that it was 9.30am and got back to the train station at 1.30pm. Ezra and Mom were there.
