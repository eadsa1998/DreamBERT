I'm in a play. I'm playing a male part. I have fake whiskers glued on. I am playing "The King of Israel." I walk to the stage area and stand on an empty stage. I know the throne is there, but I just can't see it. I'm waiting for the audience to be seated. A chorus is singing on bleachers between me and the audience. Open bleachers are near me at the front of the stage. Some people sit there in case I fall. I pace and then decide to start. I announce, "I am the King of Israel" and I place myself on the throne. Someone playing God's angel comes in and says, "God didn't say you could do that," and I said, "But I know He will" The play goes on. I worry if my false whiskers are going to fall off.
