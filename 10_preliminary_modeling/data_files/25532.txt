 I'm having a gathering at my house. People come uninvited. A high school classmate, Pat Mareck, comes. The big-haired, thick-glassed, non-neck moving gamer guy from Brimson comes to the door. He asks if Darla Robertson, a high school classmate of mine, is there. I say no. He comes in. He is Darla's fiance. He drove some kind of vehicle with golf carts in it or on a trailer. I look out the window and see a cart with its motor running and no one driving it. It is moving and crashing into the cars that are lined up on both sides of the street. My friend Esther Thurman and my roommate Stephen Ramos are there. Stephen drove a Tracker, while Esther drove her parent's truck. I take the running golf cart and toss it in the back of the man's vehicle. I go and tell people to move their cars, which are in a line, all smashed into one another.
