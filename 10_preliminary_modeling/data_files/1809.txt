A man (feminine-looking) sits on the floor. I am attracted to him a little. I sit down next to him. We kiss. Each time I kiss him on the mouth, he pulls away. I say "What am I doing wrong?" He says, "Nothing. It's just that I'll have an orgasm." He looks around for a place we can make love. He points to a closet door and then to a trap door in the ceiling. I shake my head no and point to my bedroom door. We get up and walk into the bedroom. There is a kitchen in there. I open a cupboard and see piles of old cereal boxes. I realize Ellie has left her mess there. I realize I don't eat the cold cereal anymore. I now go upstairs and have hot cereal. I open a package and lemon lifesavers come out and a Hershey bar. A boy stares at the food and I push him away. Then I think, "Oh. I don't eat chocolate. I should have given the bars to him." The woman says she is the Admiral's wife and watches the man to see his reaction. He is startled because he thought she was the Captain's wife.
