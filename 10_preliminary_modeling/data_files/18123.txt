We walked down to the bottom of this little gravel road which we had been on this time, and came to a sort of highway, somewhat like the Parkway. There was just my husband and me. He said, "Let's cross the road and go over there and climb up that trail for a little ways." So we did and started up this little trail, which at first was paved with cement. As we went up further, it was a very steep angle. It turned into some funny little hemispherical flat pieces of metal which were sort of ridged, tacked together in an angle going up. This was sort of a narrow thing on the outside of these little ridges. It was just a drop. There was nothing under them and then there was sort of a roof a couple of feet over them. So we were climbing up and I didn't like it very much. It wasn't very easy and I was sort of scared. My husband was having a great time. I wanted to go back. About this time some other people started climbing up right behind me so I couldn't. When we got up to the top, there was no place to go. There was just a blank wall, a shield wall. There was a ladder about three feet away from where we were and it went just straight up. My husband was happy there. He didn't even want to go back down. Finally I persuaded him and the people behind me to turn around and start back down, and then we did.
