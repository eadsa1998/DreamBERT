I was in St. Joe and taking one or more classes at ECHS. I knew quite a few other people who were doing the same. We would walk to class together. I know Paulette W was one of the people I walked with. On more than one occasion I found money as I was walking to class. At least twice I found one and two hundred-dollar bills. The first time I just kept them, even though I realized I should report them as found and let the owner claim them. I rationalized that I do not report loose change when I find it. The evening after I found the hundred dollar bills the second time I had a date with Dan H. I told him about finding the money. He said, well, of course, you are going to report it as found aren't you? I said that of course I was. Even though I was thinking that I really need the money and don't want to report it. I was late for at least some of my classes and thought it didn't really matter since it wasn't high school classes that I was attending. I recall seeing Sister Dora come out of a classroom close the door behind her, leaning her back against the door as she pushed it closed. One day I was dressed for class in a pair of shorts and a T-shirt type of top. I had on high socks with some kind of boot footwear. I thought it was a popular look but I wasn't quite comfortable with it. I liked it and I didn't. I thought it was stylish but wasn't 100% sure. I decided to change before leaving the house.
