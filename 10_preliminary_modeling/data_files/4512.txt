["Finding the river."] I am in a wheelchair. I am trying to cross a street because I want to see the river. I am going to write a book and the river tells the story. I look to my left across the street and see a restaurant on a hill overlooking the river. The perfect place to write the river story. Two or three other people join me. Another person in a manual wheelchair. We go up the hill to the restaurant. The others go in first. I see a right turn into the restaurant from the hall. It is a tight fit because a blue piano is by the door. I tell the woman at the door I can fit. Just barely. We wheel in and go to a table right in front of the window. I stand up to see better. I see a small river with beautiful trees on the banks. I am very pleased with this river. It is exactly the right kind. It is smaller and shallower than the main river I first saw. I sit to begin writing.
