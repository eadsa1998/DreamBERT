 I'm riding a mountain bicycle down 3rd Street in Wilmerton going west past the intersection of 3rd and Bar Avenue. The road is all torn up. There are other people riding bicycles. I am riding in a rough rocky area, with boulders everywhere. We are riding over rocks. I go slowly and steadily. Some people falter. I pass them very slowly and steadily. It is difficult riding terrain. My brother's friend Jeff Bautsch may be there when others and I stop at a rest point or at our destination. My high school classmate Todd Warden may be there.
