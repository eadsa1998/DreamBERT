I was home. The phone rang. I answered it and a man's voice said, "I have your daughter Barbara here and if you don't send your wife here, I will have to dispose of your daughter and you will never see her again." That was a threatening call. I answered, "My wife will not go because I will not let her. I love her too much and I also love my daughter as much, but if you harm her, you will never get away with this because in the end God will get and punish you." Then I hung up and was a tortured soul. In a couple of hours Barbara came home. The man let her go after he found out how I reacted to his call. I told Barbara, "Now I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to answer truthfully." I said, "Barbara, this man picked you up by asking you if you were going his way and you took the ride. That's how he abducted you." And she said, "Yes, you are right." "Now Barbara, haven't I told you never let a strange man pick you up?" She said when he abducted her that your mother didn't come back as she promised and this was one way I would get her here, but it failed because of your dad. I didn't get an explanation on why your mother didn't come back idea.
