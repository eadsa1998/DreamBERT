I was on a bed with Calvin, Jeremiah, Selena, Ezra and others. We were at school or something. I think we were watching TV. Jeremiah was listening to someone's iPod. I said "I got The Beatles". I tried to take a photo of something. Elijah was there too. We were walking and saw Theodore. At another time, Elijah locked himself in a toilet.
