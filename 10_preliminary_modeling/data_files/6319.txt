We were off Admiral Street sitting on a house that has been known to have drugs deals there. There were at least two patrol cars that I could see. I was alone in one. I went into the house and arrested various people, but the one I caught happened to be my sister. I did not know what to do. Do I arrest her or let her go? She had just had a baby in February. I arrested her because it was my obligation and it was the best thing for her. I then became scared that the court would take away her baby, but I would file for custody.
