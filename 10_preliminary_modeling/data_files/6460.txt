I dreamt that I was standing outside a cafe when Jeff tapped me on the shoulder. "Oh, hello!" I said. "How've you been?" He responds in a typical fashion, sort of nervously, looking around at everything but me, squinting into the distance, looking obliquely at me to check my reactions, alluding to private events as though they were common knowledge. Sharp guy, but annoying to talk to. "Oh, I just moved in here, you know. Mary and I, we got back together." <br/
