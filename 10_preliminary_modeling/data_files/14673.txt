It was today, and I was waiting at a bus stop for a bus to Centerville. Autumn was there and Tiana too. I was talking to Autumn and she mentioned Whitehall and I was thinking that maybe I should've stayed there. The bus came and stopped in the middle of the road. I ran across and tagged on, but the gate closed as I stepped on. I was wearing shorts because it was hot but I remembered I hadn't shaved and decided not to go, so I got off. I tried to use a teleport on my phone but I had to stay really still but this car was coming at me. I called Mom and I started to walk down the path. She said she was coming that way and then these two doctors and a stretcher ran into this building. The lady asked me if I could help her and I said "with what?" and she was like "age, gender, problem" and I said ok. She had a pregnant lady and I had to hold one of those air things. I had to help rearrange the room. I saw Mom outside and I waved and she came in. The lady doctor was now Ms Hayward and had a black eye. I asked how she got it and she said it was from her husband. She still needed me to help and was asking me questions about how I felt about the job I had done and I said the usual doubts 'that I didn't listen to the instructions properly, made a mistake' etc.
