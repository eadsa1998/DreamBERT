["Mexicans and stealing."] I put some of my things in a car and leave it for some Mexicans to steal. Then I and my companion decide to steal some of their stuff. We sneak into an area to take things. Then I feel overcome with guilt and fear they will arrive early and catch us. I demand we go hide until they are out of here. We go up a level and hide under a pile of clothes. Another family comes in and takes their own things and finally depart. My companion wants to get up and go on. I shush her, afraid we will be found. We finally decide the Mexicans must be done and gone. I get up and my companion wants us to go visit her friends upstairs in the office of the manager. I peek over the edge of the balcony and fearfully look to see if the Mexicans are around. We don't see them. Now the beach area is full of tables and we furtively walk past where they were supposed to have been. I see one of them drinking from a glass seated at the table. I am so afraid of being caught. I hurry past and go up a flight of stairs to the office manager apt. I go to the top of the carpeted stairs but a recording starts. A woman's voice says they are not at home because her husband had died suddenly and she hadn't anyone to help her manage the office so she took the day off. I hurriedly rush down the stairs to get out as we aren't supposed to be there. I am afraid I will be caught. The stairs become raked theater seats and a gap is there. I must jump from one row to another, over the gap. I hesitate. It looks too far to jump. I then step carefully down one row where a lone seat is and then jump. I am successful. I leave quickly still afraid and furtive.
