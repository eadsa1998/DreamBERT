I was at my gym with my friend Zena, and my coach, Kerri Strug, Jaycee Phelps, and Shannon Miller were there. Also, this strange gymnast I didn't know. I was tumbling on the floor along with everyone else, when this woman came in and started talking about her divorce. Everyone sat down and listened for some strange reason, and I remember her mentioning her two daughters (one was there), Arizona, and a hot air balloon. Then she left and everybody went back to what they were doing. Then she came back with a HUGE cardboard box that contained her divorced husband, her other daughter, and her poodle. She talked about all of them, and said we could pet her dog. Zena said, "Uh, does your dog - ?" "Oh, yes," said the woman, "You'd better not pet it." I somehow knew that she meant to ask if her dog gave off a scent because she was getting a dog. I then woke up. Setting: The gym, where I take gymnastics. Characters: Zena, a friend I have known all my life, a bit too cautious. Kerri, Jaycee and Shannon - Olympic gymnasts. I've never met them. Strange gymnast - never met before, didn't say or do anything. Woman - just WEIRD. Never met her before. Dog, daughters and husband, didn't say anything. Never met before. Feelings and Thoughts: Disappointed and excited. I think it's mostly weird but cool that I was with Olympians.
