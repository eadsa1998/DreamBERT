I was on a scavenger hunt with Stephanie (a friend from college who now does PR work in the city where I now work). It was us hanging out, though we were in competition with each other. She got into a big semi truck. After the first couple items on the list, I realized it would take days to finish all the stuff. I didn't want to spend so long doing this. She drove away slowly toward another list item with the truck. I tried to catch up to her on a little beat up bmx bike I found. She rounded a corner into traffic just as I had caught up. Oh well. I was on a hill near a beach area. I helped a woman with something. She had a kid with her, but she was still attractive, although a few years older than me. She thanked me profusely. And said, You know, son stay here, I need to show this man something. She was going to take me to a back room and give me a blow job, I was certain. I told her no, no really, it's ok. People can do nice things and you should just accept it. Really? Ok , thank you. She looked longingly, though. I saw this and said to her, and yes, you're checking to see if what you said excited me, and it did. She smiled as I turned away and left.
