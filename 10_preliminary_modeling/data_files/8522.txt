I was working with Jennifer C. I don't know if I was talking to her or if I was observing her working and trying to figure out how best to address the performance issues I was having with her. I was wondering why she didn't seem to take her work more seriously, why she didn't feel any sense of importance or need to complete things that I would tell her needed to be completed by a certain time, why she hadn't been paying attention to the details, or why she doesn't seem to keep better notes. I was also trying to figure out what to do about it.
