 I'm skiing home from Country Store with my friend Stephen Ramos and maybe one other person. We are on the east side of Wilmerton, and I ask people around if there used to be and outdoor movie theatre around here. They point in out on the left. The fat kid who said "don't be a dick", that I know from a college game of Assassin, and a girl, are there. We talk about the theatre. <br/
