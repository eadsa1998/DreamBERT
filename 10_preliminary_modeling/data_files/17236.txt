I took the bus and went across part of campus and into a furniture store in which I saw my long time classmate Brett working.  We talked some.  Then we were at a sort of carnival, but had some trouble getting in.  They questioned our tickets.  I had need of a small spring for a mechanical pencil.  I went back to the store, but there were none on display.  I went in and opened some boxes in stock.  I found some, but considered it.  That would be stealing.  They didn't look like they'd fit, anyway.  Then people came by and I pathetically tried to hide behind some boxes.  My dorm friend Peter came in and found me, and I was embarrassed.  He left, and I went to leave, too.  The security man stopped me on the way out.  He tried to take the packet of stuff I was holding, but I didn't want to let him.  He was speaking a different language.  I explained to him in French that it was mine, and he let me go.
