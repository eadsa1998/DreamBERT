Banquet at church: we sit at Father Andrew's table with Frank. Frank and they talk. Show Father Andrew at yellow cloth with crucifix on it (reverse of colors on Communion cloth) - Frank walks away - Zena in a boat in the rapids until she sinks under but I realize it is a dream! I play with children in a large, beautiful room under a Christmas tree!
