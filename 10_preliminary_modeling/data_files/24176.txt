The dream took place in an unfamiliar setting. I was taking a shower and a friend walked in to hand me a towel. There were several showers, like a dorm. In the one next to mine, was the guy I was seeing. The funny part was that my friend did not know we were seeing each other, therefore I felt nervous. The three of us work together in the same place, but our friend is not aware of the relationship this guy and I have. Our friend is 21-female and the guy is 27. Basically, all I could recall is that actual feeling of fear. The details are not that clear. I could only remember the overall picture of it, the two of us taking showers separately, right next to each other, with the interruption of a friend.
