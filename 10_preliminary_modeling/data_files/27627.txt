I dreamed that I was in a country store in a town I had never seen before. I saw a girl in the front of the store crying. I went up to her and asked her what I could do to help. She saw a small suitcase I was holding and said she would like it. I gave her the suitcase and a small amount of money. She thanked me and walked out of the store. The next day I read in the newspaper that I would be called to the police station for questioning. The girl whom I had helped had been mutilated by a hatchet and my suitcase had been found near her dead body.
