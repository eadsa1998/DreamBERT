I'm riding bikes with Mahorn at night and we're cruising through the grocery store parking lot. Everything is going good and we're having fun, when to our right we see a car with a bunch of people in it. And the backseat driver's side window is open, and there is a faceless person smoking a cigarette. Mahron screams, "Let's get out of here!" and I can feel my adrenaline rush. As we ride faster, the car drives closer to us. The car catches up with us and the smoking figure becomes recognizable and it's Mahorn. I do a double-take, looking at the Mahorn I was bike riding with and the Mahorn smoking. Now it's a convertible filled with girls that are models. All the sudden smoking Mahorn turns into just another one of the other girls and the car drives off. I look around to see I'm alone.... I wake up.
