There were 2 little dogs. One was barely older than a puppy herself--about 1 to 1 1/2 years old. The other dog was 7 years old. 7 hours after conception the puppies would be born. The younger dog didn't want to rest. I coaxed her into a recessed square--about 5 square feet to lie across--not facing the other dog. Rudy went to give the older dog a break and kept the pillow case of puppies warm between his legs. Soon he said, "I feel puppies," and little puppies ran out of the pillow case. Then puppies ran out of a pillow case the other dog had. Puppies were everywhere. my father kept calling and leaving messages that said he'd deposited $4,600 or $1,200 into bank accounts for me. A cop burst in demanding to know where my father was. my father had printed the money himself. Cops found me again at a trampoline in the rain. The cop was mean and rude. He did not believe me when I said I didn't know anything about it. I was at the beach with Paula. First there was a dance/stretch class. The man told us to stay in a back bend for 1/2 hour--but with our hands not quite touching the floor. Then we went to the beach. Paula and I had forgotten our bathing suits so we wore leotards. I cut the arms off one--only to find there was a tank-style leotard just like it (without the arms) already. I was looking for my sports bra to wear under it. Paula left to go play tennis and stayed till past noon. Our family was at the cheap place on the beach. Nice houses, but cheap because it was right in front of dangerous currents where you could not swim. Only this year--for the first time the currents were safe to swim in. We all played in the water and swam. My mother walked out of the water. There was sand in the bottom of her swim suit. Me and my father were still in the water, walking toward the beach.
