I am a teenager and some guy is joining us, but I don't trust him. Our teacher, Gary, calls us together and asks us, "What do you think of this new guy? Does he seem a little sleazy or not "true" to you?" "Yeah!" we agreed. I say, "He doesn't feel right, like he lies." "Yeah," says Gary. "Well, what if I just flat out say, 'No booze or drugs'? That would take care of the scotch problem right there. It's tough, but real." We agreed. Paulina says, "But he might have a problem getting back in with his friends. If he's a flirt, then he won't fit in any more." I think it's interesting that a lesbian is concerned that a drunk be able to continue his noisy, flirty, sexist ways. I disagree and start talking about if his attitude is OK, he can fit in and still have fun even if he's off the booze and drugs. As I'm talking, suddenly little lights zip up to me and surround me. I look up at Gary startled. I realize these are aliens that are taking me away, and as I start rising (still in cross-legged, seated position), I yell, "Gary!" And then I yell, Goodbye!" I see them all staring at me in astonishment and sadness. I feel a little scared and sad as I see the tree as I rise up and up. (I suddenly wake up relieved I wasn't disappearing into the cosmos.)
