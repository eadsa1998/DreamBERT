I was in a woods. There was a clearing about 10 feet in diameter. This clearing was covered with cement. I came upon the clearing and was very puzzled by this clearing in the midst of a woods. I walked to the center of the clearing and stood there for some time. Suddenly a large bird swooped down and I ran into the woods.
