Samantha, Sandra and Derek had come to town, and I think it was Christmas time because we were going around looking at everybody's lights. And they took us to this one house that I think was their house. It had a horse puppet that was really big, and it was like t_____ things and it was like a marionette puppet tied to the roof and it was automated so they were saying how they would have liked to give it some more moves, but it would have really cost them. I guess the people who put it up there charged an arm and a leg for the moves that it could do. And then I was upstairs with Mom and we were trying to vacuum and the vacuum cleaner was like bizarre. It was instead of being loud and normal, it was quiet and the motor was turning like extremely slow. And I thought, "Jeepers, what's up with this?" And also in this dream my sink was dripping like crazy and I was beside myself because I didn't know what to do about it and I'm very conscious about not wasting water. I always feel kind of beside myself when I notice that it's dripping. I think that's all there was to it.
