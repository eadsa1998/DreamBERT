["Watching Bill Domhoff dream."] I am in a house that doesn't really have walls I remember. Just furniture. It is supposedly my mother's house. Bill Domhoff and some of his graduate students are there. A woman grad student suggests I watch Bill Domhoff as he sleeps to see the REM movement. So Bill gets up from the dining table and goes to a bed near by and lies down and immediately goes to sleep. I lean over his face, which is in profile, to see the eye movement. The grad student is leaning over him on the other side. She says see? I look and the eyes are moving. I observe this three times in quick succession. Then the grad student and I return to the dining table where I see a chart with the three eye movement sessions marked. I notice they are each different. I point that out to the male Freudian bearded man in a black coat. Perhaps a lawyer or scientist. He says each is a representative of different types of dreaming. The first one has two lines that go up and down like a stock market chart. The second one has a single line. The third one happens as I look at the chart. I can feel the complexity and depth of that one as it happens. It is a full dream. The 1st one was a short dream and the second one was a fragment. I look up to see my mother in the kitchen. Cooking. Bill joins us at the table. I suggest we go out and have lunch. He must be hungry after his work. He agrees happily. He is very hungry. I am surprised actually because he just ate breakfast not too long before. I go into the kitchen and ask my mother is she cooking dinner for us? She sighs and says yes of course. Isn't she always? I ignore the guilt trip and say when will the dinner be ready? She says around 5 or 6. I return and tell Bill dinner will be ready by 5 or 6. Just so he'll know what to expect. He says great. He still wants to go out and have lunch. So we all go.
