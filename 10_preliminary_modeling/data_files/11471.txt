I was having intercourse with my mother. She was reluctant and didn't want me to do it, but I told her that I was trying to learn something which might prove valuable to me. I was sort of curious too, as intercourse with my mother was something new and unusual. She consented although she did not become sexually aroused at all. I felt guilty and a bit disgusted during the act. We tried some postural positions which I knew that most women object to, but which I wanted to find out about. The experience was not very pleasurable in general, although I almost had an orgasm immediately before I woke up. Incidentally, no thought of my father occurred to me in this dream although earlier this same night I had a dream in which my father appeared. The dream seemed to be pleasant, but I can't remember what it was about.
