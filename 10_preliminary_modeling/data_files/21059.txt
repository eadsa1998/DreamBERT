Barbara bought two colts for $24.50 and sold them for $225.00. She made a nice sum. I picked up a tire at the gas station which belonged to me. There were a couple of colored guys. I told them it was mine. I was in con's field hunting. A rabbit jumped and ran away from us. I was digging up the sidewalk and was doing to put in a new one. I talked with Joe Lasko and he told me I was the smartest one and was Ann's best boyfriend. He liked me the best of all. 72 came to me. I sat out in the fresh air and sunshine.
