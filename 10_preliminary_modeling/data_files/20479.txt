I was seated at a dining room table in a hospital. A patient across from me went to a different table. I had defecated before coming to the dining room, and I had a slight odor about me. I wondered if the patient had moved for that reason. The one next to me left for a different table, and a heavyset man sat there. Then two men sat at places across the table. They seemed to be effeminate. They made effeminate gestures as they spoke. I happened to look under the table, and I noticed that one of them wore a skirt. Later I left the table and walked alongside a young man. Everything outside was wet and muddy from a recent rain. We passed some burning torches, and the young man as a joke pushed me so that I stepped into the flame.
