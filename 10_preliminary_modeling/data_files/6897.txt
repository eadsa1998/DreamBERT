We were in the hall. I saw two men carrying in plates of jello, piled with whipped cream. I thought I'd like some too so went into the dining room. Saw three long trestle tables piled with food but couldn't find jello until after asking. Two dishes, one white, one red. Helped self to first and small amount of second, then to two ladles of whipped cream.
