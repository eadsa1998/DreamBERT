I am flirting with Tomas and Preston, kissing. I have decided they are O.K. Then the door opens and Hector comes in. We kiss passionately and lovingly. I have missed him so and I'm so glad to see him. He wants to buy me presents. I see a huge glass bowl, delicate, expensive, and beautiful. I hesitate. He says, "Get it; it's yours. It's O.K." I take it and admire it. Then I get some other things too.
