There is a destroyer or U-boat out on the ocean and I (or Dwight) have a flare gun. I must stop the boat from getting us, but that is too big a thing to do, so I choose to kill the Captain, assuming that if I stop the top of the chain of command, then I will have disabled its power. I fire a green flare into the right side of the Captain's chest. He falls, clutching his wound. It takes a while for him to die, but he finally does. Now I enter my parent's bedroom without knocking. I realize after I enter, it could have been embarrassing and I should have knocked. I see my new special outfit on the floor and I pick it up, saying to my mother, "I knew it was on the floor and I meant to pick it up." She asks if I intend to wear my special outfit now. I say, "Yes." The feeling is that it should be reserved for special occasions, but I just want to wear it because I like it. It is black with roses on it like my new bedroom curtains. I leave. I need to find a bathroom and try to convince myself that it's OK to pee as I'm really in a bathroom, and not dreaming it. Now Dwight and Corinne have a newborn baby boy and I want to see it. He's asleep and I smile at him, but I wonder if he can be comfortable as his head is off the edge of the dresser they have him on and it looks like he'd fall or get a stiff neck. Later, Lydia is pregnant. Doug makes a nasty, Doug-like selfish comment and I fix my eye on him and glare. He glares right back and I feel uneasy but continue to stare, realizing this is the first time I've had the guts to let my true feelings be authentically known.
