A large jungle cat, like a tiger and a huge snake, are all wrapped up around each other fighting. A cut is made on the back of the cat's head at the base of the skull so the snake can get its poison into the cat and kill it. But if it's the snake doing it, where did he get the paws?? So I don't know who is biting and poisoning who!
