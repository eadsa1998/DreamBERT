I'm out on my bicycle, riding with a black man [I know him, but I think I work with him, not a friend socially] - we're in a part of town like maybe the Love Field area, or some parts of Oak town - away from downtown, run down. We're crossing a big intersection at a light, there are stores set back from the street. Another man (also black) on a bicycle passes us going the other way, and as he comes to the intersection he raises his arm high in the air, hand straight. So does the man I'm with. I'm guessing that it's some sort of bicycle road signal, indicating that you're going to cross the intersection - I never heard of it before. Hmm. But they keep their arms up as they pass each other, and when they're close to, they acknowledge each other, then drop their arms after they've passed. Oh - I guess it was a black salute of some kind. Hmm. Just at the other side of the intersection, another vehicle turns out of the parking lot to our left (it's on a rise) and passes us crossing the street, and its driver gives the same salute. This thing is a kind of pedal cart, the driver at the back, a passenger sitting on a chair, sideways - it's a woman, white, the driver's a black man - on a platform. Looks a little clumsy, but they seem quite comfortable with it. Hmm.
