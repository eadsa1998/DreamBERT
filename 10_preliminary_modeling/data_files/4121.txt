I am with a group of people in a large room. It's a work place. I try to be helpful by cleaning up things and putting them where they belong. The people are pilots and a call comes in for the Stealth Fighters to do a practice flight. I ask permission to join them. The officer thinks it over and says Not the Stealth Fighters, but you can join the crew on the cargo plane. I am disappointed but I agree, saying. At least it's flying. So now I am in the cockpit of the cargo plane. We are flying very low down a big city street with tall buildings on each side and many bridges to fly under. I am allowed to fly the plane. Someone keeps saying to me Pull it up, higher. We have to get under the bridges until we get high enough to get over them. I pull back on the steering wheel. The nose of the plane goes up and we get to our destination which is a man dangling off some high platform. The crew in the plane has a hatch open on top and he drops at the right moment and the crew pulls him in. Now we turn around to go back only very high winds start up over the water by the street. We try to fly back down the street but my instructor points out to me that if I had chosen to go as I was planning, I would have sheered off the wing. The instructor is standing at the post that would have done it outside the plane and the plane is not moving as I listen. He then suggests I fly out toward the water where there are not so many obstacles. I do so.
