["Doing workshops."] I am visiting Ginny. I am in bed. I am sleeping next to Ernie. It is comfortable and friendly. We hold hands. The next morning, I am making changes. Ginny is helping me. I am moving some things around in my house and packing some things. Now I am giving a lecture at a workshop. There are 6 people in the audience. Two on my right, two in front of me and two on my left. I move a rectangular table with uneven sides, like a half of a hexagon, in front of them and begin my lecture. I am reading Italian from a big beautiful book. My accent isn't very good and I work hard to do a good job.
