I am in a new house with built-in toilets, and closets with light in them. I hang up my clothes and a friend comes by to thank me for being so helpful. -- Lying in a bed with Frank, looking into a mirror seeing ourselves reflected. -- On a hike in the mountains with Frank: I see some dead seals and later go up a tree where I encounter a black bear: I yell to Frank down below, but he does not hear me. Finally, when I come down, I realize that it was a friendly black dog!
