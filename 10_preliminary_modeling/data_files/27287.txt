It was an especially bleak day and I was walking with a friend of mine (girl) along the path around W Park Lagoon. I was carrying a flat, blunted rock. My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend.
