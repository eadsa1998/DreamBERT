I don't see Mary, but she is in the house, downstairs. I am upstairs in one of the bedrooms. Mary is not feeling well and asks me to do the laundry. I am searching in the bedroom, unable to find the laundry. I call downstairs, asking Mary where the laundry is. She tells me where to look, and I go into the other bedroom and find it. When I am in the first bedroom, the furniture is close together. I can hardly walk between the bed and dressers. I recall trying to move a lamp from one dresser to another while talking to Mary. I want to move this lamp to get more light in order to see more clearly into the area where I'm searching for the laundry. The dream ends when I find the laundry in the second bedroom.
