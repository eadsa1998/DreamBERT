Benjamin, Gunnar, Vikram and I used to regularly go to this restaurant where they served 4 meals at each table. Ours was Hababam. I had Kaldi, Benjamin and the first one, Gunnar had Tatilde and Vikram had Uyaniyor. Vikram was the only one who was always the same, the others kept changing who they were. I sat next to Vikram and across from Benjamin. On the day, they changed the theme and we were annoyed at requested Hababam meals anyway. One had a long piece of cucumber.
