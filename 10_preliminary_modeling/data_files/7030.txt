The boy handed me a four-page newspaper. I asked him how early he had to set out. He said until 7:30 he was ... (Then came confession (?) I couldn't hear) and he thought it was 2 a.m. I looked along hall and tried to speak to a grim-looking teacher in an empty room. She didn't answer. I went upstairs by an outside stairway thinking it was such a little ways that I wouldn't need dark glasses. Showed him my paper and he wanted to keep it. But I said I hadn't finished it. Told her about the boy. She asked if he was Catholic. I said I thought he might be as I thought he talked of going to confession.
