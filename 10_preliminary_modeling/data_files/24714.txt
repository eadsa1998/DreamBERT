I was in ancient Africa. I invented a time machine. All I had to do was press these numbers that stood for the date and I'd go to the time I wanted to be in. I came to modern time with one of the ancient African people. Everything here was really cool for them here. Setting: Africa and here. Characters: Me, an African person (I just knew this - there was no image). I was about 10 years older - no real images. Feelings and Thoughts: Calm, excited. I was calm and excited at the same time. The dream was interesting.
