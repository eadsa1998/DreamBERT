The setting of the dream looked into the past by way of a photograph album. I was looking at some photographs of a certain type of water rescue and I was rescuing the instructor, who was a big sort of Phil Silvers-looking type of guy, just a little bit bigger and broader and so forth. I had a little cap. I was laying on the side of the pool, and I'm supposed to be trying to help him up, but it looked more like they were helping me and it was supposedly a series of four, four shots in succession of me as a younger kid. However, they eventually turned out to be moving pictures. There was another group of pictures of a girl doing the same thing I was doing.  It was sort of like an, not an advertisement, but an example of how other people can use this type of rescue. There was no purpose of the rescue. It wasn't being used by the Red Cross or a standardized job; there was no real point to it. As I was viewing this, I was looking at myself and was just noting muscle structure of my body, trying to get a picture of what I supposedly look like to others when younger. However, at this closer look, I seemed to all of a sudden just become my usual size again. The first original snapshot appeared to be myself very young with a hat, baseball hat, just to give a significance of youth. Then the movie of the pictures I seem to enlarge. This dream is what just appeared to be the tail end of another dream. However, my recall for the other, longer dream is not very good at all. In fact, I remember, that's just not clear right now.
