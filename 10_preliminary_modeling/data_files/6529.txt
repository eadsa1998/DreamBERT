Laura gets undressed and takes a shower. The mirrors are placed so that I can watch her from the bed. I watch and jack off. Later, when she's done, we go into the bathroom together; it's hot and steamy. She informs me that she figured out how to get rid of all her excess cynicism. She opened the window and pointed to all the water condensed in the metal grate in the window. "All that represents excess moisture in the atmosphere." She opened the door and turned on a huge standing fan outside the window. The switch is by the bathroom door. The fan begins blowing, spattering us with droplets of water. "That's what I have to do with my excess cynicism." "What," I joke, "spray us with it?"
