I am in the Army and we are all laying in rows on a giant bed. I look at a woman whose arms are so skinny they look like Olive Oyl's arms. She has a flat chest like a boy's, no breasts. She is ill. Her clothes and things are in a pile and some of mine are mixed up in with hers. She gets up and goes to her room, #409. I pick up my things and then decide to bring her things to her. I look at the room numbers and find #409. She's laying on a double bed in there. I give her clothes to her, and she gets very angry with me for taking care of her. She can do it herself.
