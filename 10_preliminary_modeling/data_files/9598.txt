I am invited to two banquets: one with Father Andrew and the other one ? I see him put Zena on his lap. He is very friendly. He sits next to me and gently embraces me and kisses me on the right cheek. We remain this way a long long time. Very happy. See Zena fall down long staircase, but she is not hurt.
