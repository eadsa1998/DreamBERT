I am Buffy St. Marie, and Frank Sinatra comes by and likes me. We kiss. He's concerned that he's too old for me, but I assure him I like him just fine. We go to my mother's house. She pulls strands of beads (Indian Wampum beads) off a peg and gathers them up for my dowry. I notice she's not bringing them all and we insist she bring the full dowry. She does not approve the marriage and doesn't like me, but she reluctantly complies.
