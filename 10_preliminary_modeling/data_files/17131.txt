The dream started talking to my good friend Del online.  I felt that since he knew what I was trying to learn, talking to him about it would somehow be wrong.  After that the dream was all around a decision that my mother and my brother Stuart made, that we would move to Hollywood.  I was crying hard.  I didn't want to leave so close to graduation.  I got violent and panicked, trying to run to talk to my online friend Marty.
