 I'm riding a bicycle delivering newspapers. I decide to quit this job delivering newspapers. As I ride up to the first house my bike keeps pulling leftward, and is difficult to steer. I take off a tire and bring it to the door, hanging it on the doorknob. I forget to leave the inner tube, so I go back and leave it on the doorknob. The tire and the tube are the newspaper. A little girl is at the door. She may be scared of me. I ride to a gas station. I'm putting air into the tires of my brown Toyota Camry. My grade school friend Todd Hinz is there with his brother Chad. Someone introduces us like we are strangers, but we know each other. I say hi and we talk. Todd is working at a printing business in Wilmerton. He tells me of a certain kind of printer or printing. I am familiar with it. I say printing is Wilmerton's biggest industry. As I am trying to put air into the tire, the air spout collapses and recedes back into the tire. My bicycle now has low air pressure in both tires. I tell Todd to look me up when we're home. I tell him it will be under my mom's name, Natalie Redding, in the phone book. I am near the city of Hillston. I'm trying to find a route back to town. I am in a very wooded area on the outer edges of town. There is a river there and some hills or mountains. I am lost. My classmates Kyle Mendelson and Kelsey Bobber help me to an underground tunnel. I saw them and decided to yell. They wouldn't have helped me if I didn't yell. They have a torch. They lead me to the house of my academic advisor Mary Monroe. My roommate takes me down some stairs. He says that an acquaintance of mine, Mary Phelps, has not given up on me.
