In this dream I and a male friend from the neighborhood were at the gate of school that is close to home in a car of unknown brand which seemed old, but well preserved. He said that the car belonged to my brother and that he had put in 50 cents worth of gas. He started the motor, but he didn't know how to drive. All he could do was step on the gas and stay in the same spot. I told him, "Let's drive around," and I was going to get in the front seat because I had been sitting in the back. And when I got to the front, I saw that a yellowish liquid was coming out of the dashboard. I looked at the motor, which was uncovered, and water was coming out of it. It had a very strange carburetor.
