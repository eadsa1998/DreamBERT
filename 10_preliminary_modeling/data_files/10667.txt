There was a beautiful but scary rainstorm in my dream. I wanted to get my camera. By the time I had gotten batteries, the storm had passed. I went back to my house, but it was unfamiliar to me. There was a birthday party for me and all the kids came over. I didn't know any of them and it was a terrible party.
