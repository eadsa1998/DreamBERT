I was with Terri G, (a client from work), and she had her daughter with her.  [She has one daughter in waking life.  Emmy, a blond girl, and I really love Emmy.]  But in this dream she had another daughter, a little older than Emmy, with dark hair.  And it came to be known to me, that this other dark haired daughter, was probably really mine.  It wasn't like: this is your daughter.  It was like: there's a great possibility, coming close to a probability, that this girl is your daughter Tara.  I looked at her in the dream and I thought, "How can this be possible.  How can it be that I don't even know I have a daughter. I mean, a guy might not know.  But a woman would know if she had a baby."  And I remember thinking, sitting with Terri, that I was feeling really bad about not taking care of this daughter.  Not realizing I had one and taking care of her all those years.  Also in this dream, I dreamed at a different point that I was making a birthday cake, either with my middle sister or for her, but I think she was there making it with me.  It was this really huge birthday cake in sections, it had half-circle sections and square sections and you had to put them together and sort of construct this cake.  And by the time we were done it was so messy, so unruly, it really looked like hell.  And then we had to get it downstairs from where we had made it.  And by the time we got it downstairs in all these pieces, trying to keep it together, it really was just about falling apart.  Disappointing.  But there was some sense of celebration or happiness for my sister.
