My mother, father, older sister, and I were at a riding academy, negotiating with the elderly farmer and his wife for pony rides. There were several very small ponies grazing nearby, some brown and white and one black and white. As soon as I saw the black and white one, I was very excited and anxious to ride that one. The farmer remarked that we women were wearing dresses, and offered to wash out some old slacks for us to wear. We were reluctant at first, but the wife was so anxious to have us do so that we must finally have agreed. She smiled almost fixedly at us, and I was fascinated by her shiny face and her literally apple-like cheeks, very round and brilliantly red. Then we were riding horses under an archway past the stables. This scene seemed familiar to me. I think I have dreamed this same riding scene before.
