I'm walking in a parking garage with Kristie and we're talking and we walk up and up the garage's multiple levels. When we're about halfway up, she pulls out a baggie of mushrooms, but they look like dehydrated mangos and we both take some. I feel "high" in my dream and I stumble around and it's hard to stay balanced. We get to the top of the garage and start walking down the ramp to the street. When we're halfway down the ramp we look back up at the levels and I see a colorful peacock laying dead on the cement. We're too far away to touch it, so I throw a rock and miss it. Kristie is very upset by this sight and says something like, "We're on mushrooms and shouldn't be letting ourselves get depressed by this dead bird. Let's get out of here." Now we're walking on a sidewalk uphill with a street on the left and a sloping hill to the right. Now there is another guy walking behind us. I've never seen him before. He's wearing white tennis shoes, blue shorts, a tee shirt and a blue baseball hat. He's tall and is a redhead. He's nice, but doesn't really say anything. We all walk into a little caf√© and the red-haired guy opens the door for me. We sit down at a table and Kristie asks me how I feel. I reply, "I really felt high at first, but not so much any more." She shrugs and we talk a little while longer. Then I wake up.
