I was in a cross between two big cities I have visited, visiting friends and meeting with family. I went off with my sister in search of vampire ribs. Apparently, they were an illegal food, but quite delicious. We didn't have a car, so we took a sky bus with a surprisingly friendly driver. We went around the couple miles -- too far to walk, since it was all gritty and confusing and car-centric city below. We arrived at weekend fair at the fair grounds -- it was only like this during the summer. It was run by gypsies. Long hair, weirdo gypsies. I saw all kinds of food, but realized I'd need to ask someone who knows someone and go into a dark thick tent in order to get to the ribs, which were likely dark and tempting,  oh god so good, so bad for your body and soul.
