I was in a bookstore, getting a book for a class.  I picked up the book I needed.  It was white with purple text on the front, about the culture or history of Japan, by Sonya somebody.  I went downstairs to the register and nearly bought the book when I stopped to look at it again.  It looked familiar...it was one I had from a previous class.  I got out of line and went back to look at a stack of books.  I was standing on something leaning on the top shelf comparing the book with another one.  I flipped through the pages and it was a complete set with a CD ROM and some other extras.  I saw my former friend Jenna walking around below and I was going to ignore her rather than trying to be friendly, but I hesitated, and mentioned my book dilemma.  I have the feeling my good online friend Del might have been in the dream but I don't remember him at all.
