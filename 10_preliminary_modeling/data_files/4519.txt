["Not being professional."] I am watching a scene from my past when I was learning to be a counselor. I have long thick reddish hair. I am conducting an interview of a client under supervision. I hear the woman supervisor commenting I had not done it well. I had made sexually suggestive remarks to the male client and did other things that were not appropriate in terms of the psychological safety of the client. I feel embarrassed for myself.
