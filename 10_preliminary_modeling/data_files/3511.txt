Jean-Luc Picard and an "Emperor Boss" are there. Jean-Luc is aware that he is in the present, but there are chunks of his past he is not aware of. He must simultaneously regain the memories of the past and continue to function in the present. The Emperor Boss is a pain in the butt. Then Scotty says to Jean-Luc, "I am a senior trusted officer, why do you have to oversee me too?" It hurts his feelings. Jean-Luc tries to explain that it is good policy to always be examining things and noticing even old trusted ones.
