I am in a city, downtown, night.  Some parts look like Santa Cruz and some parts look like Tucson.  Jeff [my ex-fiance'] has let me use his car and I drive it into a bad area.  There is some problem or I have to do something.  I am at Robert R's law office but it is a tiny little shack or warehouse in an industrial district.  I need fervently to see him.  I knock but someone else, his friend, is staying there.  He's nice and lets me in but can't give me much info.  Robert R has fixed up the place and there's a bunk and desk.  But it's small.  And I'm very aware of this bad area of town, ramps, dirty streets, fencing, etc.  I look in a mirror there, I think and I notice this large circular red blotch on my cheek - left cheek.  It's like dark rouge at first.  I go out and the car's gone, and I know who took it somehow.  I notice that the spot on my cheek is getting different.  It is being eaten away, like acid, and I'm getting a hole in my cheek, deeper and deeper.  I'm terrified about this, and know I should see a doctor but it's more important to get Jeff's car back.  The hole keeps getting deeper so I can start to see bone, jawbone.  It's smaller than at first in circumference - maybe the size of a half dollar now, but just eating away at my cheek.  It's red and tissue-y.  I look for Jeff's car.  I run all over the damn town.  I get to know it inside out.  It's like I've been there before.  I know who has it but can't find her.  I go up ramps, around corners.  It dawns on me that Yvonne [another student] has the car and she's doing it to get my "attention", meaning love in a relationship way.  She wants to have a relationship and this is how she's getting my attention.  I am furious at her and frustrated.  Then it seems like Paris or a foreign city, but still familiar.  I go down one-way ramps, end up in people's back yard, go out, back to warehouse district.
