There were a lot of people around that I knew. [Don't know them in waking life.] One man was considering suicide. A number of us were trying to keep an eye on him so he wouldn't, but we weren't successful. He jumped into an indoor swimming pool and drowned. We found his body floating on the surface of the pool. Someone told me that Matthew had also committed suicide. Of course, I was devastated. I knew I wouldn't survive this. I started denying it because I didn't see his body. When people would try to convince me I would just argue that they didn't know that for a fact because we didn't see his body.
