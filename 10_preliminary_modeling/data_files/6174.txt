My dream took place where I work. I'm a teller at a bank. I had a dream that I went to work and there was dog food behind the counter. It was all in big bags and I couldn't walk around it. My ex-boyfriend came in to talk to me and he didn't notice that there was dog food behind the counter. I thought that it was strange that he hadn't noticed because I was standing awkwardly on top of it.
