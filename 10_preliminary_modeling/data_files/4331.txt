["Al Pacino and Ellie."] I am somewhere, outdoors. Ellie is going to meet Al Pacino. I walk with her across a field looking for him. As we approach where he is, she turns and asks me, if he and I should bond, will it be all right for Charla? Will it hurt her? I feel jealous because she is going to go off with Al and I can't come. I do answer the question though. I say as long as she gives Charla attention and doesn't ignore her, it will be fine.
