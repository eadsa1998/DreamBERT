I have been quietly exercising in my house and now I go for a jog. I come out of the house through a tunnel-like opening like from a basement. I slowly run. It is hard at first, but then I get better. Fluffy is with me. Now I'm returning, running easily in the rain. I feel good. I have camaraderie with my cat who lays down every once in a while to get her tummy rubbed. I call to her often to keep up with me and pet her tummy. Then Fluffy wanders a bit toward the road and I see a vehicle coming and I am concerned she might get run over. It's almost like the fact that the vehicle is there that attracts her like hypnotism. I call to her. The vehicle is a house trailer with segments like washing machines and dryers. She gets caught by the skin of her side/belly. The vehicle is nearly stopped in its concern not to harm her. I get her uncaught and we then go to the house, open the front door and enter, passing Howard and another man who are on their way out. They come back in. I try to ignore them, but know they are attracted to me and I feel sad about Howard. We've lived together all this time, but not in relationship. I rub Fluffy's tummy and see the wedding band on my finger and feel sad that I give more love and attention to the cat than I do Howard. I go into his bedroom to take off my wet layers of jogging jackets. I lay them out to dry on the floor. Then I put on my old jeans and mauve tee-shirt with laces and admire how good it feels to be slim and trim and in good physical condition again.
