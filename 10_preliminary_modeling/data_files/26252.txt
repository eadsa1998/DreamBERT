 I wrestle with my friend Nat Miller: we fight. He is aggravated because I've made fun of him regarding something to do with women. We see a map of Montana. Tornadoes are coming, many of them: all over! I return home. On the way I stop a middle-aged man who is jogging and tell him about the tornadoes.
