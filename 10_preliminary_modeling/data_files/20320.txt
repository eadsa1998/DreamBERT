A canary in a cage seemed to be ill, and I gave it some water. Hours later I returned and it still seemed ill. It occurred to me that I had not fed it. So I gave it some seed. As the bird ate, the seed and the bird seemed to slowly turn. Then the whole cage looked like a box, and began to spin. And then the whole room spun, and I became dizzy. It was like a delirium. I was worried about the bird.
