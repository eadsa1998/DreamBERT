I was in the back of the car and Gavin and some mates were walking but staying right behind the car. I looked at him and he saw me. We went to a video shop and he stayed at the car. I went out to the car because I was hot. He left a note in my book about drama and how Classmate-M-13 (guy at school) had tripped someone over and some other stuff.
