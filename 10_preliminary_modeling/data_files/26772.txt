 I'm in a truck riding with another man. There is a woman driving the truck. The truck is fairly old, from the 70's or 80's, and is green. We drive on a freeway-like road. We're going fishing, on a charter it seems, and the woman is the guide. We'll be fishing for trout with spoons. The woman drives fast, passing people without changing lanes, weaving in and out of traffic. She's a strong, sturdy mountain woman, I think.
