I was in a brightly lighted room in the dormitory with about 10 other people (2 boys). There was an operating table in the middle of the room. Two men walked in the door wearing white coats like doctors wear and carrying huge bags. They were tree surgeons and they had come to operate on a tree. They said they didn't need to wear gloves or use an anesthetic because the tree wasn't really an alive human being. Then they took out a saw and one of them began to saw off slices of the tree supposedly, but it was a human foot. They sliced off pieces just like meat (only it looked like cork). I said I couldn't stay and watch and I ran from the room. One of the fellas said he was staying because he thought it was interesting.
