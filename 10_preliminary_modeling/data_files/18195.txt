I was a man about 35, I guess, and I was going to South America. I had some business in the capital city of Venezuela, and I got down there. It was quite a bit like reading a book, a description, or like seeing one of these travelogues. And I found the main road right away that led to the capital and stated driving along it, and it was very attractive scenery, I guess. It was very green and there were these high grasses on each side of the road. And there was hardly any traffic. Every once in a while you would go thru a very small village which would enact as sort of a toll as you went thru it. And also at these small villages you could buy gasoline very infrequently, so every time you found anybody with a gasoline station, you stopped at once to get some. I came to a crossroads with a stoplight and it wasn't far from the capital. There was a man selling gasoline, and he was selling it from this big tank. He was a farmer or something, and he just had this large tank full and he was going to sell me 21 gallons. And he brought his hose over, and I had some strange contraption that led to the gas tank. I can't remember exactly what it looked like now. It was sort of a hollow tube and there was sand and stuff in it because there was sand on the ground here. And so I had to get this sand out of it before we put the hose in it and filled the tank up. Then I started driving on towards the city, and as I was going there was this woman at this gas tank as well as this man, and she had sort of fallen in love with me -- the man that I was. Meanwhile, I had gotten to the capital city. The whole trip was very short and the time that it seemed to take was not more than an hour. I got to the city, which looked just about like any city, and I drove into it. And I just turned around and drove back out of it, seeing that whatever my mission was, it was accomplished. As I drove back, it seemed that when I got to this particular gas tank again, I stopped where this girl was.
