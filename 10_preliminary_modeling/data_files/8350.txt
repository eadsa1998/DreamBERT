I was in a photography class. We were to take photographs of one of the other students. We were also supposed to have one of the other students take some photographs of us. When we took a break to do this I didn't stand up to connect with someone right away so I had to sit and wait for someone to be free. As soon as I saw one woman sit down - finished - I asked her if she would take the photographs of me. We moved around to different places in the room. There was one place that had grey curtains. It was almost like a stage area. I was going to sit on the edge of the stage and have the grey curtains in the background. She didn't like the grey background. There was another place where the walls were kind of a cream/beige color. She thought that would be a better background. We went over to that area. As she was getting ready to start I realized that everyone else was done and sitting down. I said, This isn't good. Everyone is sitting there watching now.
