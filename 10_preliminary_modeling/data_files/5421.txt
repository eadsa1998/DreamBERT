Last night I had the worst dream that my mother died. It was honestly the worst dream I had ever had. I had been talking to her two days before, and I somehow knew she had died, which made me hysterical when the police showed up at the front door to tell us officially. And I guess I had known that when I had been talking to her before hadn't been real, like some sort of recording. But I started screaming and crying so hard and convulsing when I found out she had died, because I had remembered telling my father how lucky I felt that no one I loved had ever died and it was really only a matter of time before someone did. I just kept wishing and hoping that I could talk to her one last time. I would have given anything to see her and hear her voice just one last time. I was so so so so happy when she crawled into bed with me and I started crying because I had been so scared!
