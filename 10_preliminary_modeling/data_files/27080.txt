I dreamed that my mother &amp; father were living and that I was at home with them. However my father was ill in bed. I could see him sitting up in bed, then out in the sun porch. He kept asking me when he would get well, &amp; if he had to continue to take the "shots. " - He was getting medication for lues. I tried to  explain that it would be necessary for along period of time, but not to become discouraged that is was a long treatment but would be helpful to him. I asked him how he thought he had become infected &amp; that did he have any idea how long ago it was. He seemed very surprised that I had any idea what it his illness was &amp; he asked me if I knew. I said yes, that I wasn't a child. He began to talk of a time when he went out with some of his friends about eight years ago--however I can't seem to remember any thing more. I did feel however, that although my mother was in the dream she didn't enter into it actively.
