I was in an Arab country, on a college campus.  I was under arrest for something.  I was not confined, but was atop a very high bed, too high to jump off.  People were walking around down below anyway, so they would have seen me. My wife Anita was there, and I was trying to find a time when no one else was looking and I could drop something down to her (a note? my keys?).   Eventually I got off somehow, and as I was walking through the campus, I saw a several guys sitting in a curved booth.  I asked them if they knew, or had seen, Ron Nadner.  They pointed to one of the guys sitting there, and he admitted to being Ron Nadner.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  They guy looked nothing like Ron.  He was slim, with sandy hair, and was wearing a cowboy hat.  I suggested we go somewhere and have a cup of coffee or something.  So they all got up, and as we wound through the narrow streets of this campus, we somehow got separated, and I couldn't find them again.  I was frustrated.
