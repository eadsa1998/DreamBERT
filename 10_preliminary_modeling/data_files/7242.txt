My door was open again. I tried to close it but couldn't so the latch would click. Decided to lock it even if it was against the rules. Then I went to the bathroom. My towels were gone and I couldn't dry my hands. Complained to X. She said Mrs. Wilson had taken them to wash, why not? Didn't I put them in the Home's wash? Not when they were mine. I had lost a pillowslip by doing so.
