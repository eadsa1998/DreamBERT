I was with my sister in her fiance's car going by a park. It was nighttime. She gave me the wheel and I started to drive; the car was very hard. Suddenly they started to play protest songs on a P.A. system and we started to sing. I saw the police taking some boys from the university away in order to interrogate them. Every one of them was very calm, laughing. I was talking with one of them and we agreed to meet later on.
