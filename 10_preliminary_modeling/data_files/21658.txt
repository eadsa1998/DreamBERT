I was outside and looked across the land and saw the clouds flying low. I went out and let some of the small clouds come to me like steam and they gave off a peculiar odor. Then I saw a cloud that was an image of rhinoceros. It floated low and I picked up a rock and was going to throw it at it and it seemed to be alive or acted so. It looked at me ready to throw the rock. It went around the other side of the barn. I was walking across a small stream of water. I had to jump across when I went over it, then came back. Bob had a high ladder against a high wall. He was tightening up wires from it.
