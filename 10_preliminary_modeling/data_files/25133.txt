 I'm in my yard at home near the tree where the old tire swing used to hang. There is a drunk entertaining man there. People seem to like him, but I don't. I am flipping some branches around with another branch. My friend Melanie McDyss, her friend, and my classmate Krista Coulson are there. There is a large wood-like block that I have. It is the congressional record. I am using a wood saw to cut it into three pieces, and then am placing them in my duffel bag. I tell people I am cutting the congressional record.
