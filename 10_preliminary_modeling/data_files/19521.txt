I was walking south, on west side of 17th St., in vicinity of Red Cross and D.A.R. Bldgs. Smoking a cigar which was very short and much chewed. A barricade where some street repair work was in progress extended out from the side walk about 1/3 distance across street. Automobile #1 pulled up close to sidewalk, and just short of barricade. Auto #2 at first tried to usurp place of #1, but later moved out into street enough to clear #1. I crossed street and hear Dr. Bowe laugh. I wonder whether any of the occupants of the cars noticed that I was smoking, and feel that I have cheated in claiming to have given up smoking, whereas all I have done is not to smoke in the presence of acquaintances.
