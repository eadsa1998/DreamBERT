I was on a bus going through New York City. As we approached the country a woman guide of about 30 said that we should notice something high up on a mountain. I had an aisle seat and crawled into the aisle, putting my head next to the floor in order that I might see the top of the mountain to see what the guide told us to notice. I still couldn't see the object of interest. This made me feel cheated as everyone else in the bus was exclaiming at the beautiful sight and I was the only one to miss the view.
