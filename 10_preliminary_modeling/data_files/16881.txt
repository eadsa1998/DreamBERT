A true nightmare based on anxiety. I lived in a small seaside town. I had just bought a small merry-go-round for my children. My father was helping me to transport it. I left it for 5 minutes on the corner of the street, thinking because it was so heavy, it would be safe. When we came back with a van, we saw 3 or 4 men carrying it away at the other end of the street. I drove down the street after them, and saw them taking it into an amusement arcade on the next street. I considered shouting out, but stopped myself. I'd phone the police instead - a safer option I thought. In my dream my vehicle was like a child's car with large plastic controls. The phone was a child's toy phone. At first I seemed to be calling the arcade. The man who answered seemed to know who I was, and gave me a clear threat. He called me by my name, and said something like "if you and your family don't want to have an accident, then don't think about calling the police." After he hung up I called the police straight away on the kid's phone, dialling the emergency number. To my horror, the police didn't answer - instead it was the man I'd just spoken to. The dream continued with escalating threats, and my concern for the safety of my family felt real. I woke up from this dream feeling terrible - anxious and terrified for the safety of my family.
