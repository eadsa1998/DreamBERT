I was at a house which was Dad's, but not. I was watching a Russian movie with Benjamin over MSN, and there was a girl with me too. I didn't know her very well. She started throwing these little yellow balls (like Bingo ones) and I told her not to because Dad won't like the mess and had recently vacuumed the floors. She ignored me. Then Timothy Olyphant was there and was Mickey (Scream 2). I wondered why I had the killer there. I pushed onto a table and climbed on top of him and kissed him. I wondered why I was doing this. On Facebook, Benjamin wrote Leif and Arnie' names into a song by The Police he didn't like. I thought the lyrics were Sk8er Boi. He made a joke about 'gasming'.
