My brother Terry was with me and two other people. I don't remember who they were, but one was a guy and the other a girl. It was late at night and we were driving to go pay the PG&amp;E bill. I think we were driving through desert. I was talking to my brother and I asked him if he had ever been to a couple of places out here. Arguilles and some other place in Oregon. I wanted to show him around. The next thing I remember was all of us being in some building (inside resembled a hospital in the dream -- distorted) and paying PG&amp;E. I went to use the bathroom and saw a picture of four girls, who, in the dream, I had gone to high school with.
