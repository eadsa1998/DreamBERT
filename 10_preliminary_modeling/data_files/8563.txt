I had put some kind of skin treatment on the palm of my hands. Shortly after I did I realized that I should have put it on the outside of my hands, and extended down onto the outside of my fingers. I was either thinking that I could just go ahead and rub what was on each palm on to the outside of the opposite hand or if I actually did it. I also realized that to remove it, when the treatment time was over, I just needed to rub it with the opposite hand.
