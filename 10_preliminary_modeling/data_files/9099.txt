Debra Messing and Harry Connick Jr. were going to get married. Tom Selleck was in love with Debra and doing something to try to stop the marriage. I was in love with Harry, though I wasn't doing anything to try to stop the marriage. No one knew where Debra was. Harry and I were going different places trying to find her. At one point we were in a bedroom and ended up lying down and kissing, but I pushed him away. I told him that this wasn't right. I knew Debra was better for him than me and I wanted him to be happy. Someone convinced Tom to quit trying to stop the marriage. I was walking behind him into a building. He was wearing a light grey suit. He looked very sad and dejected.
