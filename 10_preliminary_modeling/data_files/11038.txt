I dreamed that I was dancing In a nightclub with B (a 25 year old Negro fellow whom I would like to date--we just recently met and are becoming quite well acquainted). The lights were very dim and I couldn't see many other people in the club but everyone I did see was colored. This didn't seem strange to me and it seemed that I was almost a Negro because I couldn't think of any white friend's names. Then I was in B's apartment, sitting on a divan with my head in his lap. I had been crying and he was stroking my hair and face. Then I thought of S, the girl who is very fond of B and doesn't know how I feel about him (she's in my class at Mather and we're quite friendly.) All I could see was her face with her long black hair drooping over one eye.
