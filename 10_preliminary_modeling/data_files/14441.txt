I was at the train station, which was different. I was getting picked up inside. I saw Eugene's car. I can't remember, but we followed them. Also, there was some dude who got something had photos. He, or I, needed to ask his mother how she wanted to get them. We followed them. I was then outside what looked like Mom's house. Eugene's father Abraham was there. His mother was there too and she was skinny and looked young. The other side of the road was just grass. Nana was there and I sat with her. Eugene called her Nana and asked about Poppa. He asked me something and we started talking. I asked "what are you doing this year?" and he said "Engineering", then he paused and asked if I'd gotten in trouble for all the school I missed this year, saying he'd seen me at the train station "100 times".  I said that I took the train to university. He mentioned he had an older sister called Trish. Somewhere else, his mother was on the ground having a seizure. There was some game I played earlier. There was a Keike family, which I thought was based on Preston's family.
