I am in a set of four rooms. The dining room is never used. I am surprised and ask Bonnie why not. She says it's too much trouble. I see Phyllis G. who is helping me with my paperwork. I want to give her the Barry Stevens book she likes. I write an inscription on the inside and then realize I wrote it on the wrong book. It's a children's coloring book. So I ask her to read it and pretend it's on the right book and then I give her the right book. I then must drive many miles on a bumpy dirt road to get to my word processor. It's a van/bus and a woman is driving. Without even stopping, she gets up and crawls out the passenger side of the van near me and runs up to the stop sign. I know this is normal procedure and wait patiently as we drive leaderless up to the sign where she will hop in and continue to drive. Lydia, in the back seat, is startled and cried out, "Look out! What's she doing?" I explain to her.
