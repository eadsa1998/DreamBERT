Mom is holding a jar with a mouse. Dad is with her. A lion chases them. I go inside where it is totally calm, at the JCC. There are teachers and kids. These are two different worlds. Setting: Jewish Community Center on Brotherhood Way. Characters: Mom - scared. Dad - scared. Me - dizzy, scared. Teacher - pleasant. Kids - happy. Lion - fierce. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. Recurrent dream. I felt deja vu because of the number of times I'd had it.
