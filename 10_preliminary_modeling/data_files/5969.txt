I am at the arrival area of a large airport going through immigration and customs. An official takes my passport and places it down on a table with many papers as I pass through a gate of some kind, similar to a metal detector. On the other side of the gate I am handed my passport back. I get to my home and ask myself, "Did I check the passport?" I open the blue- covered passport and see inside the name and photograph of a Chinese man. "Oh, no", I think, "they gave me the wrong one." Thinking that I might contact the Chinese man to exchange passports with him, I look through the passport for an address or telephone number. All I can find instead are glossy color pages picturing an item that the Chinese man has brought through customs. The item is a universal exercise machine with weights, pulleys, benches, etc. I become anxious believing that now I will have to go through the bureaucratic procedure of obtaining a new passport.
