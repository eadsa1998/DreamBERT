In the dream I'm walking my eldest daughter home from school on a warm summer evening along a canal - perhaps in London or Amsterdam. It's the kind of happy summer evening that mostly exists in distant memories. My daughter is older in the dream that in reality - perhaps she's around 5. On route we bump into some friends of friends who have kids too - who are just a bit older than my daughter. They invite us to come over for a cup of tea nearby so that the kids can play. They live in a large scruffy house with bare floorboards and couches covered in ethnic throws. These people have a couple more friends back at the house too. We get talking. The kids are having fun, so we stay for dinner, then for the evening until it gets really late. While my daughter is playing in the next room, we adults (there's about 6 or 7 of us) start to get drunk in the kitchen. Maybe we pass around a joint. Around midnight I realize it's very late and we must go. I get up and give the women a kiss goodbye (and shake hands with the men). One of the women lingers and when I go to peck her on the cheek, she kisses me on the mouth. I feel uncomfortable about her sexual body language, so I leave. She seems disappointed. The fact that it is so late, and my daughter (who is only 5 in the dream) needs to go to school in the morning makes me feel terribly guilty that I should be getting drunk with these people.
