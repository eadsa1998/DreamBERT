I'm in a place where there is a large crowd of people. A party is going on and the main course is spare ribs. The place is so crowded it is hard to move around. Mary and I must have had a disagreement about something and I'm sorry we are on the "outs". I want to make up with her. She is upstairs and I am having difficulty working my way through the crowd of people to get to her. I am diverted and directed away from getting to Mary. I think, at one point during this dream, that I lost my clothing and must find them before going to Mary. Toward the end of the dream I have my clothes on and am heading up the stairs toward her. Somewhere in the dream there are two fellows complaining that they have not been served any ribs. Someone gets one or two pans, cleans them out, and brings these fellows a supply of ribs.
