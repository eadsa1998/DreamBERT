I was in an uncle's farm, playing with my cousins and siblings. My aunt and uncle, other cousins and my parents were sitting on the floor and started to look at some dried fruit and then they played cards. In the meantime I was being chased by my cousins and siblings. There was a small river (which is familiar to me) with a bridge made of tree trunks; it was narrow. I crossed it in a hurry and when I got to the end, I saw myself walking on Union Street. I bought a pair of shoes and continued walking. Then a girlfriend came out of a side street, we looked at each other and we kissed. When the kiss ended -- it lasted long -- there weren't any more people. They had all gone and it was still early. We continued walking, holding each other, and I awoke.
