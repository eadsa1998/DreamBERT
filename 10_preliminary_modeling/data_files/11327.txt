I was in Wade Park with 2 of my friends. We stopped to talk for a few minutes in one spot. I noticed a young couple walking hear us. Suddenly I heard a loud blast. It was a loud explosion occurring behind my back just a few feet from me. When I turned around to see what happened, I asked my friends what happened to the young couple. They pointed to the ground. I walked over to the spot where the explosion occurred and all I could see was the young man's head and part of his body scattered over the ground.
