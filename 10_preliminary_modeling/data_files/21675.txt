I played two horses and I didn't know if they won, but Benie Minkus, he had a horse by the name Minkus. He won and paid $12 or $94. I told him so I was flying. The wind was keeping me up. John Tesar (deceased) was also flying. He tried to catch me. I tried to fly fast and keep out of his reach, but he caught up to me. I saw his youngest son and I asked how old he was. He said his son Jimmie was 20. My son Bob was near. I said, "Look at my son Bob. He is only 16 and is as tall as me. He is taller than you." I was down at White's. Louis Kaufman was the foreman (deceased). I had a hard-on and I just seemed to have a shirt on only. I tried to hide it as much as possible. Then I noticed I had pants on. I went outside and I saw Swifty walking by. He was looking for work. I told him to go in and see Louie and he walked in to see Louie. I was standing by a window looking out at a big tree that the wind was blowing back and forth as if someone was breaking it loose from the roots. Then I said, "Let's move away. It's going to fall on the house," and sure enough, it fell down on the house. We looked out and there were other trees around and they were as calm as could be. I said, "It was the devil that knocked that tree down." I was pounding nails into objects on a bench and a pheloscopic was here. He said, "Keep repeating you are not going to steal" and you will be involved in stealing.
