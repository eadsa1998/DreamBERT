I discovered that Leslie had been murdered (stabbed). The night before I dreamt that she died -- her car had flipped over neat the roundabout on Princess Rd and I told Mom later but she already knew (that Leslie was dead). Then I was at some place with a bunch of school people. Some were people I knew and some weren't. There was a killer and we didn't know who he was. Sometimes it went third person and it was my Sim, Alex Goth. Some people saw him and then later, he shaved and looked completely different and escaped with everyone else. Then it was back to my point of view and we discovered that the killer looked like Marcus Alvers (24), but hoter. He had these blood slides and was throwing them at people. I managed to take them off him but he kept getting more. I'm not sure what happened but I think we liked each other and I let him go.
