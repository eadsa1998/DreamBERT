 I'm with my friend from high school Tiny Combs, and his father Tiny Combs Sr. There are two other men there who are bad. There are some cars there. We try to run the bad men off the road in the cars. They are trying to run us off the road as well. Tiny Jr. and I avoid a head on collision. We later tell his father, Tiny Sr., what happened.
