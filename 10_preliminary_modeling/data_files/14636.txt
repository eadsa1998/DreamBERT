I was at university in class talking to Jakob and some others about our marks, hopeful TER and failing last year. Later, I was talking to Samantha and she was in the last year of her course. I asked her how many hours a week she did and she said she did 15 yesterday and I was like 'what?!'. I complained saying that it takes me an hour to get there and that I have to get up at 6am when I start at 8.30, which was three times a week and that if I had a 15 hour day, I wouldn't get home until like 1.30am. I was then in a room and there was a riddle on the board -- the waiter had [something I can't read, looks like 'moar'] and we figured it meant a plate. I was then watching Thank God You're Here and Hamish Blake and some guy were on a bush walk and they stroked this horse's penis to find out where they were, which everyone found funny. A friend of Mom's had written her a letter saying that was praying for me to do well. He was at war or something.
