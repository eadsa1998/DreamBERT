["Dora visits."] I am trying to get ready to go to an English class. Things aren't working well. I am going to be late. My girls interrupt and take my time. I look for some papers. Suddenly Dora shows up. She wants me to take a drive with her. She is driving. I see she is about to drive down a steep hill without a road. I say to her. There is no road here. She just drives on. It is bumpy but we manage to get to the bottom safely. I see large rocks that could stop us, but she drives over them also. Now we are on city streets. I sigh in frustration. I am late. I decide to give up trying to get to class. After all, I haven't skipped classes all term, so it's probably all right. Now Dora is walking. I see she is in a marching band costume and carrying her tuba, which is in two parts. Charla helps carry it. We cross a street. I ask her if she just returned from her Marching Band class. She doesn't really respond. Now we are inside a school. I see a classroom Number 357. I think maybe this is my English classroom. I think about going in. Lots of students, including a man in a manual wheelchair are rushing in. The class is about to start. I decide not to go in. We walk down a hall. Now I realize that I made the wrong decision. I needed to present a speech in the class in order to qualify for the speech contest. I won't be able to participate. I feel disappointed and upset with myself.
