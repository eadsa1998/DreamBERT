I was at Midvale High School, which was completely different. Tiana was there and I started walking home and I thought I would call Mom to get me instead, but I didn't. I realized that I forgot my bag. Liza Minnelli was there and she went and got it for me. My bag looked a chicken. I was talking to her and she lived in my country. She was friends with Nana. I asked why she was working at Midvale. She had this teacher form and we had to pick what we thought the teacher was like. 'Giddy' was there and I said "Well, I'll tick that since I was watching Arrested Development yesterday".
