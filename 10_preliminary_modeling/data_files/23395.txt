I was in a warehouse kind of house, and there were other people, and my husband, and we were running around trying to find a way out. There were all kinds of rooms and there was a scary presence. My husband went to get his truck and he backed it up to a window and the camper shell was on his truck. I was calling for everyone to come so we could go and it was very scary, climbing through the window with my legs dangling, thinking something was going to grab me.
