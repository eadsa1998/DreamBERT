I dreamed I went to an unknown place and I appeared in a desert, looking at a very pretty blond who was in a bikini and who flirted with me. Then I asked her to have intercourse with her and without saying a word, she took off her bikini and I started. Suddenly I felt a strong gust of wind which made dust and I saw several men on horses, with guns, who looked like they were from the West. One of them was riding very fast. He had black clothes and a golden gun holder and silver guns which shone. Then I went up to him and asked him why they were following him and he told me that it was because he had killed a man. I told him to stand up and face them, but he didn't pay attention and went on. I awoke then.
