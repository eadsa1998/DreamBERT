I'm in a car, in the front seat, and talking with a cousin. We like each other and are laughing. I see a short cousin who I don't like coming toward the car. He wants to kiss me. He gets in the driver's side. I am in the middle and he tries to grab me and kiss me. I "playfully" say "ugh" and make jokes and squirm away. He really is annoyed at me and wants to connect. He's jealous of the sweet camaraderie with my other cousin. With the kissing cousin is another man I don't like who is building a square wooden box in the front seat in the driver's side and he's making rude remarks and leering. Later, I get out and go to where the short cousin is now seated on a couch. The cousin is tow headed and holds in his lap two sweet tow headed children, obviously his. I smile at the children because they are so cute and reluctantly smile at the cousin because he's being sweet and fatherly to them. He goes to put them down for their nap. The cousin hopes this has impressed me and I want to move away from him. Dovre is around. We are going somewhere. Dora is there somewhere. Maybe we are going shopping.
