I turned into a mouse and was being chased by a cat. The cat was a big cat, it slowed down and swallowed me. I went down it's throat like I go down slides. I ended up in a green house with lots of honeysuckles. Setting: Outside, in a cat's throat, and in a greenhouse. Characters: Cat. Never seen it in life. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. I was very scared.
