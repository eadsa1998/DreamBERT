The dream took place in a railroad station. I was standing on the platform talking to a boyfriend about my age. Across the tracks there was a cage of animals that attracted my attention. Somehow I suddenly found myself in front of the cage watching elephants at a fair. The trains started coming in but I paid no attention to them. I do not remember how the dream ended.
