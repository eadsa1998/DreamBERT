It was a preposterous one, I know, and the one feature I am sure of was a load of hay, towering to an amazing height from the low massive sledge on which it was drawn slowly along the snow-covered streets of a small village. It rose far above the buildings, and I could hardly distinguish a group of people riding on it. I asked a bystander how high it was, and he replied: "225 feet."
