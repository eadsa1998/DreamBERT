I joined a group on Facebook for FilmForum and it had less than 10 members. Raquel and Leif were friends on Facebook. I wondered who she was on FilmForum and thought she was Mary Rose for a second, but then remembered she wouldn't have seen more films than me. There was something being filmed outside. I had a microphone that was like a flat map and I realised the person hadn't filmed lots of things. There was a kid on some rocks near the water being interviewed. There was a zoo which a mouse creature. I had a big lamington and it kept grabbing at it. It had a long nose and was weird looking. I was then with Mom and I finally got to the and ate the lamington. I offered some to Mom and she said 'ew, lamington' and I offered her more and then remembered she didn't like them. I ate half and then gave her the rest.
