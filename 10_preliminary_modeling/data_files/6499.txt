I was standing on a road near Hillside, in the middle of the night, with my supervisor. She handed me a library video and told me I needed to return it. I agreed to return it for her, and I walked over to where the Denny's is in reality. In my dream there was another building here which I lived in. I got into my room all filled with books and records and food, and suddenly there came a knock on the door. Somehow I *knew* the knocking was some old friends of mine I didn't want to see, so I didn't open the door. (My room, by the way, was like a janitor's closet in some institution. There were no windows and the only light came from a bare bulb hanging in the middle of the room.) Still, it was nice to have visitors, so I went ahead and peeked out the door. Mistake. Matt and Steve forced their way into the room. They made havoc out of a good deal of things until Robinson Jeffers showed up (poet, American, 1887-1963). I imagined him from a characoal drawing on the cover of a collection of his poems I just bought. I really had to pee, but the only thing around was a paper bag, so I pissed in that. When it was filled up and beginning to leak out the bottom, I ran into the hallway to dump it out. Naturally I had to pee when I woke up at this point.
