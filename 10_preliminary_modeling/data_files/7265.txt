[2nd dream] Get ready and we'll go for a ride so I started to toilet but a young boy did too so I waved him on and went downstairs to look for the Bible I had left there. When I came back and got in the toilet, I couldn't do anything and the door was open. I asked the boy standing there looking at me not to watch and I'd get through sooner.
