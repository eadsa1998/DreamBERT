I don't know where I was, but Juniper had to go to the toilet and the door didn't lock so I had to stand outside and guard it for her. I thought she had finished for some reason and I got distracted and was talking to someone and some guy went and opened the toilet door. She came out a few seconds later and didn't want to talk to me because she thought I did it on purpose. I apologised and said I thought she had finished.
