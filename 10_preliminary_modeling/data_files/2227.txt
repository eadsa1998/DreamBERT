I'm a river animal of some sort and I'm lazily paddling in my nice creek. I see fish swimming, my dinner later on. I smile, floating on my back and feeling good about my nice river. I get out and explore a commercial restaurant kitchen. I waddle up some stairs and see a double swinging glass door to the lobby. I am tempted to go through, but remember that the last time I did that I couldn't find my way back, so I return to my creek. Kitchen people comment on me as I pass, "Did you see that? Wasn't it cute?" "Someone should pick it up." "Not me!" I see three or four more poodle dogs in a side alcove. A man says, "They're mine. I'm waiting for the other sexed dog to arrive." I see someone leading a female poodle toward them and am glad I'm not here with three or four sexual males awaiting her.
