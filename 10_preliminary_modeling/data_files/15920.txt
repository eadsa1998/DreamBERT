I was supervising this Decjuba at Harbourtown. It was a supervisor-only SFG and I'd never done it before [working at the store today for the first time, but not supervising]. I got to Harbourtown which was different and just this big block of shops, with these market stalls next to it. I parked over one side and asked a lady where it was and she said it was on the other side, so I drove through the carpark to the block of shops area. The whole thing was on this big block which was just grass between them. I parked and realised it was 8am and I was 1 hour late and I couldn't work out how that'd happened. I got my stuff out the boot and asked another lady where it was and she said it was down in the stalls. It took ages to get through and by the time we got to the store, it was 9am. The manager lady didn't seem that bothered though, and it only took me a few minutes to scan everything. Apparently there was another Decjuba that had gone south as well.
