I am in my office at work with the lights off. Just outside the door there is a party going on in the hallway. Many classmates from college are there loudly talking to each other, apparently ignorant of my presence nearby.  "What a coincidence that they have the party so close to my office", I think to myself. Before saying hello, I decide that I will turn on the lights. I flip the switch which normally turns on an overhead fluorescent light, but this doesn't work. Next I try turning on a small lamp on top of a tall file cabinet, but this doesn't work either. With myself still in the dark, X. (a male friend from college) walks into the office and I say, "Oh, hi X."
