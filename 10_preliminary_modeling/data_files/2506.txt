A man is showing me how to do something on a computer. My head is against his chest and we stay there hugging gently, except we are both pretending we aren't really hugging, we are simply working on the computer. I feel sad. Then we break apart and I say, "Hug me" Now he's older and overweight. He says, "Hug her" and points to Katrina. I say, "No problem, she's a friend." I hug her and say, "But it's not the same." He sighs and says, "I suppose we'll have to go to bed then." I feel sad and disappointed. All I wanted was a hug.
