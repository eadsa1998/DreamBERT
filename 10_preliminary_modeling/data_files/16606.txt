I was in some kind of grassy, open space. I felt like it was near my school, but I kind of felt like it was in my old apartment complex from Weir (?) Park and I was sitting there on a picnic blanket with a boyfriend that I had. I'm not sure who it was. It could have been Sean or Justin, or it could have been a younger version of Jim. And he was talking about Andrea Bocelli and how he had apparently started a charity and he was helping manage Andrea Bocelli's charity. And he was putting all kind of money in it, all kinds of jobs and donations and stuff. And we started talking about getting a drink of water, and Jill comes by and she's talking to us a little bit about different things about school, and then this boy says, "I'm going to go in and get some water. I'm going to get some ice from the ice box in your refrigerator, okay?" And I say, "Okay, that's fine," and Jill goes, "Oh no, I took a lot of time to fill up that ice tray, and I just don't feel it's right for somebody else to go in and get my ice." And they kind of argued a little about it, and in the end it turned out that he was going to take some of the Andrea Bocelli money to go buy his own ice. And then I woke up.
