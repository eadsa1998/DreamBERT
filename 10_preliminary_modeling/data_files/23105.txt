I was to be in a baseball game, playing catcher.  I was described as the "offensive catcher," which I took to mean that they didn't expect much of me defensively.  I was a bit worried myself about playing the position, since I hadn't played it in so many years, but I was also excited about the challenge and proud that they had picked me.  When I tried to find a glove, though, I couldn't find a catcher's glove, and I couldn't get my fingers in the gloves I could find.  I was very frustrated, and it got closer and closer to game time.
