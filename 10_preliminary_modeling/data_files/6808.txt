We were driving in a car with two facing seats inside and a driver's seat in front like a landau. It was dark. I missed J., perhaps he was in front with the driver. I asked, "where is J.?" H. or R. answers, "On the other side of me." I say, "Move nearer then." For there was a big space, so he can have more room.
