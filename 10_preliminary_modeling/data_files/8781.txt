I was at an office and saw that all of the old SXDS district managers were there. I was noticing how much some of them had aged. Of course, I was looking desperately for Gary S , though unsure that I wanted to see him. Some of the others saw me and came up, smiled, and said hello. They seemed very pleased to see me and I certainly enjoyed seeing them again. I saw a young woman there and realized that it was Kelly S, Gary S's daughter. I was somewhat hoping he had gained weight. That way I could talk to him without feeling self-conscious about the weight I've gained. I caught a glimpse of him and immediately thought that he hadn't changed at all. He didn't seem to have aged much. I mean, he really had. I suppose it was what some people would call aging well.
