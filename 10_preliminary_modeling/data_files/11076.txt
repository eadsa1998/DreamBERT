I dreamed that my mother and I were downtown in Cleveland shopping. We were having a very good time laughing and enjoying ourselves when all of a sudden it began to storm. My mother and I decided that we had better hurry and go home because we didn't want to get caught downtown. So we went to the car and drove home. When we got home the storm had stopped. Then I woke up.
