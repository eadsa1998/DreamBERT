 I have a sore on my left hand. I seem to be in a place where a talk is taking place. I open a cupboard without getting up, and take a pin out of the tomato pincushion that is inside the cupboard. I see the pin is thicker, and is plastic. I use it, poking it into the flesh of the sore. A bit of flesh rips away a slice of skin, which seems to be dead and decaying. The piece of skin that tore off looks like a slice of a clove of garlic.
