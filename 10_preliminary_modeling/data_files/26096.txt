 I'm on the back of a motorcycle that someone is driving. We ride east on 2nd Street South in Wilmerton. There is an attempted suicide of an ape-man. The character Barney from the television show The Simpsons and an old woman are there. They may be involved in the attempted suicide. We chase someone on the motorcycle, and then stop at the suicide scene, which had something to do with metal barrels and holes in the ground.
