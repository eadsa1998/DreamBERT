Nancy was my best friend and we rode our bikes together with our other friends. She crashed into our house so she had to go to the hospital and her mom called 911 and told the address and then they came and I don't know, but some people came over to clean everything up and then a lady said "why don't you come park your bike, but you have to walk like this," and she said I had to walk on the side of the house and then she parked my bike.
