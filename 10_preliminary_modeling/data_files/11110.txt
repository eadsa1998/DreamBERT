It was raining and I was taking a driving lesson. I turned the corner at 18th and Euclid and almost hit a little kitten. This frightened me and I became doubly cautious. I was skidding quite a bit and was afraid of an accident. I was turning a sharp corner and instead of putting my foot on the brake, I hit the accelerator and we went up over the curb and stopped when we hit a telephone pole.
