I was hiking, I guess.  We came down the mountain partway and looked in a cave.  There was a lot more to the story but it eludes me right now.  My old friend Jenna got mononucleosis in Disneyland, and apparently so had I, so there was a conspiracy.  I talked to someone about a radio station.  I was trying to come up with good call letters, and the man told me to come up with a Plasticene figure.  I started looking around to move again.  I was looking amongst some huge houses, with little streams and bridges and a cat in the water chasing a floating paper hat in the moat.  I stopped at an open house held by an Indian lady, with thin logs leaning against a tree.  The lady was complaining about the landlord.  Entrance was through the music room- someone was playing a run down piano and another a little flute.  There was a stage.  There was a gash in the wall so it was very thin, and wavered when tapped on.  My old friend Jenna's father was there, and apparently my brother Stuart was looking at the house as well.
