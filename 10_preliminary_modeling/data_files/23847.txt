[Visions while going to sleep.  Before going to sleep, had been reading Seth, and I had asked for a past-life regression or past-life vision.]  First - I saw two big elephants coming toward me, at night, along a pathway.  It was as if I was crouched down in the jungle, watching the elephants come toward me, and their eyes were tiny green lights.  Second - I knew I was in South America.  I was a South American Indian, with the black hair, with the bowl cut, and I was holding a young South American Indian child, with my arms around its torso.  The child was about eight, and I felt, something felt like it was dying, it was about to die.
