I was back in Oceanside Elementary and I was going to eat lunch in the cafeteria with a couple of other girls and a boy. And what the thing of it was that part of your grade related to whether you went up to the cafeteria buffet and served other people along with yourself, or whether you just served yourself. And I was in the line and there were only like three people behind me, and there was this boy ahead of me. And they had this kind of yukky turkey and pork fiber that was supposed to be a sandwich, but really wasn't it. And he plopped some of that on my plate and I was thinking, "I can't serve this to anybody else; there's not enough." And some of the ladies behind the counter were going to give me more, or put more out for the people, and there were like little containers of fruit and little containers of jello, and I really wanted one but I didn't have enough money. So I took my measly little pork dish up to the cash register and paid for it and the lady wrote on my receipt that I got a 50 because I didn't serve anybody else. And then somewhere alone in this dream I felt like the cafeteria had a subwoofer under the stage and that there was a sound system that they were going to play for us during lunch. And that in a few days the cafeteria was going to be closed for a few weeks so they could remodel and retweak the sound system in some way. And then I was back home upstairs in my bedroom, and I had the feeling that I was still really close to that cafeteria, like it was downstairs in our house, and I wanted to go get something more because I was still hungry in my dream. And then I woke up.
