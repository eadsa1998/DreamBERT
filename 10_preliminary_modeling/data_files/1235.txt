I am a man, being kept by a wealthy man. I wear lovely clothes. I ask him, "How long can I count on your generosity?" The old, fat man wears high heels and a robe. Now I'm wearing a beautiful wedding gown. I'm female. The announcers tell how women love to swoop up and down a staged aisle in this type of dress. I swoop. It's like a roller coaster. When I'm on stage, another woman, a rival jeers at me. She threatens to tell the man stories about me. Hints that he won't stay interested in me? I must get to him first. We both begin to run. There is a massive crowd. I work my way to the left edge where I can move faster as there are fewer people. I see video tape boxes with titles on them. I grab 2 that say "Barb." I get to the street. I must cross the street but the noon hour traffic is starting. I see my chance and I go for it. I run and keep looking to my left where the cars are coming. They are getting closer and closer. I am worried because they won't stop for pedestrians. If I miscalculate, they'll just run over me.
