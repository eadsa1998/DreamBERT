I am eating some food at Aunt Elaine's. Unexpectedly, there are two more guests. There isn't enough food. A man drops in. He asks to see some pictures I took with my camera. He's looking for beautiful women. I show him pictures of an open air zoo in Roseburg. A beautiful wildcat leaps out and becomes alive. He runs outside. Howard tries to catch him. I am a little concerned. Will it be hurtful? Will other photos come alive? I find more pictures.
