 I'm in a car which may be my mom's station wagon. I see some blaze orange clothes in a parking lot. I drive in to get them, and see that the clothes are in a van. I drive into a store, which is the Fuller Family Store in Wilmerton. I drive around the store and back out. Then I walk in the store. I get some liquor. My parents, who are there, buy two bottles of graham cracker schnapps. It is pink and appears milky. There are a lot of valentine cards for sale. Some of the cards are blue and purple. My dad asks me about a dent in the car by the radio, and other dents. I tell him I don't know anything about them. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. She is wearing tight pants. I say hi and introduce her to my parents. There is a huge valentine book on dreams, which is about three feet tall and one-and-a-half feet wide. Melanie suggests getting it, but it is not for me. I want to get some valentines.
