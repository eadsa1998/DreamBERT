I'm at a big lecture given by this well-known motivational-self-help guy. I'm helping out for a bit here, listening to him when I can. There are a lot of people here, including a lot of LT people. He sounds pretty good, I'm liking what he says, and his manner. There's this girl - one of his regular staff or helpers - who's been part of the crew I'm with, and suddenly she's getting out of hand, dancing around and flouncing her hair (which is reddish-brown, long and shaggy), she's wearing orange tight pants and a midriff top, no shoes, and now she gets really loud, flouncing by me, asking, "Have you ever heard of the Barefoot Lesbian?" And I have no idea what's going on. Meanwhile, the lecturer starts getting more excited and energetic about something, and he's talking about somebody he's calling evil, and starts pounding his palm and raving. I'm thinking, well, this guy sure ain't Brad &amp; Roy after all.
