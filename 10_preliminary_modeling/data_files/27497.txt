I was in Sunday school. While services were going on I stayed in a little room which contained an old iron bed piled with coats. After services were over everyone came in to claim his coat. My cousin came in to get her coat and told me that she was engaged. She introduced me to her fiance. I told her that he looked familiar but that I couldn't place him.
