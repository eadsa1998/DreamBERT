I had Biology, except it was in a shop. Ms Olmstead showed me the yearbook so far and I was going to ask for the photos, but I didn't. I was trying to find Eugene, but the only person that I found that I knew was Classmate-M-29. I took a lollipop and Evelyn said "You just took a lollipop" and I said "No, I didn't". She said that I did and I said that I don't eat lollipops. I tried to get rid of her by running around this shop but she kept following me. It was hard for me to run. I was pulling stuff from the shelves and throwing it behind me to make it harder for her. There was a shop exhibit thing that gave you extra flowers and I asked for extra chocolates. I hid on it, but she found me and I jumped off. I found this little car which was pretty fast. Mika was bouncing around on this ball and was singing Love Today. We ditched the ball and were hiding in sports equipment. Mika kept singing and I was hiding underneath him. I was telling him to be quiet and that "she'll hear you" and told him to hide with me so she didn't see me.
