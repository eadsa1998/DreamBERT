I am in some weird house and my friend Allen is my housemate. Some random girl is over and we are talking to her. Next thing I know there I some cop in my room and he is telling me that I need to get a new dresser. I ask him why and he really has no good reason except that he does not like my dresser or any of my furniture for that matter. We continue arguing and I am not afraid that he is a police officer, and I tell him to basically fuck off. The cop leaves after we argue some more and then he leaves. After he leaves, Allen, the girl and myself decide to build a fort out of the couches like I used to when I was a little kid. I feel pretty good about the whole situation because I did not let the cop tell me what to do.
