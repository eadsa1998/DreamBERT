I was working at a newspaper, and was sent out on a story. I wound up at a gas station. I needed to get gas, and some other stuff. But I was stressed about my job. I bought all kinds of useless stuff that I didn't need. I also bought some tobacco from a vending machine, and a packet of sugar that I'd already opened. I went to the counter to return them. The packet tobacco -- I couldn't use it, unless I chewed it or ate it... and who wants to do that? The lady behind the counter took the return in her hand in different pieces. "What sexual addiction do you want that will kill you?" she asked. I took American spirit cigarettes, the yellow organic pack. Then I went on to work. The roads were completely flooded, but I drove through anyway. I met A co-worker I was attracted to at the office. She was working on a big story. With her, my feelings come out as a mix of love, jealousy and respect.
