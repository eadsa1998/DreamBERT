 I'm at Brimson in my room, which in real life is my girlfriend Jackie's room. My roommate Stephen Ramos is there. He leaves the room. As the door closes behind him I see that Jackie is sitting on the floor across the hall from the door. I am folding laundry. Jackie comes in the room. I say I'm going to the bathroom because I have to urinate. I go into a large red or pink room with lots of windows and many small beds with metal frames. I decide to defecate. I go into a stall. Stephen comes in with me, jokingly, and then goes out. I sit down on the toilet, but I can't defecate. I can see the whole room. There are four or five men there eating. It has been a while then, and I think I should return to the room because I told Jackie I was just urinating. My economics professor Zoe Madden and some men with very thick glasses are there. They look like stereotypical "nerds" in high school. They are eating lunch in a cafeteria-like area. I get up and wash my hands. I go past the women's bathroom to the men's bathroom. The men's room is a large open area. There is a sink of warm water that I wash my hands in. There are large windows and a Jacuzzi, like a spacious health spa. There is a ceramic water fountain-like structure. I urinate in it. I run water to rinse the structure out. I think someone is about to enter the bathroom so I stop urinating. No one comes in, so I finish urinating. There is an upside-down water tap on the fountain that I use to rinse it. I go out into the room. My friend Simon Naver is there. We talk. I tell him about my job in the Big Resort Area. I'm eating lunch outside what feels like a luncheon for prospective students. There are a lot of people who aren't familiar with the college and the food. Stephen is there and we talk with a man about the food. The man is the father of our high school classmate Aaron Webbed.
