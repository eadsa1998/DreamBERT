First of all, I dreamt that we had this certain CD that was called the "Concert 90" CD because that's a classical music station in the area, but it played like the Dove 105.5 and it even said that on it a few times. And it would play like the station does; it would play about 20 minutes or so of songs and then about 5 minutes of "Bleah, bleah, bleah." And I was thinking how odd that was, and I was thinking it must have been they sent us in the mail. And then I dreamt that there was this other blue and white CD that I couldn't find the case for, and it was supposed to be something like Snow White soundtrack or something like that. And then I dreamt that I was putting two of them in a bag, like you do at the bookstore. I was putting like Maggie's Mo Jo with the Concert 90 and the blue and white one with Mariah Carey or something and two other Mariah Carey's together and so on and so forth, thinking that maybe I was going to organize them better. And then I dreamt that Mom had paint up the kazoo in the bathroom closet, and I was looking through them and half of them hadn't even been opened. It was like a stockpile for a store or something. It was totally ample. And I suggested that she move her tape rack into the bathroom and get a CD rack for her work room. And then the rest of it was a whole slurry of activity and stuff, and just basically all kinds of stuff.
