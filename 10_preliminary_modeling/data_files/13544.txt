I was at 'school'. We had this cooking class. I put my bag near the desk and when I went back it was gone. I was trying to ask the teacher if she knew where it went. Eventually she went looking for it. I had to cook all these different recipes. I picked this banana muffin. It had to go underwater. I had to one of those MATHS things as well. This lady was at her house and she knew all these kids Halloween costumes, so she pretended to be someone else. These two kids walked away from her house and one said "she tries".
