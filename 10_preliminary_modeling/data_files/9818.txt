We are in England with John H.: we went through castle with a woman I knew: she waved hand very gently; entered drawbridge of the castle, she is the wife of the man in the castle: we debate as to where to sleep: John H. seems disturbed; is he homosexual? I noticed how he acted toward women; finally we find a bed in the top of the castle: H. does not make a pass at me; relieved, because no one will be pawing me all night long; one of the women talked "dirty": "he knocked her up and then that 'turd' left her."
