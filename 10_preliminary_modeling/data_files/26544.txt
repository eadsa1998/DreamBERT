 I'm at Scott Junior High School in Wilmerton. I jog around the athletic field. There are men in their late twenties playing football there. I play a game of three-on-three with them. My teammates are physically small, and we get beaten badly by the other team. I fight one of the big men. Three bullies bother me at grade school. A woman helps me dupe the bullies. We offend the principal.
