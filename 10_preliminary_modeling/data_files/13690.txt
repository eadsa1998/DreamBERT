I was watching American Idol. They showed Michael Johns and then they had these African kids dancing. Randy Jackson said "What is this, So You Think You Can Dance?". One of the dancers, a little girl, had weird arms and they were wrapped up around her head. She had said something 'sad' to Simon Cowell and it had changed him somehow. She tried to do the same thing to Randy.
