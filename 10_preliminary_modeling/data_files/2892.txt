I am going through boxes of old things from my business, which is now officially my daughter's business. I am looking for something and I check things off as I find them. I find the name "Barb's" has been changed and think I've found evidence, and then I remember she legitimately bought the business and so it is natural she would change the name. I change my outfit seven times to be exact replicas of seven past women to make her remember. Howard is in his office and she is in hers and they both ignore me but are very aware of me. It's time to leave, the end of the day. I go out to the car with her, very pleased that she was aware of all seven women, right down to the smell. I realize Howard hasn't joined us and I know he's trying to commit suicide and my daughter arranged it. I confront her and demand the key to his office. She says she hasn't got it. I prove she has and further I have one and I go back and open the door to find him nearly dead with pills. We take him to the hospital and save him.
