I dreamed I had gotten a scholarship to study English in New York. A teacher had recommended me and I had won. I had gone there on vacation and had stayed for three months. I was in a school where I learned only English, and that I came out in the afternoon at 5 and therefore we had to take a lunchbox. In the breaks we all sang and played and had lots of fun. In my dream I could speak the language perfectly.
