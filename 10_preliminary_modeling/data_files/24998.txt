 I'm checking my mail at Brimson but my mailbox is way at one end of the post office, which is different. I can't get into my mailbox. The door won't open. There is only a little space to reach my fingers in. In my box are some little name cards that people put in graduation announcements. There are also a bunch of forks in it. The names on the cards are from people from my high school that I graduated with. <br/
