 I'm near the Grease Pit burger joint with my sisters Heather and Ramona, my dad, and Heather's friend Belinda Bark. We want to eat. Heather says we should go to Helen's family restaurant. I say no, lets go to the Grease Pit, because it is cheaper and we're already in the parking lot. My dad is over by the pink building to the west of the Grease Pit. He is walking towards us. I am going to pay some or the entire bill. I think of ordering five bigger burger combos.
