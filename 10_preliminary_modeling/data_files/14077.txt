I was with the school at some hotel place. I got room 264 and I was by myself. There were three other lots of beds in the room (they were in lots of two, so there were eight beds). Later some Asian guy had to join me. Mom came and was helping me set up. These other people came in and joined their friends (other people now were staying in the room). The balcony was next to my bed and we looked out the window and saw this ugly couple in a tree, kissing. They started taking their clothes off and Mom yelled to them and they said "oh, do you have a child in there?" and so they only took their pants off. There was a magazine on the bed with Sophia Bush on the cover. I went downstairs to this place with someone. We saw some dogs outside and then ran into this stairwell. I closed the door as they got there. We ran and hid in this big office like room. The door was clear. We looked to see if they were coming. They weren't so I ran out to the elevator. A dog came and I kept pressing the button so the elevator would close but people kept coming in. Eventually the dog left, but I kept missing my floor because of the close button. It was there when I got to my floor but someone hit it on the head. I went to my room and the Asian guy was actually a dog.
