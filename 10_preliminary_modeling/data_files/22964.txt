Daddy was alive and was seeing my daughter Christina for the first time.  I was surprised that he didn't make much of a fuss over her.  I remember telling him how Christina would do "forehead bumper" by point to one thing on my face and then clawing when tickling under the chin for the "gitchee-gitchee."   Daddy and I were also trying to get a football game on the radio.
