 I'm at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's old farmhouse. Grandpa, Grandma, my friends Kevin Simpson, Hank Anderson, Darlene Miller, my mom, and others are there. We have to leave by 10:05 am because Darlene needs to be somewhere. Darlene needs a pipe so she can justify, which means to show, to someone that we weren't smoking marijuana, only tobacco. I ask Kevin for his corncob pipe. He takes it out of his dark blue jeans. My mom or Grandma is cooking eggs with yolks. People eat them. I want some before I go. I eat some eggs in a hurry on my way up to the bathroom on the second floor. Hank has two little snakes. He is appalled by the idea of feeding them to his bigger snake. There is snow on the ground. There is a zip lock bag of severed fingers in the back of the car, which is a station wagon. My brother Wally is working with food a lot where he is. Liver parts are being served for the vegetarian dish that night. There are apricot jam and oatmeal raisin cookies for dessert. I take a cookie and eat it.
