I was at a concert by a local singing star, and when it was over, I stayed and listened to him answer people's questions. I was the last one there. I don't know how, but he ended up staying over at my home. He was watching a video of the concert and I asked him if I could buy one for my mother who was very upset because he didn't do a concert in her city this year. She goes every year. He said he would get me one. I set a pot of coffee to be ready and I got a new pillow case. I explained to him that was the bed I sleep in, so I would give him a new pillow case, but he said mine was fine. Then Cindy came walking out of the room. I explained to him that this was my youngest daughter. He smiled and said she was cute. I got her a bottle of milk and we said goodnight and I went to sleep in Carla's room.
