I want to go to my bedroom. I'm at a rich and swanky party. I'm told to push a button. I do. The buttons are apples and other fruits. When I push an apple, a bed of red cabbage with cole-slaw stuffing rolls comes out. A woman says, "Oh, good, I don't have to stay in bed all the time. I get so tired of staying in bed day and night."
