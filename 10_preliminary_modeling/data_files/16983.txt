I live in a modern, spacious city - it seems European. I tell my partner one evening that I'm popping out. I go to the city centre, where there is a performance taking place in the cobbled main square, which is reminiscent of London's Covent Garden but bigger. Elton John is performing on a stage, and underneath the stage a look-a-like Elton John is hiding. Later I go to a bar in the square. There's lots of empty seats, but it's filling up. There's music playing and a buzz in the air. I sit with a group of 20-somethings. They encourage me to stay but I felt I should go home to see my partner and the kids. None of the people I'm with have families to get back to. One blonde girl is quite persistent in persuading me to stay, but I get away in the end.
