We were to take the train but got talking and discovered it was past time 2:40 p.m. J. said David would take us, leaving him at office and take Elsie and me on. I saw Elsie had gone fast asleep in the waiting room and went to wake her. Had to shake her before I could rouse her and make her understand we had to go.
