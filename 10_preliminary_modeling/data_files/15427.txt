I was at a shop with Eugene and we were dating. I joked that we should go outside and pretend to have sex to annoy the security guard, but we didn't. Two other friends were there and we were using our iPhones and a headset to communicate for some game. Some guy had drugs. He gave us these sticks of marijuana and some other drug. We used a 'tube' of pasta to snort it. We liked it and kept taking it. I was then at a house. Dad and Ezra were there. A girl knocked on the door and Dad said it was a girl he slept with and not to answer it. But she said she was just here to do something that I can't read. She had a weird English accent (Northern) and she was young and blonde. There was a notice on a board for Greg Grunberg having a party. There was a new Tommy Wiseau movie about the war. I watched a trailer and Neil Flynn, Zach Braff and other fairly well-known people were in it. I was then driving and I got a call from the guy with drugs. He asked "Where are you?" and I said "Stirling, near Target" and he said "Good, come over", "Where do you live?", "Just come over". He just kept saying that so I drove to the shop where I normally saw him. I think he actually lived there? He said he didn't want anything and I asked "Well, what do you want?" and he said "Dunno".
