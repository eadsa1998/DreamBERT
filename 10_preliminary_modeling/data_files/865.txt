I dreamt that I woke up to see my daughter Paulina floating on the ceiling. She was naked, with long blonde hair, sleeping in a curled position. I got frightened and looked to my right to be reassured that Paulina was her regular little girl self asleep beside me. She was, and I calmed down. I had a sense of fear about this visualization, like I was seeing her/me in a past life.
