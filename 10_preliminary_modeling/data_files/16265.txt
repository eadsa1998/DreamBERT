Mom and Dad went out for the evening and I had some things to do while they were out. First of all I was putting some CD's in the CD player and I was going to dance and stuff like I usually do. Then I had this notion that I had to go out to get something; I don't remember where it was or what I had to do, but I had to go somewhere. So I got in the car, I started it up and I sat in the back seat, and it just took off from there and it just sort of knew where I wanted to know. And it stopped and it parked itself in the parking lot when we got there. Like I said, I don't remember what it was, but I remember getting out and talking to somebody in the parking lot and being real afraid because I don't look like I'm of age to drive. Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere. And again, I started it up and I sat in the big seat with this ____ thing, and it just sort of knew when to stop at this traffic light and knew where to turn -- that was so crazy! But when we got to Allison's, we were almost home and we were coming down 5th Street, and we were at Allison's and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions, and I didn't want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it's funny. And so after talking to Megan, I just walked home and I put the boombox out on the front lawn and played some CD's and I sat in the green chair. And then I woke up.
