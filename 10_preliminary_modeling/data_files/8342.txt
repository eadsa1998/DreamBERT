I was working with a group of people on some kind of project. I think it was all women. I have no idea what the project actually was. The best way I can describe it is four large white banners that formed a square, leaving a large opening in the middle. Each section had rectangular pictures or graphics every so many inches. However, there were places that there was supposed to be a graphic and there was not. It was the job of the group to select a graphic for those empty spaces and put one in. We had a number of different options for selecting graphics. I suggested to the group that we choose one of those options and stay with it, as it would help us to be more effective. We could reach group consensus on each graphic more easily and we would be able to accomplish the task on time.
