We live in a large COOPERATIVE apartment with several families, but we buy our own food; a couple goes away on vacation and we watch their baby boy for them while they are away; WALLY is helpful and puts the toys in order. Outside there is a sandbox, and Wally shovels the sand back in that has spilled; shift: it is summer and warm; we are in the country; I remember to add 17c to the cash register.
