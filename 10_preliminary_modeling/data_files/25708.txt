 I'm with my grade school friends Jerry Kasper, Patrick Bergman, and others. We're driving on 8th Street in Wilmerton towards Armstrong High School. Jerry is seeing our grade school classmate Kari Otis. I say it sounds like a "friends with benefits" situation. I ask Patrick what he is doing. Eh says he's living at home and working.
