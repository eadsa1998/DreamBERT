I watch as two fluffy white dogs which are somehow magical need to fly up into the sky. Get above the turbulence layer of air to bring back fresh pure air. One dog blows air into the butt of the other dog. They fly up, inflated. I am now up there with them helping get past the turbulence layer. We successfully get above it and gather fresh air. I return to earth. Then I am holding a pistol which doesn't fit right in its holster. I struggle with it until it slips in and fits correctly. Now the pistol is purple and slides in and out very easily and comfortably.
