 I awake in my bed before my alarm goes off. I'm in the larger bedroom upstairs at home in Oak Valley. Becky Muldoon, an acquaintance, is chained to the railing on the stairway. The chain is attached to her neck. She does this by choice. She may be sleeping or trying to sleep. I let out a yell, as I sometimes do in the morning to get going. I get out of bed and put my red John Henry underwear, with a crumpled elastic band, on my shelf. I wrap a towel around myself and walk downstairs. The two monks who teach my Buddhism class, Dhar Thack and Jonah Daruwalla, are at the bottom of the stairs with another monk. Dhar says to me, "For example, we do not raise the voice: yell." I realize that I'm disturbing their sleep, and I say, "I'm sorry." My brother Wally walks by. <br/
