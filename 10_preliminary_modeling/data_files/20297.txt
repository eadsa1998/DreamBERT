At first I was working in a laundry, and I was confused about something. Then I seemed to be at home using a washing machine. A little later I was confined in an institution. I was standing on a floor that felt like a bed spring, and looking through a hidden opening that led outside the institution. I tried to get through it to escape from the institution, but it was too narrow. I wanted to get out very badly, and with the force of my will I seemed to rush through the opening, leaving my body inside. I went rapidly down the street. I did not know whether or not the people I passed could see me. They behaved as though they did not. I felt elated at being free. I had the form of my body, but not the flesh. I passed some young girls and attractive women, and I was tempted, but I resisted. But I did not turn my gaze from them. I assured myself that if I had enough will power to get through that opening without my body, then I surely had enough will power to resist that temptation. (Yesterday I read from Nietzsche's works that a thunder storm symbolizes will power without the confusion of intellect. In the first part of this dream I was confused.)
