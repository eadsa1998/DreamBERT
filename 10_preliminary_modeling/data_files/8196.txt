I was with Karyn L. She had three children. I was surprised to learn that she had been married and had three children as she is gay. I thought about how Mary Kay C must feel about becoming an instant parent. But she is so kind and loving I knew it would not be a problem for her. I knew she would soon be coming to live with Karyn L.
