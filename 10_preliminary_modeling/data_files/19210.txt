It seems that a party, a funny kind of a party, had preceded this scene which is where the steak scraps had come from. The last thing that I remember was that a funny silly sort of a game was being played. People were carrying their trays in from the kitchen to the living room, ballroom or wherever this party was being held. As they went thru the door they had to keep their balance and if they lost it, dropped their tray on the floor and bent over or something, everybody would laugh like mad. This happened several times and I was laughing like mad. There was fruit and stuff all over the floor. I recall one guy cleaning it up. I remember thinking how disgusting the mess of food was, you know. I would probably get sick if I had to put my hands in it and clean it up. He cleaned it up and took all this food unspoiled except it was messed up back into the kitchen and threw it in a trash can and this is when I was salvaging those steak scraps out of the can.
