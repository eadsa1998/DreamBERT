I was playing a phonograph. It had a regulator to increase and decrease the tempo. It was a new invention that I had never before seen. The automatic kept putting the needle at a point away from the turntable made of material like a woman's panties. It had a snap on it like a corset. Another was made of stocking material (woman's silk stocking). A young girl (or boy) about 15 came and took them, saying they belonged to someone.
