 I get my master card bill for $381. It is already paid. I'm at the bank talking to a woman about my bank statement, which is my credit card bill. My statement doesn't have my itemized checks and deposits: they are all photocopied onto the back of the statement. The name on the statement is Eugene B Filse. I want an itemized statement, but my name doesn't seem to be on it, and everything is fuzzy. The woman says that I wrote too many checks in too little time, and that they are sloppy. My mom is there. I am angry! I ask the woman angrily if it is because I wrote too many checks in too little time, or if it because they are sloppy. I ask this knowing that the question is dumb, and that it really doesn't matter. The woman gets defensive and bluntly asks what she can do for me. I say loudly and sternly, "I want some good answers!" I sand up abruptly with contempt for her. I crumble up the paper with contempt. My mom is upset because of my behavior. She follows me out of the bank. I see my high school classmate Todd Warden as I walk away, and I think this is the first time I've seen him since his father died.
