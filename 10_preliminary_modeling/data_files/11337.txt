I got up from bed to go to class. I found myself climbing up a hill with some fraternity brothers. We were looking for a place to go to eat breakfast. One guy told me we were going over to my roommate's house to eat. I said, "Do they serve meals?" Then I remembered that they had the best meals in town. I was in a car riding through a forest. With me there a few other guys my age. We saw a bear along side of the river which ran close to the road. I said look at the bear, It was probably washed up by the flood. Went on further, and I saw a pheasant. I said look at that pheasant and what's that behind it? It looks like a chicken hawk. The chicken hawk was sneaking up on the pheasant. As we went on I saw more pheasants. Before we got on to the main road leading to town, we stopped the car in order that some of the guys could get completely dressed. It irritated me that they didn't finish dressing before we left the house to go to eat.
