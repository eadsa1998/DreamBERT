I am a woman who lives on a piece of land that has a mountain of trees from the back door on and a central (state) rocky terrain from the front door. I am garrulous and talking to a woman friend. Some men come to the door and I let them in and I'm telling my woman friend how we get our food here, that we won't go hungry because I grow pumpkins in the back. In fact, I'll be serving my men guests pumpkin pie for dinner tonight. I walk to the front door and look out and up. I see a square hole being sawed out of the blue sky and four men in blue shirts fall out of the hole like they'd been kicked out of heaven. They fall across the sky, rather than down, toward earth. There are four holes or so. I marvel that they start healing themselves up and soon there are no holes in the sky. I go back in explaining about what I saw to my friend. I carry a one-dollar bill in my hand and a shirt. I wear a black crocheted shawl over my T-shirt and jeans. I have ample bosoms. I'm going to give this one-dollar to the young man who has come to visit. I try to find a place to put the dollar so no one will see it and get tempted to steal it. First I lay it under a backpack on a shelf, then I tuck it into my jeans pocket. I say to the woman, "They had blue shirts on too. I guess when you are drummed out of heaven, they don't take your blue shirt from you too." I laugh.
