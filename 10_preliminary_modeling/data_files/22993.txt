Back at the agency.  Again without a badge.  But I wasn't too worried, because I was going to stay right in the division area where everyone knew me, and I knew someone would escort me to the door when I left.  The division area was in a big room like the fellowship hall at church, almost empty except for a long table where everyone was sitting.  I was talking to Norma Grimson about how much I missed working there, and I half jokingly asked her about some specifics about what systems had been broken, etc.  She wasn't sure whether it would be all right to tell me or not-but I was free to walk around in the office and look at everything that was out.  At one point Kathy Reynault walked by.  I don't know whether she saw me or not.  When I finished talking to Norma, I wanted to see Joey Brownell and his section.  They were around a corner and out of sight.  On the way, I saw Marvin Martinalle.  He stopped and asked me to do something involving a responsibility.  From there I went outside.  The building was right on the street, and near the corner was a car which Judson Schinn and someone else from high school days were getting into.  It may have been Ronnie Engles or one of the Cunninghams.  They hadn't changed a bit.  Judson was the last to get in, and hardly seemed surprised at all to see me when I came running up.  I wanted to go with them, but the car was full already.
