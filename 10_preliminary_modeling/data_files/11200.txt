There were three men in our recreation room whom I recognized but could not remember when I woke up. I went down the stairs and was greeted by a burst of pistol fire. Three slugs ripped the lower right part of my stomach. I was wiping the blood on my shirt as I walked back up the stairs. I then seem to remember being with a dog who was in a similar condition. It seemed very realistic, and I was in great pain until I woke up feeling my right side and was relieved when I found myself in good shape.
