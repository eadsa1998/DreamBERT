It was spring break and I was back in Washington D.C. This time, though, everyone from Suffolk was there. A whole group of us went to the Irish bar together. At the end of the night, I looked around and everyone was gone. So, I started to run back to the hotel. It seemed like the faster I tried to run, the slower I was. When I finally got to the hotel (which looked dark and scary) everyone was packed and ready for the drive back home. I started to panic and ran up a bunch of stairs to get back to the room and pack really quick. I woke up!
