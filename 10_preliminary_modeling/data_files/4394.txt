["My dream program isn't ready."] I am working on my usual DreamLinking, outside on the lawn, and realize that it is nearly time to make a presentation for the high school students. I quickly try to pack up the laptop, the modem, the printer to carry with me. I realize that I should have spent more time in making the presentation simple and easy to follow and use. I get to the high school. They are hurriedly moving things out of the way so I can use the room. I am trying to set up the equipment as the students are sitting there waiting for me. I ask them to move the projection screen to the side so I can see the projected screen from my dream program on the blackboard. After trying to get things organized, I am told I need to move the class to another room. So (I pack it up and we walk down the hall. A man says there's a problem. All the stuff we packed away for her to be able to use the other room is now on the ramp. I then see a dark narrow staircase going steeply down. I have to walk down these crowded stairs.
