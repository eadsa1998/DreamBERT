I am maybe in a hospital setting. There are helpless, newborn babies being badly taken care of. Michael J. Fox grabs my hand and pulls me, running through the corridors. I am concerned because I am hooked up to the babies and our running is pulling out their life support system and causing them pain and then death. I feel I must do something. It is suggested that I talk with the top authority, Governor Goldsmith. I waver and think, "Oh, I'll just mention it to some local person. The message comes clearly! "DO NOT WAVER! Go to the top. Top priority! You must save the babies because horrible things are being done to them! They are used for experiments. Pieces are taken out of them before they are dead and people say they can't feel pain but they can! You must help them!" I must help them! Also a naked man was in the bed next to me. [BL]
