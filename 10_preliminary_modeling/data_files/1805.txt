Jake visits and brings me a birthday present for Fluffy. It is a fake fur blanket with her paw prints cut out of the fur, four of them in a row, and some applique things on it. Valerie had knitted some lacy edging. It was a nice light brown color. I find it hanging up on my door as I come into my room. Then Jake and I and some guy are going to take a big heavy machine to T City. We try to load it into the back of our red vehicle. It's too long. We think this is too hard and then suddenly the solution comes to me. Just fold it up upon itself and there will be room. It fits easily.
