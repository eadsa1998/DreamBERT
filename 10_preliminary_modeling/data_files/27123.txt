Two friends were visiting me in my home. One was J--, a very close friend of mine here at school. The other was one of two people. Both of these girls are friends of mine. It was time for us to catch the bus to return to school. We were in a very great hurry and I did not have time to pack so J-- packed for me. My father and his wife (my mother and father are dlvorced and my father is married again. I live with my mother but I am on very good terms with my father.) took us to the bus station which, although we were at home, seemed to be the one here in C--. My father opened the trunk of the car to get the suitcases but they were not there. He had left them at the hotel in which he had lived for a short time after my parents were divorced. Dad and I went to the hotel to get them leaving the others at the bus station. We arrived at the hotel but it seemed a very long time before we left because my father's wife kept delaying us. We finally left the hotel but Dad took a very long way to the station and drove very slowly. I urged him to drive faster so I wouldn't miss the bus but he would not. He flnally arrived and there at the station saw my father's secretary waving the bus tlckets in her hand. We had missed the bus. I turned to my father and asked him to please not bring H-- (his wife) with him any more when I had to catch a bus. I then opened my suitcase to see what J--  had packed for me and saw my pink blouse lying on top with a button off.
