I catch a gang leader, a thug. There's four of us. We pick him up, one limb each and carry him kicking and swearing off a football pitch in front of his friends. We take him to a wood and dig a hole about 5ft deep. We tie his hands and legs and put him in the hole. We then back fill the hole until just his head pokes out. For some reason I hate this man. I don't know him and I don't know what he's done - but it is something terrible - something that makes me want to kick him to death, but I refrain from doing that for now. Instead we dress him up as a puppet by attaching puppet clothes below his chin, so that it looks like he's only got a tiny body and a large head. We make him look like Judy from Punch and Judy. We even paint rosy red cheeks on him and smear some lipstick on him, and put a little maid's hat on his head. We play a cheerful jig and make the arms and legs of the puppet dance.
