I was in our cellar at home with a former instructor. We were debating about what would be the best procedure to go about getting a stuffed water drain cleaned. I was sitting on the washing machine in my nurse's uniform smoking, and she was on her hands and knees inspecting the drain. After a few minutes my father walked into the room and I introduced him to my former instructor. He was very rude when she asked him if he would get the drain cleaned. I stood next to her and whispered to my father that he should be nicer. The instructor in this dream appeared actually as she is, and she is about 35 years of age.
