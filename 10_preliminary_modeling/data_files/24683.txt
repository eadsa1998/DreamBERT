The way I remember my dream is: I was in the gym (I had already been checked in), sitting at a table. There would be one stool between every person. In really life, I took three sets of tests. The first was an English, then mathematics, and last another English. However, in my dream I was already on the last test, although this time the teachers were more organized because in real life I signed up for a math test but I got two writing and one math instead. In my dream I took two math and one English/Writing. Then the dream ended in my mind. Setting: It took place in a really big gym when I had just taken a 2/1 test. Characters: There were a ton of people who had been there before, plus I know two boys, David and Roger. Then there was three teachers who were explaining the test. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, anxious. I thought my dream was very interesting. Plus, I thought that seens (sic?) I had just taken a test at this place, and here I was taking another.
