I was walking on E--- at W--- Park at night. I had on my bridesmaid dress (which I wore at the wedding of my sister). Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do.... Then I was in a designers shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was....
