We are in a strange city where there is a Memorial service for a little girl who has died; Frank is there. He looks like a bum, unshaven with a gray beard. I am very embarrassed, also because he talks too loud and makes inappropriate remarks to the minister. Later Frank tells the minister that his father was a Baptist preacher I keep apologizing.
