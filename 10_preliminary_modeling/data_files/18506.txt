The picnic was really an individual annihilation of a group of 30-40 feet tall female creatures. They were all very strong like super heroes and I was near 40 feet tall too but I had to fend for myself. I had no special powers. The individual annihilation had to do with available energy consumption and natural selection. Only the fittest could survive and we knew it was a fight to the death. There was not enough air on earth to breathe. The very, very tall women creatures would lean over until a tidal wave started and it was KILL OR BE KILLED. It was scary to be fighting over the air (that) I was hoping to breathe. Some of the creatures knew instinctively that the next tidal wave was their last and they were asking if (there were) any questions. There was a sand bar way out in the ocean and in between tidal waves the ocean only came up to some(one)'s ankles. The wave was coming. It was time to hold your breath and hope for the best.
