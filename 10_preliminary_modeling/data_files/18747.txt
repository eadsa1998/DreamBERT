I was at the high school. I wanted some coffee. I was behind the counter. I wasn't suppose to go there. It was partly like a diner too. It was the teacher's lounge. I snuck back there--there were 3 large coffee pots--all full of fresh brewed coffee. But just then a guy in charge came. I was sitting in the front with some girl friends. I didn't know them. I was trying on team softball shirts. They had slanted bold writing. I tried one on and I couldn't get it off back over my head. It was stuck and I couldn't see. The girls were now lounging provocatively. By the time I got the shirt off all the coffee was gone. I put on some more water and went to the bathroom. The teacher's aide stuck his hand through the window--giving me a tea bag, a pack of creamer and a pack of sweet 'n' low. "I've already cleaned out the coffee filters and turned the machines off," he said. I slapped the tea bag flying out of the window sill and said, "GODDAMNIT!" The principal was how making an announcement over the intercom. He said, "Please bring your old shoes, stools and coats to school tomorrow." He was suppose to tell about the thrift store exchange project--but the way he said it, nobody knew what he was talking about.
