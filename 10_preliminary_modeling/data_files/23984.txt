From what I remember about my dream, it began in my dance classroom in my current class. The people there did not have distinguishable faces, but they seemed to be professional producers and directors. The next thing I knew, I was in a vacant parking lot, and there were two men standing at the opposite end from me. One was tall, the other short. I don't remember their faces. Suddenly I was being chased by one of the men. I remember thinking that it was just part of the play; we were just acting. The odd thing was, however, I did not know the script or the lines or plot. I didn't know why this man was chasing me, but I was scared, and was hoping that the director would yell, "cut!" But the call never came, and suddenly this play that I was in was truly real. At this point I was on the beach. There were lots of people around, but no one would help me. The sand was difficult to run in. My feet kept on getting buried in the sand. I could barely move, and I could sense that my pursuers were getting closer. I saw my little dog, and my neighbor's golden retriever running in the waves, and a wave fell over my dog, and suddenly both my younger sister and dog were being carried out to sea. I guess I somehow rescued them, but then the waves were getting high and I couldn't move away from them because the sand was trapping my feet. I do not remember what happened after that. I'm sure more, but it is very vague.
