I had a lot of dreams last night, about science class, oddly enough. The first was that Mr. Frank was my teacher and he had had another son and wanted me to go change its diaper. So Alexis and I brought him to the bathroom to change him. Right before we were leaving, though, I thought Alexis was holding onto him, so I let go and he fell, hit his head, and passed out. It was horrible. Then my final project for science was to do research on Jennifer Lopez, and present her success in terms of biology to a committee who wanted to figure out how to better market her. Anyway, I had forgotten my workbook, so I wasn't able to do that. Then Ross, from Friends, was my teacher, and he was leaving. I had had a crush on him or something, because I was really sad. He rocked me in his arms for a long time, and then left. I wrote his email address down from the board Later, I found out he had slept with some girl, so I told her that the other night, he had slept with another one of his students, so she got upset. Then I had a dream that I had to protect Annakin Skywalker and Padme before their wedding. It was really horrible because people kept shooting them, and I was usually in the way. Then I turned into Flounder from The Little Mermaid and I was paid $5000 to persuade an alligator to ambush the wedding.
