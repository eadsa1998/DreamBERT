I am at a FOOTBALL STADIUM and sit where I can see the field and get really involved in the game. Before the game I sit down to eat with friends at a table overlooking the field. I order "Wiener Schnitzl." A young Mexican woman leads me to my seat, and permits me to take a second helping of the "Wiener Schnitzl." I am proud that I resisted taking seconds on potatoes and fattening foods. Then the young woman leads me through corridors to my seat located in a TRIANGULAR BOX. But while I eat I hear cheers from below: "Rah for EMMA, she is such a great friend." I feel good about that, but cannot see the game from the triangular box. I end up riding a STREETCAR and sit next to the driver. I feel the warm WIND on my face as we drive along the river road. Then it gets too cold, so I go inside. I talk to a young man from the Book Cafe, but am interrupted by Frank. - shift: I am watching divers from a very high board. I lie on my stomach on a very high board and say, "I think I could dive from here, if I lie here long enough!"
