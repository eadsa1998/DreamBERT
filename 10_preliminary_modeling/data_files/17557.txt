I was taking a computer class and still hadn't done my homework.  The second assignment was due and I hadn't even done the first.  I was going to go home to work on it but it was 6:15 and I couldn't get to the base of campus in time.  I was going to take a shower in the kitchen but my housemate Andre got in first.  Later on, I still couldn't turn my homework in.  Another family emergency- they were going to execute my mother.  I cried, and she told me not to; she accepted her death.  I felt young.  I would stop crying for a while, and then cried some more.  Finally she decided to fight it.  She called and told me to tell them the authorities that she was a witch.  That would make them have to research and postpone the execution, at least.
