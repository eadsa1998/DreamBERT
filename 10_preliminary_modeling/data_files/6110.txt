Tuesday night, 2/1/93 I went to surprise Rob at the studio. I got there and I couldn't find him. I was asking around and no one knew where he was. I was in a hallway in my house upstairs only on a larger scale. All of a sudden Rob comes out of the bathroom in the doorway and says, "I don't want to see you anymore." I was in shock because it was very sudden. I was relieved in a very small way but mad at the fact that he didn't seem a bit remorseful. I felt stupid like, "How dare he dump me?" I was mad at myself. When he came out of the bathroom he was holding a razor and his mustache and beard were gone. He had shaved them off while he was in the bathroom.
