There was a hot pink limousine. These weren't the right ones--it was suppose to be a lavender limousine. I had gotten a scholarship to go back to the art school I went to in Florida. When I got there, only 2 years had passed since I left. But for me the regular amount of time had passed. I knew Dora had been killed. When a girl I'd known at school, but had forgotten her name, told me the armature on my desk was Laurie's my eyes were blind. I thought she said "Dora" and I couldn't move. I thought she'd said, "How's Dora?" Armature ??? and little art mannequin were not tall enough, but it was to make a sculpture of William. The head to make was a tea cup. I want to ??? Writing the 212 then but We weren't sure what ??? We were going to the art school. Me and William and Alicia were working on a Christmas installation. Jeffery had a young baby falcon on a leash with a little halter. It was a very young bird and had already tried to fly away. Alicia had a little puppy dog. We were all sitting on a ledge about to start the installation. An ice skater was working out choreography. A catchy in and out step that made you want to be a good ice skater. William was installing neon lights to make a shadow of the ice in colors. I was suppose to work on a mural design. The first was partly up there. We looked at it. It had snowmen on it. Then William asked me to do one and I did chaotic Christmas lights strung on nothing. Jeffery said the clocks with the snowmen were just inviting surrealism speculation and that was asking for trouble. But he wasn't crazy about the disheveled Christmas lights so we sat on the ledge thinking--knowing we would KNOW when it was right.
