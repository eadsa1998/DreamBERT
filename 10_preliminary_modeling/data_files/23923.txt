I was returning to school. I didn't know who my roomate was going to be. I picked up the keys to my room which had a little orange cone attached to it with a room number. I went out the first night. I don't know with who but I hadn't gone to my room yet. I had my period and remember carrying around a HUGE bag of tampons with me trying to hide them under my shirt. I went to go see Briar S. who was a freshman. She lived in a dorm that had been completely re-done. There were no rooms just long corridors of beds. I went to go and try to find my room but I had lost the orange cone. For some reason no one was able to help me find my room. I tried everything (looking at the billboards on each floor for my name, asking RA's). I called the operator and it was some Indian guy who couldn't really speak English. I was so frustrated. I tried to read the number on my key but it was too dark. Finally, some women said, "Oh you're in Room 8165. Your beautiful apartment is on the very corner of the far wing. We hope you enjoy it. People have been very happy there." She led me to the room. I went inside and there were 2 girls there. I collapsed on the floor saying "Thank God I finally made it". It kind've felt like freshman year - meeting the new roomates. There were 3 beds in a row. The place was already decorated in pastel flowers and the ceiling was a light mint green. Yuck. It looked like a hotel room. Apparently the 2 outside beds were already claimed so I had the smushed up one in the middle. Yuck. The girls said they already knew each other and I could tell from their style of dress that they were very different from me. [Briar S. = an acquaintence]
