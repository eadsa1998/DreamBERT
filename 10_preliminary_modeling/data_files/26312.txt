 I'm in a church. My dad and grandpa and grandma Redding show up. I notice grandma, and hug her to greet her. My mom and my brother Wally are there. We walk from the main church area to the back trough a mundane, secular area with stairs and some day care items. There are several attractive young women on my right as I walk by. My family starts to rearrange the day care area into church pews for the mass. Toy and bookshelves fold in such a way as to form pews. There is a young man next to me who says he wants to play cards with the family and I. I say after the mass that will be fine with me if the others want to play.
