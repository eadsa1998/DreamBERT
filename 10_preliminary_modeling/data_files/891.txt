I had another dream but had trouble waking up. I remembered thinking, "Forget it, I don't want to remember this one." I repeated that and then realized that it must be important. I sat up to write it down and it was gone. A "to hell with it" kind of feeling-tone, like with the light switch. The name Roger and a feeling about movement, avalanches.
