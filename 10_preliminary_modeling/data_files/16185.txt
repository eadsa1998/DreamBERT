I was in school and I was in the Media Center, and the elevator was doing cuckoo stuff. And I lost my book. And I dreamt that this Spanish teacher gave me a set of tapes and told me to do like 9-12 or something, and I took them home and I started doing them and stuff, and then we were supposed to go ice skating with Abby and Porter. It was like everybody was supposed to put out ice on their sidewalk so that we could ice skate from here to Disneyland. [laugh] And then we realized when we were out there, we realized there wasn't enough ice. So I went home and I was just going to dance. And I dreamt that Dad was still working, and he was going to have a few days on my vacation when he worked. And I was getting ready for this party, I think, and nothing was going right [ended abruptly].
