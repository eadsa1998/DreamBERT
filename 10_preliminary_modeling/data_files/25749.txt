 I'm at the dentist. My appointment seems to be in rush. Either the dentist or I don't have much time. It may be the end of the day, a last minute appointment. The dentist is a young blond man, and there is a woman assistant there. They tell me I have teeth problems. I have a lot of plaque, cavities, early gingivitis, etc. They talk about horizontal lines on my teeth that can be felt with a finger if they are clean. I try to feel these lines. I am shocked to hear this because I think I brush my teeth a lot: morning always, night nearly always, and sometimes during the day as well. I floss a couple times a week as well, I say, though actually I know I don't floss this much. I brush my teeth there and spit into the chair. I wipe up the toothpaste spit, and spit the rest into the sink.
