[1997-06-23] I was on a farm, it was springtime, there was a warm breeze blowing on my face, the sun was shining, I could feel it on my eyes and on my shoulders. I was riding a horse. The horse had that thick mane, that you could touch, with that hair that is sometimes on the coarse side. It had that very strong scent that horses have, you could smell the pungent hay as well and I was also inhaling the fresh warm air as I rode on this horse on this farm, and I was feeling relaxed and happy because I had nothing to worry about.
