I hardly remember anything so I'll just write about the bits I do remember. I remember looking for something and going up a hill to look for it and sliding back down it and slamming into a wall. I remember many houses along a street and the kids in the houses were falling in love with each other and sneaking through woods to see each other. I also remember a man who had been tricked into getting really mad, and while the town was in a circle having some kind of meeting, he lassoed them. And then he was never forgiven what he did. I think the person who tricked him was a woman. Soon the dream made more sense. I was racing through the woods with my younger sister and a whole bunch of other kids. Suddenly, I started moving my legs weirdly and I started to fly. Soon I had a balloon in one hand, my sister's hand in the other, two books under my arms, and I was flying above the treetops. I did not win the race but I did learn how to fly. When I got there, there was an adult who was surprised that I could lift off the ground with only two balloons (my sister was holding one). I also remember a poor family that lived in a big house that came from a warmer north. Setting: In the country with lots of woods and a lake nearby. Characters: There was the person I was searching with, the mad man, the tricky woman, the townspeople, the other kids, my little sister, the lady with balloons, and the people from the north. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, excited. (Angry) when I ran into the wall and the man was being treated badly. I also felt excited when I started to fly.
