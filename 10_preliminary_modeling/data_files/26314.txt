 I'm at a desk in a bedroom next to a computer lab. I have a $5 and $10 bill. The door to the bedroom is open a few inches. In the hallway there is a computer/slot machine with a screen saver on it that has two words that read, "Win Big", or something similar. I take the $10 bill to go gamble. I hear soft noise in the next room, which is my sister Ramona's room. I hurriedly go back to my room. It's 4:30am. I was going to gamble before I went to sleep. Ramona has awakened. I may talk to her.
