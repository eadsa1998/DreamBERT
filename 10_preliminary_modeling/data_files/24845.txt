We went to a restaurant like we always do on Sundays with my parents. Then Mrs. H. came up to me and told me and Courtney that I needed to get measured for the wedding. She said Alessandra, Monique de Brian would measure us. Monique had this weird measuring device like a stick that she put over Courtney's chest. Then Monique was hitting a ball with a piece of metal from her sword. I tried doing that by throwing it but I couldn't. Then Saul made me bend my knees and make sure my arm was above my lets. Then I threw the rock really far into a pile of rocks. Then I was walking down a big mossy step to this guy I knew from somewhere. Then I talked with Courtney and Melissa about my school. I was visiting there and Linda came up to me. I had to tell R. than you for something. Then Courtney said that she didn't want to go to my school because the female admissions director had been mean to her. Then the scene played again, and I saw what happened: It was strange. The I went to Burlingame Avenue with 2 people from my school, and went into a gourmet food store that sold Margaritas. The other stores didn't, even though they had displays up telling people they did. Then the crackers started bouncing up and down in a strange order. I wanted the garlic and cheese ones. Monique said she had been fencing since she was 3, then 2 1/2. While she was measuring me, Jacob, and Patty, his wife, gave us a (illegible) about something confusing but it was supposed to be about love. Setting: school, I am applying to. At a gourmet food store. Strange building. Funny building. Characters: Monique de Brian is a really excellent World Cup fencer. Jacob is my teacher. The admissions director from school - who is actually a man. The boy - a kid from church. Lorna, a 9th grader. Courtney &amp; Melissa, school friends. Feelings and Thoughts: (blank)
