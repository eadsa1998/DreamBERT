It took place 10 days ago, but it was about my fifth grade class. We had taken a field trip to my grandfather's house for some reason, only it was at San Diego, not San Jose. Anyway, when the tour was over (I don't remember the tour) me and my girlfriend went to go eat ice cream. Mine was bubblegum. I hate that flavor. Then she disappeared with her father in a blue plane. I looked all around, but no one was around me. I was afraid that no one would come back for me. Then a huge swarm of butterflies and bees attacked me. I screamed in my dream, but my dad woke me up and said it was time for school.
