Driving a Model T car with Reynaldo AND Amy; I am able to maneuver it even in traffic. I go through a STOP sign and barely miss a car coming at me from the right. - shift: I hear that President REAGAN is to visit our city; I see an official gov't car parked in front of our house; I am late. I go upstairs to change my clothes; the room is very messy; I am embarrassed as my therapist is there waiting for me to finish changing my clothes; finally we go to my office.
