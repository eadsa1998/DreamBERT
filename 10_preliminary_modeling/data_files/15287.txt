I was in India or something. The father of some girl I befriended was in this hut and gave wishes. There was a queue, and she was before me. She asked for marijuana and he put his head down and didn't answer. I requested 'gay marriage and legalization of marijuana'. Mom was watching something at the old house on TV -- Rico (Six Feet Under) was talking to a black woman at a bench near the ocean. Ezra wanted to know what we were watching "Six Feet Under" and he said "oh, you watched Psycho". There were waves in the show and a voice said "Florida". Laer I went to a job interview at 9.30am. I was stopped at the traffic lights and a car hit me from behind. Someone got out and apologized but it only left a small dent and I said 'don't worry about it'. I got to the place I was going and went in and all the doors led to this classroom lab type of thing. I asked a guy how to get out and there was a floor 'wedge'. They climbed up this thing on the wall and then walked out the door. It led onto a balcony with stairs. There were some magazines from 1999 with Angelina Jolie on the cover.
