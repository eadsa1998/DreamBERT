 There is a young woman and a young man in a house. A mutual friend of theirs, a man, has died. The woman and man are in an intimate relationship. She has blond hair, and is very annoying. I may be the man. She wants some of the dead man's belongings. I say no, and hold her back, telling her to let it go. I want to end the relationship, I want the man to end the relationship. The woman is an annoying pest. There is something in an upstairs office or bedroom that she wants.
