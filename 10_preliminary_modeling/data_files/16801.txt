I dreamt that I was Jan Brady. We were all just moving in to the Brady house. I wandered through the house looking for the room I wanted. I found the stairway to the attic. It was a bit dusty and dirty up there and there wasn't any carpeting, but I liked it. It was a nice big private space. There was a very comfortable bed in one corner. I laid down on it and I knew that I absolutely had to have the attic for my room. Carol and Mike Brady were calling for me. They found me as I was walking down the attic stairs. I told them that I wanted to live in the attic. Carol said, "I don't know, Jan. I don't think that's such a good idea." I climbed back up the stairs and Mike and Carol followed me. I sat down on the bed and said, "I love it up here. I'm an artist. I need space. I don't want to share a room with Marcia and Cindy. I have to have this room." Mike told me that he didn't think it was safe for me up there and that there might be all kinds of creepy crawly bugs. I told him that I have spent lots of time camping out and that I didn't mind the bugs. He said, "OK. You can live up here once I fix some of the floor boards and get some carpeting down." I was ecstatic. Mike and Carol went downstairs. Marcia came up and told me that she felt that she should have the attic since she was the oldest. I told her "No way. It's mine, but if it's that big of a deal to you I wouldn't mind sharing it with Cindy and you can have the downstairs room all to yourself." I felt kind of guilty, like I was being greedy wanting my own room when the three Brady boys all had to share a room.
