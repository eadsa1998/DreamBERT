I was out somewhere at night. A Mr Whippy type of thing pulled up and a bunch of us were lining up. He looked like AJ Bowen in The Signal and he never gave change, so you either had to give him the exact amount or give him a bit more. It was implied that this was a scam. I pulled out my wallet and pulled out a $50 note, then $20, then $10, then $5, before realising I had tons of change. The ice-cream was $3.35 or something, so I gave him the exact amount. He seemed angry and gave me a messy ice-cream - instead of soft serve, just squished it in. I complained and he did it again, but still messed it up. He got increasingly angry and violent and messy making my ice-cream and I continued to yell that he wasn't doing it right. I wanted one with chocolate sauce and nuts, and he would either forget one, or just dump it on etc. Eventually, he made it properly and I went off to enjoy it.
