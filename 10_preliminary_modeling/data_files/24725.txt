Well, I remember very little this time. I remember a butterfly sitting on the ground in front of our shower, and I think we took of its wings and put them on the shower wall. Somehow I think it turned into a person, because later this guy said, "Where can I change?" or "Is there a good place to change?" I was in a big group so I don't really know the details. Setting: I think it was either in a hotel room or at somebody's house. Characters: The people in the big group I didn't know. I didn't know the butterfly/guy either. I didn't know anybody! Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. Well, I was happy the whole time, except when the guy wanted his wings back, then I was worried for him.
