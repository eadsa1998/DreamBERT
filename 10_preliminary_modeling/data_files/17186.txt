A field trip in Mrs. Drager's 3rd grade class to an army base.  It wasn't a field trip at first.  I had gone up to someone's dorm to see about something.  I left one room on crutches.  Just before leaving the building, I asked someone if my online friend Joe Grim was still there.  The guy said he was in the blocks.  I asked the teacher then if I could go visit.  I was allowed, and got in line to go into the area.  Long line.  I was not allowed in because I'd left my purse and ID with the group.  I begged not to have to go back.  I didn't have time to wait in line again.  I didn't get in.  I went back to the class and sat down in a movie theatre on the left of the teacher, who was not Mrs. Drager anymore, but my university core teacher Sylvia Roan.  I told her I didn't want to sit on her hair, which was lying across the seat, so I moved it.
