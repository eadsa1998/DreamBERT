Walking beside a narrow lagoon (perhaps 20 or 40 feet wide) with Mary, Faye and 2 older people, one of them possibly my mother. The water was musky, but this, I explained, was not because of mud or silt, but was caused by the presence of a minute organism (a fungus, I think). Faye was crowding me almost into the water and I pushed her rather roughly to save myself from wet feet. Farther along the water became clear, with numerous, rounded stone-like objects on bottom -- these apparently something of the nature of coral.
