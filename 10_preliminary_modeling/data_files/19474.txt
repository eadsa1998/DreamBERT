Two young men were talking with me. They planned to take over the Drake Co., an entomological supply house, one important function of which was to answer questions on the control of injurious insects. Having in mind the failure of the similar Pierce-Gage project, I gave it as my opinion that such a venture probably would not succeed. The boy with the large face and tanned skin seemed to dominate the other. They tentatively planned to locate near Washington, D.C. in order to be near large reference libraries -- to find answers to their correspondent's questions (a mail order business). Gave me about a dozen cards (possibly business cards) of which all but one were same kind.
