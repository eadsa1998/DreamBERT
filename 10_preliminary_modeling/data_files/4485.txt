["Saving Judith from a bad fall."] I am in my wheelchair and traveling sown a road and across a long bridge in a big city. I am looking for the way to get back on the freeway. I keep getting lost. I come to a "T" intersection and turn left. I go a few blocks and then realize I might be going the wrong way. I turn and retrace my steps. Now I am going up an on ramp to a long bridge. Dora and Judith are with me now. We decide to race. Now the on ramp is a steep incline and is enclosed. We go fast, laughing. Judith is in a manual chair and nearly beating me. I go faster and get ahead. Then I am stopped by a wall with window blinds on it. I am disappointed because I lost my lead as we are all stopped there. I push a button on the side wall and a blind raises. But there's another one there. I push the button again and this keeps happening. Finally the last one is raised. Judith rushes to get through first but then falls, I grab her foot and she is suddenly dangling over a long drop. I hang on tight and slowly pull her up. It is difficult. She turns and I get a grip on her leg and she climbs with my help to safety. Her chair had fallen. I look down and am shocked to see how long a drop it is. I offer her a ride on the back of my wheelchair. Dora is now walking with a stroller to push. We coordinate how we are going to return down the incline and find another way to our destination.
