I call L. (college friend). Ask her about getting me an apartment as I am taking trip back to B. City. Arrive to find big mess. Many paintings helter skelter and L. brings down some art treasures. I ask about our upstairs neighbor but he is away skiing. I want to stay so badly but must return to U. Town. I find a nasty landlady who read part of my letter about my upstairs neighbor. I make up a story to satisfy her. Scared and mad.
