I was at a school. There were two schools there and the other one got angry at ours for some reason and they started fighting. People had knives and people were dying. I hid in a toilet and there was a hole in the wall and I snuck out. Everyone came around the corner but I didn't know who was who. A friend of Eugene's was dead. I said there was an island we could go to to hide. This guy threatened us with a knife and we put our hands up and watched him but he just left. To get to this island, we first had to go to this small island which had a river thing with a waterfall and a house. We sat in a boat and were sprayed with water which would teleport us. At some point, I had a son and a husband but I chose to get rid of them to be with Eugene.
