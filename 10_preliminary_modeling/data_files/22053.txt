I remember I dream about the best friend of the girl I love. We were laughing and having fun. We were in the living room at her home. I say goodbye. I tell her that I'll call when I get home. When I get home, I phone her. She answers. Suddenly her younger sister hangs up. I call again and a male friend answers and tells me she has gone out to buy chocolates. I hang up, furious.
