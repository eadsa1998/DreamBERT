I am in this huge arena and it is packed with people. I am at the very top of the arena and I start walking down the aisle. As I get to the center, I realize that there is a concert going on. It is very crowded, I realize that the group is New Kids on the Block. They all looked so cute and I was so excited to be there. Then Joe from the band saw me and smiled. I was so happy. Then he pointed at me and walked down the stage stairs and took my hand. That's all I remember.
