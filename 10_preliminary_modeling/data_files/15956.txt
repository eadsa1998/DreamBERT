I was at home and my room was bigger and didn't have much in it. I noticed some ants in the corner and I left briefly and came back and there were more. There was also another part of the floor that had started gathering them too. I called out to Mom and said there were lots of ants in my room and she said she'd have a look later. I said they were getting bigger but she didn't seem to care. I threw a sock and it landed in a corner where a group of them were and they started going frantic and spreading out further across the room. I ran out of the room but looked closely and realised they weren't ants but hairy spiders. I yelled to Mom saying they were "hairy jumping spiders". Spaceman was near my room and I shooed him away. Then Rover was lying on my floor and I made him come out. Mom said she thought they were dangerous but still didn't come to help. They began pouring out of my room and into the hallway. I was freaking out and screaming at them to do something. Darren calmly walked out and said he was waiting for them to go 'up' and I realised he was going to go under the house. They had started filling up my room vertically as well. I was worried they would ruin all my stuff.
