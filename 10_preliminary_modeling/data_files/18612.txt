Keith had gotten a job working graveyard shift for Bryan Hunt. Bryan had assistants 24-hours and I was there just hanging around a little. It was over for me. I was just showing Keith the automatic doors. Keith was having a delayed reaction, at age 39 from when his father died when he was 12. He had 2 drinks and threw up. Then he asked for a beer by name. It was a quart of beer in a bottle with a handle. The beer also settled your stomach. Keith said he wasn't sure this job was going to work out because he had too much time to think. He sat on the floor against the wall thinking and drinking beer. It was the end of the world and people were trying to escape. I knew the only way for me to get through the gate was with a little red wagon. I was pulling little kids in there and we got in just before the gate clanked down. Then I saw the tennis courts and I wanted to play. Tennis was what I wanted to be doing. And then Dora was playing Chopin and she told me some things to help. But the children were still in the little red wagon. My cousin, Deb, came and she was going to have a rough time. She didn't have music and she was nervous. The man at the gate where I pulled the kids through thought I was the teacher for the kids at this gifted and talented school. I let him think that but I knew I was one of the kids just taller. We got in and I wanted to play Mozart and a girl offered to show me the hard parts. She went down the hill with her Mother and the piano was in a warehouse where construction was going on. You could hear the Mozart with the hum of machinery and the bang, bang, bang of hammering and the clink of big iron bars. The girl and her mother never came back up the hill.
