 I'm with others. We are finding a place to set up two tents. The land is steeply sloping. The old tow driver for a competitor of Fishing Haven is there. My friends Stephen Ramos and Emerald Reinhold are there. There is a big building. We move to flat ground. The carpentry is good: wood and twisting stairs. There is an attic. I go up and look in the attic. It is not good for sleeping or being in because tables and chairs are taking up the space.
