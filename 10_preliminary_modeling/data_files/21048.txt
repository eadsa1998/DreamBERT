There was an atomic explosion. We ran under cover of some rocks. The rocks came down on our passage after the explosion and blocked us under the rocks, but there was enough air coming in. I used the butt of my gun and got out. I saw Sam squirting water into the air. I was on top of the hill and I saw the horizon lit up and when I looked, there was coke ovens in Fairchance and homes were on fire in Rivertown, PA.
