["Hector's Mother."] I wake up the next morning and go to the kitchen where Hector's mother is cleaning up. I look out a big window and see a large river running right by the apartment. It is flooding and overflowing its banks. I am talking with his mother about how nice and spacious the kitchen is. This is obviously her pride and joy. I look down and see that the river has risen up so much that it is flooding the kitchen and I am standing thigh deep in the water. I am surprised it isn't cold and then I realize that I'd been standing in it for hours and have grown used to it. Now Hector's mother and I go for a walk up some stairs. The apartment is in the same building as this small city. I see "Jose" who sort of is an older Hector, but is sort of a younger Hector's father. We chat. Hector's brother's are there, doing business in the city. They wear nice business suits.
