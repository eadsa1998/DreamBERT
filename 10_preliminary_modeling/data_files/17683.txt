I dreamt about going to my new apartment last night.  Of course it looked nothing like my apartment will look.  Entering the building, there was a little curtained off area from the lobby.  That was the entrance to my apartment.  There were several people with me, probably my boyfriend Jeremy and my mother.  For some reason I decided to take a bath.  I left the sliding glass door open, but closed the two sheer curtains.  I climbed the steps and got into the tub.  I don't remember what happened then. I looked behind me towards the rest of the apartment, but I think I saw outside.  Something about people playing ball?  For some reason Weird Al comes to my mind.  Then I followed a fence back and there were doors, like a labyrinth.  I think I was trying to beat someone to the end or avoid them, because I stopped using the doors and started climbing over the top of the gates.  At the end was a dirt clearing with a ball or something in it.  Then I think I was at an ice cream parlor with a group of friends.  I was on my period and started leaking so I went and sat in the car.  It seemed like it was supposed to be a birthday celebration for me, but I was very antisocial.  I left the group and drove home.  I was going to go take a shower, and then decided I'd better lock the doors so my friends wouldn't come following into the apartment.
