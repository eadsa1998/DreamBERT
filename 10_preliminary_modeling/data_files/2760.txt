There's a room full of men who are mindlessly having sex with one another, sort of a sadistic kind of thing. One of them bites me on the ankle and the skin blows up like a transparent balloon and will explode if I'm not careful. I look to where they bite at the back of the ankle and see a dark purple fill up the skin and then the balloon rise of the transparent skin. This is supposedly very sexual, but I don't feel sexual excitement.
