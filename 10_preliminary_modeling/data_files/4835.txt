I am in a square bus. Men keep coming in. Gaston sits across from me. He acts silly. I keep trying to keep these men out but they keep coming back in. I feel scared of them. They mean me harm. I ask the bus driver to help me, but he's one of them. I realize they are aliens in human form. I am very afraid. I try to escape them. They follow me out of the bus. They are surrounding me. I feel terror. I wake up, afraid. Nightmare.
