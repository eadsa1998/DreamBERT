It's a very vivid dream, very distinct, with many lights and many colors. It's a parade at the time of Fascist Italy and the Duce himself is at the head of the parade, proudly marching, his look straight, his forehead is high; his uniform is yellow with black and very shining boots and straps. What calls my attention the most is his totally bald head which shines brightly from the sun's reflection.
