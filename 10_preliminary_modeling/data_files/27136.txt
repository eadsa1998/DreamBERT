Two girls, one a close friend and the other an acquaintance, and I decided to go to Florida. Both of them are my age. When we arrived, the close friend insisted on going to a very expensive hotel where we paid in advance. Then we discovered we had only $11 left between us. I was furious with the girl for putting us in such a spot.
