Ann and I came home at night. I hooked up the water pipes and ran water thru the hose off the dresser. Then I shut it off and went for the kitchen door to see that it was locked. I was walking thru deep snow about 6 inches and Carter was walking. I said, "Did you play Mucho Mas?" and he said he played him $5 across the board. It was supposed to be a Nash horse. We walked across the border from Canada to USA and Eleanor Roosevelt was standing on the USA side and watched us come to our homeland. I got change from a colored man. He gave me about 8 pennies and two of them were Indian head pennies.
