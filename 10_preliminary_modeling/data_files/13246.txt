Mom dropped me off on Casserley Ave a few houses from Eugene's, on the other side of the road. I started walking and heard Eugene and Rodney leaving the house. I realized I'd forgotten my jumper and it was on the top of the car. I grabbed it. They got in their car and I was walking in front of them. I was worried about Eugene seeing my 'fat'. Then they passed me, but they were on bikes. Eugene turned around and looked at me. He turned back but then looked at me again and almost fell off his bike. I was then at school. I went to the toilets and then left and was walking home.
