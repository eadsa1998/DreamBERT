 The Combs family lives in the red house on Home Avenue on the block north of home on the west side of the road. I come to the house a lot to visit my friend Tiny Combs. His parents don't like that I come. There are two entrances in the front of the house: one on the second floor, and one right below it. I go to visit Tiny. It's winter. There is much snow on the ground, with 4-6 inches of fresh powder. There is a long black metal bridge that is on or over the sidewalk to the lower entrance to the house. This bridge is a plow that removes snow from the sidewalk, silently spinning and sweeping the snow away. When I arrive the bridge is spinning to clear the path of snow. This is a clandestine plow, something that happens in secret, like for Tiny to let me in without his parents knowing. I'm wearing a winter parka with a big furry Eskimo-like hood. I pull the hood up as I approach the door so snow doesn't go in my face. Tiny's parents know I'm coming. They may see or hear me. Tiny's father comes out and yells at me in a frustrated manner, "Get out of here; just get out of here!!!" I take off running. They think I'm a prowler or a burglar that is nagging them, since I visited yesterday too. I run down the sidewalk going north. I turn left into the alley. I run past a vehicle in the alley near Andy Jones' house. There is a woman and dog standing outside the vehicle, which may be a mini van. I run to the next block into the short alley again, and turn left onto the long alley, going near Booker's back door. There are several feet of crusty snow. I'm in the alley of the block where my home is, where the old blue house was, kitty-corner to our home. A Chevy Blazer roars by, going north, in the alley. I take cover so I'm not seen. People in the Blazer are looking for me. They don't know that the person they're looking for is I: they think the person is a stranger, a nuisance, and a pest. Really it is I, and they don't know.
