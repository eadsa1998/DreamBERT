I hadn't met Calvin in year 4 and he had a picture of Ramona, Tiana and I and had glued a picture of himself on my face. I found a picture from years ago and I found a picture of him. I realized that he was at Adventure World. Granma had a pet buffalo, which looked like a big toy dog. She made us hedgehog slice.
