During the night I had several dreams but I can only remember one clearly. A boyfriend and I were on a bridge. A small child had drowned and police had just brought the child to the surface of the water. The child was wrapped in a large blue blanket. As my friend and I stood on the bridge and watched, Dr. Boone's two little girls came to identify the child. They waded into the water and unwrapped the dead child. Mrs. Boone appeared on the bank in a red two-piece dress and told her girls not to look at the child too long because they might cry. My friend and I laughed and threw the two Boone children candy. Then we found out that the drowned child was my friend's brother who died 18 years ago. We decided not to tell his mother and then left.
