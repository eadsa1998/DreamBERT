Daddy, Mom, and I were walking up the street when all of a sudden we saw our dog C-- who died about a month ago. He wabbled up the street. When we went on the sidewaIk, he went on the street and when he went on the sidewalk, we were on the street. We couldn't steer him toward our house. At last we got him to the front door. It was very late at night and we found the front door wide open. Mom was the first one in. She yelled for us to come in also. As we ran around inside the house to see if anyone was there, we found that every door was closed to every room, but nothing in any room was disturbed.
