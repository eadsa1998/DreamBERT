I am in a classroom setting. Bao Ninh is critiquing my work. He speaks perfect English. His voice is warm yet authoritative. He commends what is good, denotes what is imperfect. He sounds very much like Peter Kane Dufault. I am learning a great deal from him. He pauses, makes a general remark. I respond with a mocking reply. He becomes angered, saying he will not tolerate that sort of reply, hinting or stating the class is over. I apologize twice, and state I will leave in order for the class to continue; I will come back the next day. I apologize again. Inwardly, I am aware of anger towards him. It is the only way to explain what I have said. Recollection is fuzzy at this point. Bao Ninh appears to accept what I have stated, but I am forced to accept the conflicts of my own nature and to understand them. The shock of recognition is painful.
