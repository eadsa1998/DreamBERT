A horrible series unfolded. I was a sadistic killer. It began when I was visiting family friends who had a house in Thailand. I had the feeling I had been there before, but didn't have any direct recollection. So, when most of the people were out, I took one of them into a back room, pissed in a tray, and made her eat out of it until she threw up. I planned on doing worse, but felt sick myself and wished I wasn't doing what I was doing. It was like killing an animal out of mercy. You try to make it as quick as possible, but the sickening moment when you know suffering, no matter how fast, is inevitable... It makes your stomach turn. You want to look away from what your hands are doing. The place is square, with a steel roof and concrete floors.
