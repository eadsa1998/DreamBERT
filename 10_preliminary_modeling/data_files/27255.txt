B., a friend of mine around 23 yrs. old and 6 ft 3 in., took me over to the West side of C. to an ice-cream parlor. This ice cream store resembled the store that I had been at in N. R., mirrors composed all four walls. The seats were blue leather with yellow additions. After we finished our ice cream we came to my house where we talked with my family. The dream ended at this point.
