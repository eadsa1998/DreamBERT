As nearly as I can recall, my dream began on an airplane. My companions were students of the same sex, and also a few older women who were apparently our teachers or perhaps chaperones. The interior of the plane was unique in that it resembled a large mansion with an overabundance of large easy chairs. I recall that we were on some kind of tour along the East Coast, with Florida as our ultimate destination. The most prominent thing in my dream to me was the fact that the plane was going by way of Alaska, and that I would have to be on the Plane with all these unliked strangers for days on end. Everyone else was having a good time doing such things as singing, eating, playing cards, and sleeping. I recall that one older woman, the particulars of whom apparently were minor to me, kept pestering me to do things that I had no desire to do. I remember distinctly being afraid to leave my chair or the window for fear the plane would land and I would miss my opportunity to get off and find help. I remember trying over and over again to convince everyone that we did not have to fly the course on which we had started. For some reason I was in a hurry to get back to a certain destination. Neither my home or Florida or any other specific place seemed to be in my dream as where I wanted to be. Occasionally, a familiar person that I liked walked by me, but seemed to be deaf to what I was saying, and apparently they were not conscious of my presence. I can remember distinctly that I thought I was in a world where no one else existed. The last thing before I woke up was that I experienced that falling through space feeling--at which point I woke up.
