 The house on the northwest corner of 1st Street and Bauer Avenue in Oak Valley has just been stained with wood stain. I'm near my friend Gino Teavor's house. I start to paint his house. It's its usual, ugly yellow color, and I paint over it. I have a flashlight, a paintbrush, and one other thing. I'm nervous that the Teavors will see or hear me painting. On the side of the house I think Gino may see or hear me. I run away. I'm at home with painting equipment. Greg and Loretta Slick and their family walk by. I try to conceal my painting equipment.
