Begins in a busy TV station newsroom (hustle bustle more like a TV show about a newsroom). News producer Dan is getting ready to put on show. Everyone walking around. I'm in the middle trying to do my part but I no longer work there. Somehow music to one of my favorite musicals (West Side Story) comes on. Some people begin to sing (Something's Coming). They don't know all the words but I do. I grab a mike and sing the whole song (to everyone's amazement) catching the attention of a powerful female executive producer. She mentions something about how great TV has led to my knowing such a wonderful thing. I say, "It's not television, it's the writing!" Everybody stops and looks at me as if I've committed a great faux pas. The woman exec asks me to come with her. Switch to: On our way to the Opera House, she wants to know about me. I tell her more about my sister who is a bigwig at the Opera House "in a man's world." Some of show happens -- I excuse myself and go the bathroom and note I need to fix my hair (still in curlers under scarf). Go back to lobby where it's breaktime. The woman exec is gone but her other cronies (all young 20-something year olds) eye me suspiciously and try to get more info out of me. They are very surprised to know I have a 12-year old son. I begin to leave. On the way out (seems like I'm on some European Street in Greece or Rome) and a sandal floats by in the gutter (some man, an Italian valet of sorts, hands me a note. I am to return this sandal to a hotel. I instinctively know the woman exec is waiting for me in a room there. She will seduce me. Switch to: Myself in a coach with my sister, and another (my mother?). She is laughing about this whole story I'm relating. Back to my being on European Street, etc. My sister now laughing. I'm laughing too because I know I'm on my way to be seduced. I say, "Hey, I can do this easy! I'll be the woman's driver/chauffeur, if it will get me back my job!"
