I was lying on a beach next to the ocean with the sound of the waves in my ears. The sun was bright but pleasantly warm. I closed my eyes to keep out its brightness and when I opened them again the sun had set and the world was bathed in twilight. Suddenly the waves parted and a girl strode toward me. I looked around and to my surprise found we were alone. Not speaking she lay down by my side and we had intercourse.
