 I'm at the Mason Cafeteria eating lunch. My friends Bubba Hacker, Stephen Ramos, and Kevin Simpson are there and I'm waiting for them to finish eating. I drop my tray off on the south side of the cafeteria. There is a bag for plastic forks, but I drop a metal fork into it. In the east dining room there is a dessert area. A lady is giving people a choice of 4 dessert donuts. I want more than one and am having a tough time deciding what to get. I grab a bunch and walk off with my hands full. Back at the table they are goofing around. I do a fake fight with Kevin, and kick him in the groin. He farts on me. We all laugh. There is a guy there with a sack over his shoulder.
