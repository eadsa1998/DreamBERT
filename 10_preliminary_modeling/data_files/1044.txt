I'm in N City visiting Aunt Elaine's. We go through town. I am getting married, or have a boyfriend. We find a boyfriend for my younger "sister." We go "home." "Mom and dad" are leaving on a trip, leaving the house to my sister and me. I open a drawer to get something for them and a small hidden drawer falls out. It's very old. I look in it. I see a spider. I quickly take the drawer to a sink and turn on the water to drown the spider. It changes into a miniature man. I am still trying to drown it. I almost succeed. He looks quite blue. I try to swish him. He avoids me and rolls on a log. I stop trying to kill him. I say to him, "This is 1981." I say the # slowly because I want to trick him into showing surprise if he is very old. He does. I expect him to tell me he's 1800's, but he says somewhere in the 6th to the 10th century. He changes into a light bulb and rolls all over me like something with static electricity. He says, "You'll never get rid of the light now. I'll be with you everywhere you go." I feel pleased and also aware that it will take an understanding man to have a relationship with, he'll have to tolerate my "light." I take off a pair of fancy hose. I talking to a man named Jim, who thinks I'm great even with my light.
