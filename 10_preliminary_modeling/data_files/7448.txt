I dreamed of Mary, but can't quiet capture the imagery of it. But I saw Mary and she said something like, "I'm going to an early grave." The message was clearly that she had died - or was going to die - at a young age. I had a vague feeling that she was angry about something. Or had she said, "You're driving me to an early grave."
