I was eating in a corner cafeteria when I happened to recognize one of my old schoolmates. Her name was Pat. Pat seemed to be managing the restaurant and had various employees working under her. All of a sudden I felt an ice cream cone being shoved into my hand. After I ate a little bit of the cone, I happened to drop the ice cream on the floor of the store. Pat immediately told one of her employees to pick it up for me. However, after they had picked up the cream, I refused to eat it for some unknown reason.
