I was in this dome shaped room in a larger building. People started running to the door, then to a door on the other side, but I couldn't see anything and didn't know what was happening. Someone said that 'it' had 6 legs. I ran out of the place and then I saw all these small dinosaurs running around. I ended up back inside and someone else and I walked to the top of the roof. We jumped over to this thing on the side. A dinosaur came and it was a bigger one and it was blue. We stayed still and it jumped up to me and I quickly got onto this shelf thing. We then ran outside. Ezra and I ran to my car and got in and locked the door. I drove off and there were other people driving away and it was stressful. We went to this shop place sometime later and there was raw fish and the dinosaur things ate it. One came and I threw fish at it. Ezra packed up some and we drove away. We went to another place without the car. We cooked chicken. Two were ready and three had a few minutes left (but they had to do something else with them). Rover was there. We packed up all important stuff. There were mechanical things. We ran out and there was a robot like in World of Warcraft and it came up with the green arrow to get in. This other guy climbed up and I pushed him off. We got in a fight and something big was coming and we went the other way. At one point, I strangled some girl and pulled tight on the cord and it made a bone stick out of her neck. We had a place set up now like a village. At another time, we were in a clan and there was a picture of me with the dinosaurs. I got us out somehow.
