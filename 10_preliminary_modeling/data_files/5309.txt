I dreamed that Johnny Depp was in the hospital and I wanted to see him. So I devised a way to pretend that one of my relatives was in the same hospital room so that I could have an excuse to see him. He had changed his appearance, accent, and everything about him, however, so that when I got to the hospital, I couldn't tell who he was. I forget who, but someone I knew ended up in the same room as this dark Transylvanian guy, who ended up being Johnny Depp. I went in the room and was about to start talking to him when the entire hospital was about to collapse. I remember seeing Caleb and Alexis and knowing that I had to save them, but then I woke up.
