I went to university and was going to a different tutorial today. It was 9.22 and it started at 9.30. I found a parking spot and went in. I didn't know where the class was, so I picked one. It was night. The teacher lady gave me my assignment back and I got 19/45, although sometimes it said 49/90. Alejandro was sitting in front of me and he saw me, but didn't say anything. Then Mom, Rover and I were at a shop, I think. Some paint fell and made a mess. I tried to clean it up. Pink paint came out, but blue didn't. Then I was in a car with Ezra and some guy. We turned around and I said this reminds me "gay cowboys eating pudding". I explained that down this road was a cabin in snow where Dad and James Marsden used to hang out and supposedly they had secretly been together. We went there and there coins scattered everywhere. I took some. I asked Ezra if he knew if they had had sex and he said that he didn't think so, because they weren't gay now. I said that Brokeback Mountain was about love, not gayness. Then it was a movie. Some guy came along and pretended he was in real estate, but was actually scamming people. There was an Asian couple and the girl wanted to see the products and then her ex was there and it was a scam too.
