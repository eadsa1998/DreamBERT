Monday. I go to Lucy's house to have breakfast. Lots of pancakes and good food. Lorne comes later and I am not happy he's there. I frown and grumble. He bumps into me and I pull away. I'm annoyed at Lucy for still having him around. After breakfast, Lucy, Justin and I go for a walk. We are talking. We go into a school. We see the students' art work on the walls. Now we go into a classroom. Bonnie is teaching. It's a chorus class. A well-dressed professional woman comes in to guest lecture, but the class is comfortable, casual and inattentive, so the woman leaves. Bonnie lectures them on their bad manners. I tell them this woman came to offer them her knowledge and they could have been more respectful. A group of men (seven or eight) get up and with noses in the air, walk out. "Good riddance!" I say and we continue the lessons.
