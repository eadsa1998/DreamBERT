I went to the door to get the paper but none were there. Two men were working next door tearing down and enclosed porch and rebuilding it. Saw it was termite ridden, as much of the building was. I asked them where my paper was. They hadn't seen it. Then I saw it on a stand at the left as I turned back into the house but when I brought the paper in there was only one of the two sections. Two children, less then three years were seated on my buffet. One was dressed in white, trimmed prettily in blue that matched her eyes. I lifted them down, put them out, telling them not to come in. Then the Rich. boy came in. I told him he shouldn't without knocking. Meantime I was wondering what to do about my deficient paper.
