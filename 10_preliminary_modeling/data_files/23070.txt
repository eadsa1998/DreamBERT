I was in the chorus of an opera, behind a big brick wall, blocked from the view of the audience.  Our librettos were in enormous books that were almost too big to hold, and certainly too big to hold open.  It kept shutting and losing my place, and I was totally dependent on it-I didn't know the words or the music.  Everyone else was having trouble too-at one point Helen Martin was the only one of us to come in, and she sang a strong solo.  Later we emerged from behind the wall.  John Payne and Lois were in it too.  At one point I was naked and scrambling up an embankment or something to another part of the set.  I was the only one naked, and the script didn't call for it.  I was very embarrassed and was sure that some of the audience and even of the cast would be offended.  I didn't know why I didn't have clothes on.  After the performance was over (and it strung out much too long because of lapses, etc., and was a real bust), I was walking along a corridor of dressing rooms in a rather decrepit basement.  I passed two blacks, one of whom was taunting the other.  He then challenged me.  I kept on walking and told him to fight the other guy if he wanted to fight.  He called me a coward, and I replied that I was simply too smart to get into a fight without any reason.
