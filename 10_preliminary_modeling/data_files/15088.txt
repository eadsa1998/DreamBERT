Ezra wanted to buy tickets for something. He thought it was a movie, but he got them for a reenactment. I agreed to go and got tickets. I thought it was going to use real actors. There was a huge queue but we had like the 9th and 10th tickets to we got in first. It was a small room. There was bedroom stuff to the side and a big TV which was going to play the original movie. I said to Ezra 'I can't be bothered, I'm leaving. See ya!' and ran out, yelling "Ma!" and told her to wait. It was night and we walked back to the car. I said "I can't believe I bought a ticket. I wasted $10". We got to the car and started to drive off. We saw a girl only wearing a tight black vest with her boobs showing a little. It was gross. Life is a Highway came on the radio. I complained saying that I'd rather be [somewhere I can't read] than see this movie. A girl in the queue nearby said "I don't want to listen to this bullshit". I wondered if she meant me or the music.
