I've just gotten home from school - I live in this house with my Mom and Dad [not my real ones - a fairly nice pair of sitcom parents, we're loving and close]; I'm young but not little, and my attitude is light, cheerful; it's a nice day. I open the front door of the house, which is not facing the street but sideways to it; I had to pass between the side of the house and (the garage?) to come to the front door. There's a man inside the door; he's obviously broken in and is waiting to do me harm. I drop my book and run. I run back around to the street, screaming for help. Across the street a woman opens her front door, first a crack, then she comes out - now there's somebody else out, maybe others. I stop and look around; the man's not following me.
