I was on vacation with a girlfriend in an unknown place by the sea. There was some kind of a bridge where one could walk, but one had to be very careful walking because there were some very narrow parts. I fell three times, but was not seriously hurt. There was in that place a woman (about 40 or 50 years old) who was a fortune teller. We went to see her in the afternoon and she told us that she would write a paper for us, but that we should not read it until the next day at 10 a.m. and that if we read it before, a curse would fall on us. That is all I remember.
