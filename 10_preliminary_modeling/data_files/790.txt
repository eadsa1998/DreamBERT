Howard is driving a beat up VW bus. His wife Karen, the kids and I are in the bus. I am the in passenger seat. I see Howard going to sleep as he drives. I am angry. I yank the driver's seat from him. We argue. He is on a bended knee next to my right side, trying to get close to me. I feel very closed in, rigid. Karen pleads with me to see his need to drive and to be close. I'm angry and I argue that it's best for me to drive and that I don't like him anyway, so there! The brakes are weak and I have trouble stopping or slowing us down when it is needed. [BL]
