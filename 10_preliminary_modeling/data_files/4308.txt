["Islands and I don't like it."] I am at a tropical island resort. Lots of people are there. They are at their dream resort, the place they'd rather be. They love sun and surf and swim and relaxation. I however, don't like to swim and am allergic to the sun. This isn't where I want to be. A man is there. We are friends. Lots of repetition of lines of people in swim suits on the beach. The beautiful blue gentle sea.
