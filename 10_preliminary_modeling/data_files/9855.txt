Visit from the Wilders (Frank's parents): Mrs. Wilder (his mother) and a friend of hers and Sam (Frank's brother) arrive; we live in a different place; when we say our prayers Frank speaks up out of turn! Very embarrassed; but I chuckle to myself as I pray. Later I walk out to hear others pray in their houses.
