An ex-colleague Kevin and his team of technical people have set up a bizarre machine for me at work. It is housed in an upright piano. It contains many cogs and gears in two rows visible on the front panel. It seems to be able to do two things: 1) Simulate driving. There's a steering wheel and windscreen etc. It is very convincing. Kevin is driving it very fast, which makes me panic for a moment. 2) Print in color. I look through a hole and see behind the machine is a small storeroom with piles of spare inks. I guess this thing is like some kind of supercomputer.
