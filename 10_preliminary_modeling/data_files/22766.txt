I dreamed I was watching a television program at home with my mother and my three brothers. I cannot remember whether it was a familiar program, but I do remember it was in color because, in the dream, my brother told me that he didn't like a girl's dress in the program because it was an ugly shade of green. It had something to do with gangsters or spies, I believe, because there were shots. I don't remember any more. In the dream I was drinking lemonade.
