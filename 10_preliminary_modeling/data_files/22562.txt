I dreamed I was at a party with a maxi skirt and since I was dancing so much and the skirt had been put together in a hurry, when I stopped dancing the skirt fell down. Then I felt terribly ashamed and I got out of there, running, and everybody was following me and I was running very fast and the dream ended there.
