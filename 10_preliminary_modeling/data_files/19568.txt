Anderson and I are on the front seat of a sedan, he driving. Later on I take the wheel and for a while at least drive with my hands crossed. Car is going down a long hill, paved with brick, leading into Georgetown. I drive far above the legal speed limit in order to "beat" the traffic light at bottom of hill which shows green while we are still a considerable distance away. Near light I apply brakes and slow down enough to stop if necessary, but we get by before red shows. I accelerate car again and we pass over railroad tracks. Next we start out across an unfinished bridge. A car some little distance ahead of us turns to right and seems to disappear -- or rather it seems to reach opposite bank safely though I can't see it any more. At any rate I feel that the proper thing for me to do is turn to right, just as the other car did. However, this proves impossible as the finished part of the bridge suddenly ends and we find ourselves looking out into space. Several (4 or 5) feet down is some sort of a temporary bridge on which a man in overalls is standing. He seems to be waiting to lift down a long plank which is lying beside our car and which Anderson and I have difficulty in handling -- that is, it is so heavy that it almost gets away from us. We both sit on the plank, trying to balance it, and as we are only inches from edge of bridge, I at least am acutely uncomfortable. The last 20 or 30 feet of the roadway of the bridge is made by about 6 huge steel beams, set on edge, but with spaces between some of them large enough to take an auto tire, and I am surprised to reach the end of bridge without having a wheel slip into one of these large cracks. The man in overalls smiles and shakes his head, apparently in wonder that we got there at all. The bridge roadway is paved with brick.
