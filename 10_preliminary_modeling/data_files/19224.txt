Enrique Iglesias (he's 23) and Alicia (23) (both singers) were going to sing here, but no one knew them so the manager, the one that was in charge, told me to sing for Alicia. So I was going to sing for her but I didn't know a whole song (I just knew parts of it). At the end Alicia came for real so I didn't have to sing any more for her, but I wanted to.
