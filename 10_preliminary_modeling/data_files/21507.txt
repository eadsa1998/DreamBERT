I was working at White's. Dr. Conn was our doctor. Someone fell over the sweeper and we put on a telacall and called Dr. Conn. "Dr. Conn, emergency, Dr. Conn, Dr. Conn." The fellow and I were to write on our cards 3rd shift, which I did. There was another call over the telacall system by us. Bob was lost and we were searching for him. I had an idea we would find him dead, buried under something, or drowned. I thought of how he must of suffered before he died. I found a body, but it wasn't Bob. It was some fat, husky boy. He seemed to be dead and still alive. I left him with a boy and went on searching. Then the boy came up to me with the husky fellow I dug out and he was now just a skinny boy. I saw Bob Lippert sitting on a bench with a husky man. Bob was fat and chubby and had his fat elbow in the husky man's neck, sort of making him sit in an awkward position. I pulled up on a big cable which made some freight cars move. I then pushed it back and they stopped. Then the cars started again and went down the track and up a grade. The last car started back down and I was on the track. I had a hard time getting off the track, but I did and the boxcar came by me and then it went off the track and climbed a steep hill, went to the top and started back down with speed. It seemed to fall apart and the debris was scattered around.
