I was in a large meeting room at church. The room was filled with people, all sitting at large round tables. I was either one of the hosts or presenters, but I'm not sure which. It seems to have something to do with CRHP. We were instructing everyone to write thank you notes to the current CRHP group and we were going to do so as well. I didn't know what to write because I didn't know any of these people. I was trying to think of a sincere thank you that could apply to anyone. Now I'm helping to clean up the room and I'm talking to someone about my neighbor. They're telling me I should make more effort to talk to Jasmine U. I'm wondering if it would be okay to ask how old Jordan U is.
