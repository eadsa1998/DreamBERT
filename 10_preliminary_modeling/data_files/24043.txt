I had just listened to the song Penny Lane the night before, so before I feel asleep, I was thinking of it. In the dream, I was playing on my street in a wagon with my brother. All of a sudden, my brother disappeared into thin air, and I was all alone. Then a light started glowing in front of me, and I was forced to follow it. When I got to the light, I stuck my foot inside, and it sucked me in. For hours (it seemed like) I was turning over and over in the green light. Then I stopped turning, and I started falling in a huge tunnel of pennies. When I finally landed after (what seemed like) falling forever, I found myself in a scene from the X-Files, and I was playing the role of a special agent (Bana Scully). Right when I was about to shoot the enemy (who was trying to kill my partner) dead, I woke up in a cold sweat.
