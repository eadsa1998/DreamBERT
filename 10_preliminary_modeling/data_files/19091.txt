In the dream it was asked to whether a philosophy professor could make enough money. I was with my girlfriend. That was the discussion. Her parents somehow were there too or very near discussing different aspects of whether it was possible, and then as a writer, I guess, because I remember there were two different occupations we were thinking about, as a professor and as a writer. My girlfriend cried a little bit when she realized I wouldn't be making a lot of money. I felt rather disappointed at that because I said she didn't understand me very well. She could make me feel so badly about not being able to make money and besides it wasn't that important, it seemed to me, the money.
