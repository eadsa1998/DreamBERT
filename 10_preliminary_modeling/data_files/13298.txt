We were at a shop. I got a little Twix and had "thirteen bites, two to go", when Ezra took it. They had some mix bag and there was a Yowie in there and a tube, which looked like toothpaste but it said it was Panadol and was empty (it was curled up). I was then at home watching TV. I went to AirActive, but it looked different. I was watching some movie thing. There were four black guys and they all had short hair. One was called Shorty and was Marlon Wayans. Shawn Wayans was there too. I said "just call them all Shorty!". There was a house on a raft-like thing and the people on that fell off the house and died. The others were hanging off.
