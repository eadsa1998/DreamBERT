       Restaurant: Father Andrew wears a stunning coat and hat, like a chic woman! Then he is again Father Andrew, only wearing white slacks and shirt. Frank and Sibley and pacifists come in: we have a discussion about pacifism. I am impatient about wanting to talk; finally we get a chance to talk about (with Father Andrew).
