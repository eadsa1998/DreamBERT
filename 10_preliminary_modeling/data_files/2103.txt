I'm a beginning pilot and fly in my one-seater open airplane. I feel afraid to go too high because if I have trouble and crash, I'll hurt worse. Then someone else pilots and I goad them to go faster. I love the speed. We go through swinging glass doors and I hope the propeller doesn't scratch the glass. Someone chuckles at my love of speed.
