I came in from the front of the house and my brother Stuart was humming an annoying tune over and over again.  My boyfriend Jeremy had done as the note I left him before going to bed said; he left, without saying goodbye.  I was already irritated.  I asked Stuart to stop humming, but he didn't.   Over and over and over again.  I started to yell at him.  My mother and Stuart were supposed to take me to class.  Stuart thought it was Saturday but I said it was Wednesday and had to get to class at 10:30.  I looked at my watch.  20 to 2.  Well, still had to get to class.  They kept lagging.  No way I'd make it.  I woke up to found the 'humming' was actually Jeremy's snoring.
