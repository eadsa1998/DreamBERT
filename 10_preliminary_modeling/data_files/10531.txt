We are about to leave for Mankato. I wanted Willie to come along, but we are already on the road. At one point we get stuck at a narrow place between 2 cars -- we return to Willie and home. "So glad to see you" he says. Again I ask him to come along, but he says 'NO." Then I say: I'll fix you cereal and eggs." and we'll be back between 7:30 and 8 PM. Willie leans back and talks on the phone to a girl he calls Sylvia... vivid. Also scene of yelling to Frank. "How come we missed Bible Study?" -
