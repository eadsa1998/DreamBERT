I called a girl that I knew in high school on the phone. While talking to her on the phone, I could see her -- like on TV when two people talk on the phone and the black line on the screen separates them. The conversation was regular, just "Hi" and "How are you?" Nothing major. However, this is a sharp contrast to the experience I had when I actually called her last summer. She was hard to hear, like another phone in her house was off the hook, and there was a lot of background noise. The conversation didn't go well, as if she didn't know me.
