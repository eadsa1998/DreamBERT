I had a strange dream last night. First, I went back for RA training. At night we were watching a movie in an opera house. No one was allowed to eat any candy besides Starbursts. Mario was getting really mad at anyone who was talking. Next, I was going to a sleepover with all my old roommates from last year and my brother. Sophia was as annoying as ever, but I was trying to get along with her and be diplomatic. Then I was living in an attic in South America, where they had slaves. I had to take a really long train ride to get down there, and I kept trying to send Anthony letters, asking him to rescue me, but I couldn't spell his address correctly. The woman at the post office kept getting mad at me. When I got there, there was a bullfight. And then someone bought me a pair of those footie pajamas. But I really didn't like the bullfight, but I just couldn't figure out how to leave.
