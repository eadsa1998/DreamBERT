At a school - I don't think I actually go to it but I'm with somebody else; it's real close to the end of the year and everybody has a what-the-hell attitude. We're in a big open room without chairs to see a film (educational, of course) and my friend parks beside a big obnoxious-looking woman (also not a standard-issue school student) but I don't relish the idea so I pick another spot and my friend joins me. The film rolls and it involves sport or dancing, and a couple of kids get up to demonstrate something which involves vigorous movement, and they "dance" right outside to the open grass and air - a spot rather like one at Scarb Faire. I seem to have come along for the ride, as has somebody from the class who's supposed to be getting them back in the classroom and doesn't really care any more than they do. The routine is something like, "well I looked but I didn't find them" and everybody goes their merry way.
