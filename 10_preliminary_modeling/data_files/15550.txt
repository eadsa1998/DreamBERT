I was back in the UK for a bit. Benjamin made his profile picture a picture of himself. We met up for a bit and it was easy to talk to him this time and we actually talked. We met again and went to a water park. We went through it collecting 'peanuts' which were park currency and you could hand in anything leftover at the end to get turned back into money. We got food and I couldn't decide what to get and I asked if the meat was spicy and they said yes and to go with the roast chicken, chips and tomato sauce. I had a small water. I made a joke about making decisions. Then I went there with Dad. We had some fruit stuff and then it was time for dessert. This lady with her daughter said we should line up behind them. We asked why and she said that she had to be somewhere in 45 minutes. We said we didn't care. I argued that there is a queuing system in place and she was being a bitch. We got back in front of her. I went to this stall with strawberries and sorbet.
