[1997-05-07] I am sitting in the kitchen of my parents' house in a chair at the table. The table is on my left and the chair is to the right of it. My ,mother is trying to do my hair, she's setting my hair in a more interesting way, she's making these curls up on the top and up on each side and I'm getting ready for a trip, I'm about to take a plane I'm not sure where. We get a phone call and we get to talk to some people about things related to the trip. They're talking about Boston, so somehow that figured in too, places in Boston we go to.
