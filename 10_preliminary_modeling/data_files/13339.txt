I was at school and I went to the office which was creepy and looked like a bathroom. Ezra and I signed out. We were trying to work out how to get out of the school. I saw Alejandro. There were gates everywhere. Then it was a game. The windows were up and the doors were locked in the car. We drove and hit this lady. People were chasing us and I kept driving. Then I fell off this cliff thing and slid down into these trees. Then it would reset and I kept dying.
