This scene is from around Miami, and I'm with my roommate and we're sort of just doing the usual errands of the day, going to school, to the library or to the store or such. I recall I was riding a bike, which I ride quite frequently back and forth to school. Then I think what happened I met him and he asked me if I had any books as if not to forget them. The exact location is not clear. It was just some street here in Coral Gables. I did see myself, not real clear, but I saw another person on the bike which I assumed was me, but the face wasn't real clear as if it was me. Yeah, it was my bike. Not, I didn't see myself riding the bike except just as I met him, I was on the bike riding it.
