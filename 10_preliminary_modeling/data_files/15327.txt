I was at a cinema with Dad and Ezra seeing a Twilight movie. It was really bad and we left at one point but came back and it was weird. There was a guy at a table and something screamed like a monster. There was another strange scene with no music. There was a late season of Cheers with Jensen Ackles in it. He was really fat though and I couldn't even recognize him. I was then at some concert place with Dad. Ezra saw an ACDC concert then said we had to see it. There was some Beatles thing on the day after. There was also The Doors, Roxy Music and some others. There was a Tommy Wiseau movie which had something to do with Roxy Music.
