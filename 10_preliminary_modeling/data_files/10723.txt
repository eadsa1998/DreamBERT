I was walking along by the side of the road in the country. The landscape was barren and deserted and it was raining. I kept stepping in puddles. The few cars that went by would not pick me up, but rather splashed water all over me. Then an army car stopped and the driver offered me a ride. I recognized him as a man I had worked for, when I worked for army recruiting. He was a colonel, in his fifties, of whom I had been quite fond. Just as soon as I had gotten in the car and closed the door, the rain stopped and the sun came out.
