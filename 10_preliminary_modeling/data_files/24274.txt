This dream segued into one where I was back in Thailand at someone's house. It was grandma's birthday or something, and we had to drive to the party they were having for her at a restaurant. I hoped it would be at a traditional Chinese restaurant, dim sum. But, alas, it was an outdoor banquet place set up in the parking lot of a strip mall. The tables all had red tablecloths on them. We arrived by car. My father was in the car. Like in Asia, I didn't trust his judgment but at the same time felt bad for him. A secret service agent or air force driver or something picked us up. We had connections. He was driving on the right side of the car. I remember not wanting to leave my headphones off, but I thought: it won't be too long. I was going to stay at the airport hotel that night, and quickly need to catch my flight back home in the morning. I remember being back at their house and trying to find the right bedroom to sleep in. All the bedrooms seemed occupied. Even the bathroom had a mattress placed into the bathtub. That worked, I guess.  A little ingenious use of space -- for a person who doesn't mind living out of the bathroom. It was dark and cold in the house, like grandma's house. I remember going to the other bathroom for privacy.
