I was watching Supernatural. I don't really remember it properly but Sam and Dean were both there. Then some others and I were shooting a TV show/mini-series/movie thing. It was about zombies. I was watching the first part of it and before this thing we were making there had been a prequel of what had happened before the show we were making and also some of the parts in between. In real life, this crazy fat girl was with us and I killed her friend or something and she was angry/upset with me and I suggested we tie her up. I locked something away in the safe. I changed the code so the other girl couldn't get in either. I changed it to 6456. The main character was a girl. The whole thing spanned years. Most of the movie used CGI. The sets were mostly green screen too. We were shooting a part in this small bushy area and I said "the first bit of nature". There was a weird possum thing in the tree. Then I spotted a giant lizard and some scraggly cat thing. It looked a bit like Cuddles. Mom said we should get 'Cuddles'. This scraggly thing was actually a boy and someone called it "the father of her child" (something to do with Cuddles). It kept chasing me. Mom had renamed her 'Princess' and Ezra was annoyed at this and said "I'll kill Princess". Then one of the characters looked like a young Chris Barrie. He got a call from some guy back home and said there was a pretend war going on. His scene included another guy, on top of a car. After the scene he said he'd been dared to put an extra knee up. Someone was saying how nice his hair looked, especially in that scene and said it was "effervescent".
