I was at school, which was different. There was this competition on, where we had to go through some different stages. First, there were three different lots of bugs in three different places, near each other. I realized they were breeding with other things. I can only remember scorpions and spiders. Eugene was there, but he didn't do this part first. The people who were doing this one, went inside this house, which was just past the bugs. As we climbed up the stairs, which were circular, there were also three lots of things scattered over the stairs. The first one was serial killers and Ted Bundy was one of them. They would come to 'life' and one had an axe. This girl and I decided to just run, instead of identifying them. We got to the top and since only the top 3 could pass, I was worried someone would get rid of me, so I pushed her off the side. This fat guy, this other guy and a girl came, but the fat guy fell off and accidentally took the girl with him. The other guy and I were the only ones left. We didn't want to go back down the stairs so we had to get out through a window. I grabbed a towel and put it around my hand and punched the glass. I said "I watch too many movies". Then we had to go to this room, "om1" and there were random tests. The room had computers in rows in the middle of it, but I sat at a round table at the side. This guy with a posh accent was talking to me. The tests were really random, one of them was it would give us a German title of something and we had to rate how "fierce" it was.
