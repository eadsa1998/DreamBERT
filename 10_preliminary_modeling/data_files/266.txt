I'm still in bed, just normal, trying to sleep - I get up, I guess I'm going to the kitchen or I'm checking on the cats, did I hear a noise? I see through the bedroom door that something is very, very wrong - the left hand wall (with an incorrect door in it) is lying on the floor, part of it anyway, and there's daylight coming through. I know that Julia planned to have some work done on the place, but I certainly didn't think it meant taking the walls off. This is terrible - I wonder if the workmen have done this by mistake, or is it really necessary? I can't see any way it would be. It's awful, it's dangerous, the cats could jump out or fall out the hole - I'm quite nervous about that, and I make sure they're in the bedroom so I can shut the door, but that's not great, there's no air conditioning in there. I go toward the bathroom - I'm planning on getting dressed and going to find Julia or call her and find out what's going on here - and suddenly the bathroom wall falls out. There's a couple of guys out there that I see through the hole, I suppose they're on ladders - they're wearing khaki uniform shirts and look like nice clean guys. I'm just standing there horrified. I've got to go out and do something about this. I pull on some pants and go out the front door. There's a concrete landing and stairs outside the door (which is on the south wall) that lead forward rather than backward. They're still working away at something out here, but I don't know what.
