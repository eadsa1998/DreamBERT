 I'm on an airplane with people who are familiar. We fly over New Zealand. The takeoff is shaky. I'm not sure the runway will be long enough: it barely is. The plane flies very close to the ground, right over and past many snow-capped peaks. The flight is risky and fast: a bit scary, but also exciting. The plane lands abruptly, turning as it does. The runway is narrow and curves. I'm afraid the wings may hit trees or other objects as we land and slow on the runway. The stewardess is going to make lunch, cooking a ham and a chocolate cake, during a short stop that we have. I take, and eat, a ham sandwich. The stewardess tells me that because I stole the sandwich I have to go without lunch. I lie, and tell her it was a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I made myself, and she then says it's okay that I have lunch. I get off the plane with my former flat mate Glen Ryan. We wait near a swing set for the stewardess to cook the ham and cake. The plane takes off and lands two or three times, low and fast. I look for the perfect cone shape of Mount Jutness, but don't see it.
