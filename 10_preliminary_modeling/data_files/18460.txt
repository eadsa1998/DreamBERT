There was a Moses hologram card with drippy blood letters like horror movies; about Moses and Jesus producers. On the back half was an invitation to church. In between the lockers loud music was playing sort of like punk stray cats, and punk rock kids were dancing in the hallways. They were so happy to be dancing they started throwing their clothes all over the floor. The music was so good and I was dancing. But eventually we had to leave the hallway and go home. Between 5-6 p.m. there was an advertising meeting. They said at 5-6 p.m. they were either closed for the day or out to lunch or very busy with marketing and will get behind and then you won't get your paycheck. I knew I didn't work there anyway so it didn't matter. While she was still talking I just walked away and she didn't even notice she was talking so much. I went back to the classroom. In the time it took me to talk to that talker lady he had gotten a 4-year college degree in chemistry. We talked about the vertical strength necessary to balance out horizontal weight. The original 3 bank robbers robbed the N train which went through Belton Honea Path. They took the horses back in the woods behind the tool shed. The man asked me, "Did you see any bank robbers?" And I didn't answer him because he saw them too and I didn't know what he was getting at with that question.
