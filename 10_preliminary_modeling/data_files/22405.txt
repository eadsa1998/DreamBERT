I dreamed that I was being followed by a car driven by an unknown woman, everywhere. Each time I turned around, I would see the face of this woman. She never got off the car; she just observed me. Then I went on dreaming that I was walking and then I was climbing some very narrow stairs which led me to a school where there were unknown people, and when I had climbed the stairs, I turned around and I saw the stranger again, sitting in the car.\
