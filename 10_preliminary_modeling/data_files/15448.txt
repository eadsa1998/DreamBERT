I was staying at this big house for the night. Mom and Darren were there too. My room was huge and had a backdoor and had stuff like, a table and a lounge (it was kind of like a hotel room). Light came through the windows in the morning. I put curtains up and closed the door. Ezra came home 'from his job'. He was talking outside my door and I complained saying that I was trying to sleep. Later, during the day, Bill (True Blood) was looking for something. I said 'before you do my room, give me time to hide my private stuff' and he agreed. This girl was planting memories in another girl so they could be friends. I went somewhere outside where she was and we were standing on sand with green stripes on it (originally was a tennis court?). Then it changed to water and I was trying to run before her power took over. I got to my room just as Bill got there and I said I wasn't ready. He said 'I would've come for you' and said he'd wait. I put my pads and diaries in a bag. There were new True Blood characters; 3 guys, who were supposedly attractive but were muscly and square jawed and ugly. Two of them were family of the Stackhouse's. I was watching an interview with Robert Downey Jr. and his 'wife' (who was born in 1985 and he was born in 1959). Her ex was a creepy Indian guy with gaps between his teeth and back teeth. He was friendly though. Michelle Williams and another girl had been with 3 others (?) and one had died and she cried, and I cried.
