Zena is in nursery school (in reality she is 8-1/2) and she hurts her hand, lower arm very badly; see blood flow out; bandage it; am upset. I go to school with her; lots of confusion; school nurse talks to kids and teachers during the break; sees many familiar faces; see Mike (Wendy's childhood friend) playing a banjo; he's wearing a shirt, tie and spotted vest.
