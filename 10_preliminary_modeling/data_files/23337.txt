In a dream which I had within a week, the mosaic structure is exceptionally odd. Someone came to me with a book in which I was shown a series of pictures and diagrams in explanation of a strange repulsive game. It was to be played on a bowling alley. But instead of pins, living rabbits and guinea pigs were to be set up. How they could be kept quietly in their places and up on their haunches, I do not know, but this was demanded by the directions. The guinea pigs were to be set at the extreme and far end of the alley, a pair of them, and in front of each, about two feet nearer the bowler, was to be placed a rabbit. The usual massive balls were to be used. Now the object sought by the player with all possible science and skill was to send the balls down the alley, past the rabbits, and curving in beyond them to mash the helpless guinea pigs against the wall. The killing of a rabbit was to be avoided, and was penalized by a deduction from the score for every such accident.
