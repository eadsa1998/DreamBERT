I was at some freaky place which was like a play area place except it was scary and evil. Some bloke, a father of someone, was with us and he had slept with me, except it wasn't me. He got hit by a train and "I" rushed over, but he was fine, and then we were dodging train tracks. We couldn't leave. There were strange Pokemon battle things. Rabbits, cats and dogs were in little exhibits just outside.
