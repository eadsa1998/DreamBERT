I was in a place that looked like a ruined old temple. I was surrounded by tall stone pillars. Some of the pillars were half crumbled away. There was no roof--I could see the sky. In the distance, moving slowly among the pillars, were four or five men. They were dressed in purple robes. I could not see their faces--their backs were turned to me all during the dream.
