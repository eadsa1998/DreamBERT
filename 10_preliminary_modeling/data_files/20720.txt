I was in an institution. I was called for an exercise in the field, but then the man said I didn't have to go because I was a veteran. My trouser legs were rolled up and I rolled them back down. Later I watched some men in a field doing war maneuvers. Guns were firing over their heads. Later I watched some men riding horses in a coral. An old man raced a horse so hard that the man was panting furiously when the horse was halted. Some younger man came up to him and wanted to kiss him. But the old man politely declined.
