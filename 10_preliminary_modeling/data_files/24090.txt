I am at my parents' house and I am talking to my dad and he says something about "him being dead." I had no idea who he was talking about because no one had died that I has heard of. I asked him who he was talking about and he said that my dog was dead. He said that it died of a heart attack a while ago and they had forgot to tell me or something. I remember being extremely sad and I burst into tears because I was so bummed out. I was crying uncontrollably and I felt as miserable and depressed as I have ever felt in any dream or waking moment of my life. The sadness I felt was literally immeasurable. I was devastated that it was dead because he was the best (and my most favorite) dog I have ever had. This is probably the worst dream I have had since I was a child (in terms of how much it affected me).
