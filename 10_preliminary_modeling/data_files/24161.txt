The main setting was an unfamiliar hotel room. I vaguely remember my father walking around there, paying very little attention to me. I clearly remember leaving my new purse under the bed there. I accidentally left the room without the purse. Strangely enough, the path I was hurrying along when I left was the path from this room (Oakes 105) to the bus stop nearby, to leave campus. I hurried the same way I hurried when I finished a final in this room at the end of last quarter. I was so relieved in the dream that I didn't go back to get the purse. It seemed like too much hassle. I forget where I was in a rush to get to. When I opened my eyes I realized with relief that the purse was there on my dresser where I had left it.
