I was in a hospital lying on a bed. Someone came into the room and said I had taken something from another room. I was unclad, and I told him to wait until I dressed, and then I would be there. I had taken some food by mistake. As I walked back, I saw Romanolo, and I avoided speaking to him. Later I was seated and my trousers were down. Romanolo passed and he commented as he went by to an attendant something about me. Tatra came, and he handed me something.
