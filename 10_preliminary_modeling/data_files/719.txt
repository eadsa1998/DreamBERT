I had a strong dream about Dan. I dreamt we were making love on the couch. He was on top. He was small and had difficulty getting it in, but he finally succeeded and it felt good. Then I was on top and he couldn't get it in and I helped him. He groaned in ecstasy when it finally worked. I kept getting my leg trapped between the couch and his leg. It hurt. I'd mention it and he'd move and it'd be all right.
