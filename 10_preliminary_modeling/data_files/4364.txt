["Magic children."] I see an image of individual children up in the sky like a picture of a constellation. They are colorful and are placed to form a picture of what I am not sure. Moon, stars, something magic. I look at it, feeling happy to see it. It is a full circle filled inside with the children in different positions. The children are all standing but the direction of the image is different.
