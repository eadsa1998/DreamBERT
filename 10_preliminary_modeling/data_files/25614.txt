 I am in my neighbor Gary and Wilma Stein's yard with some people. There are hundreds of biology textbooks there, specifically genetics books. I ordered them but didn't realize I was doing so. My friends Holly Lapson, Jill Banks, and other biology majors are there. I ask them if they need a new textbook. I have all these new books and no use for them. The group makes a circle to play duck duck gray duck. My friend Esther Thurman sits by me. I am talking with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. There is a man there who is my friend that is saying to Annie and I that we are going to hook up in a sexual encounter. I disregard what he is saying though I know that I would hook up with her.
