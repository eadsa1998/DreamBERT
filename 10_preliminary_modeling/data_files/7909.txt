I was so excited during this dream as I realized that I was lucid and was sharing this with my family. They didn't know quite what to think. Many of my siblings and in-laws were there with their children. But the children were much younger and not in the same chronological age order, or not represented as such by size, than in waking life. The first time I realized that I was lucid is when Chris A was just a baby and Matthew was about three times his size. I said, Hey, you men this is a dream! They all looked at me kind of funny, not quite sure how to respond. I said you can tell because look at the difference in sizes between Chris A and Matthew. Chris A is significantly older than Matthew is and it should be the other way around. I don't know if we are all having this dream or if it is simply that I am lucid, but this is definitely a lucid dream. We went about what we were doing, changing diapers, working in the kitchen, eating cookies and such. Mari Kate S had curlers in her hair and was very small. Chris A came up to me again but this time he was about 4 times the size he was earlier. I said to everyone Look, another example of this being a dream. Chris A is now 4 times larger than he was a couple of minutes ago! This is so cool!
