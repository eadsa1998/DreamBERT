["Lila the camel."] I am riding a two humped camel across a large desert. Someone is with me. Her name is Lila, or something like that. We come to a city, maybe an Arabian one. We walk with the camel. Now she has to poop and I am frantically trying to get her out of the city so she can do that, but the poop comes part way out as she is walking near a man and it messes his pants. I feel badly.
