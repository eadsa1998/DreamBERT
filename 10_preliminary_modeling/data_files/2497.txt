Bonnie wants information on where to get newborn sizes of sleepers. I have notes that Bill from Total Mo made and I show her the number of the page. She writes it down incorrectly and I get annoyed and say, "It'd go faster if I wrote it; here let me." (I feel like I have to pee and I'm in a hurry.) She's slow and continues writing. I point out the columns for sizes and type. Then I excuse myself to go pee. I step out on a balcony and sit on a rock edge and pee. I see it coming out from under my skirt and foaming out on the floor. I think to myself, "It is amazing. I'll just pee anywhere," and I wonder if I'll have to clean it up, or if someone will notice, or if my skirt will stink.
