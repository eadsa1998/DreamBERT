I was in a hospital bed, but not sick, just sleeping there. I had a paper wad. I shot it with my finger and it stuck on the ceiling. Henry at Dill's asked who had his 22 pistol. I saw Dick Shebek. I told him Henry wanted his pistol that he loaned to him some time ago. I saw a nurse give a lady a check. Her picture was on the wall.
