We took a trip to Jackson, and that this dream, the setting of this dream was like home. And for some -- I don't remember too much, because again I let this go all day. I'm getting bad about that, so I forget most of them now. But Dad and Mom and I were like in a connecting airport, but we were outside on this deck and looking over like a roof into the city. And this thing was like a floating deck dock thing. It was like flying on air and it was like trampoline. We were jumping up and down on a trampoline. And in my dream Dad and I were holding hands and were like trampoline jumping back to the main terminal, which was like about ten foot square on the deck, and Mom was over in a chair by the main terminal. And I was thinking how trampoline jumping might bring back a bunch of scary stuff if we do too many maneuvers, but that wasn't a part really that much of it. And then I was thinking how nothing better happen with this plane because in my dream we were getting home from Jackson on a Sunday and I started class Monday morning, the next day, which fortunately on the way home everything went well on our real trip, and I could pull that off. But in my dream I don't think anything went wrong, and I think we just about made it onto the plane on time because we were waiting for them to call us, and they weren't calling us and weren't calling us, and we figured we'd better check and make sure everything is okay. And so we got on the plane and it was like, just like riding in a car, except we were riding along the interstate, and, you know, how do you slow down, you brake at a red light and you speed up and accelerate. Well, that's how this thing was. It was a vehicle with wings and the windshield was open and the windows were open, and it was like, it wasn't really a plane at all; it was a car. And then I woke up.
