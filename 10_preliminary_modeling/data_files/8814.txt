Ben D and I were in a vehicle that reminded me of an ambulance. The front seat, where the driver would be, was a bench seat that stretched across the vehicle. Ben D was driving and I was sitting in the center of the seat right next to him. I had been resting my head on his shoulder sleeping. I was partially awake and I reached over with my left hand and put my hand on his leg. I was thinking how glad I was that he was there. I was thinking how glad I was that I wasn't just dreaming it. For some reason I knew that the vehicle needed to be moved quickly so I moved over into the driver seat with the intention of driving it myself. However, as I was sliding into the driver seat I realized that it was a stick shift, and I didn't know how to drive a stick shift. But I really didn't have any choice, so I just started it up and tried to drive it. I was surprised at how well I did. I didn't have any problems at all.
