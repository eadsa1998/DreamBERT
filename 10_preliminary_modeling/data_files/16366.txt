I was still at Westport High School and I was carrying a bunch of stuff. I was carrying my book bag and one or two or three other heavy bags of stuff. And I dreamt that I was at this meeting to plan the prom that was supposed to be August 10th. Now isn't that ludicrous! I can't remember any kind of details, but there was a regular school bus that was going to take me home with a bunch of other people, and this meeting kept me talking and talking, and I missed the bus, so I had to call Mom and Dad and they came and they picked me up. But before they got here, I think I had to go back through the school and back into the courtyard and around because I forgot something, and then I came and I can't remember any more. Now isn't that stupid?
