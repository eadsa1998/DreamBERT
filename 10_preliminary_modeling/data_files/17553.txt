I was riding in a car with Dick van Dyke.  He wanted to marry Mary Poppins.  At first she said no, because he didn't have enough money.  Somehow he changed her mind.  They found a huge house.  I was one of four kids living with them.  There were vertical strips up the stairs for our fun.  Mary was demanding.
