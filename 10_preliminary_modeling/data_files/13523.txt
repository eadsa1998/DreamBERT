I was in space and there was a war. Some spaceship thing was leaving and I thought it would take me to the ship that was fighting. Instead, it took me to this planet. Calvin was there and everyone started eating and I realized I had forgotten my bag with water and food. I went off and was crying. Ms Braun came and said something about Calvin kissing me and I was like "ew, it's not about that. I want to go home". There was this robot in a sleigh that went to France.
