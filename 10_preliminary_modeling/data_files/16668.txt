We were ___________ that was like ___________ but they had different names and neither one of them __________________, but they were real proud of me and ________________________ and they like __________________________. So _________________ _________________ on 7th Street. And I was kind of taking care of them. I think I was like -- oh, what should I say? -- I was ________ing up things around the house and I was helping to dress them or something. And they had an alarm, but somehow I was able to get in and out and just deal with it. They taught me how to shut it off. And the only thing was when I would leave, I wouldn't re-arm it. I would let their next caregiver to come and she wasn't __________________. And I really wanted to _____________________. I guess I really do miss the coming and going at ___________. The only time I was like afraid is when I was in the house and they weren't there for some reason. But they showed me how to look at it and make sure that it was off. And ___________________ a house alarm security system, but the settings were all dealt with on a panel that looked like an alarm clock, like one of those ones you find in a hotel room. That was kind of odd. I kind of think there was a whole lot more to these people. It was kind of a nice dream actually. We were talking and stuff. But I don't remember too much of it. Now the next one is kind of bizarre. We were at Disneyland, Mom and I, and it was one of those things where __________________________ and apparently Dad didn't really go on any of the rides, but he was out in the middle of the park where there was grass and trees and stuff, and he was just kind of like bored to death, kind of sleeping in the truck. We had the green truck this time. Now there were some things that were leading up to this, but I can't really remember _________. I just remember the really scary part. Mom and I were in the Bermuda Triangle ride, which it's like in a big auditorium and the floor just kind of moves this way and that, kind of makes you think you have to go somewhere. And we were kind of walking around. There was a whole lot of people there. And we were playing musical chairs and picking different seats. And Mom, I was little enough so Mom could just carry me. I must have been like a toddler because she could carry me comfortably. And then they made a big announcement that everybody had to get out, and there was a fire alarm. And it didn't actually sound like the fire alarm at school. It sounded like a very loud fire truck back-up alarm. So she was able to just grab me and scoop me up in her arms, and we were off. And there were just tons of ______ and tons of people trying to get out. I don't know where all those people came from because I didn't notice so many people when we were enjoying the show. And somehow they had people that were directing the traffic and we were able to get out. And when we got out __________, and I can remember just feeling really, really scared after that. And Mom was like, "I'm going to put you down, I'm going to put you down," and then eventually she did, but I said, "I ____________ if I'm getting heavy, you can put me down, but I'm not letting go of you for anything." And then the next little scene was that -- oh, I know -- we were out at the green truck and Dad was talking to somebody about it, and a lot of the hardware on the back near the bumper, like there was some p____ and things and there were a couple of other things that were for towing, and a lot of hardware was all made out of chocolate. So when you had a hankering for chocolate, you could just go to the back of the green truck and get some. And for some reason Mom and I were going up this tower because apparently we wanted to take the green truck up there for some crazy, crazy reason -- I don't know why -- and it was kind of like Tuck's Tunnel at Great Explorations, which I've never been there, except there was a light on and it was all white instead of all dark. It was like there was light and there was like white carpet on everything, so you were in a white nothingness. And we crawled and we crawled, and at first it was fine, and then Dad and I, we turned, we were going higher and higher, we were just crawling and crawling up the slope. And then we turned and it got like almost too tight to go any further. And I got kind of off ____________. And Dad said, "Well, you just have to go about it the right way," and he got kind of a little stuck too and he had to kind of go out the other way. And we went the other way and there were like these doors that led -- we thought they went out to some kind of stairs that go down to the outside, but they led to this observation deck, which was kind of, there were tables and there were _____ and there was this wrought iron railing and stuff. And we asked somebody ___________ the stairs back ____________. And I was kind of afraid to go down the stairs because of what happened at the other place. I'm trying to think, did I ever come down? I don't think so. I think I was on the observation deck and then I woke up.
