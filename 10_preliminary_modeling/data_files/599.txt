Is it late on a holiday (not Christmas) and I am hurrying to get to a town near my hometown to buy a last minute gift for my daughter who is a small child. The same daughter is also going with me! There is a young man about her age in the kitchen of the house as I wait. He wears a leather jacket and is short. There is also something about a gift display at a style shop in my hometown. One part of the display is blue diamond earrings, another is a white shirt. Sarah, my sister-in-law, is with me. Her family owned the style shop.
