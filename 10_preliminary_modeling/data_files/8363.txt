I was on a trip related to SDI. I was rooming with a woman much younger than I. One morning she woke me up sitting on the floor next to my side of the bed. She was making unwelcome sexual advances. I wanted to be kind in how I handled it but yet wanted her to be very clear that this was unwelcome. I was lying on my back and she her head was resting on top of me, and one arm kind of draped across me, from my left side. I was going to try to move a bit to my left and place my right hand on her hair, hoping to indicate more gentleness as I spoke to her but found myself unable to move - as happens sometimes in dreams. Because I was not responding to her she climbed up onto the bed and lay on top of me, but she was on her side, in a fetal position, and kind of perpendicular to me. I then was able to move my arms and I cradled her while I told her that I was not interested in this type of relationship with her and that it made me very uncomfortable. I later called the BE Retreat Center to speak with Sister Rachel about withdrawing from the program and this was one of the reasons why. I am at the BE Retreat Center and trying to get in to talk with Sister Rachel about this. When I do get in to see her and begin to explain why I am there she said, You want to talk to me about this? She then said something about the fact that while she is getting settled in her new position members of the SDI are to speak with a Sister Roseanne about such matters. For some reason I thought she was going to tell me that I needed to talk to Sister Betty. I didn't know who Sister Roseanne was but felt strongly enough that I needed to speak with someone that I decided to go ahead and speak with her about it. It seems that I did go in and speak with her but I can't recall any of that now.
