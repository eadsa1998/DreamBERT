Last night I dreamed that I was walking through this swamp/bog thing. As I was walking, I came across a set of 5 bunk beds, all stacked up on one another. There were people having sex and they wanted me to join them. But I didn't want to, so I dredged on through the mud. Then I saw Jayden and Aaron fishing for frogs. With them was Aidan. He asked me to prom, but I didn't even know that the prom was so close, so I just kept walking. I finally had come to the end of the swamp and there were the dorms. For some reason Bellah was following me for accepted students day or something. So I tried to find my dorm room, but it was completely impossible. Instead of the hallway with rooms was a HUGE ballroom and lots of small dark corridors. And I couldn't find my room! Finally after walking around forever, I found my room. Outside it was a stack of books and a balloon with my name on it. Bella and I went in but there was yet another huge room. In this one was a cooking show. Fritz (my dog) was trying to guess what kind of sandwich they were making and he got tickled every time he got it wrong. I guessed PB&amp;J, got tickled, and woke up laughing!
