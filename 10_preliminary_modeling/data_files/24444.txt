I am in a place that resembles Viet Nam. In this instance I am selecting some sort of hotel room. I am looking for a place that can take the impact of mortars and bullets. I am now in a war zone. It is as if I have returned to Vietnam. All the buildings in the previous part of the dream have been almost totally destroyed. There is always the chance of being attacked. Much of the landscape resembles City X, where I grew up. I kill some people (a black man) with a burst from my 16. Then I wish to escape and make my way to a train that goes from Vietnam to Thailand. I get out but do not want to be caught for desertion. A fellow checks my I.D. He comes upon four stamps that I have in my wallet. They have been given to me by my mother. He asks why I still carry them. I offer him one, leaving me three. I return to Vietnam and the sense of danger is heightened. It is the sense of death and destruction that haunts me more so than a confrontation with VC or NVA. Then a friend and I decide to escape by car. He drives and I am aware how wide he is taking the turns. He does not really have an idea of where he is going. I am afraid that we are going to be ambushed as I see the familiar jungle that hides the enemy. I know only too well this paradox of beautiful jungle and the enemy waiting within. I wake up with feelings of immense anxiety.
