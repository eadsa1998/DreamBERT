I remember very little, but I was at the county fair and there were hella fine guys and they were both staring at me and I had to pick one... Setting: Near the entrance of the County Fair. Characters: Two beautiful guys, just beautiful, my height, my kinda clothes, FINE! Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, excited! I was so incredibly happy that there was such fine guys. A co-inkydink, as my friends and I were talking about the County Fair at school that day.
