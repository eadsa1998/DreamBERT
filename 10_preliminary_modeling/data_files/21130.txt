I went up a stairway with Mickey. We stopped to see Bernie and when we got to his door, I saw steel chips in the cracks of the door. I looked over the top of the door and I saw the hallway was filled with chips all the way to the top of the door. His wife said she cleaned a half of a room. I told her she should walk on the unclean half, then clean the other half tomorrow. I had an oilcloth. I saw pynton or pyton on it. I got out of my car and it seemed morning. I looked at the white blossoms on trees. They were there, then would fade. I was out hunting rabbits. I shot at one and it turned out to be a dog. We shot at a bird and he flew into a hole, then came out and I grabbed him. I hit his head on a pipe and he gripped my hand with his claws. He held on tight till I bounded his head more, then he let go. I was driving on a rough road. I t was full of holes. A fellow had a cell flashlight and he shined it on the distant trees. I went into Tony Maroll's beer garden and I drank and talked with him.
