I was at school and Dmitri was around. Calvin was asking him who he liked. Calvin asked if it was me and after a long pause he said that he's not saying anything. There were these files somewhere and he said that he'd hidden one with the person he liked in it. I looked in a plant pot and he got annoyed that we were searching. There was a photo of Daryl in his house. Calvin asked me if Lumpy was one of my Top 2. I said no. I was looking through a computer and I was reading through these log files to work out who it was that he liked. There was something about 'no lemonade'.
