I dreamed that it was stunt night. The time was just before the judging of the stunts. I had come into the lobby where there were many people milling around and looked for my date. Someone told me he was in the balcony (my date is an old acquaintance from Lake Erie College where he dated a friend of mine.) N., a college friend, hurried up to me and said P. had come to the show with some other girls from LEC (P. was the girl my date had gone steadily with at LEC). The fact that she had come did not bother me but I did not want her to see me when I got dressed into my street clothes. It seemed that I had a fur coat similar to hers and was afraid that she would accuse me of having stolen it. The strange thing was that I did not know for sure if I had stolen it or not and I had no proof that I hadn't. The lights began getting brighter in the lobby and I wished some of the people would leave because there were so many of them.
