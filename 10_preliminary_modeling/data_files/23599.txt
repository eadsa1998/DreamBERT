I'm working in a hospital, in what field I don't know. I wear white and the person who follows me around wears green. This goes on all through the dream. The person wearing green is trying to be better than me. (I'm in white.) Nothing happens one way or the other. Green is no better than white. Where I go, Mr. Green is right behind me, always trying to do better, if not doing better.
