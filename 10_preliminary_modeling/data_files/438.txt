I was in a place that I didn't recognize, but the people who were with me were familiar to me. There was a big group standing around a picnic table. My father was talking and saying "thank you" to all the people who comforted me and helped me through the tough times that I was going through. Then a housemate of mine asked if my father had considered her one of the people who helped me. He told her that she only helped me out a little. Since she and I were having problems, I didn't think that was appropriate to say, and I took my dad aside and said that what he said to her didn't help the situation between us. When we went back to the table, I was sure that there was going to be a big confrontation. I was surprised when no confrontation occurred.
