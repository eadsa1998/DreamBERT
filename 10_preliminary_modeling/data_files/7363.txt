I started a note to Jo in which I tried to explain why people who had every wish fulfilled as a prince might didn't really develop fine characters. As I was trying to word the application, I was interrupted. Later said I would go upstairs to finish it but someone had found the slip and I was afraid had read it. Since they had, I decided to leave it but found I had finished it. Mother asked if we'd have lemon pie and coffee. I said I'd like the pie if there was enough. The male guest said, "No thank you."
