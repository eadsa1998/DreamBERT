I was in New York with a group of friends. We were going to a Knicks game. We were driving. We came to a parking lot and asked where to go. The man was tall with a thick beard. He asked, "Are you parking here?" and we said, "No." He said, "Then I don't know where the stadium is." I said, "If we were going to park here you would know where it was?" He said, "Yeah." We parked the car on the street and walked down one street. A man came up behind me and grabbed me. He was older with glasses and his hair was messed up. I kicked him and grabbed onto his clothes. They ripped and I ran away. I was screaming and running as fast as I could but it seemed like I wasn't getting anywhere, like slow motion. I finally reached my friends and the man was arrested.
