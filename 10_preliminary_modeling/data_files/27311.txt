I dreamed we were having a large party at the dorm and everyone from the university was invited. I had such a good time, that the feeling of anxiety I felt, I thought was due to the excitement. Then I saw a fellow I had dated before. I didn't want him to see me. I still like this fellow but in the dream I wished he wouldn't know I was there. For the rest of the evening I tried to keep behind things or far enough away so he couldn't see me.
