I was explaining to Nana and Poppa how I didn't get an A for the year. I had gotten 50% on the Accounting exam and I said I got a B overall. This lady said I didn't get into the A form and I was thinking I wanted to so I could be in the same form as Eugene. I asked if I got an A next year could I get moved. I was saying how one guy (Eugene) got A's in all subjects, another (Darius) got almost all A's, another (Jeremiah) got A's, B's, C's and a D. And I had no clue about another (Bradley) because he never says anything.
