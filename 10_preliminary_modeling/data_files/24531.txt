It's late at night. I'm in the bedroom of my college friend John K.'s brother Jerry, who is drinking and using power tools. He isn't building anything of use. He isn't making much sense. My friend David is getting ready to sleep in his own room nearby. I'm trying to go to sleep on the floor but it's too noisy. Finally, I get up and leave Jerry's room and sleep in Dave's room in a bed. All the while I'm aware that in real life David and Jerry are not brothers, even though they act that way in the dream.
