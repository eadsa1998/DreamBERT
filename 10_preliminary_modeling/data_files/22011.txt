I won two doubles. One was a 8-5 and the other was 6 and 4 or 5. The 8-5 paid $95. I was paid in cash from St. Charles' church. I saw the double in the paper. A Bob in the first face and a Bruce in the second race. I'm not so sure of the names, but I have a vague picture it was that. I was going to school and I was going to look at the entries, but had someone around and was not in the mood to look. I saw George G. He had baloney for lunch. Louie Kaufman came by and took a piece of the baloney and ate it.
