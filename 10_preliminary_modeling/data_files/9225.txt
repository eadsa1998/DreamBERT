I went into my old SFI store. I was quite surprised at how much it had changed. The type of clothing they were carrying had changed completely from African-American cultural clothing to typical American styles. The way they did displays had also changed. Most of the round racks were two tiers. They seemed to have upgraded everything about the store, though the prices were still lower than you would find at most women's clothing stores. I wondered if Lisa S was around. I was walking around the store looking at their inventory, thinking that I might be able to find a reasonably priced suit jacket that I like. There seemed to be two offices in the store, in two different locations. I was headed into the office to my right. It was a long narrow space. Just as I got to the doorway, I saw Randy M come from the office to my left which was set back further in the store. I was disappointed to see him there. I didn't want to see him again. He was holding something in front of his chest that was about the size and shape of a ruler. It had a yellow balloon attached to it and he was joking around about it to the employees. I went in to the office and said something to whoever was in there about Randy M being there.
