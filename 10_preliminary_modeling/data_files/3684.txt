I am trying to send a huge text file on the Internet to Russia. They are going to help me. But I begin to wonder if this is too big a text to be sent and if the Russians can be trusted to work with it and return it. Now, I am watching a group of women, young,  who are hanging out having some kind of ritual party to get rid of the "losers" they had dated. There is some kind of container with a sign on it about the "losers." You can ritualistically put your "loser's" name in the pot. One woman is more aloof from the others. I see her leg as she steps out from the side to watch.
