Me and a few other classmates were chosen to join in a space launch with aliens. Before we got to the launch door, Hillary &amp; Melissa were shot by the aliens. But then I looked further up and Melissa &amp; Hillary were there. The aliens had been imitating them. We went onto the launch &amp; after we had taken off, they told us we had too many people. We had to choose the one to go. We chose Emily because she didn't hear us. Someone gave her an Orio and said he wanted to record exactly how she ate it. She willingly took one cookie and described it as she went along. She pulled it apart and said she had to lick the cream filling first, and then she ate the outside. Immediately after eating it, she looked at her arm and it started to turn green with red splotches, just like the aliens. She was pretty angry at us for tricking her. I somehow became their leader and one day I got so stressed out that I went for a walk and swim in a gorgeous little pond. After my swim, I went down to some sort of store and outside was a man. That's all I remember. Setting: At a space launch and outer space on some planet. Characters: Melissa, a classmate. Hillary, a classmate. Emily, a classmate. Aliens - never seen before but resembled aliens from "Mars Attacks." Feelings and Thoughts: Happy and guilty. I thought it was a good dream except when Emily ate the cookie.
