I was at school and we were playing hide and seek. I was running and Alejandro was yelling. Samantha and I ran off together and hid in these go-karts. There were big bulldogs nearby. Someone smashed a house. Calvin came and said that he was 'Chicken Boy' and was clucking. Seamus came in a train and was acting like Cartman (South Park). We all went back.
