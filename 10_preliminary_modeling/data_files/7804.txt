Very bloody and gory. It started out that I was watching the whole event. Like a bunch of people and dignitaries going to their very formal ball, a royal ball maybe. The only person I recognize is the woman who plays CJ on West Wing. Some of the people were dressed to sneak in and kill a lot of the people in attendance. They were particularly interested in killing anyone associated with this one vicar of the Catholic Church. They specifically killed one priest that was in their way. He was killed by the _____ the priest _____ an acquaintance so it took the priest completely by surprise. There was as green tablecloth with two spots on it. One of the killers poured some wine on both spots. Then someone said, that means that you're going to kill me too. The killer said, yes, you are wise. There was a chase with that person who was to be killed as they tried to get away, but they didn't. When the killers first entered, this one woman that I recognized, her date was one of the killer but she didn't realize it until he made the signal. Then all of the killers that were with him started attacking. She was trained in self-defense because she successfully killed or surprised several of the killers and remained safe. There were two girls, late teenagers, sisters, that were running away. They were with the killers and had been asked to kill these two little girls. That was over the line for them so they were trying to run away. Their mother was not one of the killers. She kept calling to them, Come back, Come back and we'll forgive you. The one girl gave up trying to run away and stayed with the killers. The other one came back to be with her Mom and her family. Where the one woman and the one killer were getting dressed to go to the event there was something about jewelry. It was as though I had displayed this jewelry but I don't know how to explain this. The images are really disturbing to me but I can't readily describe them.
