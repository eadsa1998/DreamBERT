My friend Sal's mother has a warehouse of stuff. Large boxes stacked up in a yard containing bottles of alcohol, cigarettes, pills and perhaps food. There seems to be a situation whereby these things are scarce, so it's a real coup to have them. These things don't belong to Sal's mother, but she encourages my father and me to take them and hide them in my father's house.
