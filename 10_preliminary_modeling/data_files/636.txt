My oldest son is going to school in the town next to my hometown. I rent an apartment for him in a building where all the students will live. Then I realize he can live at home and I cancel. My friend Alice shows up and needs an apartment for weekends. I tell her I'll check on the one my son gave up. Maybe she can get it. There is also something about a baby putting all kinds of things into its mouth. I find them and take them out but am not sure if he swallowed some alphabet letters and he isn't sure either.
