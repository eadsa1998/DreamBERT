["Teaching Jeanne Marie to survive."] Jeanne Marie is setting up a tent because she needs to survive in sub zero temperatures. She plans to camp out in the arctic regions. We sit in the tent and I explain to her that some of the walls she has put up do not completely cover the area. There are large gaps when the wind and cold will come through. As she is blind, I try and describe to her where she needs more protection. Mostly, the tent is inadequate to protect her. She will not survive if she doesn't have better equipment.
