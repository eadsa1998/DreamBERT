We went visiting friends. I went home for something and I found someone was ransacking or robbing our home. There were clothes in the floor from the clothes closet. I looked up the stairway and there was a young fellow who was robbing us. I knocked him down and out. Then I went to call Ann, but I couldn't get her. I was going to call the police and I saw one man with a gun above a man down. He was pointing the gun to shoot him. I ran at him to save the man and he took off when I got near. Then the phone rang and a small girl was talking, calling me daddy. He name was Aggie. I said, "You have the wrong party," and I hung up. A friend of mine came to see me. I told him that I was thru believing or rather agreeing with their untruths that they told me. He said, "Would you be able to work 14 hours a day?" I said yes, I could if I wanted to. We were preparing for someone's wedding, a friend's.
