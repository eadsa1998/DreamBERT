All I remember is the end of the dream: I was at a typical My school party, out on one of our many lawns, eating little sandwiches, and little cookies, and drinking tea, on a fairly cheerful Sunday afternoon. Then I went home and started making myself a brownie (just one) when my mom started asking me questions about a guy she thought I liked. Setting: At My school, then in my kitchen. Characters: My school students, teachers, parents, no one I recognized in particular, and my mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, confused. All I can say is I remember liking this guy back in first grade, but haven't thought of him since.
