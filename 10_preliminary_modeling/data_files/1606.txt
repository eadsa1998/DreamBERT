It's easy to learn my lessons now. I am in a writing class writing fast to keep up. Both my daughters and I are learning "freshman" writing together. We leave the class as it is over. It's crowded and I am in a wheelchair. I go up a crowded aisle, trying not to run over anyone seated on the edges. At the door I am standing. I walk out. It is dark and rainy. Ellie points to the next building and says, "there's the next class. Where's the path?" I walk ahead and see the path. "Here it is," I say.
