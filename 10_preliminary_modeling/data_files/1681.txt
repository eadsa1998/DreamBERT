It is nearing summer and I want to get my P.E. teacher's permission to work on my Master's project before she leaves for vacation. I ask Libby where Mrs. K. is. She's gone. "So where is Mrs. Six (high school English teacher)?" She's gone too. So I decide to go on vacation. Libby wishes me well. (She is English dept. sec.) I walk down this dirt jungle path and see creatures that are large birds (sort of cat faces and you can ride them). One is wild. I wonder if it's going to hurt me. Then I see it has a baby and I'm holding it. The mama is very upset and threatens me. I am careful not to hurt the baby. She watches me carefully. We form a tower. I see the village up ahead where I will stay and work. I try to imagine it as primitive huts, etc. I go into the house of my host family. It's nice. The family is in the dining room, down some steps. They see me and come up to welcome me. She points out my bed in the corner of the living room and he shows me a counter near it where I can eat.
