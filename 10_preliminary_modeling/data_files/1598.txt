I see Howard's scales and I want to stand on them to weigh myself. I notice that the scales are a book with a plastic protective cover on it. The real scales are underneath. I am in a house and I look for Howard to ask him a question. I am concerned because I can't remember paying the rent or the insurance for several months and wonder if he did. I paid the other bills but there's not much money left. He says he has paid the other bills and I feel relieved. A boy and a baby girl come romping up to me. They are my children. The little baby girl starts to nurse. I feel somewhat embarrassed and think, "Hey, there's no milk. I'm dried up."
