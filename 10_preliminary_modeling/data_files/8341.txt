I was driving down the street of a neighborhood that was familiar. [unknown in waking life] Every family owned a dog, most of them fairly large dogs. As I was driving I was thinking things like I didn't know they had that kind of dog Those two families have identical dogs Look how big those dogs are That dog reminds me of.
