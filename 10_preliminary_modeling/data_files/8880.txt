I was writing a document related to a contest. It was about the results. It was either to explain the criteria for judging the contest or to explain the different levels of winners. There was more than one chapter to this document. Throughout the dream I was working on just one chapter. It was so frustrating and such a struggle. I was discussing it with other people to try to figure out the best wording so it would be very clear to whoever read it. At one point I thought I had a break-through. I thought I had figured out what our sticking point was. I thought that by including this new piece of information our issue would be resolved. We could then finalize the chapter and document. As I tried to finish it with this recent insight, I realized that didn't fix it either. It helped, but it didn't fix it completely.
