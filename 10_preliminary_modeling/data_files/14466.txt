I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There was a second Buffy. I can't remember how she was around, but she was like the Buffy-bot. Spike was with her and angry with it because it was annoying. They were doing a strong spell and Dawn was doing it, which I thought was strange. Tara was with her. She stopped for a second and then there were two Tara's and they were doing the same thing. I was looking for Buffy stuff to download for Sims 2. There was lots of Spike stuff, but I also found Buffy outfits and a Spike Sim. There was a forum post and people replied with numbers, one of them was "167th!" etc. They were making a list of people who Spike had 'slept with'.
