I had a dream I was tall. Big, about six and a half feet high and I had on White's clothes. I was standing and could notice the height. I was talking to Mike Polca's dad and I asked him about the number four big horse and he said he will win. I was eating peanuts and they were big peanuts in the bag, about three-fourths of an inch long and about _ inch thick. I got the results and two other horses won besides the number four horse. I was thinking why I didn't hook them up in a reverse bet. The White's clothes were like underwear or dancing clothes and Audrey was with me dressed the same.
