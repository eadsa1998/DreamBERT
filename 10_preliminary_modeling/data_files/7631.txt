I was being chased. There were three men working in a kitchen or hotel. It was a huge room and there were many people around. They had on chef's aprons and hats. One of them must have been the head chef. The other two did something wrong that somehow was involved in me being caught and getting away. I don't know. The head chef made one of them drink a ladle full of dishwater.
