[1997-08-01] Dreamt we went to an amusement park as a matter of fact it was Six Flags and I remember hearing all the noise of the amusement park, touching the actual rides that I went on, they were metal and I could remember the seats, and we went on quite a few rides and I recall getting off the rides and they were really intense rides, they went up and down and all around the way rides do and I remember looking for my son and I couldn't find him for 2 or 3 hours. There was nothing wrong with him, he was off riding some other rides and I could hear him at a distance but every time I caught up to him I couldn't find him, he wasn't there. It was pretty weird. The next thing I remember was getting into the car and just slowly driving back home.
