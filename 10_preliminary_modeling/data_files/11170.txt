Our final swim show was taking place in the pool this evening. However, unlike the Friday evening performance, there were but a few persons scattered throughout the bleachers. Nothing seemed to be going right. During the various numbers, the lights would go out and the spotlights would not be shining on the swimmers. Instead, they were flashed in the faces of the audience. The girls in the show were not in their positions on time and throughout the entire show, some were sitting on the pool edge kicking and splashing while watching the others as they went through their numbers. Also some of us were sitting out on the bleachers watching. In addition to this, all of the girls were laughing and talking and calling out corrections to the swimmers in the water. Another thing, we weren't wearing the new yellow suits, but had on the old swim suits which we had used for practicing.
