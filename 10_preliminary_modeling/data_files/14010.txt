I was at this house in the middle of nowhere. I was with Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and going out with the former. Mom came up and left with him. When they left, Jared put his arm around me and we started making out. This black guy was a friend of his and was cleaning something outside and he knew about this affair we were having. I wanted to leave and called Mom but she only just got back and said it would take "70 minutes" for her to get back. I started locking all the doors and windows. None were locked because there wasn't anyone around for miles. There were stingy looking frilly curtains on the windows. This guy got angry and picked up the only car there and threw it into the water. Then he was this girl friend of mine and her name was Emily or Jade. She decided to look for a car herself instead of waiting for Mom. We went to this shed and she looked out the window and told me to get a badge and she grabbed this police badge. The only one I found had a fish hook on it as it was used "for bait". We made up names and went down. There were two cop guys there and they invited us to eat and there wives were sitting at a table. We saw the bad guy outside the window, but he had seen us earlier so as to not blow our cover we hid our faces. Then this guy with a gun walked past so we went after him. We ran through this crowded undercover place and everyone was shooting. I shot the bad guy but then my gun clicked as it had run out of bullets and he lifted his gun to shoot me, but this girl, who was an ex-girlfriend of his, grabbed him and shot him herself. I threw my gun to this kid and said "take the gun". This black cop guy got it off him. Then I was with Nana and I was going through That's Life. I had written stuff in it. There was a page where I had written stuff about Twin Peaks and then the next page had a picture of Kyle MacLachlan. There were photos of Fido and some other dog with its tongue sticking out.
