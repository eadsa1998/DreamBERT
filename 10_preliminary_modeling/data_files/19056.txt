I'm in a hotel room or a small apartment with Audrey and we're making love and having a conversation at the same time. The love-making part doesn't seem to be terribly much in focus. We're talking about Russia, and oh yea, something about dream studies or sleep studies in Russia. I'm saying something about how as usual everything is backward in Russia. The subjects pay the experimenters or that the subjects offer to be subjects for the learning experience in Russia. Then mixed in with that there's some kind of humorous thing with that's about an old Irish woman who is a maid or a cleaning woman. Now Howie ______________ gets into this somehow. It's like I'm playing a joke on this cleaning woman or she's playing a joke on me. I don't know which. But the point of the joke is that Howie Blane is dead. It turns out he really isn't but somehow or another I'm able to use his absence to get this cleaning woman to think that he's dead and I'm explaining to Audrey how she was taken in by all this, that is how the cleaning woman was taken in by all this, and how she went on saying something like faith now and the poor soul was only here yesterday or something like that. All this tmie I don't think we're having intercourse, but I'm sure getting ready to. Howie Blane is a friend of ours, a psychologist at Mass. General and as a mater of fact, I think this dream takes place in one of the rooms at Mass. General. Either that or the Hotel Sumerset.
