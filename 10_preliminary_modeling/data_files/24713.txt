I don't remember the first part of the dream. But I remember the end. I was at my circus class, and they needed three people between 90-120 lbs. I was one chosen. We climbed up like a 20 foot tower, and stood on something. I can't remember what. I looked on either side of me and saw Will (a boy in my real circus class), and a person, boy or girl, who was familiar, but I don't think she was real. We held waists, then jumped from the platform thing. We floated gently down, then slammed onto the teterboard (a circus apparatus) and catapulted the person on the other end into the air (Bill). Then, we floated up again, into the air, and flew slowly, barely missing hitting Sandy and Alexis (my contortion partners) and landed smoothly on a crash mat. Setting: In the gym I work out in. Characters: Will: 13 year old boy I know from circus class, brown eyes, brown hair. Alexis: contortion partner, 12, with brown blonde hair and brown eyes. Sandy: contortion partner, 12, with blonde hair and green eyes. Bill: we catapulted him on the teter. Feelings and Thoughts: Calm. I wasn't tired or worried or anything. I was totally calm.
