I was riding on something that might be called a train, except that all of the "cars" looked like flatbeds. There were no rails or anything to hold on to, but this was what everyone used for transportation. They simply stood on it while it traveled. The time period seems to be the Victorian Era. I was concerned about falling off so I reached up and put my hand on the shoulder of a man standing in front of me and said something to him about my concern. He reassured me that there was no reason for concern. He was wearing a dark green jacket and a top hat. We arrived at the center of a small town. I am walking around the town with this man and two other people, a man and a woman. The woman reminds me of a TV character named Miranda. The second man decided to go off by himself for a bit and then rejoin us. Miranda and I needed a restroom. The first man said there weren't any around. I suggested that surely one of the shops had a public restroom or one they would let an out-of-towner use. Miranda and I went into a women dress shop to inquire. The woman working there pointed to two doors, one for men and one for women. I went to the women's room and opened the door. The doorway was very narrow. I had to turn sideways to get in, and even then I really had to inhale and squeeze through. Inside, there was barely room to move. My arms nearly touched the walls on either side of me and there was little more room than that in front of me. There was no sink to wash your hands, just this tiny closet of a room. Miranda later went off by herself, leaving the first man and me to walk alone.
