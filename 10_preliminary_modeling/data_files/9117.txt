I was either writing a paper or grading a paper and inserting a couple of descriptive words that would show what it would take to earn each letter grade. Also a few descriptive words about that particular paper for each letter grade. At first I tried to create a table using Excel, where the first column was the letter grade, the second column was the descriptive words for the letter grade and the third column the descriptive words for that particular paper. When I inserted it into the document it wasn't very clear. It looked very fuzzy. I didn't like it at all. Then I tried doing it all vertically, instead of in a row. I didn't like the way that looked either and it seemed very confusing. It felt like I worked on this a long time.
