I was outside somewhere. There was a house behind me and my car and this other red car were on the lawn. A retard girl and her mother were there. The retard would open her mouth and go "dur!". It was really funny and I was trying not to laugh. I had to wash her head. I held Mom's hand and she scrubbed. Calvin was watching. My car looked orange, so I sprayed it with the hose, which caused the other car to go orange. Mom then sprayed the other car, which turned mine orange and we kept going back and forth.
