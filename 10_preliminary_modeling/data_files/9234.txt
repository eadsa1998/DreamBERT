I had another assignment at ITT and was walking around the building carrying a glass of milk. It didn't have much left in it so I didn't have to worry about spilling it. Jo was standing partially in her doorway, facing out, and leaning against the frame. She was talking to someone. I was going to stop and talk to her but since she was talking to someone else I just looked at her, nodded my head as a hello, and kept walking. I walked over to say hello to Sam and Holly. I reminded them that they wouldn't say goodbye the last time I was there because they both said I would just be back again the next week. I pointed out that it has been four weeks since I've had an assignment there.
