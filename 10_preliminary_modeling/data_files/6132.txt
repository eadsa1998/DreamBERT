My neighbor and her husband had their baby. When they brought the baby boy over to see me all these dogs were there too. Dogs were circling us. Not savage dogs, just normal everyday dogs. The baby was talking even though it was just born. It was years ahead of itself. The dogs were just sitting looking at the baby and not barking.
