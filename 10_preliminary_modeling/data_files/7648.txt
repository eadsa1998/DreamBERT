Vince P was partially clothed, laying in a fetal position by his dining room table. I heard footsteps on his stairs. indoors. It was his mother-in-law. I arose and looked at the stairs and asked if it was Sue P. It was dark so I couldn't tell. Vince P's mother-in-law was taking things to her car. She never said a word. After she was gone, he was telling me about these new condos and how great they are. I was asking him questions about them. He said he was getting a one bedroom that he and Sue P were splitting because she was involved with someone else.
