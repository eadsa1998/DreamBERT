I was studying for exams. I went out and Mom and Darren said I had to do something. On TV some guy had been asked to play a part in some thing that I think was fake but he didn't know it. Darren said I had to go see him at some place which was to prove my 'trust' because I was suspected of killing a friend of theirs. It was 1:30 AM. They said it was to see if I was the 'person I used to be' and I said "I haven't changed since I was six". As I stormed out the door with Mom, he said something about 'sucks on lollipop'. Mom's car was undercover and mine was out the front of the house. I went out to my car and I said 'Oh, I can't drive because of the night time restrictions'. I started walking back to the house and I saw this guy come running quickly from one house over. I saw him stick a gun up at Mom and I ran to the front door, scared.
