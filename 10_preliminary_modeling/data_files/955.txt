I am a counselor. A client calls on the phone. She is pretty upset. There's lots of activity, so I step out in the hall and pace back and forth as I talk to her. I calm her down and remind her to read the instructions I've given her. I say, "They're things I wrote." She complains that there aren't 3 things. I read them to her and then she sees them. Some persons from Bulgaria or Greece come and offer me wine. I try it. They are selling their wares. I see a price list. Everything is made by XXX and cousin George. Then, I am a Greek. I can become invisible at will. I want some truckers to pull their truck over to my spot on the side of the road to buy my wares, food and wine. They are mean and make fun of me, so I turn invisible and use the force of my mind to make them pull over. I wear a wreathe of flowers in my hair and dance in front of their truck and they follow. I lead them to a spot of grass where I have marked their tires and engine number. They pull up there. I have a banquet table set up for them. Then I see a national hero. He's driving a tank in the water. I go near to see and get caught under the tank treads. I become invisible so I won't be hurt. As they are Greek, they can see me and know I'm there and are concerned for me. I hold my breath and let the tank run over me and then I get up, unhurt. I go back on shore. The two Greeks join the banquet. They are very intrigued by me. For some reason, I encourage the mean truck driver. We all sit down to eat, the Greeks on either side of me. I am very beautiful.
