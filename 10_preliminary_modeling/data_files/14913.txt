I was at the train station, which was different. Noelle was there and she looked the same and I was trying to get a photo of her for my Wiki. She moved and asked if I was taking a photo of her and I said no. Later, I was living/going out with her? I wondered why. I left my computer and when I came back she was on it, on the net. It was in my room. I had a photo on the floor of me and Jared Padalecki from Comic-Con, and also the one of me and Jewel Staite. I had a stupid smile on my face in the one with Jared and I was annoyed about it.
