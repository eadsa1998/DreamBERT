Mom, Darren, Ezra and I lived in this barn. I had my computer and another computer, which I didn't use. Mom was on Neopets. I noticed that I had suddenly logged on and I was like 'How the hell did that happen?'. It turned out that Mom had 'guessed' my password, but my password was 'alexlumsden642'. I was saying "How the hell do you guess that?!" We had to vote for something. Calvin and Terrence were there. We went to this house and the rooms were all bouncy. They were all strange shapes and were too small for my computer to fit.
