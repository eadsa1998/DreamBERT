This dream had something to do with burning a CD for other people. I don't know who we is. I don't know if we were doing this to sell them. There were a couple of different pieces that were going on the CD. I wanted to make sure that they got burned in the right order. I also said when people put the CD in their computer to play it they would see the name of each file for each track. So I wanted to make sure that each track would be named appropriately so it would make a good impression. There was also something about dividing up the files or some such. Maybe the whole file didn't need to be burned on the CD.
