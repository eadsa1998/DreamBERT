There were three levels of something, in a big communistic sort of setup, also perhaps 1984ish. The top level was on the surface of this town, a sort of hick town; the second level housed mainly a cafeteria and also was concerned with information; the bottom level had all sorts of more subtle jobs and was where I wanted to be, because I wanted to get help to overthrow or change the whole setup of the place which I didn't like. The government forces were mainly concentrated in the top level, if I remember. I was being sent to the second level to replace a worker there, and had a cared for identification. The type of thing that was done there was that people sat around reading all sorts of books and copying them for use throughout the whole community (and censoring them, undoubtedly). This seemed like the height of stupidity and uselessness to me, which was probably another reason why I wanted to go down to the third level and try to find some way to get out.
