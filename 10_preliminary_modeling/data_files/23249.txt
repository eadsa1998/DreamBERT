I was taking Mary Margaret and her baby somewhere in her car.  I don't remember whether she had asked me to or whether I had volunteered.  I also don't remember the destination.  In any case, when we got out of the car, we went to a small store like a 7-11.  I noticed that she didn't have KC with her, and asked where he was.  She said matter-of-factly that he was in the car.  I was shocked and alarmed that she had left him there and ran back to the car, where I found him crying.  She soon came back and got in the back seat with him to calm him down.  I also got in the back seat.  It was really crowded.  I couldn't sit facing forward.  I felt very affectionate toward her, and didn't know whether she would reciprocate it.  I think she did, because I was worried that someone from her family would pass by, recognize her car, and see us in an embrace.
