I am in a house and Howard is there and I realize I'm late for an appointment in Roseburg and I get up and rush around to go. Howard, in the kitchen, in exasperation, says, "Why don't we just get over this part and settle down and do things together? You like to swim and I like to golf." I smile wryly at Katrina who is listening to this as if to say, "I don't believe I'm hearing this." I feel like saying, "But I don't want to spend time with you, that's why." He's going out the back door and I don't bother to respond to him and hurry out the front, slipping on the stair and it tips over as I walk down it and falls. I haven't time to pick it up and rush on to the garage. I see Howard's taxi leaving and he is still muttering angrily in frustration.
