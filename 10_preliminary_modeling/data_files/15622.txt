There were people in a park. Something started happening in the sky, like a split, that was getting lower and chopping things up and people were dying. A girl yelled to a group of people to get down low and they lay down on the ground. She got close to them and they asked 'how low' and it cut the girl's hair. One lady had the top half of her lead cut off. A building sunk and disappeared and then reappeared a bit differently. A few other things changed too, like an instrument that had been lying on the ground. They realised all the world was dead. They said they needed to find more survivors to make it fun. There were some more around the corner, including the girl's boyfriend and another guy that she had recently started dating as well. I was then her and I kissed him on the cheek as a greeting. We went into this building and then it was kind of half time travel and half parallel universe. We went down stairs and there was a gladiator fight. There only one good looking guy in the first group of people. He chased some big guy and went out a door and got trapped against a car. There were dead people everywhere and he got killed.
