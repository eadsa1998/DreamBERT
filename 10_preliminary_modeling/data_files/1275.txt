I am in a large store. Bonnie and I are going to have lunch. She has the food. We sit down. It becomes clear she isn't going to share her food. I ask, "Are you going to share or should I buy my own?" She says, "You need to buy your own." I go looking but I don't really find what I want. Someone comments that things are really icing up outside, like we're in Alaska or some place frozen. A man is near me. He seems to like me and me him. I still hesitate to buy anything. Some people, a family, goes out to their tent. Even when you pee, it freezes and is solid ice as it hits the ground! The man and I go back to the store to get mittens, hats, etc. The woman store owner asks what we want. The man bargains with her; we get things half price. He puts his arms around me and I lean into him. I kiss him on his cheek. I look for mittens. He brings a spray can. He sprays it around his neck and then mine. It's a white cloudy material that has sparks coming out of it. I don't want to breathe it in. It is supposed to keep us warm. We buy mittens, etc. and go out together to the tent to make it through the winter.
