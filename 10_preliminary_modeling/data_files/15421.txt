I was playing World of Warcraft. I was in a place with lots of lava. There was a dire dog and it growled at Ezra and he ran. Then it attacked me and I ran and jumped up high onto this cupboard. Then something happened to cause the whole place to implode and then rebuild. Then it was real life. I went to this shop place and Justin Bieber was there and some guys were making fun of him and I filmed it.
