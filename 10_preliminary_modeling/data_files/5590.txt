[1997-05-05] I was at Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia visiting Thomas Jefferson's house which I had already seen. I was down in the basement looking at all the clocks, a big clock that he had made. It has cannon balls on it. I guess my husband was with me. He and I were visiting and getting our own, personal tour of Monticello. We went there in 1989 with a bunch of people, but in this dream we were getting our own private tour. Going all over the mansion, up and down that winding staircase, in those rooms, looking at all the books that Jefferson had.
