Now I remember the image of the dream. I am with a very tender, sweet, affectionate cat and I feel that I really love him. It seems that he feels the same way because he rubs his body against my leg; I am standing. Then I go into a house and see some very fine porcelain figures on some shelves on the wall (at least I think so), and I have the impression that I must wash them. Then I go up (I suppose, because in my dream I am suddenly upstairs) and talk about something to my friend T. (she is about 40, married twice and twice a widow; I love her dearly. She has 5 children and one of them is already married. She is very understanding with me.) I don't remember the conversation.
