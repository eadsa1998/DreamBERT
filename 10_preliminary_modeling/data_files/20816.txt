A man with a radio microphone. His voice came over a megaphone. He was accusing someone in the audience of something. It was a lady, and the man was asked if he knew about her lawyer and he answered in the negative. Some man was ruing his having wasted time. I found out about some women who were using the wrong stand in the holy place.
