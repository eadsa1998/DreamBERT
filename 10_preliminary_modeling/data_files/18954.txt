This is a fragment. The setting was here in the lab. Everything was just about normal. I remember the image of the machine out here and also of the room I was sleeping in and someone in the bed. I won't say for sure, but I think the someone was me. Just as things were getting started, there was a noise out here in the other room that woke me up, so the dream aborted.
