Louie Kaufman and I were looking at a man's picture on the wall. He was dead and his name was Kingstone. Louie said he was working so hard that he died early from the speedy work. He was trying to beat everyone. Louie had his hand on my shoulder and we walked thru fields to work. We hopped over small puddles of water and saw frogs around ponds. Then we saw a big frog in the water. I never saw one so big. I got a twig and touched him, then he moved. We had to climb down a little cliff. I was to start working at a certain time. I always looked at the clock. Butler came to my mind, that he may be a winner in my dreams. I was in the screw dept. It got dark in there all at once, then the building trembled and rumbled. I ran out for I thought the building would fall apart.
