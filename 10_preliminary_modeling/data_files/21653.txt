On two occasions I had a dream of horses that won, but I can't recall them now. We were in a hideout or cave and the boss didn't want any prints left anywhere. We took our shoes off and took out some packages, then came back in and I put on my shoes. We were talking about dancing barefooted. I took a few steps barefooted in dancing.
