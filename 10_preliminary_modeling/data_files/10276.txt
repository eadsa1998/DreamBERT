Hillary tells me that PIPPIN, their dog is dying; they invite many friends and their kids for a "wake" Hillary is in the kitchen baking a cake; Ronald shows people around the house and where the emaciated dog put his head into a tree trunk and is moaning. We all stand around awkwardly; I write them a condolence letter, but feel awkward about it.
