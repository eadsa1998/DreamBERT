I was in a strange residential area. I came to a park that had a gully. I had an urge to go into the gully and hide myself, and so I did. Then I saw a woman and some children do the same thing, and I was glad that others also had urges like I had. Later I was walking with my mother and sister. They looked at my feet. It looked as though I were wearing my slippers with the red border. I laughed and said I must have left them at the pool in the amusement park where I had been swimming. Then I noticed that they were not slippers. They were my shoes. I laughed and said why would I have my slippers with me at the pool, anyway. They laughed too.
