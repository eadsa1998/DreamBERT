I go to a crystal ball reader. He's late so I go into the room to wait. I go peek in the ball. I'm curious. It is clean. I see nothing. I want to though. I sense the reader smiling to himself. I'm not supposed to look into the crystal ball but he knew I'd try. As I leave, I am reading a newsletter. The reader has published my story. He tells of my back history, disease, marriage, and mistaken beliefs, but points out how changed I am now, how good and smart and neat I am. I am embarrassed but also glad. It's about time I get recognized for my positive side. Ginny comes in and mentions I owe a penny here and there on past postage. I am embarrassed and say, "Yes, I meant to pay that but I just put it off. I'll do it." [BL]
