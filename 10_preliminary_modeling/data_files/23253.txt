I am the owner of a small clothing store or the manager of the clothing department of a bigger store.  There are four or five young people working for me as sales associates, most of them girls.  Two of them come into conflict because apparently a customer who was kept waiting got mad at one of them and the other one did not come to her assistance.  They are almost in tears.  I calm them down and gently tell them, "I know you are both working hard and doing your best, so don't worry, I'm not mad at either one of you.  Just remember that you are part of a team; always be cheerful with the customer, and be alert for situations where you need to help each other out, so that you can give the customer the most pleasant shopping experience possible."  This is almost literally what I said.  It seems to reassure them.
