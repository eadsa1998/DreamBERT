I'm going to my school. I pass through a hall filled with booths that sell junk foods of all kind. I say, "I'll probably not eat much, but it's nice it's available." I get into an elevator. It goes up and then sideways. I travel a long tunnel which I think of as dragon's breath. It is smoky with misty swirls. It stops at my dorm room #451. I go in. My roommate asks which setting of light I prefer. There is "brilliant" and "dimmer." I choose brilliant. She wants dimmer. I give in to her. Now I'm on a couch and Jon sits next to me. He touches my breast and I lean over and whisper to him that if he does that again, I'll punch him in the face and yell out loud so people will know. He backs off a little, but hangs out close by on the couch.
