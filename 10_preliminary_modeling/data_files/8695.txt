I was at some kind of a not-for-profit organization doing volunteer work. There were quite a few of us. We had to do community service because of traffic violations we had each received. The place was very dirty and messy. It seems that maybe it is a homeless shelter like it as the people there are all unkempt. Melissa J was there. She said something very brief to me and I acknowledged what she said with a look and maybe a nod of my head. We were getting ready to leave and I noticed an arc shaped tear about 2 inches long in the upper right leg of my jeans. Someone told me that I should go tell one of the supervisors about it. I guess they thought the organization would reimburse me for the ripped jeans. I dismissed it initially because it was such a small tear and I felt responsible for it anyway. We had to go see the supervisors to check out. When we reached the counter the person I was with something about my jeans. When I looked down they now had three very large, straight, vertical tears. One was right in the side seam. One was around the pocket and the other was about two inches further towards the front. Two of the tears were about 12 or more inches long and the other was a few inches shorter.
