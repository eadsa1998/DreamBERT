 I'm in a group of men where a wicked man is killing people. I may be killing people as well. There is a huge gun there, mounted for stability. The wicked man is after me. I hold him down and yell for someone to grab the big gun and shoot him. The wicked man has a ray that he shoots me with, and I slowly die. I grab a broomstick and try to shove it through his heart. The ray is then channeled into the end of the broomstick. The wicked man gets shot. My friends Kevin Simpson and Hank Anderson and I are left there. I have a gun that shoots lasers. I fire all the lasers bullets so the three of us will have to fist fight. The winner will fight Hank, though the main fight is between Kevin and I. The fight between either Kevin or I and Hank should be no match: we will beat him easily. Kevin is then Jean Claude Van Damme when we first start to fight. We fight for a long time, punching each other with hard blows. We talk while we fight; we're not angry, we're just talking normally. He is resilient. I land most of the good punches. He holds up well. My high school classmate Marybeth Neumann is there. My friend Bubba Hacker is there wearing an orange chicken skin shirt. That is his new job. Kevin and I fight over something that is trivial to us, but important to most people.
