I dreamed that my roommate (20) who would never consciously do anything ethically wrong, had just come in from a date with a fellow (21) with whom she had almost been pinned to a year before. She was completely happy and content, not withstanding the fact that she had just slept with him and she was now pregnant. The fellow came into the dream pictured as a martyr who will make an honest woman of her, so he gave her a set of rings that were nothing but stone or glass - big and glaring. He had no recollection of ever having intercourse with her, although he admitted that they had fallen asleep in bed. My roommate was happy that at least she had him to herself. I was surprised at her reaction and wondered how she could ever feel that he could really love her, but she was unconcerned.
