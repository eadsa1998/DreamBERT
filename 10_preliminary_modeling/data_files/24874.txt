I was lying in bed at about noon in my mom's room, and I was pregnant. All of the sudden, I felt like I was going into labour, and then all of the sudden there was a baby right in front of me. Setting: In my house, in my mom's bedroom. Characters: Myself, and a baby I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Tired, anxious. It was so strange because it was so short and I don't really understand the dream.
