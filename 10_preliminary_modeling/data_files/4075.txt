["Walking and Losing The Crowd"]  I decide I will walk on a long hike with a group of people. My Aunt Naomi, Aunt Charlotte and Bonnie are also on this hike. It seems to be all women. My Aunt Charlotte saves a place for me near the front of the line. We begin the hike. I walk around and come back to the line and can't find Aunt Charlotte. I ask Aunt Naomi where she is. She says Aunt Charlotte decided not to come on the hike. I am a bit upset, as it was she who promised to save me a space up front. I feel badly about cutting in line. I realize I need to go pee. I leave the line in search of a bathroom. I find one. The door opening is odd. The toilet is directly in the doorway, facing into the little bathroom. In order to shut the door, I pull a small segment of the door over the toilet and then shut a second segment of the door with straps on it. I think about just leaving it open, but decide to go to the extra work of closing it. I then pee. A woman from the group comes in and angrily tells me I wasn't supposed to leave the group. I'm in trouble now. I now go back to join the group. They are gone and I don't know which way they went. I feel nervous about finding them. I feel upset that I am walking for such long distances. I don't know if I'll make it. I feel tired already. The hike seems too long for me to manage. I see a woman and ask her where the group went. She says they went to the Shanghai District of the city. I am surprised because that is such a short distance away. I realize they are taking it easy the first day to help us build up endurance and strength to make it the whole journey.
