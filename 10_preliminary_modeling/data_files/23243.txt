I am trying to get to my class on time, and I am in a walk-in closet looking for something to wear.  First I am looking for shorts, but I can't find any, and I decide that that wouldn't be appropriate anyway, so I pick out a pair of gray slacks.  I have lots of different short-sleeved shirts hanging in the closet, with brightly colored and unusual patterns and fabrics.  I can't decide which one to wear, and it is getting later and later.  And the longer I take to decide, the fewer choices there seem to be.  Finally I pick one and rush to class, which is in the same building.  I run and slide down a ramp leading to the door, and into the classroom.  I am already 20 minutes late, but there is only one student there, a female.  I see a cockroach running across the floor, and I run to try to step on it, discovering in the process that I have on one shoe and one flip-flop.  While I am trying to step on it, another student, a male that I know, comes in.   The female student asks if we can go to the Capitol, and I tell her no, there isn't time.  The male student tells me he wasn't able to do the homework, and I tell him that I will accept it but count it late if he gives it to me the next day; after that I won't accept it.
