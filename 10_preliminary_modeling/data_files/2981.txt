I have to do the next round in the comedy challenge and I can't decide if I should do the routine I did before or do a new one. I feel very nervous. There are a series of places I must go in sequence to do the routine. The first one is in a living room late at night. I keep getting distracted and now it's time to do the routine and I don't remember all the old routine. I sure wish I'd practiced more. I start to talk, saying anything that comes to mind and some of the jokes are funny. I tell them I had dreamed a joke and naturally wrote it down. It was very funny, but when I woke up I looked at what I had written. It said, "Frackel ummm orange." Everyone thought that was very funny and laughed. Then a man starts talking to me, sort of interviewing me, and I spend the rest of the routine time talking with him in front of the small group of audience members. I hope it counts. After it all, I must rest before going on to the next round and lay down on a sofa bed (hideaway bed). The man who is attracted to me lies down beside me in spoon fashion. He is hesitant, but he wants to and I pretend to be asleep, even though I enjoy him being near. Then he reaches over and kisses me sweetly. I do not respond, pretending to sleep and enjoy the kiss. He says, "Please don't tell my wife I did this."
