I was at some area of chemistry.  It looked a little scary.  In another area, there was a group of people watching a movie.  I was with them.  A seemingly nice guy said something to me, and I sat with him.  He was probably going to flirt with me, but I chose to make no assumptions and enjoy.  Then 4 other guys came over.  All the others had moustaches.  I thought about my boyfriend Jeremy and how he doesn't have one, and thought about saying I like that better.  They were all nice and talked to me, one especially.  4 of them left, and so I was left with the last nice guy.  I got up and went somewhere, but got lost on the way back.  I had no pants on.  I wanted to leave.  There was some transition from that into an odd sort of game that I did not seem to be very good at.  I was to lay out my clothes covering Jeremy or our cat Buster.  There was some trick to it that I couldn't get the hang of, of covering some spots twice before others once before time ran out.  Jeremy encouraged me to keep trying. Then it was something of having to pass inspection before I could leave.  There were some odd shaped (semi rectangular) neon lights above, and the clothes had to be completely clean and unwrinkled before I could leave. I started to get upset.  Bright orange shorts- no, black, no..Someone oddly dressed came into my room (where I now was) and wanted to help me.  I ended up dressed like a clown (more so than she). <br/
