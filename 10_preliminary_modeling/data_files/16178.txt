Samantha and Sandra and Derek were in town, they were staying at this hotel. And it was like a hotel and a school, and I had the Peavey system in a math classroom and I was going to give a talk to this business about how I set it up and how to use the stuff. And so, but I was in this math class and it was so cramped. The guy could only give me like one little desk to put my stuff on, and it was like he was going on with his lesson plans and I only got like five minutes to show them the system. Then we moved on to the next room, except we got Samantha, Sandra and Derek and we went to the park. And we set up the system by the playground. Don't ask me how we got power to it over there. And we took the wireless microphone and I walked over to the lake, around a ways, and I started singing a song, and people were like staring at it, like where is the person, what is going on here? And then I come back and I never did get the presentation figured out, I woke up.
