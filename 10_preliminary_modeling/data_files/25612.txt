 I see my classmate Kate Francis in the lounge in my dorm. I go in. She is wrapped in a towel. I sit next to her. There is a movie on the television. We talk a bit. I don't want to seem too concerned about sitting distance, so I sit right next to her so we're touching. I flirt with her. She leans over, and I put my arm around her. We kiss. She withdraws after several moments. She asks me to go get coffee with her. I tell her I won't because it keeps me up at night. She says that it keeps her up too, and that she vomits to rid her system of the caffeine.
