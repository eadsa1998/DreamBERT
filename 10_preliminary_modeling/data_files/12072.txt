There were these animals -- llama's, I think -- that kept laying eggs. There was this other section outside, around a shed, and there were more animals. There were lots of steps. I was trying to avoid people. There was a fair thing on, with rides, near the school. This guy was hanging around me while I waited for Dad to pick me up. He liked me.
