I and another person and "my little brother" are walking on the old cemetery road in my hometown. It is spring or summer but it is cold out and we can see only a few people at the lake. A man is at the bottom of the hill cutting branches with some kind of cutter and we are afraid of him. We are trying to figure out addresses when suddenly my brother disappears. We suspect the man did something with him. Then I discover a hole at the end of the road. I reach down and the hole is so deep I can't touch anything but air. I know he can't be breathing as there is dirty, oily water in the hole. I have my friend reach but he or she (not sure which) can't reach either.
