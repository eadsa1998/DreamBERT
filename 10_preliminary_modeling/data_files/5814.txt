this night I had some disjointed dreams, very hard to explain. It seemed like I was switching tools, sorting them by touch, tools for a piano, but there were no pianos in the dream. There was like transferring of things. Later I dreamed that I was in a car, in the back seat and the car swerved around a large curve or a corner and to the left almost to where I had to lay down in the seat. I don't remember anyone else but me and the driver who were in the car. It didn't seem like anything of significance, the tires squealed...that's it for today.
