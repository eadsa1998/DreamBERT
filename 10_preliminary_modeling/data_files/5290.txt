Last night I dreamed that I was in the auditorium. Wyatt was mixing some music on different CDs for me. I was really excited! Wyatt gave me the CDs to copy. Then my mother, brother, and I all had to go on some trip. A spider crawled out of my brother's backpack and he threw a huge fit. We all walked into a grocery store to buy snacks. I wanted to get juice boxes in the store and my mother got really upset. She bought my brother chips. Then she remembered that she had left something important at home. So we had to leave. Then I was in the auditorium and it was snowing and everyone was dancing. Then I woke up.
