["Toastmasters and love."] I am in a room and a friend asks me to help her practice a speech. I ask her some prepared questions and she responds with a speech. She is practicing for the contest. Then Del comes in and announces he loves me. He then walks back out the room. I am startled and don't say anything. As he gets to the door, I realize I should say something. I don't love him so I can't say that. So I blurt out "That is very sweet." I wonder if that is hurtful to him as it is not reciprocating his love.
