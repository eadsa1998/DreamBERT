When I got back to sleep, I dreamt that I was wearing a summer polka-dot dress that I have. I was in my car with my mother and with a friend from the university who was wearing lilac. It seems that we were going to the bank, to the safety deposit they have underneath. But the bank in the dream was near the main market, and this is not true. Then in my dream it looked like the bank's vault led through a tunnel, known by everyone and lit, to the market. That is, the bank's vault led to a subterranean tunnel which in turn led to the lower part of the market, which is several stories high, and we were going through there and went to the stores. But my mother stayed in a store which was not the kind of store they have in the market building, but rather an ordinary store like you find in any corner of the city. And we stayed in front of that corner, but our corner did not look at all like the one in front, since the store in which we were is at the main square in Lima, and in the dream there was like part of the Lima portals on that corner. Anyway, we were working there. It seems that, in the dream, there was a fixed closing time, and if we didn't, they punished us and chased us, and the store where my mother was did not want to close. We had already closed when we heard sirens and other signs that they were coming to punish the people who did not obey the orders, then we (very scared) were going the other way because we had not seen my mother. Then I saw her and together we went desperately through the tunnel and we came out in the bank. But as we ran, the other people who were late also ran, and I woke up.
