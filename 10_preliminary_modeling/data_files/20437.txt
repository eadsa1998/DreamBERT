I worked in a shop as a patient in a hospital. A boil had appeared on the side of my left hand below my pinky. I saw it swell until it resembled a finger about two inches long. Then it began to go down, but it immediately began swelling again. Someone gave me a bag of food, and I ate some. The shop workers were leaving the ward. I decided to stay on the ward because I was to be discharged in a few days and because of the boil on my hand. But after they left, I decided to go. I had difficulty because I did not know the way. I knew it was near ward 9 or 11. I told some patients about my difficulty and asked if they could help. I came to a strange ward and helped move some furniture into a living room occupied by a doctor. The doctor and a lady were asleep in a nearby bedroom, and when they awoke, they left the room and went into the hallway.
