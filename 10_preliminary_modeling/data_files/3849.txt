["Fired."] I am being fired from my job at community college. I am upset about it and want to fight the decision. I talk to some woman who is surprised that I was fired. I explain I was told that the reason I was fired was that I needed a special permit card and my circumstances didn't allow me to have one. She says to me but that's not true. I have a special card. Because I am a friend of community college and a girlfriend too. This means that she has several relationships with community college and she shows me a plastic ID card community college issued to her. I walk to an office to talk to the woman in charge. She is Rosie O'Donald and is taking care of her baby as she works as an executive. She doesn't listen well as she is distracted by her baby. I help her wrap some things but that doesn't help the situation. I need to go to the bathroom. I see a small bathroom and ask permission to use it. She says it has no toilet. So I go down the hall and I hear my Aunt Naomi who is teaching children their letters and sounds. I pass that room by and find the restroom. I go in and see the toilet which is hanging on wires and swinging back and forth. I sit on it but the swinging won't stop. A girl comes in and stands near me. I am concerned I will spray urine out onto her shoes as the toilet is simply a swinging bowl that is hanging above a cement trough. Bicycles are hanging up on the wires as well. People, families, wander in and out.
