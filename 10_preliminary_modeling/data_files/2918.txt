I am at the Kennedy compound and I am very tall, maybe 6 foot and 50 years old. I had been working hard at regaining my body tone and strength and I dive into the swim pool and dive in the 12 foot deep end and swim with strong strokes. I am aware that I am not as strong as I want to be or think I am as I try to match the powerful strokes I am imagining myself doing.
