Mateo is visiting. He is lying on the couch beside me and I am tickling him. He spills some juice on a folder on the floor and I scold him. "Look what you did. No, no." Ellie and Bonnie come in bringing someone's laundry to do in my machine. Ellie shows me a photo with $12.00 written on it. It's a receipt a friend of hers needs to get someone to help her pay her bill. I get up to find Charla.
