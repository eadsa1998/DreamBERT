I get into my special car, a sports model, red and sleek, convertible. It only needs a 1/4 of a gallon to go hundreds of miles! It practically drives itself. I suspect aliens gave it to me and am a little suspicious of what I'll have to "pay" for its use. I pick up Ginny, Ernie and their two boys. Bonnie will meet us there. I touch the door handle and it opens, the key turns and starts the car. I have mirrors all over the windshield so I can see everything clearly and the car drives itself when I'm not concentrating on the road. We get to the support/training area. I have several grocery sacks of things which I put under a table. I tell myself to remember to grab them if we have to leave suddenly. I play a tiny banjo-like instrument and tease a cute little cat with it.
