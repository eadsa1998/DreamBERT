Ezra and Mom were going to be checking out a Technical College thing. Mom had to go look after a shop and juggle lots of different tasks. I was talking to Ezra and asked what he was watching. He was watching The Fugitive and I said, excitedly, "Transit cop! Neil Flynn- I mean Janitor! Yay!" and left. I was saying Janitor like JD does as I walked out. I went to Mom to remind her about the Technical College thing and she yelled at me, but then left. I was watching Scrubs and JD and Kim were in bed and she was pregnant and cuddling JD from behind.
