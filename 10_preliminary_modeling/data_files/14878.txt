I was at university, which was different. I got a text from Dad about a sticky calculator and he was a teacher. This girl said "I thought you were here to talk to Terrence" and I said "uh, why would I want to do that? I haven't seen him since I was 12". I saw Evelyn leaving. I also saw Eugene and some others at a table. I couldn't find the proper way out, but I managed to get out. It was hard to walk out to the road. There were two buses on the other side of the road but they both left. I waited for the next ones, and a huge crowd gathered. We waited for the traffic to slow down so we could cross. I text Mom to say that I didn't have my SmartRider. This guy came with a gun and said to give him our phones. I said I didn't have mine. The girl next to me gave him a wallet instead. I pulled out a $5 note and said it was all I had. He told me to stick my hand in my other pocket and I pulled out a 20c coin. The guy now looked like Eli Roth, but was some other famous guy. I was talking to Ezra on MSN over my phone and said "I'm being held up, go away". He kept pressuring me to give him stuff. He told us to go, so we all went across the street and he tried to push me into the traffic. I waited at the bus stop. It finally came. I found my SmartRider in my bag. I tagged on twice accidentally. The second time interrupted this girl and she ended up getting left behind.
