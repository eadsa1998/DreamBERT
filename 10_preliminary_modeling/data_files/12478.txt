I met Michael Novotny (Queer as Folk US) and we were really good friends. I was reading a book of Ted's (Queer as Folk US) which said something about Gus and Mike growing old together or something. He was with this guy and then two girls. There was a sheep and it knocked a puzzle and there was also a frog. Someone said something about being "well-hung". They said that they were "6 inches" and that Michael Novotny was "9 inches". I was like "ew". Then we were at this court. There was a doctor, who was actually a photographer, who was supposed to come, but his secretary came instead.
