Same house. I am a detective. A woman (me), is terrified. Something is out to get her. She lays on a bed and hears vampires and werewolves hissing and growling in the room. She's afraid to look. Then they go away. She accuses the detective of being a bad guy as he left for a time and could have been the one to hurt her. She calls in some high official/father. The detective (me), denies the accusations and knows that she's really the "bad guy" out to get herself and try to explain it to her. She is actually hurting me with her accusations.
