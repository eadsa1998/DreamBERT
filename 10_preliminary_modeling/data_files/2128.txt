A young girl is in trouble. She's been isolated and abused. A baby and myself decide it is time (past time) to try to help her. So we're taking reports of her situation to other people. We are going down stairs and some of the stairs are missing. I carry the baby and carefully step over the gaping holes. A man says, "Oh, I forgot. Even adults need help sometimes." We get downstairs and see the axe the partying teens used to chop up the stairs. A military man named Harry is kind and wants to help me help the young girl. She's a handful.
