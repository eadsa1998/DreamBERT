I was in Texas listening to someone give a speech. The scene shifted and I was in another part of Texas listening to a speech given in an enclosed place with an open top. It was like a television show with lights, etc. Someone in the audience asked me where we were. There was a large flat lake near us, but desert all around otherwise. I said we were near Corpus Christi or Corpus something else, I can't remember. Then I was in a hotel going up to see the princess. When I got to her apartment, I saw a lovely light blue permanently pleated nylon negligee lying on the bed. It had a darker blue tatted edge at the bottom. I admired the gown very much.
