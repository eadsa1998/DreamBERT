I dreamt that I was high up in a building. I remember it as being on the 21st story. It seems that the building was built in the shape of a square with a very large open center. While I was up there a battle suddenly developed in the open space inside the building. It was complex, even to the point of airplanes flying around, shooting at each other. I took part in the battle for a while, shooting at the airplanes which were flying around level with my position. While this was going on the enemy with foot soldiers took the first floor of the building. I realized that I was on the losing side and began looking for some means of making my escape. It was not clear in the dream, as to how I did it, but I remember sliding, as on a circular chute from floor to floor and finally to the first floor and out past my astonished would-be captors. At this point the dream ended.
