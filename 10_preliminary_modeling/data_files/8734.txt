I'm having a conversation with someone who is familiar with the CAS company. They were somewhat aware of what had transpired with me there. This person was telling me that Bill C and Bryan N were now having problems getting along. They said it didn't look like Bryan N was going to last long. I don't think I actually responded. I was thinking that I was somewhat surprised because it was Bryan N, but then it didn't surprise me either because of the history of employees with Bill C.
