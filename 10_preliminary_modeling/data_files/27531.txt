I dreamt that a group of us, M-- students, were sitting around in a room in a building on the M-- campus. What this building is I don't really know. I had a vague impression that it was a room in the library, yet this particular place doesn't actually exist. While we were speaking with one another, an old woman, who looked well over 80, came into the room accompanied by a middle-aged woman attendent. The aged woman was dressed in a vivid lavender dress and had striking white hair. Her face was quite lined, and after she left one of the girls mentioned the fact that part of her face was paralyzed. I hadn't noticed this. Before the two women left, they glanced for sometime about the room. Then the oldest woman said, to one of the girls, "Do you know who I am?" The girl replied in the negative, and the woman told her that she was Mrs. H-- who had donated the money for the building we were in. She didn't reveal that she was the donor, but we all knew that she was. She had come to look around before she died, and was pleased to see that all was well here. Then she departed with her companion.
