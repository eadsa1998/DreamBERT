 I'm in line in a bagel store. As I near the counter there are women on the side, kind of in front of me. I feel it is unclear to me who was in line first, so I motion to them and say, "Go ahead." They act righteous, and say that they were there first and they will go ahead. I feel dumb for offering to let them go first, since they said they were first. I get two bagels: one with blueberry and one with apricot jam. After they're prepared, a woman working there submerges the bagels in water to cut them. I get some English muffins to carry the bagels on top of.
