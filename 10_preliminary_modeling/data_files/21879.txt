I was working at White's and John Serino was foreman. I got a cold and they put me in a hospital because there was not much work. I lay there and some woman patient came in and lay beside me. I held her hand and she liked it. She said it made her feel better. I then went home and came back the next day. I asked John Serino to get a check out from the hospital. I got in a line and there were a lot of people. I went into another line and it was the wrong line. Then I went and asked for information and he fellow asked me if I was religious and I said I was, so he said, "You go down to the end of the room." As I walked, I saw nuns in that dept. So I stopped and turned back because they were serving meals. I met John Arendar outside and we talked. I told him we had very little work. I was in the shop and machines have been moved and I was replacing some of the things. I pushed a pump into the ground and then I turned the faucet and the water gushed out. I was dreaming of horses. There were strips of a sort of barrel like and each strip was a name of a horse. I can't recall any names now.
