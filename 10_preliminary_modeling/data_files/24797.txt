We got an assignment at school and they handed it out to everyone. Later on, I saw knife stabbings in the wall all over. It was a big knife. Leticia was on the phone, and I was on the phone in the alley. Setting: In an alleyway and at school. Characters: A few classmates, and Leticia (a friend). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, worried. I felt happy to be with my friends but then I felt scared in the alley with the knife. I wanted to run.
