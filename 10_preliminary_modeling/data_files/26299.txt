 There is a young black boy that flies. He is swept off the ground by the wind. I feel this: I am the boy. I float in the air, being held up by the wind. I don't want to fly. The boy doesn't want to fly. The boy wants to be on the ground! He is able to pay the bills now, and because he now has the money, he should be on the ground. The boy is up high, over a fenced-in area. I am he. I don't want to land in the fenced-in area! I'm glad when the wind blows me away from it. I turn my body so as to reduce the wind resistance so I'll fall to earth. The boy meets a black girl who is dressed in orange and is riding an orange bicycle.
