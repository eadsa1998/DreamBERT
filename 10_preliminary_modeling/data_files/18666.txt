There was an old TV show with America's sweethearts. Paul Lynn and Mary Wynn. They now both lived in my building and were old and crazy and sat at a table talking about the good old days. I made a sculpture out of kitchen sponges and wrote on it: I can't do things neat. There was a contest to build a chair with paper mache and a little table attached. I had been working on the computer till I wore it out. The 7, 8, 9 and 0 keys had broken off and there were just little pipe stems. I got indents in my fingers from punching so hard. There was a 3 hour TV show--a cartoon with a real movie too about a band called the God haters. It was a life story about a man dressed in black who was a dancer and The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The tall tall guy had a vest on and over his stomach was printed--healing. He had on black sweat pants.
