In a lofty church. Gowned choir mounting stairs to balcony as at Coe. Among them one man rushes in late without gown. (Scene shifts.) I, taking part in a play, am a man making love to a girl. (Preceding year I had a man's part in a woman's club play.) Go to kitchen, see piece of lemon pie. Mother says I may divide it with J., M., and F. I start to eat and am called on for scene 2 of play. Lines forgotten but it doesn't matter for play shifts to one like Torch Bearers and we are playing behind scenes. Can see people in front tearing down set scene. Poor audience. Think it's too bad and is because Torch Bearers weren't very good.
