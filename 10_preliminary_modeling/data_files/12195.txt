There was a sports carnival. I ate my lunch before school accidentally. There was a Ventura thing. I was watching [something or someone]. Ezra put something for him? Everyone was hugging me. It was Samantha's birthday. There was a bomb with chicken? Something was jumping over something to the end. There was a squishy table. [My notes were extremely messy].
