My girlfriend and I were sitting on a couch in her house. Suddenly my girl pulled a gun from my pocket and handed it to me. She begged me to shoot her. I was mortified. I ran to the door but she ran after me. I knew that her only wish was for me to shoot her. I pulled the trigger and then I began to laugh.
