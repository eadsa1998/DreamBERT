I was at school and we had an assembly in this big room. This guy told us we got 'free' lunchtime now, which meant we could decide when it started and ended. Ms Solomon wouldn't tell anyone her kids last names, then someone was like 'duh, it's Faisal'. I left and called Mom. She was at a radio station outside of town trying to "get to 100Â°C". I tried to call Dad but didn't get an answer. I walked out and saw Mr Reilly. I realized I had no keys. I found some food Mom had recently eaten, which was from a place in 'Liddleton'. I tried to find it. Ezra was friends with Jensen Ackles on Facebook.
