I dreamt that I got up one morning and decided to wear a pair of loafer shoes that day. I couldn't find them and I searched everywhere but all I could find were summer sandals which I thought inappropriate because it was snowing out. I kept thinking it was impossible that I could have mis-laid them because I valued them so highly. Finally I recalled that I had thrown them away because they needed repairing.
