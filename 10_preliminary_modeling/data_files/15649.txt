Ezra, someone else and I went to see a sequel at a cinema. A later session was the 'premiere' but we went with this one instead. As we left, Bruce Willis drove up and parked right near the door. He said hello to us and followed us in and sat in the back of the car. I accidentally locked it, then unlocked it. I tried to take a photo but my camera kept screwing up. Dad went to the later session with Ezra and a friend.
