Rottnest was having problems. It was actually a manmade island and kept sinking. I went to some Timezone place with some guys. I liked this guy called Shane, but then I liked this guy called Steve. Later, Ezra was on the island when it started sinking.  There were two Spaceman's. Ezra left on a boat and he thought that he'd thrown one off.
