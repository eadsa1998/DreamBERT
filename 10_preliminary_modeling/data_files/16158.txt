I remember vaguely. We were in the old brown truck that we used to have, and for some reason it was a stick shift. And Dad and Mom and I are starting out on this long road trip and we're driving this stick shift. And I think the radio was being real difficult, so we just shut it off, and I had the notion that the ____?__, and I think a back-up one too. And I think I remember something like -- oh gee, so vague -- you would shift the stick shift and there was this chain that would kind of whip around a little bit. And there was this stuffed dinosaur in the truck that was like hanging around on the floor, and I think the stuffed dinosaur got in the way of the chain. I don't remember. And then I woke up.
