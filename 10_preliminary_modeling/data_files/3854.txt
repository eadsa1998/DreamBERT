["Archie and I dance into love."] I am in a kitchen. Archie is there too. We begin to dance in a Contact Improve way and we are sensually making romantic love while we dance. It is sweet and tender and exciting. I hop up on his waist in the front and he leans way back and we balance while twirling around. It is wonderful. An older woman comes in and she is confused about something that happened in a class or group I was teaching, probably about dreams. She is asking questions and I am trying to explain to her as best I can. Now apparently Archie and I are in love and living together. We are always together, intertwined. A small sink is next to our bed, in my room. Each morning I get up and I see globs of blue toothpaste in the sink from Archie brushing his teeth and not cleaning up after himself. I am annoyed but I also feel fine about cleaning it up for him. It is a loving gesture. A way to help him. I scrub it out, then brush my teeth. We are going back to our work, and Archie says I love the morning ritual you do. I love watching it. I giggle wondering what he meant. He says I am quick and efficient and do the same thing each morning. A man comes by. There is some problem at work that Archie and I and the man need to fix. His wife Mabel Wynia sent him a noodle and cheese casserole to feed us during the work. I feel pleased that she knows I am there and wanted to help me too.
