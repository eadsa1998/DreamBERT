I am in a room that is lovely and spacious, an old-fashioned fraternity kind of room, windows, etc., but the entire room is cluttered with glassware, red glasses, dishes, etc. It is very pretty, but there is not much room to just be. I am in a bed with a woman roommate. I am smoking two very long cigarettes. I hold one and smoke the other and then switch. I have trouble keeping them from falling in the bed and starting a fire. The cigarettes are slim, long and silver in color. It's time to get up. I go on out and now I am with two men in a sort of room. They are my roommates, but they are sort of strangers. We're in this "room" until our regular room is ready. Finally it is ready, room 406. The man goes ahead. He asks if I need help walking or carrying my things. I say no. He goes around the corner and now I am alone and wondering why I didn't say yes, I could use help. I ask directions of the room and see a tall four-story building of hotel rooms and they point to the 4th floor. I start walking. Somewhere in there, I call a lawyer, or threaten to call a lawyer.
