I am seated in a big fancy wheelchair right in the first row in the center so that I am right up next to the stage. I wonder if I am blocking the view of others sitting behind me. I am aware that I've never seen a show from this perspective before because in high school I always sat in the back, because of my fears. I watch some show on stage and afterward am mingling with the crowd. Two tall men stand by me and I am aware that I am seeing from a new perspective. Men get to see things that short women can't. He laughs and says, "You mean you've never seen black straps and wrinkles before?" (meaning from their tall vantage point they can look down women's dresses. I think with some concern, "Why would I want to do that? I'm not a lesbian, after all." My father sits in the back row and I go to him. I help him carry two huge axes. We go to the parking lot and see his vehicle which isn't working. I place the two axes in what I thought was the vehicle, and now have to retrieve them because they are laying on the dirt ground. I reach in where the truck should be and get them up. It is hard to do. He watches. Then we walk over to the trailer he had pulled. It is an odd hand-made wooden house trailer with an open wall on one side. I get in. It has a long wooden bench on the long wall. My mother is seated there.
