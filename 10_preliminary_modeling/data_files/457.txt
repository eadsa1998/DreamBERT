It was the beginning of a new quarter and I was taking a bus or shuttle to campus. I was pregnant and I knew that I was supposed to give birth after my first day of classes. It turned out that I gave birth on the bus to a baby girl. Knowing that I had to go to my classes, I took my baby to daycare only a few hours old. Then I went to my classes and by the end of the day, when I went to pick my baby up, she was crawling around the daycare room. The room looked like one in a house, not a school. I couldn't believe she was crawling because she was only four hours old. I went to pick her up to cuddle her, and she crawled away from me like we were playing a chase game. The daycare worker commented on how fast she is when she crawls. "I could barely catch her," she said. When I was holding my baby in my arms, I felt so happy because I had been waiting so long to hold her. I wanted to name her Angelica, but couldn't name her because I had to wait for her father to come for us so he could name her too.
