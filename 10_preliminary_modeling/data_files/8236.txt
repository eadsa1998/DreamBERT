I had gone into my bedroom but it wasn't like any bedroom that I've had in waking life. There were two light switches. I tried to turn on the lights but none of the lights would come on. The room was pitch black light. Just as in waking life I don't like to walk into a room that dark but I did anyway. I tried to turn each light on at the light source itself but none of them would come on. Matthew came to the bedroom at one point and I told him that I needed him to help me get the lights on.
