I had English, but it turned into Accounting. I was in the library. We were sitting inside the area when you first enter. Our bags were inside and Eugene's bag, which was empty, was on top of mine. I was trying to get a pen out of mine. Nick Frost was talking to us. He said that he'd be the first to admit that he "fancied Jess" (Jessica Stevenson). He went on to say how great she was. Everyone was like "Whoa! Didn't see that one coming!"
