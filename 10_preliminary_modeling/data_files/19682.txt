In a half reclining position on a cot. An unknown lady at other end, facing me. She is the mother of a young lady about 25 years old who was to be married today. For some reason the marriage is to be postponed. Some visitors enter, and the lady on cot explains that marriage is delayed, and tells, as a joke, what she had said to someone, namely, "Oh, we can have it by 9 o'clock." She meant breakfast but the listener thought she meant the marriage. She looks at me, winks at me, and asks me to confirm her statement -- "Didn't I say that?" and I nod my head yes.
