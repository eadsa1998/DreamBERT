I am at the lake where I swam daily in the summer as a child. I wonder what I am doing there. I am with two male friends. Both are well dressed. I am in a bathing suit. I go swimming but it is a very confined space. They decide to join me but want to go into the bigger part of the lake. One of the men is wearing blue pants. They take off their clothes and get into swim suits. We say goodbye to another male childhood friend (whose nickname was "Gut") who is standing on the dock and we jump into the water by way of a small falls which leads into the lake and we all swim together.
