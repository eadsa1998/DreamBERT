I recalled a woodcut that I had seen in a dream. It was on a Sunday School leaflet and represented the head of a most humorous looking donkey with wide open mouth, stretching over a board fence. Underneath I had read in capitals, "Am I not Thine ass?" I thought this was quoted from the account of Balaam's experiences in the Bible.
