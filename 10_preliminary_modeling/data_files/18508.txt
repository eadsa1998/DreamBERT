I was driving into the parking lot at Bargain Bucks. A man was very afraid I was going to drive through the plate glass window. A man was driving a light blue and white beautiful old car with tail fins. It was from the 30's or 40's. I had given him my keys but he didn't know and couldn't figure out how he was going to drive 2 cars at once. So he gave me back the keys and I walked home from the 'time and temperature' sign on the corner. My neighbor Maz was making room in his apartment and organizing and he had a friend who stared and never said anything. I started cleaning too and was very proud I'd filled a garbage bag with old newspapers. I knew the linoleum was very used because it was covered with very UGLY wall to wall carpeting. I decided to put a small old drawing table in there to cover the carpet. A man was interviewing me inside the apartment and asking me about the problems of dogs, people and cats shedding hair in apartments. I told him I was no expert on cleaning, but I used to clean this fancy loft for Bryan Hunt. Bryan came out and did NOT say "Hi" but started highlighting a pretty young girls hair. He had her chin on the table and her big blue eyes were staring open. It was very cold and I went to the Spanish bodega to get some saltine crackers and stuff to make oyster stew. There were no oysters and so I was gonna get just milk and butter and cook that, but it had disappeared from the shelves. Only odd Campbells  soup was there. Clear watery soup with 3 or 4 thin, thin brown twisted noodles and a few black beans floating amongst them.
