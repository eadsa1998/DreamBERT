 I'm picking raspberries in the back yard at home with my sister Ramona. I'm eating a lot of them. I go back and rally search for all the berries I missed. There are bunk beds in the driveway. My friend Tim Zelling is there doing something having to do with working on a car. My friends Stephen Ramos and Nelson Eastman called for me. They called me ego'. I call them back. There is mail for a Mr. Janet Foley at hour house. My sister Heather is Mr. Janet Foley. It is her mail. I have a huge scratch on the back of my neck, which may be from my sister Ramona.
