My partner was going to my mother's house with my eldest daughter. I drove them there, dropped them off, then took the car up the road. Suddenly, at the top of the road on the left side there was an expanse of open ground (which doesn't exist in reality). There was some kind of art show or sale going on in what looked like a large school building.
