 I am next to a building that I later recognize to be Mason, the Brimson college cafeteria. There is a kid there on rollerblades. I go over by a car. I find a ten-dollar bill. It is counterfeit. One side of the bill isn't printed. Then I find more bills, including 20's, 5's, and 1's, and I check the bottom sides to make sure they're real. The guys around me start scrambling to pick up the other bills. I shove a bunch in my pocket. One of the guys takes a $20 bill out of my pocket. I catch him and take it back. There are a few little kids trying to take photographs of me as I leave, as if I have done something wrong. I go into Carter School and a kid follows me in. I am careful not to let him get a photograph of my face. I go up the south stairs in the school. Teachers are there, some of whom I recognize. Finally I let the kid take my photograph, but I make him/her promise something before taking it.
