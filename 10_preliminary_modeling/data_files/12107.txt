I was in a car with Calvin and some people. We were trying to get away from bad people. The car stopped working. The bad guys took one person. I was at a place, and I went into a little shop but I had no money. I sold newspapers and I was going to buy water but I stuffed up. Calvin went in there and asked for water. Water was hard to get. This lady in the shop wondered why we'd been hanging around. I was then in this water and this crocodile was trying to get me. I got over a fence and some dude said "Aint it dead yet?"
