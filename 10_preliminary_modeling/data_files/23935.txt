I was over at Julia and Drew's house. Mom was there too. Drew said he had a surprise for Julia so we went to the garage to look. It was this aluminium electric go cart. He was all psyched about it. It looked like a big waste of money to me. Anyway, I noticed my arm was getting really cold and tingly- sort of like a when you have cut off the circulation in your arm. The thing was though that it wouldn't go away. I started to worry and asked Mom about it. There was a little spot on the inside of my arm that looked like a little varicose vein. I felt like that was causing the problem. Like it was dried blood in there blocking my vein. I asked Mom to squeeze it for me. She squeezed it and it was very painful. The dark vein area shot out along the vein and spread. As I went inside to look at it the dark spot erupted and blood began pouring out. I couldn't stop it and so I screamed for Mom. I began to feel very weak because I was losing a lot of blood. There was blood all over the side of my face and in my hair and all over my clothes. I was taken to the emergency room where there was a long line of injured people. I had to wait and was on the verge of passing out. I was holding my arm in the air to stop the blood. The people in front of me did not seem as in bad shape as me but still they would not let me go first. Next thing I remember is sitting at the hospital and my arm was fine. The secretary guy asked if anyone wanted to make some money and work as a waitress in the hospital cafeteria. I said yes. Later on, I was hanging our the Bill, Mark, and Matt who I met at a tobacco store where I was buying some cigarettes and 4 used tapes for a dollar. They gave me a ride. I felt really out of it from the loss of blood so I was in a daze. We stopped somewhere and then they left later and forgot me there. I was really weak but I had to get home. They hadn't know about my hospital visit that day. [Julia = my sister; Drew = brother in law; Matt, Mark and Bill = friends]
