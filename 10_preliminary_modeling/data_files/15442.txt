I was at the old house. I woke up to Ezra getting organized to be taken to dads [also happened when I woke up in real life]. Everything felt weird. Then I was at this weird place with halls. One had this curtain and there was a hand behind it -- it was the 217 lady. I tried to scream but no sound came out and my throat was sore. I ran and she was walking down the other hall. Then I was home again. I found my phone and called Mom, but Ezra answered. I said I was hallucinating and that someone was trying to break in -- there was an Asian girl outside trying to pick the lock. I said "I thought it was a dream, but it's not". I went to my room and packed up my externals to go to dads. Then I woke up. An Asian girl was at the front door and she was naked. Rover barked at her and Mom told her this was the wrong house. I said 'I dreamt this last night' and Mom was like 'of course you did, these Asians are always doing this'.
