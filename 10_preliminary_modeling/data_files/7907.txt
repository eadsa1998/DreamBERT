Some men came in and worked in the upstairs bathroom. It was not the normal WNA maintenance men. I didn't even know they were going to do it until after it was done. They replaced the upstairs toilet with an old toilet that was all nasty and rusty around the rim. I was having all kinds of trouble with it overflowing and I couldn't get it to stop. They also replaced the sink and counter fixture with this big ugly unit that had two trashcans.
