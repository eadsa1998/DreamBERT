I dreamt that I had become pregnant, although I wasn't married. Obviously I had had sexual intercourse (with my boyfriend, TG) although I can't recall experiencing the act in my dream. By the time I realized I was pregnant I was in my second month. I was not in the least bit worried or frightened but even happy, and I told my parents (mother, 45; father, 49) about it. They weren't at all concerned or ashamed of the fact and told me to ask TG to marry me. When I told him he said he couldn't until he finished scratching his uncle IG's back. There was no reason why he should have been scratching it, but he was. I became very angry and spoke to his parents (mother, 52; father 55). His mother told me how unjust that was and said she would speak to him. I also told his father and he became so angry at TG that he began to beat him up. At that point my dream ended, and I was in the stage between being awake and asleep; but I was acutely aware of the fact that I was very married and when I finally awoke completely I was in a cold sweat.
