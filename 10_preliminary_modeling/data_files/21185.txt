A fellow showed us a piece of gold he held in his hand. Another man tried to force him to let him know where the gold was, but he wouldn't tell. I saw an object jumping or bouncing on the sidewalk, then it bounced over the bank. I had an idea it was under the sidewalk where the bouncing object was, so I dug under the sidewalk and came to some bricks and they were made like a vault. So I took the bricks off and I saw wax paper rolled in like dynamite sticks and there were fuses stuck in them. I found the treasure before I could open up the sticks. They started to sizzle and I threw some in different directions, then it dawned on me to pull out the fuses, so I did. I was supposed to have found a recipe in the treasure chest. I looked on the sidewalk and there carved in it was Johnny. I looked at it. Our small baby had some kind of rash, pimples all over its body. I called for a doctor and I couldn't think of his name. I held the phone for a long time, then gave up. Ann went to the doctor and he held her in his lap as he examined her. I saw a lot of school pupils get off a train when it stopped just so they wouldn't have to pay their fare. I saw my brother. I told him I was sorry for what happened to him. He was small as our Bob and was sort of sad.
