I went back to the arts center in my high school. A new black theater teacher was running 12th night. I was dressed in costume. I had to prove that I was a former student several times over. I remember standing near the stage, unsure of what my role or lines would be this time. I was frustrated with the lack of direction she was giving, and the procedural rigmarole of her letting me into the theater. I was visiting a family on the water front. it was a nice place. They'd taken to me, even though I barely knew them.
