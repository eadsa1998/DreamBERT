I was given an orientation tour of the theatre arts department.  We had to learn proper procedures for things.  A girl was brought up for a musical expos√©.  I thought I had plenty of time so I hung around a few minutes to watch.  By the time I ran to the other side of campus, through class, to the dressing room below, the lady trying clothes on who I was supposed to help (I was to be an apprentice), reprimanded me severely.  My mother was there and held my guitar case (?) and gave the woman a compliment on the outfit.  I was dismissed.  I went outside with my mother.  It was dusk.  Soft blue light emanated from lanterns.  They could turn, display pictures, to show me where something or someone was.
