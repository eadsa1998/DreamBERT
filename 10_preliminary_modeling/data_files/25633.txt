 I'm standing outside of Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. I look at a clock. I am waiting for a woman. A person I have a crush on, Jackie Hunter, and her friends walk by. They ask me if I'm waiting for them. I say no, it's a long story. I ask their names. I introduce myself. I have trouble hearing Jackie say her name. She has a visible red rash above her shirt line on her chest.
