I'm an art student at college. Jasper, who runs the course, is my tutor. I'm to prepare a presentation - a show of some kind. I plan to paint a large section of pipe white, with perhaps some text on it. I find a section of concrete pipe - large enough to climb inside - and start painting. However, half way through I change my plan. I managed to persuade two other students to be human sculptures (a lad and a girl). I art direct them. They are to huddle together to form the shape of a tube - similar in dimensions to the pipe I was going to paint before. They somewhat reluctantly agree, but their proximity to each other becomes embarrassing for them - especially because (for some reason) they have no clothes on at all. Almost in a trance, they begin to engage in sexual activity. Then the boy, who is half covered in white paint, snaps out of it and pulls away. He starts ranting about how he didn't want to get involved in this.
