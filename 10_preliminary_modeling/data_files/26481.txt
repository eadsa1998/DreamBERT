 I walk into the Armstrong High School gymnasium for a basketball game. I'm with another man. He goes and sits in the bleachers. I see my friend's father, Dick Zates. The national anthem is playing. I turn and stand while it plays. The game is being played, and the teams are terrible. One of the teams is particularly bad, with small and tiny players! Clearly one team will win. The teams seem to be red and blue. There is a huge tall large man on one team who literally kicks around the person that is guarding him. The playing guarding him is one or two feet tall: a helpless little ball. I realize that Armstrong is the team that is terrible, that is small. I look over at the bench and see four or five very young, short, small boys. I know coach Jackson Shooter is giving everyone a chance to play, but this is ridiculous! These players are pre-pubescent runts!
