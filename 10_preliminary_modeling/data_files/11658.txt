My twin brother Seymour and I were among a large number of soldiers arriving at an Army airfield in Japan. Several other GIs were boarding planes for return to the United States. Both of us were very happy to learn that we were returning home tomorrow by air. Our group was divided into units of six men each. I was number 11; my brother number 12. The first unit left at 12 o'clock. Our group was to take off at 2 o'clock. Before leaving I told number 13 that he was unlucky as his unit wouldn't leave till the following day. Then my brother and I were in a small plane the pilot of which was Capt. Arnold (m, 26, an officer in our unit while I was in service). Though our group was supposed to be composed of six men; only my brother and I and the pilot were in the airplane. The three of us were in the pilot's cabin when Capt. Arnold went to the rear of the plane instructing me to take over the controls. That was the end of the dream.
