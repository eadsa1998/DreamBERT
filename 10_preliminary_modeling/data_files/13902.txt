I was at a shop and it was someone's birthday and I was invited. I had to wear this yellow singlet and I asked Mom to get me some pants. It was 4.50pm and she wanted to go to these other shops before they closed. Then it was Jewel Staite's birthday and she was hugging and kissing everyone and I said "happy birthday". Then it was someone at school's birthday. I was surprised I had been invited and wondered why I came. I got my log book even though I didn't know how to park. There was a mistake on the certificate and it said "Staite, Jewel" instead of my name. I rewrote it. I was taking out plugs and took out my computers one by mistake.
