I was in a Chinese restaurant and I started to order a great deal of food, and I didn't stop ordering. I ate so much that my stomach hurt. I continued to order and order and I didn't seem to stop eating. The friends whom I took there left me alone there because I was such a gross pig. They didn't like the jokes about Johnny that I was telling.
