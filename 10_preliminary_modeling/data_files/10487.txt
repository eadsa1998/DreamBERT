Remember calling Pedro to have him join me in a park to camp over night. He says he has to be with BOB and although I already have set down a blanket space in the field, I agree to pick up the blanket and drive home alone.... Argument with Wendy with fellow with black curly hair, whom she likes, but she says that it is I who want to have an affair with him.... We speak French together and debate about going swimming. I ask "on y va?," but he has another date. I look into my coin purse and for money and my key.... I make sure that the key is among the quarters in my coin purse....
