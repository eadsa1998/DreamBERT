It is necessary to study and learn more about femininity. I see a southern talking blonde, helpless type, and she changes into a well-dressed woman with a dark suit, a black picture hat and a red rose. She's beautiful, self-assured, and strong. Bette Davis is the director. She's pleased I've noticed I don't have to be traditional, soft and helpless to be feminine. [BL]
