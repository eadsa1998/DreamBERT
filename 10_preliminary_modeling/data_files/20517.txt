I was having difficulty getting some clothing from a vending machine. I had inserted coins into it. A man nearby was operating an amusement park concession consisting of small automobiles. He came over and showed me how to operate the vending machine. He told me that when the machine discharged the clothing, it gave off heat that recharged the battery that operated the automobiles in his concession. When he pushed a button to operate the vending machine, a spark automatically went from the button to a switch connected to his automobiles. (When I awoke, I recalled that yesterday I was reading that criminologists say that emotional deprivation may cause juvenile delinquency, and that intellectual gratification can be a "recharger" for the emotions. I concluded that the vending machine represented intellectual gratification, and the concession represented the emotions.)
