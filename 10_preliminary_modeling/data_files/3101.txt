I am walking and looking for my hotel. I look ahead and see an underpass bridge of a freeway. It is huge and cement. I suddenly remember there was an earthquake yesterday and maybe it would be dangerous to pass under this huge structure. I hesitate, afraid and not wanting to be stupid and just go, regardless of danger. I watch and see that other people are walking under it and decide it must be OK, then. I walk under it and no problem. I now can't seem to find the hotel I'm going to. I walk around, looking. It should be on this block, on the right. It is yellow.
