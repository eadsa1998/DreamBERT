I was at school. Ezra asked me where SS10 was. I told him and went into my class. I checked what class I had and realized it was Accounting. I hadn't been in the classroom before. I saw Bradley and Eugene there. Scarlett sat next to me. Melodie was a little while up from me. The teacher came and I got up to get a pen out of my bag and she wouldn't let me. We had to press down on the paper with these coloured textas which made rays. I marked them all with a pen first and then I wanted free time. Everyone finished eventually. I forgot to write down my dream.
