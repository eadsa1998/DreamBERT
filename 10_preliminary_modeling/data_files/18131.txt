I was in my hometown and not very far from where we lived (not actually), was a hill on top of which was a pond. In this pond a heron lived. I thought it was a beautiful bird and I wanted to watch it, but my sister wanted to catch it and kill it and dissect it. I was very indignant and wanted to scare the bird away so it would never come back. It seems that everybody else in the family was in agreement with my sister. I couldn't understand why this should be so because it was such a pretty bird and there was no sense in killing it.
