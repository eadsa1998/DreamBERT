 I'm sitting outside Super America playing poker with my friend Paul Jones and others. Paul and I each get a straight flush. Twos, threes, and eights are wild. He has the 10, 9, 8, 2, and 6 of hearts. I have the 10, 3, 8, 7, and 2 of spades. We both have the same high card. He notes that he has less wild cards in his hand. I see this, but don't want to lose, and quickly point out that my suit, spades, is higher than his, hearts. He admits this, gives in, and I win the $10 in the pot. I offer him half the money because of our indecision. I wouldn't mind if he accepted this, but he declines. My friend Kevin Simpson is there with a funny brown hat and a jacket: being his goofy self. My friend Nate Nelling shows up and slaps down five or ten dollars on the table. I will give him chips for his money because I've got the chips, but I don't want to get into gambling, and I know Nate is a gambler.
