When I went into the dining room, a table for six decorated with colored flowers was set up in the living room. There were muddy-looking place cards but I couldn't read the names. I went to a larger table outside and asked Miss W. if there was room for all of us. "No." "Are there place cards here?" I ask. "No, I had no money for that." I explain I had gone in for a book and finally sit down at the larger table for she would have set up place cards for her pets. Some one comes in and says Miss Hens. had passed away. I am surprised because I had seen her well the evening before. I start to eat nuts and another person repeats the news. Miss W. points to another table where two men sit although it is not set and says, "Others can sit there. The tables are decorated for Thanksgiving." But it is the Sunday after.
