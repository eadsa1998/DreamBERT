 A man gets back from ice fishing. He is older but quite competent, and reminds me of Mr. Smith who lives on 8th Avenue and 1st Street in Oak Valley. He has five clear plastic bags filled with frozen fish. I guess that he has 47 fish there. Then I think that there must be more. He's putting them into the freezer. I help him do this, and I comment that these are some big fish, particularly the pinfish. He also has northern pike and Walleye in his catch. I ask him how he does so well, and he says that he hooks the worms through the back of the neck.
