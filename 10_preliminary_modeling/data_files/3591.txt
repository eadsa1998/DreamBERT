I am sort of Sally Fields as a comedian. I come out on the stage, in front of the huge, billowing curtain. I, the dream ego, is watching from the wings. I see Sally dressed in a blue sequined gown with see-through overdress and her act is taking off parts of the outfit and the outfit look keeps changing. Now I am her and I look far down at the small and distant audience. The billowing curtain nearly knocks me off stage. I keep hissing at the curtain woman to open the curtains a bit more. She finally does. I come up with a funny bit of lines where I wait until they get nervous at me not speaking and then I say, "This comedy thing is harder than I thought. Apparently you have to say witty things and then they love you...apparently not. And they have to be funny to other people too." The audience laughs, but they are also dancing and running around. They are so far away they look miniscule.
