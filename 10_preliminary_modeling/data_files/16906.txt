In the dream I have a second job at night that involves going to a huge nightclub complex. It's a multi-story building and full of different kinds of entertainment including different themed bars but also more strange things like a crawl-through 'house of fun', the sort of thing you might find at a fair. I find this place strange - I wander around on my own - perhaps followed by a camera crew. There are connecting corridors and staircases that seem more like a hospital or a cheap hotel than a club. It feels like a large social experiment - a kind of government institution - maybe even a mental institution.
