I am in charge of selling tickets to a dance. People are already lined up to go in, but I'm not set up yet. I have to find Josh's vault that has the tickets and money in it. I go from schoolroom to schoolroom and can't find it. I see Josh and he takes me to where it is. He says it's the latest, best model and opens a luggage case and pulls out the stamps, money and tickets. I comment that I am 45 minutes late. He says there's a $32.50 charge for the use of these materials. I am surprised and not pleased. He changed it to $3.50. I don't check it out. I need the stuff, so I decide I settle up with him later. I go and see lots of people going into the dance. I say, "I've got the tickets," but no one buys. I go in and announce they can buy their tickets now, but still they ignore me. I also see a sailor go by the table and I become aware that he stole my money.
