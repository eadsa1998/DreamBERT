I seemed to be in a learning environment, albeit a very unusual one. In this setting, each person was in an individual carrier of sorts. Perhaps something like a boat. However, we were evenly spaced apart and moving at the same rate of speed in two separate directions. The closest thing I can relate it to is an amusement park water ride. I don't even recall the purpose or what we were doing there. Whatever it was, I recognized that I was afraid to make the high jump down into the water, now without my carrier. There was a man below me in the water and he was throwing things up into the air and I was catching them and putting them into a compartment above and behind me. I was particularly interested in this man until I caught one thing in particular. When I caught this rocket-looking, blue and white item I thought it was a sign that we were meant to be together. However, when he realized that I had caught it, he instructed me to give it to his mother, that it was intended for her. Later something similar happened, I believe I was below and he was above and caught a bead necklace that I had thrown, and he then realized that we were meant to be together. Our places reversed again and I was catching nearly every necklace he threw upwards. Later we were on a beach. We were in training for something. We had to pass our training to be able to do whatever it is we were applying for. Something happened that we realized that we needed to hide from a group of people. There were very large orange flowers all over the beach. At will, accepted members of our group had the ability to turn them into beach umbrellas for camouflage. They did so until the danger had passed and then they turned the umbrellas back into flowers. I thought this was very cool because I realized that I would soon be able to do that- when I completed my training. Because of my connection to this man I had no doubt that I would be accepted. We ended up getting married.
