 I'm in a room with a male ski instructor. He talks about piano-type skiing, which is where someone drops in on a mountain from a helicopter. It's called piano skiing because the keys on a piano correspond to the depressions in the snow from where the person landed. My friend Nate Nelling and grade school classmate John Ryan are there. There are small brown paper bags of apples. I take an apple to eat. I'm in a motorboat driving down a road, with no water. The road seems to the one that goes past the police station and post office in downtown Wilmerton. We go westward, and are past the main turnoff for 3rd Street. Nate tells me a dream. John asks me, "What does control mean?" I think this is backwards because usually people ask what a symbol in a dream means, not what symbol corresponds to a topic like control. We're outside a house. Somehow Nate spills a garbage can there, and some of his own garbage. He rips his shorts. I'm annoyed, and start to clean up the garbage. There is an empty cigarette box and a lot of candy wrappers from small colorful gel-fruits. An old woman comes out of the house. She's mad that the garbage is spilled. An old man, her husband, is then there, to my left. Nate and I apologize for the mess, and say we're cleaning it up, but the couple says they want us to leave. I wonder if a fly could get into their house, sneaking in unnoticed, and survive. I think of this as if I am the fly, hiding under the table .
