["Bonnie and I cleaning up."] Bonnie and I are at some store like a big shopping center. I notice that employees or guards are watching the exits. I don't like that and feel suspicious. We move away from them. I see a huge pile of stuff. Clothes, toys, lots of things. Bonnie and I are trying to sort them, fold them and pack them. The girls are there, running around, playing. They aren't interested in what we are trying to do.
