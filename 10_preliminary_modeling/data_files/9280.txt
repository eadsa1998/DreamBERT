I was working at ITI. I went to make some copies. I lifted the lid of the copier and found a chemisette laying on it. I was very upset by this because it wasn't one of mine. It had three large holes at the bottom of it. I went to the copy room a second time and found another one. Neither of them looked nice at all. Someone there had heard about my chemisettes and decided to copy the idea and sell them to people working at ITI. I was very upset that someone was doing this, not just because they were copying my idea but because I didn't want anyone to think mine were anything like these, as bad as they looked and as poor as the quality was.
