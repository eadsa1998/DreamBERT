I dreamed I was putting my contacts in, and the contacts were big, stiff, rectangles.  I had to fit them in my eyes, two corners on the bottom first, then the top corners.  I got them in, but they were really big and cumbersome, like an inch or two high.  I had many small dreams this night, can't remember now, but I woke up feeling like I had overcome a lot, and figured out a lot, and was much stronger, mentally healthy, and able to get things done.  It was a breakthrough feeling.
