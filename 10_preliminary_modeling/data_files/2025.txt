I'm in an exercise class and then go to my dorm where I'm a head resident and feel rushed, needing time for quiet without people, but not slowing down to get it. I go to a cafeteria to get some food. I want a glass of milk. A boy hands me his cup. It had milk in it, so he rubs it clean and gives it to me. I thank him and pick up a pitcher to discover it is water. Another one has gravy in it. No milk. I buy some cheese, please and chips.
