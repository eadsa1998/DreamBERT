Before I went to bed and began this dream, my mother hit my brother for coming in late and I held him while she hit him with a leather strap. This dream was short: I dreamt that since I am the oldest brother, and have a certain amount of authority at home, they could no longer hit me with the leather strap because it had been a long time since I had fallen, and when I was a kid, I fell almost every day. So I was very confident. Then I saw my mother come in with a whip, telling me the fault I had committed, and in spite of my denials, she gave me a whipping, and I don't know what I did because I don't' remember any more. There was something about sports in this dream, but I don't remember any more.
