There was a hill. People with guns were hunting people and wild turkeys. Children with guns could hunt people too. Fishing was OK for non-people hunters and I had a rod and reel and the bait kept getting took. The guy in the tiger suit had taken the head off (of his tiger suit). He said, "This lake wasn't here this morning. It probably doesn't have fish." "Oh you have to stock 'em, don't you." He said, "Yeah." I said I could catch fish at my grandpa's and bring them here, but the water had already drained out (of the new lake). Cats were there. Lots of gray cats. Kitty's ancestors. Cuddles' descendents. I looked at their eyes but none of them were her. (my kitty) One cat had glasses. Black glasses. A boy had leukemia for 8 years and stayed 8 years old an extra 8 years so really he was 16. A guy on top of the hill said, "What kind of MS does your mom have?" and I said, "The 2nd kind I think." And he said he didn't think I was right.
