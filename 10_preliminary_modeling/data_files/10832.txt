I had a dream where I was riding in a beautiful car on a highway over the Pacific Ocean. The beautiful scenery and the ocean I can recall. I remember how relaxed I was taking this trip and how much I was enjoying it. We got off by the ocean and stood on the cliff and watched the waves come up as we felt the clean air and the beauty of nature. We traveled around visiting different places and enjoying the various sights. The participants of this dream were my boyfriend, 23, and I. The colors remembered are blue and green.
