We went to the bus stop to wait for the bus. I saw I was on the wrong side for the bus going up the street and crossed over. Soon I was back on the wrong side. Mary remarked it was a lonely road. I told her it seemed so because she had lived in the city so long. It looked like a country dirt road. We waited long for transportation. Then down the street a ways near some low buildings., we spied a couple of idle jinrichas. I went to negotiate with one of them. The rest of us would walk.
