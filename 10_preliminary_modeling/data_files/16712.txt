I remember not really being involved for most of this dream. Like a movie, where I'm there, but just watching, and nobody else notices I'm there. It was about a boy, and I think a girl, either his sister or mother probably. The boy is being taken somewhere through the ceiling of the basement (that I think is my grandfather's basement) by an evil superman look-alike. The girl doesn't know what's happening to her little brother/son. There was more, but it's so foggy in my memory I can't describe it. The next thing I know, I'm in my kitchen, and there's a bunch of people there- an electrical unit or something near the door, from what I remember (although I don't know what that has to do with anything), and we sort of "slid" out of the house. I don't exactly remember, it was almost like a waterslide, maybe. Then, I fell until I was at the other side of the driveway and then suddenly realized I had no clothes on. At that point, everybody was getting ready to start a fantasy baseball draft. The first draft pick went to the "Jethros"- i.e. Jethro Tull (last guitar lesson, I told my guitar teacher I didn't really like Jethro Tull and he said he's never heard of anyone who didn't).
