I have this visual of something that has different colored sections to it, various geometric shapes, and each has a black number on it. Whatever this thing was it was about the size of a typical jigsaw puzzle but it seemed to be part of a wall or hanging on a wall. A man has taken what I think is tissue paper like you would use in gift wrapping and laid it flat in each of these sections, matching the colors. The one that stands out in my mind is a green rectangle in the upper - middle section. It seems to be one of the more important ones. The point was to try to get people to do what they were supposed to do with each section. The man who put the tissue paper on it did it as much for himself as for the other people. Each section seemed to require some different type of action. He and I discussed the actions and it seems that I had either recommended he do the tissue paper thing or told him that I thought it was a good idea after he did it.
