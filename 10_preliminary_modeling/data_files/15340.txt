I was at a Royal Show type of place. There was a rounded pyramid game and each bit had different prizes. You had to run up and grab something and when it stopped you would get that prize. There was one with a coin and you had to drop it in the slot at the bottom, then you had to get it out quickly before it started again. Evelyn was there. My pockets were small. Eugene and I were dating. We were walking around there together. There was a movie with Alain Delon and he was a rich guy. It was set in Il Gattopardo times. He tricked a girl into marrying him before changing stuff around, his clothes etc to make her think it was actually his father who she married. She was angry when she found out and confronted him, but he played innocent and said that he didn't do anything. Then it was back to real life involving someone's family life. They had a superhero costume that was part of a family tradition and they had to wear it every Halloween. I got a stick and was poking spiderwebs to take them off. I heard a ayell and saw Poppa pull up in a car. Poppers was there too and the stick scared him.
