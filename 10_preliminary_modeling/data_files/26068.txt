 I'm in a trailer home. I hang myself by a construction helmet. The helmet is stuck to my head and there is something attached to the top of it: a rope and I think a pulley system so that when I pull the rope down I lift myself up off the ground, stuck to my helmet, which is seemingly cemented to my head. I seem to be on Carter School playground in Oak Valley. I take a photograph or two young black girls. The battery in my camera runs out: it is dead. At first I had straps around my arms to hang myself, then it was just the helmet.
