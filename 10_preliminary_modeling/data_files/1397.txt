I'm in some strange land where I must choose my King, or a mate. I chose one who is tall, dark and handsome. He doesn't speak much. I tell him, "You sure are dark!" A good tan. Then I ask him if this is the way it's going to be, hardly any communication. He smiles and says no. We then must travel to his land. We do this by stepping on specially colored "tiles" or squares that are floating out in space. We get there, me stepping exactly where he had stepped before. The land likes to wear lots of bright, clashy colors together--purples, reds, blues, yellows, etc, all at once. I choose to wear only one color, turquoise and white. They are quite appalled. The queen, his mother, lectures me on how I should be like them.
