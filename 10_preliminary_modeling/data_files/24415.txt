We were at school, except it was really weird. There were beds and stuff, and we weren't really doing any work. Judy and Michael (classmates) were there. Judy was in her nightgown and she didn't have any underwear on. It was the end of the day. And my grandma was supposed to pick me up. I waited and waited, and she didn't come. And then this was very scary. I was catching a bus. I went on this bus. It looked like a real bus. It was wonderful. It was really weird. I don't know what happened. Bob was in my dream. I didn't go where I was supposed to go on the bus. I felt frustrated about the bus.
