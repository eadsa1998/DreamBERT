I was at Nana's. A lady and her kid were there. They were going to dye the kid's hair black. They were in Nana's room, but then someone opened door and she disappeared and reappeared in the lounge room. This girl stabbed this guy in the bed. Then it showed these two families meeting at the shops or something. A song came on the radio that both had requested.
