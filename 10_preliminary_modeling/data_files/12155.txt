Ryan Cartwright was in a movie which I had a video clip of? Daryl was in our class and sat at our group of desks. He was making a weird noise and I accidentally fell off my chair. He started laughing loudly. We then had an assembly and he and Tiana said "Don't leave," when I moved away. There were zombies. I pretended to be a zombie and when I thought I was close enough to safety I started running. One said "There she is!" and they started chasing me, but I made it to shelter. A professor died trying to close the door. I ran down stairs and people from school there. The light was a pretty blue colour. There was some movie with mice and rats. Zack (Saved by the Bell) and a girl were there. He swore and then turned to camera and said "Did I just swear?".
