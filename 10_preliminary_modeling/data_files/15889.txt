I was at school, though it was different. We had to nominate 3 people for something or other. I was in the room where the ballots were submitted with Tristan and Fletcher. Judah came in with his form and I saw that he'd written two people I didn't know in spots 1 and 3, but Tristan was in spot 2 (misspelled as Allan) and the reason was like 'he is my backup in Good Advice'. I was annoyed because I can do all the same stuff. I hadn't decided on who I was going to choose. Fletcher and I were with Frederick at some point and Fletcher was saying stuff about dating me or liking me or something but saying it like hypothetically, though admitting that was how he felt too. Later, we were doing the promo ad but it was for a guy who had this bottleshop. I was the only one there and he got me to dress up like an employee and stand at the counter and shot some stuff really quickly. He showed me the footage and it looked good and I said maybe some more cutaways. I said I'd go back in this room and have a look and see what we can add. I was then with Fletcher and I posted on Facebook saying 'I wish I had someone else here'. Then other people were there, including Tristan. The guy had these horses and I took one of their ropes and started to lead it away when I heard him telling the others to not touch the horses and I tried to tie the rope back but couldn't and the horse was getting agitated and I had to tell the guy about it. I didn't know if the ad was for the bottleshop or a particular drink and the guy looked annoyed and said it was the drink.
