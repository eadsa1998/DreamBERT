I am in a town and walking down a sidewalk. Charla is in a box, a cardboard box, and playing. I pick up the box and am carrying her home (feels a bit like M City). We pass a group of her first grade class doing some summer time activity, like a class picture. She decides now she wants to join them. I say, "Too late. You could have joined them before, but you chose to play around." Charla cries and I resolve to continue, to be consistent. I say to the group as we pass, "Sorry." The teacher understands. As we continue on, I realize Charla will be missing lots of fun and I circle around and ask the teacher if it's too late for Charla to join them. She says it's fine. I lecture Charla (an empty swim suit) about next time, I won't give in, if she dawdles and plays around, then I will follow through and take her home. She gleefully runs off to play with them.
