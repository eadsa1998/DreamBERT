I was swimming in the ocean. The waves were big and scary. I tried to grab a big surfboard but the waves took it away. Then I found myself all the way on the other side of the ocean. There was a wall and no real shore. It was shallow. I said that it wasn't really dangerous because it was shallow the whole way. But I looked back and saw that at the other end the waves were rough and thought that you could still drown or get hurt. There were some people around but I didn't know them.
