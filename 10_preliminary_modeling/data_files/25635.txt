 I'm in the Brimson field house on an exercise bicycle. The woman crew coach comes and gets me to go on the ergs. My grade school principal Candy Bevner is there. She has just graded a paper I wrote. I see that I scored a 97 on the paper. She says that is pretty well. I ask her what she personally thinks about the content of the paper. She refuses to answer. The paper is about a crush I had on my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, and how she rejected me. Both Liza and Candy are there, and I talk with them about the paper and other things.
