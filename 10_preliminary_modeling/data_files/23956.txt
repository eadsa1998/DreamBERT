There are four of us and we were trying to steal rose bushes from an apartment building. We had broken into two apartments and were going to take their rosebushes. One apartment was way up high. The balcony was beautiful and looked down upon lots of other balconies with pools and palm trees. When we were in the other apartment it was like we were in some old people's home. There was some sort of security system where all the front doors of the apartment would be open so that security could check the apartments. I was worried that the woman in the apartment across from the one we were in would notice us in there. The rose bushes were wrapped up. At first, they were shaped like bonsai trees, perfectly manicured into a ball at the top of the trunk. After they were wrapped they were in little packages. We took off out the sliding porch door towards the ocean where a boat was trying to dock for us. The waves were huge and it was really dangerous trying to jump onto the rocking boat.
