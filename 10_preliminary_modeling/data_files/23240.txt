My wife Anita and I are having a party-perhaps our farewell open house when leaving our former home.  I have bought several vacuum cleaners to give certain guests.  Mary Barrett gets one, and Angi Krone (who is the last person on our guest list, with "and dog" after her name).  While some of the guests are leaving, and I am at the front door telling them goodbye, I hear a vacuum cleaner running.  I realize that it is Mary vacuuming, and I am embarrassed, because I realize that they may think I gave them the vacuum cleaners to vacuum our house rather than to take home.  And then I realize with horror how much all these vacuum cleaners has cost me, and I wonder if I can return them after they have been used, and what the store will think when I try to return six used vacuum cleaners.
