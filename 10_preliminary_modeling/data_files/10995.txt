I was swimming. I was underwater and looked up to find the water level to be several--maybe 10--feet above the level of my head. I went to the surface. There women were swimming around holding babies. I got out to the side of the pool. There I saw women preparing the babies to go underwater by holding their noses (the babys'). One woman hit her charge on the chest and then held its nose. They then dove in. Later, I was leaving the building with a friend (f). She was telling me that she had no more money because, to quote: "I just bought ________ (her roommate, f) a tricycle--I mean bicycle".
