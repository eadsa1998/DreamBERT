I saw a moon horse either ran 2nd or was picked 2nd. I parked my car, then got out and picked up a baby boy. The boy was kind of rough and we talked in his language, baby talk. My car was backing up. I put on the brake and it wouldn't stop, so I put it in gear and released the clutch pedal so the car was in gear. It would go forward and stop the car. It went back for a while, then it finally stopped and moved forward.
