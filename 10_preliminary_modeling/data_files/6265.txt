I recall that I was at a junkyard but was not there to see cars. I went there to see fully intact dinosaur bones. These dinosaurs were lined up following each other like a parade. The workers explained to me that they died that way, instantly frozen, when a deep freeze set in. I recall that I thought it was very odd that they didn't die slowly and why they weren't down on the ground. Then my brother came up to me and said that he saw my old car (which I owned 10 years ago and sold) fully intact, for sale in the yard. Then that's when I started seeing old cars in the junkyard surrounded by the dinosaurs. I started looking for the car and finally found it sitting on top of other cars. I looked at it and saw it was like my old car until I looked inside of it and noticed it was different than mine, then when I looked at the outside again, it was completely different.
