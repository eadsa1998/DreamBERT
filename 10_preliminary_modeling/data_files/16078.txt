First, Dad and I were swimming in the water, and I was jumping off of his knee and diving in and stuff. And then I dreamt that I was like at this parade, and they were shooting off planes that had engines of certain sound frequency ranges. And I was looking at this chart to see which one they were, depending on what kind of frequency ranges they had. Then I was snooping around somebody's back yard, and I was naked, and I stepped in some sand spurs and I got a whole foot full of them. And the lady came out and she was real nice. She put some kind of peroxide on them and just made them not hurt any more and made them fall right out. And I came in, and the lady was showing me her CD burner and told me her husband is really good with it. And I put something in the left-hand tray and finalized it, and when I got home, I found out that the lady's husband was at home looking at our CD burner. And then I kind of woke up.
