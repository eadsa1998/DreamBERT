       Then I go downstairs again and take a tray of green cakes to a corner store to buy wine for the Book Cafe. I leave the tray there as dash off to get change. I run back over mountains of snow on the curb and return to the Book Cafe without the tray of cakes. I tell Margaret: "I confess I forgot..." Margaret is not exactly angry, she sends FRANK TRNKA to get the tray and tells him to close up the Book Cafe. -- I leave and walk home with Wendy, we again climb over huge snow mountains; she is moody and tired when I ask about her day. She says she'll tell me later.
