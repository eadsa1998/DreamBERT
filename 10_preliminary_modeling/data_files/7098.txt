Friend asks re stranger, "Why did she change to Wednesday to wash?" while we're hanging up clothes. "I don't know," I say. "We really ought to have a set day." I am on a stool and realize I must climb down and get four more pins. ...Mother, H. and I are sitting in the living room when about eight people come down and are introduced. I say to the first man, "But don't I know you? Aren't you Mr. Drummond whom I knew in China? "Yes." Pretty good memory after so many years. As the group passes I think I should have asked him about his son Alfred. Mother leaves with the group. ... H. says, "Let's go to the dining room even if it's not quite six." I see clock. It says quarter of six. I'm hungry. H. says, "We won't wait for mother. She's still at the Fair. I don't worry about her now. She no longer gets confused. "We go and sit at a table. I pick up a biscuit and eat it but then I notice plates have been used, only scraps are piled on them. It makes me feel nauseated. I wonder where the waiters are. H. scrapes plates into each other. A number of orientals with yellow scarves on their heads pass by. I wonder if they are the waiters.
