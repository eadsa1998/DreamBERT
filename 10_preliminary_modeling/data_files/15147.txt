I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember seeing Dominic though. Raquel had some exam map as her status on Facebook. I found something that led to me discovering some secret weapon thing which I apparently had. Somehow I confirmed this. I realized people were after it, so I called Mom to let her know and she was away for the weekend. I called her and she said these people had just asked and were asking her questions. I panicked and packed my bag with clothes and books for studying. I was going to go to dads and I had an exam tomorrow. I put my shoes in there too. Then I heard a car door shut and I realized the people were here. I heard someone talking from outside the laundry door. He said that he would give me $100k for it and they'd leave without a fight. I noticed the guy was Keamy from Lost. I said they'd have to wait for my Mom to get back. I watched him off his reflection in a mirror. I pointed a gun at him and said I had a good 'ratio'. I went down the hall and quickly got to the front door -- the door was different as well as the front yard. I locked the door as he got to me through another entrance. We fought and I ended up slashing his throat and he fell to the ground. While he was on the ground, he looked like Ted (How I Met Your Mother) and I thought he was actually hot. His mate came and I ran outside. I had a package and ran to my car and drove off. I ended up going back later and they were gone. I tried to brake, but it wasn't working. I got to where Mom was and Ezra was with her. I didn't know if the key was in properly. Then the car was shrinking because of fear of a lake? Mom asked if anything 'traumatic' had happened today and I said that 'terrorists came after me for a biological weapon' and she was shocked. There was a guy with some chocolates and she flirted with him.
