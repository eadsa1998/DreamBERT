Jennifer K came over. I was asking her about the results of her visit to the neurologist. It seems that there was some confusion in some tests results that even prompted her to be referred to a neurologist but certainly when she went to the neurologist and had further testing. I think they may have mixed up her test results with someone else. It seems that there was no need for concern. The things that they had found were actually someone else.
