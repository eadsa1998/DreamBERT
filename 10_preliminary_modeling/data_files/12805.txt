Calvin and I were in some place that had high buildings. They had different names for different heights. I wanted to go the '10 million' one. But Calvin wanted to go to the '12 million' one. We used a tray to float down. When we were up there I said "This is too high!". There was this room and these apples were coming through the window and the door and they were getting bigger and filling up the room. It showed them coming through one at a time, so it was jerky looking.
