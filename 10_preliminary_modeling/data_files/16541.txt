I had another crazy dream last night earlier and when I woke up at 2:00 in the morning, I remembered it. I was dreaming that, for some reason, Dad was showing me bird pictures, jpeg pictures, on the computer of birds in the park. And they had different mp3 files attached to them that would play when you opened them. And one had this awful, "Doo, do, doo, do, doo, do" attached to it and I had to remember which one it was because I didn't want to open it and hear that sound. And for some reason that sound would go even if the speakers weren't turned on, and it was just like you couldn't get away from it. And I wasn't really scared in this dream, but it was more of afraid that I would be scared kind of a thing. But I don't know where in the heck that came from except we were moving all the hardware down the hall into the bedroom yesterday, and I was wrapping up the wires and looking down behind the desk and all that, in the dust bunnies and stuff. And it was neat to see and get to do most of the connecting and stuff for myself, and get to practice that a little. But that was that.
