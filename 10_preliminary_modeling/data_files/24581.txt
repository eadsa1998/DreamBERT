I'm at school and I have homework due, and I don't have it. All of a sudden I wish I had a magic lamp and I do, there on the side of me, a magic lamp. I had all of my homework on the other side of it done and everything. I give it in, and get a big sign at the end of the year that said on it "all homework A+" and I was so happy. Setting: In my schoolroom. Characters: Me and my magic lamp. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I was happy that I got an A+, but before that, scared.
