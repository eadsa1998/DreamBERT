I was at some get together thing at a really big playground. It was filled with kids. This guy told me to do the countdown, so I did. Mr Reilly, Ezra and Eugene were also there. I was then at Mom's and my room there was like my room at home. The ceiling was also collapsed at some places. I asked why Ezra always got the good room. I was then at school and in some class with Mr Stevenson, but it was in the science block.
