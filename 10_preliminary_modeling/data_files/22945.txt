I was on a trip with my wife Bonita and her folks and my daughter Christina.  We had stopped at a restaurant.  Somehow we had already eaten, but were outside coming back in to pay.  Christina and I were barefoot, and because of that, the lady would not let me in to pay.  I threatened not to pay at all, and she got mad.  I was infuriated, and even though I knew it would upset Bonita, I fought with the lady rather than put my shoes on.  The next thing I knew, Bonita was pulling my suitcase and things out of the car and throwing them onto the ground.  I tried to talk to her, but I knew it was useless.  I started getting a few things together for Christina.  Bonita and her mother started pointing out places of interest in Arizona, saying I could see them and be back in a week.  On the way out of some building, I ran into Dr. Knowland and told him I was leaving.
