I was in a house with my mother. There were large empty rooms. My mother accidentally pulled the iron cord, leaving the plug in the socket. The plug began to burn. I hurriedly looked for the fuse in the fuse box so I could turn off the electricity. Later I walked along the street and I met a man I have known named Carl Hogan. (I had been a patient with him in a hospital.) I was surprised to see that he was out of the hospital.
