I am at a swimming pool. I am afraid of the water. I had had a frightening and hurtful experience in the water (an attack of some sort, possibly rape). The coast has most of the swim team (24 of them) benched so I have the pool to myself. I start to swim. I am fast and enjoy it. My coach is very impressed. I am a world class champion. He marvels that I can be se good in the element where I experienced so much trauma.
