Ezra was watching Entourage. Mom gave a map of their house to Darren. Ezra and I were then on the street and I saw a cockroach and said "That's the second biggest cockroach I've ever seen!" (thinking the first was the one on my back the other week). Ezra picked it up and threw it at me and I could feel it crawling on me.
