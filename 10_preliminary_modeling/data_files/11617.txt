The scene was the graduation exercises of my high school class. There were the usual addresses, speeches and the like. Throughout the program I was both graduate speaker as well as a member of the audience. The program continued with me jumping from role to role in a more and more frenzied state. Always with a deep foreboding feeling if I didn't hurry and do something I'd fail to complete some vague, undefinable task.
