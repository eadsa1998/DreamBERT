I dreamt a lot last night, but I've forgotten quite a bit. However, I do remember that I dreamt of my uncle who is a priest and who loves me very much. I was with my sister, the second youngest, who is a year younger than I am, and that we were in his home with his mother and another person whom I cannot identify. The house in the dream was different from his real house. Suddenly my uncle appeared and he was rather drunk and beat up. Then his mother told us, with an angry tone, that it would be better if we left, which made me angry. I only remember that I and another person (I don't know who) went with him to his bedroom and I don't remember any more.
