I needed to submit my presentation in advance to someone. They posted it on a private web page where I could continue to work on it or finalize it. After it was posted on the web page all of the things that needed to be fixed or changed were highlighted in yellow. Some of the slides had multiple choice question and answers. I could highlight the correct answer, click on submit and it would accept it and then delete all of the others.
