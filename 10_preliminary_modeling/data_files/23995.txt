My unpleasant dream, it was about my boyfriend. It all started on a Sunday evening. I just got off the phone with him and I just went to bed. Well, it was about 2:43, and the phone rang. It was his brother. He told me that my boyfriend went to the hospital because he ate something very poisonous. So I went to the hospital and stayed there for 4-1/2 days. Then I went home and took a shower and got cleaned up. On my way out the door, I heard the TV and it said there is a boy that is a teenager and ate something and got poisoned and is in the hospital. So now at this point I got down to the hospital as fast as I can to find out if everything was okay. Well, nothing was okay. The doctor said he won't probably make it. He was slowing down with his breathing. All of a sudden I woke up, and the dream stopped. So the next day when I went to school I saw him there, and I was so happy just to see him okay.
