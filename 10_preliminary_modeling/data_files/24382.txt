This guy had a hut, and he lost the people he was with. he was cowboy. Then he saw his mates going by on horses. Native Americans were leading them. They captured the cowboys, and they made them go naked on the horses. The guy who had the hut didn't get captured. He said, "Hey, where are you going? Can I come?" They (the captured cowboys) said, "Don't come with us. You don't want to come like this. They made us be naked on horses." It was all guys (in the dream). It was like watching a movie.
