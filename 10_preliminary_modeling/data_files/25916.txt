 A party is going to occur. Some men my age come up to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, others, and I to tell us about it. It will be held down at an old brown deserted train station. The men who tell us are tobacco chewing, Oakley and baseball cap wearing, gimps that I think are losers. I say I know where the spot is, and act like we'll show up, but I know I won't go because I don't want to.
