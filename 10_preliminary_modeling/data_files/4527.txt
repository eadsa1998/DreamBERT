["Giants try and stop me."] I am riding around fast and fearless on a motorcycle. I weave through the traffic with skill. A giant is the traffic cop and stops me. He tells me I can't ride motorcycles anymore. I am upset. I get off, reluctantly. I walk it away from where he can see and get back on and ride around doing circles and lots of fancy riding tricks. Now I am outlawed. I drive away, going around a spiraling circle like in a parking lot, only the center has sand and Mongolian hordes on horses. I must hide from them. As they come around one end of the circle, I ride around the other end. Finally, myself and my traveling companions hide buried up to our necks in the sand as the hordes ride around. We successfully hide from them.
