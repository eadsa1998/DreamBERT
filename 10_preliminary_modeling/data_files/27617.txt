Again I was in a large house, but this time it wasn't a strange one. It was a fraternity house of another college. There were books and magazines all over the place and there was also a library there. The scene changed and I was standing before an easel painting a scene. It was of two houses, one very pretty and the other very old and rather nondescript. Suddenly I decided I wanted to visit the new house so I did. There were people in it, but none of them were familiar to me. I remember looking out over some water (a lake or river). Again I was back in the fraternity house. Someone I knew in the dream evidently (but not in real life) was playing the piano and I was listening. We decided to go down to the recreation room and it wasn't until we went down the steps that I recognized who I was with. He had trouble getting downstairs because he had an artificial leg (age 22).
