My dream was somewhat fantastic. There is a girl, a classmate, whom I -- out of courtesy -- accompany to her house, and suddenly I fall in love with the sister of the girl I accompanied. The sister of my classmate, in my dream, presents herself as a shy girl, and I, knowing this psychologically, fall in love with her. Already when I saw her, I knew that she liked me. Then I perceive that we are in the middle of lunch, and I, as the host, am in the middle of the table, facing everybody, so that everybody speaks kindly to me, but nobody gives me even a glass of water. Then I am in a sandy place, more exactly in Pamplona (Lima) and I meet a good friend of the above-mentioned classmate, logically, she's my classmate too, and I intend to touch her, but she tells me that this is not an appropriate place and therefore it would be better to go to a dark place. That's all.
