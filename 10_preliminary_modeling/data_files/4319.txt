["Interrupted sex."] I feel very sexually desirous and hungry. I am holding a small newborn like baby. When I caress it's cheek, I feel sexual excitement. I feel strange about this. I realize I simply have a need for sex and it is being projected out onto anything around me. I hold the baby and then put it away so I won't be tempted. Then I go to Ellie's room. She is a child again and is cleaning her room. I am surprised at how well she is doing it without an argument. I am in a hurry to leave so I can be alone and experience orgasm. On my way out, I comment on the magazine pictures cut outs she laid in a thick design on the floor. I say it should be fixed down so it doesn't get ruined when people walk on it. I go to my bedroom and get on the bed, but Dovre, a young adult comes in and wants to cuddle and talk, to get attention from me. I am annoyed and want her to leave me alone so I can have an orgasm. She doesn't go away and I am frustrated and annoyed.
