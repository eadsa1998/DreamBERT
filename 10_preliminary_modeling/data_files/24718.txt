I dreamt that I was playing truth or dare with my friends Ryan, Devin, Lisa, Jerry, Courtlyn, and Jordan. We just played, then I realized that we were in a movie. It was a rent movie, and the people I mentioned and I starred. We were going to ski when I woke up. Setting: Alta, near Tahoe, in a cabin. Characters: Ryan (brown hair, brown eyes, real); Devin (brown hair, blue eyes, real); Lisa (black hair, brown eyes, real); Jerry (blonde hair, blue eyes, real); Courtlyn (red hair, green eyes, real); Jordan (black hair, brown eyes, real); me (blonde hair, blue eyes, real). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, excited. I liked the dream. It was neat, and I had been playing truth or dare in a cabin in Alta with Lisa and Jerry.
