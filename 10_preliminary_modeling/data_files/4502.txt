["Wanting Drew Carey."] I am in a house with Drew Carey. I want him sexually. I arrange some pillows from a cupboard on the floor to make a comfortable resting place. I take off my clothes and lie down, waiting for him to join me. He doesn't come to me. He chooses to lie down on a bed in another room. I get up and drape a white towel around me and walk into the bedroom. I catch him trying to run up the stairs to avoid me. He feels embarrassed. I ask him to explain what's going on for him. We lie down on a couch. Our heads at opposite ends as we talk. He says he feels uncomfortable jumping right into sex. He'd like it better if we talked a long time and got to know each other. I agree. I tell him I think he is intelligent and I enjoy the creativity he shows. He seems shy. I touch him on the leg as we talk.
