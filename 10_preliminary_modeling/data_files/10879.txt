I found myself walking on a huge green lawn and saw distant tall building. The lawn was flanked by banks of flowers. The building looked new and white. As I was approaching it, I felt a sense of loneliness, and felt myself a stranger as I neared the building. There was no one else in the dream, and I did feel a little sad because I did not know where my family was.
