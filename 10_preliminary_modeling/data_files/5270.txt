I dreamed that I was back in 8th grade and had to make a poster about the solar system. So I made it and brought it into school. The presentations were held in the lunchroom. The presentations started and I realized how inadequate my work was. So I shifted my posters around until I found the best one I had made about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment. I used that and presented, and did very well. Then I had some dream about Jackson, that I was talking to him through a wall. I also dreamed I woke up next to him. Then I woke up.
