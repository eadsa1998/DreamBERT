This is a very short dream: I was at the door of a girls' school giving out pamphlets advertising an academy where one can prepare for the university admission exams. I had taken a box with 1000 pamphlets, but I saw that I was going to be short. As the girls kept going by, I was running out of pamphlets, and I withdrew. I saw the box and it was full again, and I started giving them away and I was out of them. I went away and again the box was full. That's all I remember.
