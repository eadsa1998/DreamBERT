We were at the Stadium, watching a volleyball match. We were five couples and after the game, we had dinner at a Chinese restaurant. There we had a lot of fun, with conversations which I don't remember. Going out, I was left alone with my girlfriend in the car, when suddenly they were chasing us in another car. I told my girlfriend, "They are after us; we have to run. Let's go to Huacho." She answered this, "Why are they chasing us, if we haven't done anything? I don't want to leave you alone. Let's go where you want." Then I remember getting to some town, but the one with me was no longer my girlfriend, but a male friend. I don't remember any more.
