Julius was friends with Ezra. I was at school on the floor in front of a lounge with Tiana and I was reading a Pokemon book. Julius grabbed my shirt and pulled me back. I said "What the hell do you want?" he said "I just wanna say..." and I said "That's nice" and went back to Tiana. He started reading my Pokemon book and wrote 'water against grass is hard'. He came to our house. He and Ezra went into my room to find my diary. I shooed them out. I got my diary and went to the games room to put it in my safe. Ezra started talking to me and I put it down and Julius was behind me and I thought that he had read it. He took it but then put it down and I was bashing Ezra asking if he read it.
