My husband and I were going to have this public debate about something. I can't remember exactly what it was. It seems he wanted some prisoner condemned to death, and I wanted him spared. And it didn't seem right that we should debate because my husband's been on a debating team and I didn't have any experience in it. But I thought I would do the best I could. When we actually started debating, neither of us had very much to say actually. We brought up all these people to speak for us and they were mostly people who would emotionally sway the audience one way or the other, like I had this folk singer named Joan, to sing. He had some other types of people. He was going to make the last speech and he was making it. I don't know how the thing turned out.
