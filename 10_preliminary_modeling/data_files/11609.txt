I dreamt that I was an MP at Fort Knox. On a Saturday night I tried to go on pass, but an officer stopped me. He told me that I was restricted to my quarters for having unpressed pants. I went to the orderly room and saw John there (he was in my outfit in Japan). I was surprised to see him for he hated the army. We talked about our days in Japan. Then I awoke.
