I was in a parking lot. It was like supposedly the University. It must have been a big vacation time because everybody was going home. There were many, many cars in the parking lot, more trying to get out of the lot than I have ever seen. So I was sitting, waiting for a chance to get out. The way the cars were situated, I kind of had to scoot ahead of another car. So then as I was waiting to get out in front, I happened to see the other person who was driving the car. It was a girl and I thought she might be mad at me for having scooted in front of her, but she kind of smiled and she said it to me for some reason, I'm not sure why, "Oh, that's all right. Everybody has worn a certain piece of clothing which they," but then I was woken up.
