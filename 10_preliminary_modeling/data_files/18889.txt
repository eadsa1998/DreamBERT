In this dream I was on the street in front of the house where I used to live. A neighbor, Benny, who I haven't seen in 5 or 6 years, was there too. He was flying a kite. Benny is now about 27, but in the dream he was younger, around 20. I recall that he was having trouble with the kite. He couldn't keep it in the air, and it almost got twisted up in the telephone wires. As the kite came down toward the ground, I remember seeing that it had no tail on it, and I surmised that this was the reason why it wouldn't fly too well. I remember that the kite was a dark blue color and torn in some places. The last I recall was Benny running down the street, trying to get the kite up in the air again.
