Calvin, Ezra and I were walking to school. Then Ezra and I were in a car and we drove off this little cliff. It showed Calvin's face and it took a while for this red Ute to fall on the car. Ezra and I got out and hurried away. Then it was a movie with Drake Bell. These cars were coming after him. He was at a gym and there was a car at the door trying to get in. He threw a barbell to stop the door from opening. The gym was closed that day. Someone wanted to do pushups.
