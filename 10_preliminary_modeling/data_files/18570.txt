I was registering for high school. I had to sit in the commons and then go to the gym building to register for gym class. There was a doctor checking knees and runners that were at risk (for knee injury). A guy I didn't know came in from the rain. He was a senior guy and didn't have to. He had curly hair and was tall. It was time for me to leave. IV. I need help. Too much to carry. I was thinking of Dora so strong I could not see where I was going. I wrote for a very long time and realized I had been there with my eyes closed. I saw fish eyes. 4 huge fish eyes. 2 feet in diameter. Please put on this comfortable cotton ??? print dress, still cold and crispy. I climbed up a tree on Sitgreaves St. I because if I didn't the opportunity would have been gone forever. I climbed so high--that ??? trying ??? I slid down.
