 I walk into a classroom. I think I am in the wrong room, but it is the right room, and I am here for Human Geography. My high school semantics teacher, Jerry Brock is the teacher. There is a man playing a game on the computer before class starts. I shake my head no to indicate that this isn't an acceptable thing. Jerry Brock isn't fond of it either. Jerry starts talking about tests, presentations, and projects. I am scared: I have a lot of work to do already. I don't have time for more major projects. My grade school and high school classmate Sonya Nittles is there, looking as aloof as ever. I'm playing basketball with my high school classmate Aaron Meyers and others. I am getting fouled a lot and I whine about it. I decide to stop whining and play tough even though the play is dirty.
