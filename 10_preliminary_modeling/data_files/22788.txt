Doug and I go to see The Thing, but shown by a home projector, not at a movie theater.  A lot of kids are there, including one girl I especially notice.  She is real cute and has long, sandy hair.  When the monster comes on the screen, I hide my face so that I won't have bad dreams.  The next day, I believe, I meet this girl on the bus (in my hometown), and we get better acquainted.  She seems to like me, and lets me put my arm around her.  When we get off the bus, I hold her hand on the way to her house, which seems to be on Newton or Richmond or Sandusky.  At this point, she seems to be Phyllis Rogers.  She asks me if I want to kiss her.  I look up the street to see if anyone is around, and then I kiss her.  We go up to the house, and I remember I don't even know her name.  At this point she seems to be Emily Koch, although she looks nothing like her.  I take out my address book and sit down in front of the house.  She says her name is Emily Myron, and her phone number is (something like) J1-01J11.  Just as I am starting to write it down, her father comes to the door, a small, slightly rotund man.  I stand up.  He says, in a rather brusque way, "Don't sit on my flower bed again."  I say, "Yes, sir, but I don't think I was."  But I look around and sure enough there is an impression in the dirt, which I touch to make sure it is real.
