Mom and Dad were home already. I wish I would quit dreaming those dreams about them being home, because that would only make them come home faster and I don't want that. I wish they'd stay until the end of October, maybe the beginning of November. And if they could do it and it wouldn't be hard or stressful for them, I'd say, "Stay the winter, man!" [laugh] So anyway, I dreamt that they were home and I still had some of my stuff scattered and strewn around down here, and I was trying to pick things up and put things in order. And the kitchen table was just a complete and utter mess. Mom had come home and put a whole bunch of baking and packing stuff out, and some of the things that I kept out were kind of a mess. For some reason I had left a couple of empty grocery bags, like the cloth ones we carry, and I left a couple of boxes and odd things around. And I left Big Bird on a kitchen chair, and people were walking by him and I was hoping that they wouldn't see him. And I was going to try to hurry up and take him upstairs, but Dad was in the bathroom doing his bathroom thing, and I didn't want to risk having him be seen. And so I just, I just laid him on his side and shoved the kitchen chair under the table, and covered a tablecloth around him, and thought, "Okay, I'll wait until everybody's outside and then I'll take him upstairs. And then I woke up.
