I was in the Navy and that I was trying to install this thing on the ship, and it was this little CD player in a wicker basket that was supposed to hang from one of the doorways and people could just go and sit over there and listen to it on the sound system. And I was walking around the ship with Ms. Garland and some other people and all of a sudden we were out on the deck singing Christmas carols. And Ms. Garland kind of turned into Mrs. Dougherty and she was leading us in song, and then I realized that we weren't on a ship but we were in a building and I was singing with the group in this building. And then I went into this office and I started speaking Spanish to Lydia, who is the promotion lady at the radio station. The only thing I can think why I dream about Lydia is because I was going to intern there, but now I find out they don't take anybody unless they're 18, and I took it pretty hard. So I think I'm going to have another dream about her tonight.
