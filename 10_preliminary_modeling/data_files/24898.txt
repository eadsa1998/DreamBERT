I had just finished swim practice and I was going to get a ride home with my friend but the car was full so I biked home. I had done it many times before but at this one street I couldn't remember which way to go. I would choose one way, ride on it for a while, then turn back when I realized it wouldn't take me home. Then there was this bell all over the city, like a school bell, which said summer vacation had started. Suddenly everyone was gone on vacation and I was still lost. Setting: All over San Francisco. Characters: I was alone. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. It's weird because I have never gotten lost before. I was worried in the dream because I thought I wouldn't ever get home.
