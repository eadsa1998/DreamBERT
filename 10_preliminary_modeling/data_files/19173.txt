I dreamed I borrowed my buddy's new Jaguar, and I used it to come over here and dream. The next morning on the way home, I turned left to go down towards the Fla. Pharmacy, down towards the Grove House. My buddy lives in the Grove. This truck went through a green light. We were coming straight thru Grand Ave. He was coming towards me and hit me in the side, and he kept on going. He didn't stop. Really smashed the car up. The police came and everything. We couldn't find the truck. Looked all over for the truck. In looking for the truck, we walked down the hill towards the boats and there was another bad accident down there, but I wasn't involved in that one. The truck wasn't there. I was walking back and I saw this other guy looking around. He looked like one of the guys in the truck. He was in some building, I don't know which building, and I caught up with him and he said he didn't know anything about it. That's all.
