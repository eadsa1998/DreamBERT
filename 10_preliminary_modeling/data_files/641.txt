I hire my brother and Ron (a co-worker) to build an addition on a small house near my Aunts. Ron goes ahead and makes it look like an airplane and it appears it actually will be able to fly. I am not happy at first but then I like the idea only I am concerned my brother will be upset and also I am worried about how to pay for it. I decide to pay Ron $100 a month. He seems happy as he just wants to do it. A lot of people come to see it. I plan an open house with refreshments for when it is done. My husband's former employer is there and some young woman and we talk about the expense of flying an experimental aircraft but I heard of some way to do it cheaper. There is also something about a woman serving Thanksgiving dinner. A little boy comes to her house (which is my airplane house) and she has him stay for dinner after calling his mother. I come upon this because I am driving a car and they are doing something on the walk outside and I stop just sort of hitting them.
