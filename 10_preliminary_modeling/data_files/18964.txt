This dream took place on some island,  a good-sized island out in the ocean. It started out taking place aboard a ship going to this island. I was aboard this ship. I believe it was a Navy ship. We were going towards this island and once we got there, everybody that was on the island -- there were Navy men on the island and they were, they weren't doing much; they were just laying around, sitting around the island. Then two of them were going to give a demonstration of how the natives of this island used to have some type of a ritual, a sword fight or something. So two Navy men proceeded to go through the motions of a sword fight between two ancient warriors. And as the dream wore on, these Navy men turned into, or as the dream went on, these Navy men were actually these warriors, these very fierce Anglo-Saxon type of warriors with their long swords, what have you. They proceeded to fight, and they were really going at it. And one kept hitting against the other one's sword and backing him up, and backing him up ... Ha, ha, here's a clincher! The one that was being beaten by the sword fight told the one that was beating him, said, "Wait a minute," and he walked away, and he said something to the effect that he had to do a milk commercial.
