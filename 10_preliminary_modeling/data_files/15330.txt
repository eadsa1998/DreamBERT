I was at a house. Dennis and Charlie (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) were there. There was a lady and I had met her best friend before. She had someone get 'H2O' and I asked her what she was looking for and she said Coke and I said "I don't drink Coke". There was a bag of pretzels and a packet of thin chocolate fingers. I was at a table and Dennis and Charlie liked the same girl and I realised it was me.
