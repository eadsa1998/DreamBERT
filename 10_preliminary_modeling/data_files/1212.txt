Bonnie is holding and cuddling her baby (a chinese boy). At the same time, I am feeding baby food to what looks like his twin. I say to him that he is lucky. He will feel very loved because his mom even holds him when he is diapered and fed (using his duplicate...I thought in background, "Maybe not so good. He will expect it always and won't be prepared if as an adult, he doesn't get it all the time").
