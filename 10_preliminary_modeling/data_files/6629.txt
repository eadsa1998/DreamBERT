Packing for boat leaving at 12:30. Will not be able to finish. Send someone to order taxi and find out if boat will leave on time. Then am bidding D and Q a farewell. Will never see them again so kiss them goodbye. Barely touch D's lips because he's married but give Q a real kiss. I step off as steamer leaves and find hatbox is off too. I put on old felt hat and sweater and pick up soft leather pocket book. I have two quarters. Glad I didn't use them as tips. Start to hunt real wharf and turn to doors along a long hallway. Knock at one under which light shines. Tall dark man opens door and stands aside for me to enter still talking to a committee within.  I tell him I want to know the way to the wharf and he starts to lead the way explaining that many have asked him. I am in Hawaii. We are soon at the wharf. A wide gang plank leads to lower deck.  "Is this the malolo?" "Yes." See Peter. Ask him if he is on the deck where our rooms are, and then I meet R. and ask her if we shan't hurry and take one of the regular sightseeing tours. Heavy rain...
