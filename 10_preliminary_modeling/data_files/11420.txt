I, the dreamer, approached Mr. Harry Schenk, an instructor in the physics dept. to ask him to fill out another recommendation for medical school for me. However, he reached out his hand as if to contratulate me at the same time he reached into his vest pocket, which I have never known him to wear in reality. He pulled out a letter with my name on it. When I read it I found that an international physics and chemistry society had awarded me a scholarship for the coming year if I would in spare time aid by teaching lab work in the physics and chemistry depts. Naturally, I was very astonished but quite eager about the whole affair and accepted it at once. For the rest of the day I received congratulations from all of the science teachers that I have ever had or have known indirectly. The day was wonderful and I realized that this all would aid me tremendously in getting into medical school.
