I was in a desert-like place. Someone found something with a 'neverending' supply of orange gems. Some others and I went there. We went through a door and Rick from The Walking Dead show was there with a black guy. A kid said he wasn't his father and left and Rick was sad. The place collapsed and a big door went down and we got trapped. It talked to us and said we were stuck forever. But then it decided to give us 515 days to get some stuff done. There was a party. The black guy proposed to his girlfriend. I drank alcohol and was lying on the floor pretending to be asleep. Ezra was dancing in a hoodie, which was a fashion thing he was into. The black girl from before was saying the wedding was expensive and fragile. Someone asked this other girl and I what our favourite part of the cake was and I said 'the nice bit with the hard chocolate bit'.
