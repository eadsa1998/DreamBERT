One farmer has all the water and grows lush veggies and food. We all have to pay him. I decide to go talk to him and reason with him. People laugh at me. I go there and say, "I'd like some of your water." He stares at me, shocked by my foolishness or courage. I don't know which. He laughs. Now I'm in trouble! He's going to make it hard on me. My "husband" and I try to farm our land. I come home to find all the windows opened and our food dumped out of the fridge. I am angry and call "Mr. Scott" up on the phone. A man answers and I ask for Mr. Scott. He says he's not home. I say, "Then let me talk to Mrs. Scott." He says, "Which one? The first one?" This is somehow important information I wasn't supposed to know. I leave a message. I tell him that this time of rule is nearly over. We are gathering strength and he will be over thrown. The tides go in and the tides go out. All I have to do is wait and then he will be out.
