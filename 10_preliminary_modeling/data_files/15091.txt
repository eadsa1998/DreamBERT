I was on a mountain. The sea was below. I went down a bit to look for rocks as there were some grey rocks which had something useful in them, which was why we were there. They were loose and I couldn't get back up. Someone grabbed my hand and helped me up. Adam Baldwin was also down there with me (he was new) and I grabbed his hand and pulled him up, which was easy because he helped too. Someone said "shark" and I looked at the sea, but saw nothing. But they meant dragon and we got rid of it. There was a little 'cave' which two purple dragons. I had to get their attention and put a blanket over this fire and I had to do this for "77 minutes".
