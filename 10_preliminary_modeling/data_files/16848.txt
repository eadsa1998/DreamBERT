There was a huge animal - a wolf or bear-like beast loose in the area. It is enormous - the size of a horse but fatter, squatter and has features more like a cat. Initially this beast was captured and sedated - tied down with straps and blankets, but somehow it revived itself and got away. There was panic. People were running around trying to get to safety.
