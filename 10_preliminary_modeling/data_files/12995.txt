Dad liked some movie program thing. I was on a site and it showed my password which was 'johnnyd' (I figured it was meant to be Johnny Depp), then it was 'johnnyb' and then 'jonasb' (Jonas Biggs). I was confused about it. I was in a line to get water at this cinema place. There were a couple people in the front and then suddenly I was miles away, so I gave up. Aunt Sally was in the line. Then I realized that I had a water bottle anyway.
