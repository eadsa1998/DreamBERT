Driving north on about 4th St., N.W., on what seemed to be my regular route to the office. My car was in left lane of a double line of cars. A single line of traffic was moving southward at same time. To reach office it would be necessary to make a left turn on N.Y. Ave., but just before reaching this street, I suddenly remember that there is a business matter (something to do with the settlement of the estate) which should be discussed with a man, and to reach this person a right turn will have to be made at New York Ave. This is awkward, as I am in wrong lane for a right turn, but I begin making .... made by my right forearm, and apparently are intended to be seen by drivers or cops in front and not by drivers behind.
