I am living in a tall building and I am snowbound. I am sitting by a heat register looking out a window. One leg is cold and when I look it has frozen and split open. My boyfriend from high school and a female neighbor/friend I grew up with are there visiting. I'm sitting on his knee. My parents are also there. We go in and out the window of the top floor of the tall building. My parents and some man leave. My father jumps. I yell at my mother not to do it too. She says something about not looking down and then takes the ladder down.
