I found a new TV show to watch. I can't remember what it was about but it was a teenage type of thing. This girl needed a transplant and her boyfriend agreed to do it. She wasn't sure about it though. His sister came and she tried to make it sound like she was cheating with her, then she admitted the truth. There was an interview with her and she was saying that because she was short, she had to be better looking and they had to shorten everyone's name by 3/4. Someone said "perfect 24.3" but I can't remember what it was about. Two months later, he went to a friend on an oval. He collapsed and the girl came. There were drugs. People climbed over the fence.
