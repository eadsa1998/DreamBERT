I was working at Dill's. I got a lot of oil splashed on my shirt. John Walker told us that the three big shots lied to each other and the truth came out. I counted the machines on my line and they had put three more on the line and they were set close. I had two machines so close that when they were running the indexes  locked or jammed from one machine to the other. I had a machine running 363 screw that we used to make at White Machine Co. I was repeating Jet Marble.
