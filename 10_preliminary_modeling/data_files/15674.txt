I was part of an underground movement during World War 2 and the SS were looking for us. The leader guy was basically Hans Landa (Inglorious Basterds) (his personality was very similar), but looked different. He had a wide nose. Calvin was part of the group and we went into a house where there were lots of old people. It was well furnished and looked of the times. We saw him come through the door and we got on our knees and were crawling around trying to find a way out and avoid him. He found us though and took us outside. He told me to dig a grave in the snow for Calvin, who was now someone else. I was wearing a shirt and shorts and had no shoes on and I had to use my hands. It was very cold and I started scooping it. I was a few feet away from him and I chose a moment to start running away. He followed me, but walked. I never stopped running, and went through a field with lots of abandoned, ruined castle looking buildings. I ended up in a building which was full of stuff and had lots of shelves and I ducked in between them trying to find a way out. He followed me in there, still calmly walking down the middle of the building. I climbed up some shelves and boards to a door leading outside (but it was like the equivalent of a balcony). I climbed down a ladder down the side and ended up back in the room. Any exit I went through was a dead end or brought me back to the room. The guy said something like 'you really want to live', but was getting annoyed with me. He ended up cornering me and held a gun up to my head and I was saying 'please don't, I'll do anything' etc. He seemed to hesitate and I was hoping he would have some respect for my will to leave from having escaped him so long.
