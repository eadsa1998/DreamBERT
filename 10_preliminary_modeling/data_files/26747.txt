 I have some sort of interaction with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I'm walking, and see her walking the opposite direction. We both look different, and are different people than we knew each other to be the last time we met. We stare at each other as we pass, and slow down, stopping in front of each other. It's been a long time and we're unfamiliar with each other. I'm very interested in talking with her and hearing about her life now. I hope, and I think, that she is equally interested in learning about the changes in me. We begin to talk. She seems to be standing in a house or on the steps. An old man comes and harshly confronts her and I, but it seems mostly directed towards her because she is in his house. We leave. She has short hair, above shoulder length. I have a goatee.
