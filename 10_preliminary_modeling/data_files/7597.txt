After he left, another young man came out from behind the reception desk. I told him I was waiting for Debbie Phillips [unknown in waking life]. He said, oh yeah you have some forms to fill out. At that point I felt like I was a new employee. I don't know why I thought that. He walked away and I was just kind of wandering around the front office area there. There was an antique sewing machine there. Very similar to mine only I remember thinking how large it was and how I guess this interested in it. I remember thinking how much I like antiques. There was no name on it. It didn't have the make of the sewing machine like mine has on it. I don't remember seeing the pedal at the floor, but I walked around the front and pulled some of the drawers open. There were papers and stuff in there. At that point, the second young man came back out. I said, sorry, I'm just really interested in antiques. I have an antique sewing machine, but this one is larger and I was somewhat intrigued by it. He said, oh, that's okay.
