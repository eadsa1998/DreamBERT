I believe that I was living with Mary Kay C and one other woman. Matthew was a young boy 4 1/2 years old. The other woman had a client's coming to the house that day. Mary Kay C and Matthew were both at home. Mary Kay C, the other woman and Matthew were all downstairs, and I was upstairs working in my study. Shortly after the client arrived Matthew came upstairs and stayed with me. After the client left the other woman came upstairs to talk with me. She was very upset with Matthew. When the client had arrived, Matthew went up to her and was talking to her. He was just being friendly. He didn't realize he was doing anything wrong. I'm not even sure he was doing anything wrong. This woman felt that he was being intrusive and bothering her clients. Mary Kay C walked in on our conversation. Fortunately, she defended Matthew. She said something to the effect, to this other woman, what do you really expect from a 4 1/2 year old?
