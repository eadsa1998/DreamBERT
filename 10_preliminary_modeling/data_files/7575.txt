This is a long complicated dream in which  a former work colleague of mine who died several years ago is taking me somewhere. In one scene he is talking to me in a bedroom. Mary is sleeping on the bed and his voice is so low that I can't make out what he's saying. He is talking low so as not to awaken Mary. I have only a flash of seeing Mary when some light falls across her sleeping face. In this dream there is a scene where I am trying to open the door of a van but my key breaks when I turn it in the lock. I manage to get the broken piece of the key out of the lock and I am pleased because I think I can now get another key made from the two pieces of my broken key.
