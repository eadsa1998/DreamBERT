I saw Ehnce to Now Hear This in the entries. I seemed to be above the earth and saw an atomic explosion. Then I was back down on the earth driving a car on a highway. I was driving at a fair rate of speed, but some of the drivers were passing me at a high rate of speed. I seemed to be standing at their speed. I was wheel-barrowing some items and Bill Grove gave me a hand when I got sort of stalled.
