I'm in the back yard of a really nice house and am attending an outdoor BBQ with a bunch of  adults. I never see my parents, but I assume they are there. I suddenly remember that my friend is the bartender of the local taqueria tonight and that means free drinks, so I say goodbye to everyone and am now sitting at a table in the restaurant. My friend Michael (who I never talk to at work) is sure enough the bartender and I order a margarita. He says, "That will be $7.50." I'm thinking, "What the hell, Dude, that's pretty expensive for a margarita and I thought I was getting hooked up," but I pay anyway. He makes it for me and it comes in a tiny little cup with a straw and I'm thinking, "Oh, you've got to be kidding me!" I sit down at my table and drink it and Michael asks me how it was. I say, "Dude, I don't feel anything," and he says, "Oh, if you wanted me to make you a drink that would get you fucked up, you should've just asked." "Now you tell me," I say. I'm about ready to leave when a group of girls over at the bar invite me to sit with them. They all work at the bakery, but I don't recognize any of them. Michael gives me another drink and implies with his hand that it's free. The girls ask, "Why do you get free drinks?" And I say, "It's no big deal, but... I know the bartender." And they say, "Oh, my God, that's so cool!" Then I realize that even though the bar is crowded, the restaurant is empty and my group is the only ones there, and I think, "It's cool to go to the bar with a group of girls." Then I wake up.
