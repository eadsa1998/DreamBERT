I was walking in the country and came to a farmhouse. I asked the lady of the house if I could shovel the snow for $5. She hired me and after working for a while, I was invited for dinner. I remember it was quite unpleasant and the lady of the house seemed rather displeased with me. The food seemed quite delicious, but I was very worried. All of a sudden there were quite a few people that came in and they seemed very unsocial. The lady of the house warmed up to me when they came in and the meal became quite pleasant.
