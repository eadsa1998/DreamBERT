Darren went to some place that was like a party but it was brothel like. He had sex with this young girl, who someone said later was only 10. He got worried and tried to find out some information, but then it looked like she was only 8. He tried to talk to her and she cried and acted like he did something wrong. Later, I was at this place which had lots of storeys. It was just a square building with water in the middle and ramps around the edge. There was a party or something going on. There was music playing and I heard Talking Loud and Clear playing. There was a room to the side which was like a classroom. Andy McCluskey was in there at the front sitting by himself. There had been some voting thing for bands and people had voted for their favourite songs and the bands for each were tallied. Andy won with 1003 votes. No-one clapped or did anything, so I clapped and said "Well screw all of you!" and Andy was like "thanks". There was this huge eel like monster in the water. It had tentacles that were like 15 feet long and they were flat. I managed to tie two of them up around a pillar.
