I was looking for Ann. She took a walk with a fellow I know to someone's home. I looked for her at night. I saw the two guys and they said they took her by some friend's house. They were kidding me till it dawned on me they were kidding me and she was right near me. Ann drove my car around the block without putting on the lights at night with the kids. Audrey ran up close to a train to throw a rock at it. It was so close, she leaned back and fell out of the way. The brakemen, firemen, train stopped and the crew came to me. I was spanking Audrey for doing it. Some of the fire crew took one spank at her rump for doing that with my permission. While I was laying in bed, I seemed to hear hollow boots.
