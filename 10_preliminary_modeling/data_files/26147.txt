 I'm at a funeral at the Hill Park pavilion working with the funeral home directors. I work with one group of directors and the funeral goes fine. There is a second funeral, with a second group of directors. I'm pushed around and not respected: I'm the rookie. I walk up with one or tow other men to take the casket from the stage. This requires one to be graceful, solemn, and surefooted, among other things. We walk up on the stage and pick up the coffin. I carry one end of it and two men carry the other end. I back down the steps first and they follow with the other end. I carry the bulk of the weight. We get down on the cement. The men carrying the other end of the casket let go, and I strain to support the entire weight of the casket by holding on to one end. The end of the wooden casket cracks. After the ceremony I walk and talk with a man who seems to be the leader of the second group of directors I worked with. I tell him that things didn't work out well for me: that I was mistreated and I don't want to work with his group anymore.
