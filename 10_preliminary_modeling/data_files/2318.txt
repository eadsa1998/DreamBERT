A naked man walking with a white horse follows us, spying. He is hidden in the grasses and I see his eyes peeking out. When he gets close, I realize he's a friend. Then he starts having a heart attack and I hug him as he's lying in my arms. I try to encourage him to stay, but he's dying. He says, "Tell Susan." His name is Charlie and I keep saying "Charlie, Charlie."
