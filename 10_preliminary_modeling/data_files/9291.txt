I was at SVSDC. It was a huge, open space, the size of a very large warehouse, and very industrial looking. It felt chaotic and claustrophobic to me as it had stuff everywhere. I can't identify any particular things, just lots of steel. I saw Doctor C. I was happy to see him and he was happy to see me. He made a comment implying that he had decided I wasn't going to go visit him anymore because it had been so long since I had went to see him. No one I knew worked there anymore.  (97 words)</span
