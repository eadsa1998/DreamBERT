I was two other people, searching for something. We were in a seemingly empty room. The way I can think to describe the inside size and appearance of this room is an empty airplane hanger. Even the ceilings were enormously high. It was well lit. We noticed something near the ceiling in the far, left corner of the room. The main part of the object was circular, kind of like a large horizontal ring around the outer rim, a horizontal circle that was suspended inside and a little bit higher than the ring. It had a special light in or shining on it, which is how we spotted it. We seemed pretty sure that if we positioned ourselves right under it we could easily propel ourselves from the floor up into the object under our own power. We had barely stepped underneath the object when we began to propel upwards, almost like slow-moving rockets. When we got beyond the first ring we saw the other ring. This one was vertical and maybe 12 or so inches deep. Both rings were easily 6 or more feet in diameter. We landed and stood on the vertical ring, looking down at both the circle and the outer ring. The difference between the lighting around this object and the lighting in the rest of the room was still clearly noticeable. I don't know where we were or why we were there.
