We were leaving for school in ten minutes. Dad had to work. Mom and Ezra were there. I had to straighten my hair, so I said that I'd get Mom to take me late. I wanted to not go though, because of a Chemistry test and I was thinking I could get her to pick me up before Physics, but decided that it was pointless and I wanted to practice the English play with Elijah and Theodore.
