I am with my husband and youngest daughter in a barn at the fairgrounds in my hometown. Toys and coffins are in the same area. He says he isn't going to stop there anymore because I am slow. I tell him I'm stuck. I can't get the stroller out. Some other people are there and we don't want them to know we are there. Apparently we are not supposed to be there.
