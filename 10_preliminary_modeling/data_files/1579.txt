Dwight is driving a car. I'm in the passenger seat. He drives. We get lost and go around the block. I'm looking for my Grandpa Lloyd and Grandma Mildred's house. We find it. Before I get out of the car, Dwight hands me a sack. I smile, pleased and surprised. I look in. There are 3 or 4 teddy bears that used to be my favorites. He had remembered and given them to me. I thank him. I go inside I'm surprised to see grandparents alive. I feel a little uncertain about Grandpa who sits and stares into space like he did before he died. I'm not sure if he's alive or dead.
