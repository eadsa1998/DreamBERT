I was doing some editing work and I was just first playing the original CD of Celine Dion's new album and listening to the song called "Prayer" and the first verse was there, and the key change in the third chorus was there. But the second verse was just altogether missing for some reason, and I couldn't figure out why. And then I said, "Okay, that's enough of this," and I was closing out the Little Performer, but when I went to close out the whole thing, these windows kept popping up, and I really couldn't, and it was like a maze trying to get out of it. And then there was something that went wrong, and just about in the middle of all that mess I woke up. Phew!
