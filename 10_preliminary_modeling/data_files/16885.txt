I'm staying in a house that is apparently a film set. It is an old wooden cabin on stilts built on water or boggy land. It has a large wooden deck which has grown mossy. The main house itself has been restored by the film company. Living in the house is my friend Sal and his family. They have invited my family and some other guests. There's another woman who's a kind of spiritualist. She looks like a hippy - wears colorful handmade clothes. The atmosphere is one of a commune. I ask where the toilet is, and I'm shown a curtain in the hall: "behind there." But there's no toilet, just a carpet. So I urinate straight onto that. I'm not comfortable about doing this, but for some reason I do it anyway.
