I dreamed I entered a building with the purpose of attending a demonstration and lecture on anatomy (perhaps an autopsy--I'm not sure). There were a number of people about and I seemed to be part of a group. However, I only noticed and greeted one girl who is a new acquaintance. I asked her if she had been downstairs to the laboratory and she said she had, but became uncomfortable and had to come upstairs. I proceeded down with the group and we arranged ourselves about the table, upon which was a prepared cadaver. This was particularly vivid. I recall the type of cutting that had been done on the skull, and the abdomen had been incised with consequent exposure of the entrails. The attendant or lecturer began to speak and explain something to us when I awoke.
