I was in house with my mother. A man drove our car away. My mother was annoyed. She said he must have borrowed it. The house was like the one we lived in when we resided in my home state. A baby was sleeping in an enclosed part of the porch. I pulled up the shade. My mother was annoyed. She said she didn't want the light to come in. A little later, a dog slinked into the room, and I could tell it was part fox. I told my sister.
