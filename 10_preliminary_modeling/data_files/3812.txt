["Healing Clouds."] I am in a house. We are moving. I am going to live with my mother. I am in her bedroom looking for things of mine I left behind when I had moved out before. One of my daughters is helping me. I look at a rack of clothes and realize they are all my mother's and none are mine. I do find one old large purse that is mine. I look at some pictures on the wall. They are hers. I see some native American artifacts and they are hers. I say to my daughter, she has the real stuff. Mine was just trinkets. I see Aunt Naomi and say I look forward to us living together. She says I'm not living with you. I'll still be in Dover. It's too hot where you will be. She is seated in an open window and I look past her to the sky and am suddenly very impressed. Huge dark clouds contrasting with bits of bright light. A storm is brewing. I say to Naomi. Look. It is so beautiful. She does not appear interested and doesn't even turn her head to look. I watch in admiration as huge clouds form and billow out at me like a movie of rapid time frames. I say to Naomi. It's just like in the movies. Huge thunder clouds rushing and growing right down at me. Then beings come out of the clouds. One, a male being, comes right in the window and I back up, afraid. He reaches for me as I am pushed back against the bed. He touches me, over my heart. I realize he is healing me and I relax, happily, to his touch.
