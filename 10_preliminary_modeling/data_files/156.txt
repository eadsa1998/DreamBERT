A friend of mine, who lives next door or nearly, is associated with William Shatner in a business capacity - is she an actress too, or something else? - but I saw her with him by accident someplace - out somewhere, maybe, but I think through a window - and they were behaving like sort of "pre-lovers", and I do believe they're striking up a romance. I'm coming back home on the bus and I go by her house. I think I'll go in and ask her about it. She mentions him before I do, and I think either she doesn't want people to know they're seeing each other socially (she's embarrassed about it), or she doesn't realize it herself.
