Dwight was sad because he lost his girlfriend who is an invisible spirit or an alien. Her name is Clara or Laura. She comes and gets him and I am happy for him. There are aliens pursuing me. I grab a rope with heavy things on each end of it and swing it back and forth, smashing it from one wall to the next or rather from the left side of me to the right side of me, knocking at the aliens. This doesn't stop them. One runs at me and I catch him by the legs and he falls. Now I run and one chases me. I know I can't outrun him, so I suddenly throw myself to the ground and he can't stop fast enough and falls. I get up and run more, and see a secret place to hide and crawl in. I was earlier taking pictures with my camera. I saw a flying turkey vulture and a big one and a baby one roosting together. The images were compelling and strong. I felt happy to be able to take the pictures with my camera.
