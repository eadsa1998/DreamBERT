I am at a tea given by Mrs. St. J. Get in line for refreshments. When I get there only one small sandwich left but several varieties of cookies. I take 2 or 3 white ones, one oblong and one very thin and am offered a chocolate one and take it. Look across room and wonder about going to chat with others but they seem to be leaving as soon as fed. C.H. and M.N. come in while I was in line. Mr. St. J. disappears and I hear much splashing of water. Think I'd better go in the kitchen and help with the dishes. When there I see C.H., a man and another woman all bare to the waist, scrubbing vigorously at their backs. Inquire how come. The stove had exploded and dirtied them. Already It had been removed but other repairs had not yet been made. I look out the window and see water pouring from a broken line.
