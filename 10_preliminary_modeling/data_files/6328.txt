I was brought to the future. The world was war-torn. The people that brought me there were rebels fighting aliens that took over. They showed me tapes of when this take-over was to happen. They sent me back to my own time to try and stop them. I got as many people as I could to help me, but they all ended up dying. I was able to slip a computer virus into the mother ship's main computer, causing them to return to their own planet.
