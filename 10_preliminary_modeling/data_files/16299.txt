We had a black chicken that we found somewhere, and we took her in. And she had kind of a deep-from-the-gut balk like Loretta has. And she was a foreigner to the others, of course, and we had two white chickens in this dream. So two white chickens and a red one, plus the black one that we found. And the black one was a foreigner to the others, so they would always shoo the black one away. And I had to distract the others and feed the black one. And she wasn't real tame and we had to tame her and like hold her and talk to her to get her to like us better. And I don't think we've ever had a black chicken. And then I dreamt that I was keeping up with Mrs. Hollander and her AP test, and I dreamt that she had totally no confidence in me, that I was going to do well at all in my AP test. She just totally thought I was going to not pass. And she wanted me to come in when she gives her class a practice test, and she wanted me to take it. And I was so nervous because I didn't want her to have my head if I didn't pass the AP test. And then I woke up.
