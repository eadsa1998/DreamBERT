My brother and I (with perhaps also my partner and kids) are trying to cross a border in a snow covered harsh rural environment - perhaps somewhere in Russia. We are part of a long line of refugees, but for some reason we are being chased by some agents or border control guards. We're trying to get across unnoticed, but it doesn't work, and a chase ensues. We end up being split up in the panic and crowds. I fire a gun. I'm highly stressed when I wake up.
