I was part of a nationality parade in downtown Cleveland. We were marching three abreast. Each national group was distinct by something they wore. One group I remember wore Philadelphia cream cheese packages in their ears. The Russian group wore on their lapels red and white flowers. I glanced at the person marching next to me (a young woman, I think). She had little black dots resembling raisins in her ears. That meant she was a Sicilian, which made me one too because I was marching with her. The sky began to get dark and it began to rain. I had to leave the parade and round up my nursery school group. I could only find 3 of them. Two were 3-1/2 year old boys and the third was the nursery director's girl, who's also in my group. I looked for the children's drivers to take them home. I was carrying one of the boys who, though in real life is quite large, felt very light. We finally met one of the drivers who took the little girl. It was very dark and raining hard by now. Since I couldn't find the 2 boys' driver, I began to look for my car, which had been parked somewhere downtown. I couldn't find that either. Finally met the nursery director. She didn't seem at all worried where her little girl was, nor cared where my car was. She got into her car and drove away.
