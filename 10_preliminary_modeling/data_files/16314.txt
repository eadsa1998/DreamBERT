I had my mixer, my calculator, my CD player, a little audio system and stuff set up at the kitchen table. We were doing math and I was kind of doing sound stuff too. And the mixer had its faders like it does, and it had this panel of numbers off to the side that you could use as a calculator too. And the bizarrest part is the back of the mixer, there was this cap and you would uncap the cap and there would be like this really, really, really sharp, sharp blade that kind of spins around and you would put a CD in and it would play it, but it would chop it all up. And when I took it out, I just touched it and I cut myself, and then we were kind of doing math and stuff. Then I dreamt that we were going to see Mrs. Heit in the hospital, and we went up the elevator and we were going around, and then I realized that it wasn't a hospital; it was a hotel and we had a room there. Mom and I were on a trip. And we went to this little restaurant on the beach, and we were there ordering our food and we asked the waitress if she would get the bill people to unload our stuff from the car. [big yawn] Then we were swimming in the water and like looking for fish and looking for sharks and stuff. And then I was back at the kitchen table with my mixer and stuff, and oh, one other thing to this dream -- I dreamt that I was supposed to go to Brittany's house that day, and I had recorded a concert on the VCR to take the tape over to her. But I also had drawn these pictures that I had taken pictures of with the camera, and then I was going to like animate and make them move and do things and stuff. It was kind of weird; well, it was neat.
