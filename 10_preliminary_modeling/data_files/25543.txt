 Something is happening with junior varsity basketball. I am in a place. Shawn Kemp shows up, followed by other Supersonics players. The others include a fat athletic trainer, a tall man that plays center, and a man with a scar on his back. There is a practice being held. I threaten one man. I tell him I'm going to kick his ass on the court. I am then in the practice and I'm determined to do well. The practice is some sort of aerobics/dance/basketball practice. I have no, or bad, shoes on, and have no traction. My mom is there. She talks to the coach or instructor. Then she short of mingles her way around, stopping to say hi to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. My mom makes her way over to me. She says, "It's Pink Day". I look up and see green and pink cards or pieces of paper hanging in strips from the ceiling. A pale green card has the number 21 on it. I am annoyed with my mom for loafing around. I want her to take care of her business and leave.
