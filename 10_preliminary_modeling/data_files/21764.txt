I saw Wheel Guard. I was repairing or doing some kind of stem work. I was cutting them in two or halves and then shaving off the burrs left inside of the hole. I saw 0 6. I heard 15 and 15 that's who it is, 15. I had 16 horses written on a piece of paper and I wanted to know which horse would win. I was working on my machines in Dill's. I went over and operated another machine on a different line and there were small screws on the bench. I cleaned them off. I cleaned out the brass chips out of the machines. I saw Harold Hilts standing it he department waiting for starting time. He looked much younger and better. Bob came over to me. He was to work by Hill's. He said, "I will work here till Nick calls me, then I will work for Nick."
