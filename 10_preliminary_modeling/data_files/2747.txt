I am a fan and Elvis is bored. He's way up high on a stage singing and I am way on the floor listening. After he's through singing, his manager or someone whisks him away from the crowd. I get caught up in that and it is decided I can keep him company. We go to a room and Elvis says, "Sit here." I thought he meant on his lap. But he was indicating the chair across from him. I sit and talk like an empathetic counselor, "You look tired."
