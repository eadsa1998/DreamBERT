I see Father Andrew arrive at a big Greek restaurant outside the Church; "I thought you were on vacation," I say to him. We sit around with Frank. I am wearing a nightgown (inappropriate dress). Then I get ready for Church. There are storm warnings. We go to Church. We see Father Andrew after Church. He gives Frank a newspaper clipping.
