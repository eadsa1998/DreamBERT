 I see a rhinoceros and shoot at it with my shotgun using slugs. I hit it in the body or hindquarters and it keeps running. It runs through the streets and alleys at home. I shoot at it when I can. My shots are poor: hasty. My housemate Stephen Ramos is on the stairs at home. I'm there, near the door to my room. He tells me something about where the rhinoceros came from: either it did or didn't come from the nucleus. I think it did come from the nucleus. I say this because I saw it. I tell Stephen he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that he is I because he is in my dream. He disappears.
