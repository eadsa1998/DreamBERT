I was in the Grammar School playground, and this time Angela had taken off to somewhere in the school. So I ran over to Julie and asked her if she knew where Angela was, and she said: "I can't tell you that." At first I thought she was just being a bitch about it. But then I asked her why. Then she sort of laughed and said: "I haven't seen her all day. Why don't you talk to her brother over there?" So then I walked over to the bus stop. I was greeted by a 7-foot-tall giant of a dork who said: "Who the hell are you?" I said: "I'm David, have you seen Angela? He said, "Yeah, she's in the school building." I said, "Great," and started walking to the school. He stopped me, gave me a giant slab of masking tape rolled up to look like a joint the size of a cigar. He said, "first let's play some games." We both walked out into the street to a cone, then stood there until a truck came by. Then we'd wait until the truck was a little bit away, then we'd run into the bushes pretending to swear in Spanish. We did this five or six times, then I woke up.
