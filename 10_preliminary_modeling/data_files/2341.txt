I am running from some guy that's powerful and sexually interested in me. I hide and run through the trees, up dirt roads, and finally I abandon the car and run on foot. I go through a corn field, eating some corn. I'm tired and figure I've lost him so I lay down to sleep a few hours. A man comes to me and says, "You can rest for awhile but then you've got to leave because people are always hiding in here and my mother will run a combine through here at dawn and she will do it, so you'd better be out of here before then. She even knows which part of the field everyone usually uses! OK?" I agree. I rest and then get up and continue running. There are more houses now and I then see a sandy beach to a river. Across the river is modern buildings, a hospital. I see people putting on muslin sheet robes and going into the river to swim. I think about diving in, but someone says, "You have to brine first." It's a cleansing, healing river and the sheets have brine in them. You have to go to the hospital and get the sheets first. I see a man floating in there, both his hands bandaged. I continue on my journey.
