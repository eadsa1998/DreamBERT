I had a dream about the amplifier. I dreamt that we were, first of all, I dreamt that we were going into this movie theater, but then before the movie started, we were at home and we were watching the movie with the amplifier on. And we were going to take an intermission for a while, and I put it on tuner and, it started doing this thing where it went louder and louder all by itself. And so I took it and I held the knob and I kind of clicked it back into place, and then it was okay for a while. Then it started going down, down, down, down instead of up, up, up, and so then I had to kind of click it into place again, which is really not the way to do it in real life.
