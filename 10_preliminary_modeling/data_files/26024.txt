 I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson playing the Nintendo game Metroid. His player dies quickly when it's his turn. I'm a good player, and my player does well: gets far. I go in one are to find the freeze ray. Everything with color on the screen is the color of freeze ray: silverfish-grayish-white. I shoot missiles all the time, not just bullets. My player jumps up. There are cars in the game, which I shoot. I begin going on a race track-like path with many cars. I control one car. I go fast and shoot many cars that blow up. I do very well: I'm going very fast shooting and going by things in my way. I'm going to win the game, pass the level, and finish the race first. My cousin Henry King steps on my car, keeping it from moving. I control the car by pushing a button on my pants, like a joystick. I try to finish the race in the remaining time; I don't know if I can.
