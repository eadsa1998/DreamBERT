I dreamed I went to visit O_____ University. (I had never really been there) I went with a fella who I date pretty often. There I saw two girl friends of mine sitting in class - taking notes. The boy and I just stood there and watched them take notes. When the class was over one of the girls, who in reality is a tall girl, came over and said "hello" to the fella I was with but not to me. Both she and he made me feel very little - in the dream they both seemed about six feet tall or over - which made me feel very small. I was angry when she said "hello" to him and not to me.
