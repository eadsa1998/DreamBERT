I was talking to Emma, and then I was walking when I saw a girl. And I knew I ought to have said hello, and that I knew her, but I had never seen her face. Someone came over to me and told me that it was Emily, and I was afraid and confused. I never thought that we would meet again. I could have talked a bit with her, but did not do it. She was not spontaneous and talked to me only out of courtesy. I felt the desire that nothing would have happened, that I could demonstrate that her past attitude was not really so false, but it was not possible.
