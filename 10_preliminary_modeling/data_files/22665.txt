This dream is about my sister-in-law and my little nephews. In real life I had a problem with my sister-in-law who lives at home. Well, in the dream she got sick. Just as in real life, she made life hell for me, bugging me and talking back to my parents. I confronted and she got sick. Suddenly, in the dream, I saw that she died, and I cried very much because she had left two little children. I couldn't stand the grief and, I don't know why, I felt guilty since the fights we had were caused by her. She started them, I would think, as I cried and heard my little nephews cry and ask for their mother. I felt badly and that everyone was blaming me for having made orphans of my nephews.
