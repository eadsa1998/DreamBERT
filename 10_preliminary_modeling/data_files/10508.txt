I go swimming with Steve, not Pedro. We have to take the train, I forgot my money and borrow $15.- from Steve. I promise to pay him back by getting the money at home and returning to pick him up. I take the train home and get involved with Zena - some problem I can't recall; M. is using the phone, so I am delayed, so I decide to page Steve at the Y and tell him I will be late. I call and she asks me to wait while they page him. I realize that he must have gone on to work by himself. I call him at work and he says "Never worry, see you tomorrow, keep the $15. We can share the shampoo" (expensive kind).
