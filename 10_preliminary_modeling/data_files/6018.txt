A competition is being held for the purpose of determining who can break or shatter glass into the most beautiful geometric pattern. One of the contestants, a young boy, walks up on the stage and prepares to break a plane of glass standing beside him. For dramatic effect, he plays a musical flourish on a harmonica. Somehow the harmonica, which is tied to a string hanging from the ceiling, slips out of his control. The harmonica swings like a pendulum and strikes the pane of glass, much to the boy's horror. But the outcome of this accident is lucky, for the pane breaks first into four perfect quarters, followed by each quarter breaking into three pieces of equal size. The audience gasps in awe at this presumably winning entry in the competition.
