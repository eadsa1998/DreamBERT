Grass would not grow because the dirt was packed down in front of the porch where we played and we were working on the yard. I was suppose to fix it, but I didn't know what to do, so I was stacking sea shells into the dirt, every few inches, to get some air into the ground. There were 3 kinds of shells I was sticking in and I put them in rows. I was real careful putting them in.
