I'm on some journey up a mountain. I stop at a native hut and look at the pretty miniature dishes and furniture. They are fragile. When I'm ready to leave, I bow three times, touching my forehead to each of the 3 walls, then looking up at the door and saying, "Thank you." (It was a house on stilts.) Something about Paulina needing more of my attention. I seem to be unwilling to give her much.
