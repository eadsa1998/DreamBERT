["Howard leaves and I'm glad."] I am in a house and Howard and Bob H. comes into the house. I am packing or organizing a mess in one room and Howard comes in, angry and says he will leave. I smile and say good. I want you to leave. He is upset with me and I am relieved he is finally getting out of my life.
