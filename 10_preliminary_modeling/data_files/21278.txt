I was a government employee. We were testing a sort of secret weapon and had to be cautious because we were watched by spies and we didn't want to give them any information. It seemed to be a speed jet or rocket we were testing out. I know there was a hook used in the test. It was used either to stop or start the speed. Then I had an opportunity to learn as a high skill technician. I was thinking of my age the mortgage I had and how it would be taken care of as I was in the service. I was then a father of a baby to Ann and we were to go on an experimental performance of a few babies. I played or handled the little baby. I was riding on a boat or something similar. It seemed I had a big bar of steel in my hands. I pushed it out the door and let it down on some ice. The ice was thin and it broke.
