I was at a shop in the frozen section. There were two girls. One said something to me about keys. The only thing I had on me was a bar of chocolate. There were shelves and they made a story play out and they moved stuff around without moving. I told someone that it was cool but I wasn't going to give them any money. The girl got angry. She went invisible and attacked me. At one point she broke her neck over the thing they put the ice-creams in. She was still ok and I finally escaped from the shop. It was dark outside. I called Mom but I had no signal. I tried to call Dad but it didn't work. I found some police and they said to follow them, then tried to lead me to this shifty place so I ran off. I tried calling the police and there was still nothing. I was really scared and upset and I did a reality check and realized I was dreaming. I started shouting "Wake up!". I was then in bed and I was at Mom's house, but it was different. Darren was up and Smudgy was there. Darren brought him to me and I was thinking that I haven't seen him in a long time. I heard a guy's voice out the back. He was throwing stuff into a pool. The house was two storeys. He walked up these stairs and I recognized from a dream I'd had. He threw something and it landed above a person in a photo. I said that happened before and he remembered too. The photo was of a wedding and I asked "Who's Jenna McCarthy?". This guy in the photo looked like Andrew McCarthy and I thought 'Oh, that's who'. Kristen Bell was in the photo and I said it was "the ugly girl from Heroes".
