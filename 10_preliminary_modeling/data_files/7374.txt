Mother and I were seated on a bench in the stateroom when a porter came in with a lot of baggage which he piled on a seat under the window. I had mother move to a better seat at the side of the room. I went to urinate but couldn't. There were a lot of help talking about me. She said because I wouldn't fly. I said that was on a former trip and we were late arriving in Shanghai so passengers were transferred to planes but I felt no rush since my destination was so close to the wharf. Then we talked about railroads in Europe and I remarked the only continent where one railroad crossed it was North America since other countries used different gauges.
