I live in a little house a bit like Grandmom's - that style, wood floors and screen doors, not fancy. I've called a TV repairman earlier, to come and fix a TV set, but haven't fixed a time (or a price, I think). I'm just now coming home to find this guy in the middle of my living-room floor, working on another set than the one I asked about. I'm very disturbed about his being there without my knowing about it. I ask him who let him in, but don't get an answer. He seems to think this is all perfectly normal and I'm bothering him. The furniture's mostly gone from the living room and I'm thinking burglary, but he says he moved it because he needed the room. He's worked on several things so far, including things other than TV sets. I'm quite incensed about the whole thing and we go back and forth about it. I point out that I didn't order anything else done and I didn't want it done and won't pay for it. I don't think he has any excuse beyond "I wasn't told what to fix so I fixed what was broken", but still I'm worried I'll have to pay, and I'm really anxious to find out how he got in here.
