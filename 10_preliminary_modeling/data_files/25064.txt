 I am by the Chinese Restaurant where the McDonalds used to be in Oak Valley. I'm behind the restaurant with another person, near the driveway of the light green house with the dogs that I used to deliver papers to. I have a rope with a big rock tied to the end. I am throwing the rock at windows that are high up on the restaurant. I break some windows, but can't get the rock up to the big window I want to. The string gets wrapped around the middle pane in a window. I pull it and it unwraps. We've been there a while, and I'm worried we might get caught. A man, his wife, and their daughter come around the building. They are the owners. I run, going through the back yard of the house with the dogs. I'm about to go over the fence, but the little girl catches me and I stay. I could run, since the girl is only about 3 years old, but I don't. The wife comes and throws a fit of anger, screaming and jumping up and down. I think she is going to kick me. I could beat her and run, but I stay. I yell at her, asking how much she wants me to pay for the windows. I think I have enough. I ask her, "How many Yen?" She doesn't answer. Her husband comes. I try to get out of trouble by paying them for the damage. I don't think it works.
