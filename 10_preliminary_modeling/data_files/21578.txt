I drove to an intersection from a side street. I pulled out too far. A police car was coming thru the green light. He made a left turn across the street and stopped. I backed up so he would not give me a ticket for same. The windshield was steamed up good because I could just about see the light as it turned green. I started to pull out when I saw a car coming at me and stopped. I stopped and looked and I was on the left side of the street, so I backed up and got out of the way of the car. It was dark.
