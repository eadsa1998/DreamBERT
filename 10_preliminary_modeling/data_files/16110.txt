I had a dream last night that I had multiple handicaps and that I couldn't hold in my bladder, and that I had to wear pads all the time for if I had to go pee. And I would just have to let it go. And later I dreamt that I was at school in Mrs. Hollander's room and we were doing something, and I had to put my book bag somewhere, so I went in the auditorium and I put my book bag down. And the auditorium had no seats in it; it was just a big room. And then I heard Mr. Vaccaro's class coming and I went in the closet and closed the door. I didn't want him to see me. And then I figured it was just his students and it was safe to come out. Then I came out and got out and told Melinda that I had wet in the closet. And then I dreamt that I was in my room, in my bedroom with somebody -- two other girls -- and I was playing a destiny's Child CD, but somehow we could see them singing and performing. And they said, "Don't they have strange outfits on?" And I said, "Yeah," because one of them had a table as a hat and a black and white dress.
