A fragment which appears to be a dream within a dream. This occurred in the 1/2 hour in which I went to sleep last night. I woke up from it afterwards. My memory is hazy, but it starts out with my being outside at night, and I don't exactly know the location. But I decide to try and fly. And just a little bit of self-consciousness here. And I manage to soar up from the ground, but my position keeps changing very erratically, on my back to legs higher than my head, and not too much control over it. At this point I become somewhat more self-conscious, and try to will myself to float up, but at the same time I become aware of what I thought was the real world around my body. And I notice that it was somewhat light in the room, that the bedroom door was open about 6 or 7 inches, and that I could hear music playing, sort of a slow jazz selection. I can't really recall it very well. And I was trying not to become completely awake into what I thought was the real world then. But then I woke up about a minute or so later, and I found that I was wrong about what was the real world, because it was much darker in the bedroom than I'd thought, the bedroom door was closed completely, and there was no music going on.
