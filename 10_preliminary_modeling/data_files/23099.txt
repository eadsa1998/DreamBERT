I was on some campus, and was flying all over the place.  It might have been a place I taught part-time, since I went to the department office to check my mail.  But it might also have been another university, since I was late for my English class; it was supposed to meet at 9:15, and I arrived between 9:20 and 9:25, and found the class meeting in a boiler room.
