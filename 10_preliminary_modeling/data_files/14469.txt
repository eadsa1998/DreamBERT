I was with Nana. We were going to Michael Palin's house. We were walking up to it and the house was big (mansion-like). It had a big driveway with a bit of garden. I was telling Nana that I had deja vu. We were going to meet him on the oval. There was a fake battle going on and there were people in costume. We went inside and he was with this lady secretary called "Ms Fichtner". His kitchen was big and had a dining table spreading over two rooms. There was a big bowl of bowl of big bananas. The room was very glassy (lots of windows etc). Then Nana was Raquel. There was a shop section in his house. There was a food section on the outside of a clothes shop. It had desserts on it and Raquel eating them. I had a few bites, but I was full. She ate a lot and when they were finished they put new ones there.
