Laura and I are at Kelly's place. We're working down on the road with a bunch of religious people. Kelly tells us to go to their bagel bakery. The baker, Que Cho (ficticious person), will give us each a bagel. Que Cho looks like he was a professional hit man before he turned to bagel baking. His skin is sompletely pockmarked and scarred, and his nose has definitely been broken more than once. Que Cho gives us each a bagel. We go back to the road. At 2 o'clock I hear somebody ask How much longer will it be until 'Jesus Hour'? Fifteen minutes, the other replies. I run back up to the house and find Laura in Kelly's room. "Kelly!" I say. "They're about to have Jesus Hour. I didn't want to get caught up in it so I came up to get Laura." <br/
