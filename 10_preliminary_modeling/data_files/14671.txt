Dad and I went to a cinema thing to see some creepy movie. It played lots of different things, like there was another movie, then an episode of Supernatural. It went like a cartoon and these balls of light came to this guy and turned into these weird dragon things. They said that these balls of darkness near their planet were actually dragons getting bigger and they would come back in 35 days and will wipe out their sun. We were going to leave the cinema, when the creepy movie started and we sat back down. Then it was actually a stage and Steve Burns was there. He was asking people to go out and walk backwards down the hall. We went to and as we were leaving I asked Dad "did you get the water bottle?". We realized we were the only people and I felt stupid. Steve then met up with us and he was in different clothes. He took us up the hall and then turned a corner. I realized it was the stage and stopped but Dad didn't and kept going. He took him to the far end of the stage and was talking to him. Nana was then there too. I couldn't hear them but I heard him say "if you let me fuck your daughter" and they laughed and were like "how do you know she's over 18?" and he said "she's got her licence right?". Nana came out and said "I think he likes you, you're library/biology teacher" and I said "it's the dude from Blues Clues!" and she said she knew. He made Dad drink water and eat popcorn. He was encouraging him and said "with your little cat mouth" which was really funny and I was trying not to laugh.
