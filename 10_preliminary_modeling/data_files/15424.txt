I was married to Eugene. We had a fight and I went to get a divorce. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were getting one too. The Oscar nominees were getting announced on the TV there. I changed my mind and went back. I had to climb through this pipe to get to this room. Dad came to get a key, but I had changed my pants and they were in my other pair which were on the floor. I sat on the lounge next to Eugene and it was awkward. We went home. We had 7 kids. Mom had bought each a Labrador puppy. I didn't remember being pregnant or having any of them. This American guy was around and I sat outside on a step. He huffed "What is it with y'all and steps?" and I said "What is it with y'all and 'y'all'?". It was smoky outside. Mom wanted us to get started on the next kid. She was buying the Labs off a friend for $3 each. I said that the dogs would be dead before the kids were adults.
