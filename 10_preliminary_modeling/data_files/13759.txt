There was a boat in the water which collected 'freaks'/immigrants. This girl with long stretchy arms jumped in. This young girl's bottom half was horse-like and she liked riding horses. I was at some evil person's house and the backyard had all these broken cars in it and a big pile of mess. I tried to get into some police car (which was GTA IV like). Some guy went to this shop and they had jumpers on a rack which were orange and blue. There was a creepy kid in there and he tried to scare me. Mom was meeting this lady who gave her drugs and we forgot to pay and I remember seeing lots of money. Later, it turned out we had been tipped off about her.
