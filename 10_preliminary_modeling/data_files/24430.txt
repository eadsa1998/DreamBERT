I am in Basic Training in the Army. A Drill Sergeant upbraids me. I beat and pummel him until he is dead. I go to Vietnam. I am with my old company but I am not accepted. I become a loner, an outcast. Roaming about, I shoot down American helicopters. At one point a Chinook lands and G.I.'s new to Vietnam come out and begin to march in single file. I shoot at them but instead of bullets only a spray of water falls on them.
