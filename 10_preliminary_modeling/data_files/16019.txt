Frederick was going away for a bit and we had sex on this mattress on the floor that was in this little nook area. Some time later I was sitting on there with Cecelia and we started kissing. She lay on top of me and she was really light and I asked if that was all her weight and she said yes. I said Frederick was so heavy. We kissed for a bit and then we sat up again and I fingered her. We didn't go any further than that and just hung out. Later, Frederick was back. His hair was different, like it was last year. He came up to me and was putting his arm around my back and shoulders and flirting with me. Cecelia said 'he's just teasing you, don't let him'. I knew he was but I wanted him to.
