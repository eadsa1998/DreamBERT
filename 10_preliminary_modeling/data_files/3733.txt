I am an odd-looking computer machine, quite bulky, old-fashioned and metal. I am told to check out www.20.com. So I don't know how to do this, but push a lot of buttons, one that says "w." on it. All of a sudden, I notice that many different printers are starting to print. An old-fashioned calculator, adding machine is printing out numbers on a paper roll. Then money in the form of bills come out of a metal slide and start dumping out. I run around to the front to retrieve them before they get wet in the water or blow away in the wind.
