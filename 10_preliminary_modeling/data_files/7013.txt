I was hunting through a magazine for an article by J. F. D. that I had seen for I wanted to write him and get in touch with him again after 30 years. I saw J. F. D. and his wife ahead of me on the road. Heard them say something about a disaster on Cape Cod. Caught up with them and asked them about it. A bombing. When? Read about it in the National Geographic. I say, "I have a niece there." (I have a niece on Cape Cod but by that time her husband had taken her home. )
