 I'm at home. I rewind the answering machine. I talk to my friend Nate Nelling on the phone. He tells me our friend Emerald Reinhold is having people over at ten or eleven o'clock that night for dinner. I say I wasn't invited, so I guess I won't go. All the people we hang out with are going: Nate's girlfriend Emily, my ex-girlfriend Annie, and others. I am jealous. I was going to have people over at my house. A woman named Erica that I know from my Economics class at Brimson comes up to me and talks to me while I'm on the phone. I tell her to come back when I'm done talking on the phone. She is offended. My high school classmate Adam Clinger comes over to my house on a bicycle. The stereo is moved form the table to the counter top or the stove. I call my friend Bubba Hacker and leave a message on his answering machine. My high school friend Gino Teavor is there. Adam takes juice boxes from under the sink. I am annoyed at his actions: the boxes are not his.
