A shopping area, went into a chocolate/ice cream shop.  My maternal Grandma Jane was with us. My brother Stuart had never tried an Orange Julius, so he got one of those.  A lady that worked there was under the impression that he was a taste-tester/product reviewer.  My mother made a comment of Stuart being German, trying to dissuade the lady.  It didn't work and she gave him a chocolate cigar with cherry sauce.  It was a liqueur, and he didn't like it.  We were going to sit down and watch a product spiel.   We sat, but when the man came out, we tried to figure out how to leave discreetly.  I had a French text book on my lap.  A girl sat to my left, and a guy next to her.  She made some implication that he wanted to know if I'd go out with him.  I wrote in my book that I couldn't.  Admitted that I was taken, but he had caught my eye, too.
