I dreamt about a sort of crisis.  My psych classmate Gary was there.  A flood?  Something to do with colored cloths being important.  After things cleared up there was a sort of fair.  My longtime classmate Mark's family were skydiving into the water from a cliff.  By the time I got a chance, another group was putting the gear on.  We were taken up in a helicopter and dropped.  The first time was awesome.  The second time I realized it was only about 5 feet into the air or so because it stood me up rather than dropping me correctly.
