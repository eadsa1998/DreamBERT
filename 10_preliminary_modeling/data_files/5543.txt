[1997-05-08] We were at work but it was really more of a class than a work and a whole bunch of us are in class with a teacher and we decided that we're not going to stay. A couple of us anyway, decide that we're going to leave early and just take off so it was about 1:30 in the afternoon, I kept looking at my watch, my Bell watch. And somehow we all ended up going to a party and there was a whole lot of us there, many of the people were also members of the Idaho Counsel of the Blind, which I am a member of and we were eating. We all had these bags of food and I was reaching in and grasping with my fingers, little mandarin orange sections and eating them and they tasted really nice and juicy and there was a candy bar but the candy bar felt different it had like a cut out rectangle on one side and it was flat like a regular candy bar on the other side and the rectangle felt like the whole shape of the whole candy bar, like a border on one side, raised up about a quarter of an inch. And you could feel the recess of the rectangle on one side and I said "oh, I've never had one of these before" and I ate it and it was good. We were all eating and I was eating a lot more than I had wanted to and I remember thinking, 'gee I shouldn't be eating all of this its too much' but I kept on eating anyway. We were celebrating S's birthday, he's the head of a magazine I get on tape, and I got to meet him once at a convention, and he wasn't at the party, which didn't matter, we were still celebrating his birthday anyway. The A was talking to one of the other people at the party and telling her that she really didn't want to do something that this other person wanted her to do, and that was unusual I thought, because A doesn't usually complain. About stuff. And I thought, that's good, because if she really doesn't want to do it then she shouldn't do it just because the person who's asking is blind and she's sighted.
