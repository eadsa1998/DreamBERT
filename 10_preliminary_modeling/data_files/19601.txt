A parade on Hill Road. The house was closed tightly (even the shutters were closed), and scarcely any noise from parade could be detected. At first the parade is moving westward and I am able to see the 8 leaders (in 4 pairs) stop to rest just after they had started around the slight curve to north. They place 8 black objects that look like long robes on the ground. It seems that they have been carrying my mother, very carefully and gently. Anderson (some time later), asked me to look out of window to see what it was that made a certain noise. I thought it was either bugles, or the sharp click of shod horses on pavement. I go into n.w. bedroom, but can't see anything. Then go to n.e. bedroom where I see the end of the parade (which is now moving eastward), consisting of a double column of young men, dressed in black robes, their heels clicking on sidewalk.
