I was at this big building that was like a hotel or something. And I was going around looking for _________________ something, and I was with some other people my own age. And I went up and down the elevator a few times, and then I realized that in order to make the elevator work, you had to put in a dollar bill and a coin, like $1.50 or something. And I needed more change and I was kind of worried and I was hoping I was on the right floor. Oh, and another thing, when this elevator would go up and down, you would feel a certain amount of pressure and your ears would pop. ________________________. And then finally I met up with __________________ and she helped me find, she was like all excited. She was looking for the meeting room herself. But _______________ going to find ____________________. And she was all dressed up. She had this red vest and this _____ black suit, and she, and when we got to the meeting room, it kind of looked like the Columbia, and all these board members were standing around up there. And then we said hello to them. And then I noticed that there was a piano in the back of the room, and I figured, "Okay, we'll go sit down at this table here, and when things get really boring and everything's _______ and bleah, I'll get up and go over to it." And then I woke up.
