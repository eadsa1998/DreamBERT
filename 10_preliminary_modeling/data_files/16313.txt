I was babysitting Mrs. Heecox's son, and his name was Tweetie, and he was like a five-year-old and I thought nothing of it. And we were supposed to drive him somewhere and she wanted us to drive him in their car because Tweetie felt more comfortable in it, she said. And the make of her car was a Tweetie. [laugh] And it was this minivan like type thing and it had real complicated circuitry, secondary circuits in it. You had to like insert your key and do a special little thing to move the seats forward and back, which was what she did for Mom. And we were going through this like drive-through Happy Meal fast food place, and we were just sitting and sitting and sitting. This line took forever. And while we were sitting Mom was kind of doing some messing around in the front and I was sitting with Tweetie in the back. And Mom said that the radio in Mrs. Heecox's Tweetie car, just like it is in ours. And [laugh] that's all I can remember.
