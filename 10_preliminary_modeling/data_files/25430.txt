 I steal my dad's old gray car and start driving to Super America in Oak Valley. I drive south down our alley, turn right onto 1st Street, and then turn left, going south, on Slope Avenue. There is road construction. I have a suicide knob on the steering wheel. I am sitting partially in the passenger seat. I pull into Super America. There is a semi-truck driver there. He is unloading what looks like legs to some tables. He is also buying some guns from another man there. The man selling the guns is huge! He bosses the truck driver around. I am on a motorcycle. I can't find the kickstand to the motorcycle. When I do find it I can't get the motorcycle to stand up. I am trying to park the motorcycle by a row of trees that run along the west side of the alley. I lay the motorcycle down and walk towards Super America. I realize I don't have my wallet, so I can't redeem my lottery ticket. I walk back. There are two men shaving their hair off with big knives. My motorcycle is then the orange lawn chair that my mom has. I want to leave. The two men are hostile. They talk about someone from Hillston, or the area around Hillston. They don't like the person they are talking about. I sit down in the orange lawn chair. It is breaking. I want to leave. The men may think or act like I am the person they don't like. Either they or I say or sing a song with the words to a song, "Ba Ba Billy, we look to you for guidance." I remember the melody to the song after awakening.
