I am a young boy and I see the bad man who wants to steal the statues of a god and a goddess. The statues are very special. They come alive. I hide them up a tree, like figurines, and hope he doesn't see them. We almost make it, but they start moving and open their eyes and so he sees them. He puts them in a truck or the trunk of a car. They slither out, moving across the ground and yet still frozen in their stature forms. I hide them in a house and the bad men are all over searching.
