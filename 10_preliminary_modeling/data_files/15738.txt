I went to see Grayson, whose office was at Westland University. I went past his office and he wasn't in there so I kept walking but turned back and then he was. He looked completely different and I was thinking that I didn't remember him looking like that. He had very short brown hair. I knocked on the door and wasn't sure if he heard me so knocked again as he looked over from his chair (his desk facing outward). I said I wanted to get another work shirt and he said there was a special on to get 2 for cheaper so I said ok. He asked my name and I said 'Izzy Conell' and he didn't seem to recognise the name at all and I thought that was weird. He said "are you sure you're a medium?" and I said I'd try on the shirt just to make sure (I wondered why he assumed medium). I took it and went to find a toilet to change in. I was walking really slowly and had trouble moving. When I went back he asked a question like 'if Jesus said he was going to come back in 4 days and [something that I misheard as 'because the world was ending'] would you keep working?' and I was confused and said if there was work to be done, I'd do it. He wrote something down and then I left. I was telling someone about it a while later and they said he'd been asking it to everyone and the question was actually 'if Jesus said he was going to come back in 4 days and give everyone millions of dollars..'. No-one understood why he was asking.
