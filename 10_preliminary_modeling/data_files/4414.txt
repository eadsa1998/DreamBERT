["Tornadoes and love."] I am talking with Dora. I am laughing that now that we are back together, we could be roommates this time. She chuckles and says No way!! I accept this rejection in good humor. I wasn't really serious about the suggestion anyway. Now I am sitting on a couch. Watching a movie on TV. It is interesting. A man puts another video in the set and another interesting movie comes on. I don't want to miss the one that is on TV now as I like the story but I am interested in the second one too. Can't decide what to do. Mitch R. comes over and sits by me. We are very attracted to each other. Strong feelings of love. We hug and talk happily. It's a wonderful feeling. Next, I am on a farm. Outside. Mitch R. is there, also. Then I see tornadoes in the sky in the distance. Danger is coming. We rush to the barn to find a safe place. In the barn, I look out and see my mother and Grandma Maude outside concerned about housekeeping duties. They are preoccupied with getting the tasks done and won't come in to safety. I suggest we find a below ground area because the tornado could smash the barn and we'd be hurt. So we find a cement square hole and crawl down there with lots of other people. I call a warning to my mother and Grandma Maude again. They won't listen. The tornado strikes, breaking the barn to pieces. We remain safe and cuddled together.
