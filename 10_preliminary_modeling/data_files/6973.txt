We were on a ship. Someone said it would be better up front. So we left for the prow. Miss. W. said she was walking around the deck five times. I had to squeeze between chairs and an iron super structure. The reporter told us he was stressing China this month. Told R. and me to get a page on China each day. I couldn't think what to prepare. R. said he turned down one of her ideas. I asked her what she planned to write. She said she was going to look over some old letters. I said I couldn't because mine were up attic. Thought of asking for access. Thought I might find something to use in Little Foreign Devils, a child's story I had written. R. advised me not to as he wouldn't take it. Someone has said he was a poor planner. I asked about that. It's too late to get it done today. I should type it. Woke relieved to find it was a dream.
