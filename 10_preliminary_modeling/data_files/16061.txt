Yesterday when I was at school, they were working on the alarm system and it kept going off and going off and going off all during second and third periods. So I guess it was reflected in my dream last night. I dreamt that I was in sixth period in Mr. Perry's class in the main building and that someone had taken one of the alarm boxes off the wall and was holding it in their hand, and this woman grabs me by the hand and says, "Come on, let's get out of here. It's going to sound any minute now." And so we got out, we were running down the stairs as fast as we could run, and all of a sudden I was hanging in mid-air and I couldn't run anywhere. And I was climbing these bars to get down the stairs, and then I ran out onto the football field and the alarm finally went off when I got out there. And I saw like this huge gang of people out there, and I couldn't tell who was who and what they were out there for.
