I am even older, late 60's or so. I go back and audition again. I tell them, "I know the play was written for two young women and a little boy, but I think it would be good material to do the play with older players, but don't change any of the dialogue." They reluctantly agree. I go home now, after talking to the middle-aged man who got the part of the little boy. I am now on roller skates. I can't remember exactly where my house is. If I turn left, I go up hill. If I turn right, I go down hill. I turn right knowing that it is harder to roller skate down hill. I have trouble stopping. The ride is like a roller coaster. I look for rough surfaces to slow me down. I find my house. There are lots of people on the front lawn. I join them. It's a meeting. Ethan is the leader. I listen, then decide it's time to act. I raise my hand and say, "May I have permission to write 'Dear Friends and Colleagues'," a P.R. letter about the play. He agrees. The others are amazed at my braveness. I had a job to do and I did it.
