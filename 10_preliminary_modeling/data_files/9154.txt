Vince P arrived at public event that I was helping to host. I was sitting behind a rectangular table, the heavy steel, fold-up kind, six feet long. It was a registration or welcoming area. He walked up to someone else sitting behind this row of tables. I'm sure he saw me, but he quickly looked away. I said, Vince P. It's good to see you. I've tried to reach you a number of times over recent years and you haven't returned my calls. He looked at me and again looked away. I told him that I sensed there was an issue between us and I'd like to find out what it is. I told him that if I did something wrong or hurtful I wanted to make it right.
