I was with a girlfriend, whom I can't place, on a big highway which looked like the area between the Legends Parks and the Pacific Fair; both of us were joking. Then a small car passed by and in it were two girls and two boys. I recognized one of the boys as the gym teacher in my elementary school, the other I didn't know. I saw that one of the girls was a student teacher who taught me when I was in high school, 3 or 4 years ago; I didn't know the other girl. Well, the little car went by and we hitch-hiked and they stopped. We got in and introduced ourselves. They, like us, were going to the beach. I recognized the beach we went to as Herradura, with some differences.We changed and a while later a group of boys and girls, friends of the two of us, came and we left with them. I don't' remember any more.
