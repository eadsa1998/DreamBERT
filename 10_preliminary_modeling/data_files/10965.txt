My friend who is planning to start to college and I had decided to take some courses in high school during the summer. The high school classes were held in the auditorium of a grade school I attended in the seventh grade. The teachers who lectured to us were my grandfather and grandmother who have both been dead a number of years. It seemed very natural for them to be teaching the class. We sat there and took notes and then I talked for a long time to my grandmother. It did not seem that she was really my grandmother in the dream.
