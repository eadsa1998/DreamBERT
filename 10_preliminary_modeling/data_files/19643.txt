X and I are walking along south side of G St., between 10th and 9th -- walking eastward. We cross to north side of G., and I wonder why we do so. I then see a piano on the sidewalk, placed there as an adverisement by the owner of a piano store on the corner, and realize that we crossed over in order to examine the pianos in this store and see if any of them is like Owen's piano. We planned to walk through the store, inspecting pianos as we went, come out on 9th St., and walk north to a billiard room where we were to play together. We enter G. St. door and then remember that he had left his hat and gloves outside. He starts back for them, and I begin to doubt that he understands that we can walk obliquely through the store and emerge on 9th. I then go out and nearly bump into him again coming in. On entering the store again we find it will be necessary to climb a ladder in order to reach the dining floor. I start up the ladder but find everything so crowded at the top that it seems unlikely that I can get from the ladder to floor without doing some damage (perhaps upsetting potted plant). Sometime during the course of this adventure I ask how his car ran after they had returned to Colorado. He said, "All the better for the trip."
