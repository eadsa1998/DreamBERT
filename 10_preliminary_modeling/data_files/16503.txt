Had a couple of different scenes to it, but the one -- this is like the afternoon now -- but the one that stuck in my head the most is the weirdest. I was making a dinosaur cookie and I was frosting it with bright green frosting, and I was putting some brown on the dinosaur's feet and kind of swirling a little brown up near his back and even his really beady eyes. And I guess he looked pretty mean because Dad was standing there and saying, "Now what kind of impression do you think this is going to give people? People are going to think that you have an attraction to violence, and you may be a suspect of something, and you may be arrested, and you may lose everything in a moment." And I was thinking, "Oh yeah, over a dinosaur cookie." But that was kind of, I don't know. There was more to it; I don't remember though. This is what I get for waiting.
