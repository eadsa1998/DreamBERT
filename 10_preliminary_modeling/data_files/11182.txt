In this dream I was downtown in Cleveland. I had just decided on a new dress and was about to charge it when I realized I had lost the charge plate. I told my parents when I got home and my father immediately called the store to cancel all charges. It was too late, however, as someone had found the plate and charged over $100 in merchandise. My father was furious and said I had to earn the $100 and pay him back this summer. I felt he was unfair because anyone might have lost a plate. I woke in the midst of quarreling with everyone.
