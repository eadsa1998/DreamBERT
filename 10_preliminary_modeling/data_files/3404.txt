I am in a store and want to buy some soft angora pink yarn. I am knitting the knit-purl ribbing of a sweater. I watch me knit, careful to not drop a stitch. I almost do, several times. I am knitting quickly. I take a tray with costume jewelry and the boxes of yarn over to the counter. I move the loose pearls and gems over to the left and count the boxes of yarn. Some are pink, some are white. It is going to be expensive to make this sweater. Now I am sort of married to Derek. A couple of young women come in and possibly his mother. They don't know Derek and I just got married and they are talking about him. It is clear to me that the woman Paige has a relationship with him. He's had many and I listen in carefully to try and overhear the truth. I feel hurt and unloved and betrayed. Now I go into another room where Derek/Darryl is and his two brothers. He is cold to me and his brother is caring. I go over to talk to the brother. Derek is jealous and demands to know why I pay attention to his brother, not to him. I tell him I know about Paige. He comes over to me and kneels, hugging me, his blond head at my breast level. He is sad and sorry, pleading for me to stay and forgive him. I caress his hair. Now the young wives of the two brothers are getting dressed for the return home of their new husbands. One of them is Paige. The dark-haired one is changing her top and is quite excited to look special and pretty for her husband. I'm changing my clothes too. I step outside where Paige is and say, I know about you two. She says, "Oh?" I say, "Tell me what it was like." She says, "He's a hard one, complex." He used to like to watch me do it (make love with someone).
