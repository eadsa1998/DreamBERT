Eugene and I had a baby girl. I was thinking her name was Chantelle but realized that I hated the name and thought it was Isobel, but I hated that too. Then I thought it ended with an 'a' and said "Diana? No, that's too old". I went to university and Eugene worked part time at night and looked after the baby. Mom also went to university and she was ready to leave. I was annoyed because I had to wait for Eugene before I could leave and I didn't want to look after the baby. Ezra told Mom that he had lots of dreams collected now.
