It was about me traveling to Arica (Chile) with my father and a girlfriend from the university and we wanted to pass some papers through customs and didn't want them to see the papers. Finally we got through and went to a house that was big and quite dirty. A station wagon from the detective squad came and observed the house. My father hid some blueprints he'd been working on and another girlfriend appeared and I shoved her so that the detectives wouldn't see what my father had done. Suddenly a boyfriend whom I liked very much arrived, and I took him by the arm and we went for a walk. We sat on a wet stone and a Chilean girl criticized Peruvian girls and had an argument. I returned home with him and the dream ended.
