A man repaired a drinking faucet, but it exploded because of a loose wire in the wiring. He pulled a wire out, and the fountain glowed from no apparent source. I told the others in the building about what had happened at the drinking fountain. I said it was fortunate that no one else held the fountain on for a long time like that worker had.
