I was in a small gym, on the badminton team even though no longer at my high school.  I talked to the kid next to me a bit.  My high school friend Benji was one to go up, playing a doubles match.  Somehow I accidentally flicked the kid I was talking to.  I asked if he was okay and he said no.  Then it was my turn- our turn for a singles match.  I tried to run the corners but I was in my black Velcro shoes and it was too slippery.  He served- a doubles serve.  I swatted, and failed.  It would have gone out, I shouldn't have swung.
