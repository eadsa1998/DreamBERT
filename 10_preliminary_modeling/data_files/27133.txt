I was swimming in an in-door pool which I did not recognize. The boy to whom I am pinned and alot of other people which I did not recognize were there. Along the side of the pool were showers. When I decided it was time to go home, I got out of the water and went to take a shower. I was very disappointed when this boy did not come in the shower with me because I wanted to stand close to him.
