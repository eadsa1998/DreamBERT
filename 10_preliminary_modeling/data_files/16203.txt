We had bought an SUV like minivan-like type thing, and it had this multi-band receiver that was like a scanner thing that could also receive FM signals. And I was like, "Whoopee, wow, look at this," and I was sitting there trying to figure it out while we're on the way over. [tape slips] What is wrong with this tape? Anyway, we were on the way to the fire station, and when we got there, it stopped for a minute. I don't know why it did that. But anyway, we got over there and I was like walking in this boardwalk and [laugh] Dad was showing and talking to his buddies and showing them this, and by that time it had turned into the green truck that we have now, and he was going to start the engine and show how good this sound system sounded and stuff. And he started the engine and it wouldn't start. Uh oh, it was a rotten egg. [laugh]
