I was at Nana's, out the back. Uncle Wilbur showed me a video of when I was younger, hopping around in an animal costume. I went on the computer and Mom was with me. There was something about a movie on the wall that Dad and I saw and it said that it had been mailed to Ulrich Thomsen. I explained to Mom that he was in my second favourite movie. She asked why I hadn't invited Nana and I said that we did and that she was sitting right there, but she couldn't leave. Dad and I were then in Amsterdam and Dad wanted to break into a hotel we were staying in to check it out before having to pay to stay there.
