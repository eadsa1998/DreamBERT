I was a graduate student named Kessen or something like that. I had figured up a sign of some sort of a study, which showed how much experimenters influenced their subjects to produce the type of data they wanted or something like that. And I was going to have Gardner Murphy as our experimenter. But somehow it was as if nobody was supposed to do an experiment like this. I kept finding myself forgetting what the experiment was about and thinking I was going to do some other type of experiment. Finally I got to talk to the psychologist Gardner Murphy about this and explain the real experiment. Then I pointed out to him some sort of how we had both forgotten what the real experiment was about, to show how important it was to get this experiment done. It was a real strain all through this dream - which was much longer than I am able to recall - to keep the real experiment in mind and not get sidetracked on some sort of innocuous substitute.
