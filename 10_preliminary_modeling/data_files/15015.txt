I was watching Network. The first 40 minutes were lame and then it was really good, but it was different. I was in a building and ended up on the roof. I was talking to this guy who was the boss of the company, which had something to do with technology. He said that if I ever wanted a job there to let him know. He ended up dying because he was an alcoholic and someone did something to him using his alcoholic status. Mom and I went there and Mom went to the roof and asked this guy if I could have a job there because the other guy said that I could. I was waiting on the street and Mom yelled down to me "do you have any hours spare?" And I said I could do it Wednesday right after Native Animal Rescue. There was a guy on the street and he saw a toddler walk into the middle of the road and he decided to keep it. Then he was on the roof talking to this guy. There were twins and someone half jumped onto the train tracks in a subway. The toddler jumped off the roof and the guy was upset and angry. Then the building was on fire and we were waiting for the firemen. Then he ran down and it had been mostly put out and was smoky on the second and third level, but then he was at the top again. I took a shortcut and there were cats and dogs on the platform I had to organise them.
