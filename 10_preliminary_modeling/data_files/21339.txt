I was reading about publishing books before I fell asleep. In my sleep I was looking over books. I looked at a small one and it seemed like it was cut small, then I looked at a regular size book. I had them in my hands and was looking them over. I was in Rivertown in the alley. I saw someone do something wrong. It was driving a car or something and I was seen by the person, so I made off as though I didn't see it, so they wouldn't get suspicious of me. I then went out looking for the party. I was like a detective, but I had a hard time tracing her. I bought some meat and the butcher was trying to cheat me. When I bought it, I threatened him and he knew he was in wrong, so he told his partner and his partner came out to me and offered to take this meat back and give me better meat. I said the butcher sold me a lot of meat that was too fat and he gave other people good lean meat. He said he would take care of it from now on. Then he walked back in the butcher shop. I felt sort of sorry for him so I was going to go back to have it fixed up. I told Carter about it and I had sort of pictures or statues of bulls and I show him what he tried to sell me a small one and a large one instead of two large ones. I saw a dog's head. It was a double head with three eyes. Joe Grabar, another fellow and myself were trailing a suspect. We were like detectives. We came to a cave in coal mine and I looked down and saw our man. We had spears to throw at the man and he surrendered. Joe went down into the hole, which was about 20 ft. in diameter and then I yelled at him to pull a gun on the man, which he did. Joe called me down and gave me a gun and he left. I held the gun on the man and he didn't seem to fear me so much. He was trying to get away. I pulled a little on the trigger and said, "I blast you if you try to get away." Then the man was a woman and she didn't fear me either. I held the gun on her and then I awoke.
