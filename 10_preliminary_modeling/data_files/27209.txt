I dreamt I was left in charge of a baby which I held and rocked asleep until I realized mv hair was wet and I had to put it up. I put the baby on a pillow on a stool in a corner near a dresser. I began putting up my hair. Somebody came in and I looked at the baby. It was sitting up with one eye closed peeking through the other and playing possum. I was frightened and I snatched up the baby.
