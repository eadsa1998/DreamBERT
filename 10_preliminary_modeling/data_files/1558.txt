I am cleaning the cupboards out in a kitchen. I throw away some old food, apples, shredded wheat with lots of sugar in it, open noodle packages, etc. A man comes to the house. He has a gun and he intends to kill me. He's a hit man. I pull out a rifle, which I can see, but I aim it at him and tell him I'll shoot. He laughs. He's confident I haven't the guts. I do fire, at his hands, or arms. I don't want to kill him. I just want him to stop trying to hurt me. He's surprised, but not worried. He pulls out a knife and threatens me. I shoot again. He's not hurt or affected. I turn and run -- to hide. Outside is a big bushy tree. I climb up and hide in the bushy part. I worry that he'll figure out my strategy, or that I made a dumb mistake staying so close by. I figure he'd figure that I took off fast. He does see me in the tree. I wasn't still enough and birds chattered and flew around, giving me away. He's going to force me to go into this dark hole, to my death. I turn and dive into the hold in an attempt to outsmart him. Either I'll kill myself trying to escape or I'll outsmart him. I free-fall a long way and end up in a basement. I turn to the left, and go down several flights of stairs. I find a tiny door with small knobs. It's a dumb waiter. I almost cry in frustration because I can't get the door open, and then it opens and I crawl in and hand pull myself back up to the ground level. I'm wondering if I made a mistake. I go to a hotel and sign in with a fake name and go to my room to rest. As I sit, I notice with horror that my own personal brand of shampoo is in the room and I know he has found me! I pull aside the shower curtains and he is there -- dressed up and nice. He has brought me a present. He hands me a baby. It is my "ex-husband" by another woman. I think the baby is cute and start to feed it. I get the feeling the guy wants to marry me.
