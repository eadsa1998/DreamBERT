I was a doctor, part of a surgical team. Our first step was to try to stabilize this patient so that we didn't lose them. But then our next step was to try to bring them back mentally so they wouldn't be brain dead. There was something about the importance of developing relationships with the other doctors and the other members of the surgical team and the important role that plays in serving the patients the best that we can and giving them the best possible care.
