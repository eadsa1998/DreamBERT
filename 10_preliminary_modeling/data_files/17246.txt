Was in a store with my friends Jenna and Emma, and we tried on some silly hats.  One was a banana slug, and two were butterflies.  We looked and saw that they were supposedly $20 each.  We looked and saw the price wasn't for the hats, but the Cheez-Its sitting next to them.  We couldn't understand.  There was a clerk not too far away.  We opened one of the boxes and there was a broken bean with seasoning powder in it.  Then the aisle became more like a street.  There were a lot of clone girls dressed in a grey skirt and black top.  They had red hair and lipstick to match.  There were some circling the block, like a marathon.
