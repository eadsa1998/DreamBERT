I had a strange dream. Someone named Chuck Mahoney had made an album. It was bad. Someone said, "Here's his second album. Isn't it lucky someone took a chance on him and laid the money down for a second try? It's really good, his second album." Then Raul and all the men from my past came in. I felt embarrassed. Then a man and a woman were facing each other. A question was asked of the woman. The man was fervently hoping she'd answer correctly in his favor, but she answered "money" and the man was very sad. He looked at me and said, "In some cases, divorce is very good."
