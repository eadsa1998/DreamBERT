 I'm with my friends Nat Miller and Niles Zelling. We have many cans of Mountain Dew. I drink three cans quickly. The soda goes down smooth and easy. The television is on. Many people are watching television and playing cards. I am playing cards with Niles and Nat. I turn to one man after I walk by him because I think he kicked me as I passed. The man denies that he kicked me. I am belligerent towards him, and he is passive.
