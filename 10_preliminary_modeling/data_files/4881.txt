I am watching as a large fat man, like the actor in "The King of Queens", befriend a small 5th grade girl. They are very happy with each other. However, they crawl in bed together to sleep after they are done playing. She kisses him good night on the cheek. They kiss each other frequently. I feel uncomfortable about this. It feels like it is borderline incest. Inappropriate. They sleep and the next morning, he decides he needs to leave, because this could become sexual and that isn't appropriate. Neither want to leave and they promise to see each other again soon.
