I was walking with a friend, a feeling I have tells me that it was my housemate, he is male and 21 years old. We were walking along and I had my backpack over my shoulder. I couldn't see him but I knew he was there. I was dressed in dark pants and a dark shirt and I could only see myself. There wasn't any background in the image, at least none that I remember. My housemate asked me where my classes were and I told him one was at Porter room 206 and one was at Oakes 105. I told him that it was easy to remember since the number increased by one in both the front and third number.
