I was in someone's garage.  The details are hazy, but there were two fairly new Cadillacs in there, and there was something about my opening a can of oil only to realize that the car had been using a different kind.  Someone called me from the garage, and I went up to the front of some relative's house and the relative (female) came to the door.  I saw a small package in the mailbox which I thought might have been the slides I was expecting, but I saw it was not addressed to me, and realized that there was no reason why I would be getting mail there anyway.
