I dreamt that I forgot to sign the teachers' payroll sheet at Sunday School. I tried and tried to get to the faculty room where the sheet was posted but when I finally did, the sheet had been removed to the office. I felt very perturbed because unless I signed it I wouldn't get paid for teaching that Sunday. I don't know why this thought bothered me so much.
