We had taken a car trip up to California to see Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly for a family reunion, and this is so weird -- you'd never believe it. Dad said when he was snooping around out back he found these alligators trying to get at these chickens, and a few of them were dead already, but the alligators were in the water and the chickens were up on the thing. And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I can't remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I don't remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and Dad's laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Uncle Charlie and Aunt Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that -- oh, I know -- somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Uncle Charlie and Uncle Carl and Mom were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Uncle Charlie how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that Mom and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them like came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the ______ and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door. And we were set off to drive all the way back home, and then I woke up.
