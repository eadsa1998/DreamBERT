I was at Mom's. I went into her room and there was a black guy on her bed. I was talking to Mom and then said "Who the hell is this?". She said "a friend". I turned around while I was still talking and when I turned back around Mom and the guy were kissing or something. I went back to my room but I came out later and discovered that Mom's bedroom was on fire. Mom wasn't in there and I got Ezra and I said that she wouldn't have run out because she would've got us. We got the fire out and then ran downstairs. The black guy's car was in the middle of the road. We ran out and Ezra was asking him where Mom was. I checked the back seat and then the boot. There was a big chest in the boot and Mom was asleep in one. I gasped and then pulled her out. The black guy drove off. We put Mom in her car and drove off to go somewhere. I then went back in time and was thinking 'what the hell?'. I went out of my room and Mom wasn't in her room, but then she came upstairs looking funny. The black guy came into her room. I punched him and then realized that he had Superman-type strength and had green 'pus' coming out. I realized that my laptop was missing and I said "You can take her but give my laptop back, it isn't worth much. I'll give you $500 for it". He stared at me for ages and then gave it back.
