I dreamt about my French class. It was given at a private home and this was the day we had to take a test in order to go on to the next cycle (my French class is really not in a private house, but in an Academy). Instead of an exam, it looked like a carnival party. Each person who went to take the exam came out wet because they would throw water on them. There were more people there than in reality and more men (in my class there is only one). I didn't want to go out and take the test by any means and kept waiting to the last moment. A boy who is the brother of a friend of mine (both are in the university, but I never speak to him) came into the class. I remember he came in and sat the wrong way, in order to talk to a girl; he seemed to me to be very uneducated and uncouth. Then he went out of the class just as freshly as he had come in. I remember there were only three people left to take the exam: a boy, Silvia (a friend of mine who studies English instead of French at the same Academy or school of languages, and studies with me at the university) and I. Silvia and I looked at each other and got away, leaving the boy to take the test before us. Then I remember having gone to the yard or garden and putting on the swimsuit there to take the test. My cousin Dotty (20 years) who had not been in the dream at any other point was next to me, also in a swimsuit. Then I came out to take the exam and everybody was teasing me because I had a bathing suit on and I told them that I had it on because I knew they were going to get me wet and didn't want my clothes to be spoiled. I don't remember anything more about this one.
