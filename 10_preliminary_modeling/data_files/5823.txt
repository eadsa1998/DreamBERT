I was in a van, I don't know who else was there. On the back of the seat where there sometimes are places to put things...This was much bigger than you have in reality because this would just take up too much room. There were a whole bunch of books in there...This book had something to do with health and I also think it had something to do with life in general, politics, whatever, the more I think about it , the more I think it might have been "The way things ought to be" by Rush Limbaugh and I remember taking it out and the weirdest thing was that parts of it was in Braille and parts of it were on tape. Because I could remember feeling the Braille and hearing the tape, in the back of this van...whose van I didn't know and who is driving I don't know...but there I was with this book.
