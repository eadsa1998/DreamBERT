I was in the house of a friend. I don't remember which house or which friend. Suddenly I experience a very agreeable sensation: a neighbor, related to my friend, gives the keys to his big, modern, yellow car to me. I take the car, knowing that I have never driven, and I go at great speeds. I go from San Felipe to my house in Chorillos. I ride, I have fun, I go over the same place, it's a moment of amusement. When I'm three blocks away from home, I realize that I have been driving without gear changes. When I get home, I am in a swimming suit with a towel full of sand, and I see my friend James coming, next to my sisters who are sitting by the house. He is in a car, and with a black and youthful suit on. I am not pleased by his coming at that moment, but my sisters tell me it's his birthday.
