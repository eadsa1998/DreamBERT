We had an excursion. Calvin and Evelyn were with me. Eugene and Darius were behind us. There was white chocolate and a big line up a big escalator. I went into the line Eugene was in. We had to slide down a slide to get down. I was then somewhere else and I said something about Darius to Evelyn. She said "Don't talk about that, not today" and I asked what was so special about today and she said it was her birthday. I was like "Oh my God! I can't believe I forgot your birthday!". Then I thought that it was August 24th and I said "You're birthday was last week. She went quiet and then I realized it was May 24th and told her. She was like 'huh?'.
