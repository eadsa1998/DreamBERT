["Don't panic on the venture."] I am visiting Sarafina in Ventura, California. I am at a conference. I am outdoors and ready to eat lunch. I see a display of baloney meats, all different varieties of flavors. I am resting lying down on a bench. Sarafina and her handsome boyfriend walk up to me. We are all happy to see each other. Her daughter isn't there. I feel disappointed. I would have enjoyed visiting with her. The boyfriend is very friendly and smiling. I enjoy his friendly company.
