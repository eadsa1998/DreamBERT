Dad woke me up for school. I got up to make toast and the toaster was in a different room. Dad was watching a movie. There was a flashback in the movie where this kid was playing with Fantastic Four toys. He had one that looked like Ioan Gruffudd. He grew up to be this Earth protector guy. These robot things which held up the Earth had gotten angry and were messing things up. Michael Cera was in this shop. This girl went out with this guy and she took photos of all these people and put them in this book. A rocket was leaving Earth's atmosphere. I left my room and went to Dad's room. Ezra was there. I looked at the time and it was 4pm. Mom had straightened my hair earlier, but in the morning it was all fluffy.
