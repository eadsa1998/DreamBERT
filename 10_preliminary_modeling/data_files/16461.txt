I had to take the Peavey system to the card party area, the ______ park thing, and we were getting it out of the garage and I was trying to get Mom to hurry up so that she could come and take me over there so that I could set it up before Dad got there. And so we were scrambling around and messing around, trying to get there on time, and I get there and I only have a certain amount of time to set up. And I started setting up the mike with the board and all, and I was, the minute, I just brought the fader up above the bottom, I was getting feedback like crazy and lots of floor noise with it, so I was trying to figure how the heck to fix that. And just about that time, you know, I don't remember, I never started the gig before I woke up. What the heck is wrong with this stupid tape? [tape making noises] I don't know, but that's that.
