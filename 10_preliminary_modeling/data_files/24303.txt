It was looking for friends. My recurring fear of missing a flight came back. I was looking for a place to stay in the resort town and every place nearby was booked up, and expensive because it was right there in the thick of things. I met Jenna (a friend I met in Asia) at this hostel she'd found part time employ at. I asked if I could stay, since she worked there. I didn't want it to seem like I was using her for the room. There was Jordan from the apartment I lived in while a junior in college and the gang hanging out somewhere -- like a Costco where they were getting some drinks. Later, a police detective came to interview me because there was a murder or something. I had nothing to do with it, and I didn't even remember much from the night before. They gave me a docket-like transcript of events the night before they'd reconstructed. I thought it would be a goldmine when I later was putting together a story about the murder. It had everyone's name and nationality flag next to it as it went down the list. Bob (friend from college) was in there, too. He didn't know much. It didn't make much sense, and I didn't remember any of it.
