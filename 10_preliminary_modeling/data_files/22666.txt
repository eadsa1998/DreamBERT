In my dream it seems I was at school. I have a friend there who I prefer to all others, and she told me that they had left some homework to be done, and those who didn't do it would be punished. I answered her that I would do it. The day arrived, and I forgot to do the homework. I went to school and when the teacher asked me why I hadn't done it, I told her that I had forgotten. So she said that all the ones who hadn't done it would be punished by having their hair cut short. They were going to cut the hair of a friend and I told them not to cut it, and they said, "Okay, then you go first," and they cut it. In the dream I thought it wasn't true and touched my head until I woke up and realized that my hair was as long as ever.
