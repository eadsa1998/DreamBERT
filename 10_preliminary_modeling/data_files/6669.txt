I was going to a church supper and it was raining. Hunted for rubbers. En route passed along the seashore. The waves grew wilder and wilder. On the horizon could see waves like mountain peaks. Near shore they were all foamy white. Reached the place with wet coat and stringy hair. It was 7:30, not must time left bit I insisted I must tidy up. Went to toilet. It was in the bathtub end water in tub rose about my ankles. Then I dumped an inch of water from one boot. My stockings and pink satin slippers were wet. Mother and R. were at the supper I think.
