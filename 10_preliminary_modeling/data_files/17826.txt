I was dealing again.  I ran back into the house to look for the directions and remembered I'd stuck it in a yellow folder and had it in the car.  I got there and had to check to make sure I had my cards- they were in my pocket.   I talked to some of the other dealers and we went back somewhere to get something.  On the way back to the location there was pig feed, a bunch of grain and corn.  I tried it, and the corn was very sweet.  When we got back we started to get ready.  I realized I didn't have my cummerbund and tie- I'd forgotten them in the closet.  I started to panic as we were supposed to start dealing soon.  My dad and I walked back a ways where we stood in a parking lot watching people pass.  As an older woman walked by I made a comment to my father that she looked like Mrs. Goldman, my second grade teacher.  Although I had intended her not to hear, she had, and stopped.  It was her!  She gave me a big hug and we talked quite briefly.  I was somewhat surprised that she didn't ask who I was or what has gone on in the past fourteen years of my life.  She just told me things would go well for me.  We went back, and my mother handed me two bowties- I was upset as the first one was purple and it was supposed to be red..then she handed me the correct one.  But I still didn't have the cummerbund.  My brother Stuart left for a moment and came back -- he brought my car with him so leaving would be easier, and I was finally ready, not a moment too soon.  The event was a wedding and I was set up to deal in the aisle.  Then I moved back to the stage where Stuart's old friend Tommy was sitting at a table, and we were supposed to wait for a bit.  I was happy time was passing as it meant less actual dealing time.  Then I quietly set up at the top of the aisle again.
