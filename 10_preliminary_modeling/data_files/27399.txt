I am walking down a street which I recognize as being near PHJH. A man, a woman, and a baby in a carriage approach me. I can see the man and woman's features very clearly. They are both unfamiliar to me. The man lifts the buggy in the air. He seems to be trying to get it over a puddle. I stretch out my arms and help him. I look into the buggy and wrinkle up my nose at the baby. The next scene takes place in an apartment. The same 3 people are present. The young mother attempts to give the baby a bottle. The milk is too hot. She tries to give him the bottle again; it is still too hot. She finally gives it to the baby and he refuses it because it is too cold. The man throughout this procedure appears to be hostile toward his wife. In the next scene I pass a mother (same woman) and a little boy on the corner of a busy intersection (unfamiliar). The boy is now about 4-5 years old. I can see his features very clearly, yet he, too, is unfamiliar to me. I again wrinkle up my nose at him and remember that I had done the same thing when he was an infant. I turn the corner and walk down a street. I past a store and look into the store window. I see my image. I notice that I appear just as young, but am slightly heaver in weight.
