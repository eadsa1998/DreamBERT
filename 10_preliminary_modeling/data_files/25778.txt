 I'm at a liberal rally with my friend Nat Miller. My ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter is there. She yells at me and says she'll be mad at my for a long time for saying I think we should see other people when we left school this spring. I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona. We're in an airport with a walk ramp. My mom goes to a movie. It is an action movie with a one-word title, like "Predator" or something. I walk home from the rally, which was at the Uptown Theater in Oak Valley. I'm with Ramona. Three teenagers walk by. One of them has a spray-type pellet gun. I bump into one of them. They shoot me. It doesn't really affect me much. They shoot me again. I beat the three of them up very badly. There seems to be four of them, one of whom I don't beat up. The police come to the Uptown Mall. I run and leave Ramona behind. I go over a fence and down along 3rd Street. I go through yards and porches of houses. The houses are surrounded by water. I jump, climb, and crawl from house to house on porches. Homosexuals and drug addicts occupy the houses. I get to a house that I'm familiar with. It is the Brew Ha Ha House. It seems like my classmate Jake Fowler from Brimson has lived there. I get into the house through a window or door in the basement.
