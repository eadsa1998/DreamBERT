I was helping a child with her arithmetic. She couldn't decide which process to use. I asked her if she went to buy candy, would she afterwards have more or less money left. Then she got her problem correctly. As she finished each one, she went into another room to put it away. I suggested she'd wait until all were done. We were in another apartment her parents were planning to take. We looked about and she told which room she would have. I asked if she slept in her parents' room now. She said, "no", she had her own room. Then we were back in the former room. Her mother told some one I had dinner and supper with them now. Since she was having guests, the child and I would eat separately and she told us to see about supper now. I felt resentful about not being with her crowd.
