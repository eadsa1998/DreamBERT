["Firing Sharon."] I am in a large house that reminds me vaguely of the V. farm house. Crowded with relatives. I am trying to get things cleaned up. I go down in the basement and see the light is burned out. It will require a very tall ladder with such high ceilings. Lots of bags of things all over the floor. I go upstairs to find Sharon. I am very upset with her. She doesn't finish things and do things the way I want them done. I find her in a living room. She is now a blend of Bonnie and Sharon. She is very unhappy with me as well. I don't pay her well and I work her hard and complain frequently about how she doesn't do it right. When I see it is also Bonnie I hesitate to fire her and am more friendly and kind. I encourage her to talk with me. She hints she's ready to quit and I encourage that as well. I wonder if she will be hurt I don't try and convince her to stay, but I do want her gone.
