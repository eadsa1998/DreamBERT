Grandma &amp; Grandpa are playfully fighting like the Flintstones; there is a celebration at the Unitarian Church. They put on a musical and make-believe altars covered with presents. "They did not know whom to give." Little freckle faced boy from "H" street in Vienna comes over; also in office with D.H. - kiss like friends.
