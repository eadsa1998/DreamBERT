I was at a new 'president's' like, welcoming ceremony. I was holding on to a flying fox thing and I think I was making a speech. I went to get some food and there were no plates left. Mom and Granma were there and she was going to get me a plate but then changed her mind. I went to get a plate, but then saw someone else's one that was clean-ish and got a piece of chicken. Someone said to smell it and it was a weird colour. It tasted funny.
