I was back in high school and in some kind of sewing class. Peggy B from SDI was in this class as well. I think we had finished one semester and had returned to start the next semester. Peggy B was doing something different this semester that screwed up our schedule. The previous semester we had been paired up and worked on projects together in this one class. But this semester, whenever anyone was paired with her they didn't really have to do their part of the project. The project was sewing. The first week I was paired with Peggy B. She was making a duvet I believe. At the same time I was paired with a man that I remember from high school. His name was Tom A. I had gone to find him to tell him my idea that resulted from the situation with Peggy B. I found him in the library and he was sitting there with Mike Ke working on something. I went up to him and asked if I could interrupt. They were sitting at a library table across from each other. I just scrunched down.
