Mom and I were getting ready to take a walk somewhere, and we were sitting in chairs at the house next door to Jean's house, just kind of resting for a minute and Dad was watering his trees. He started yelling at Mom for something and then he started walking away. And I picked up a cinder block that was sitting in the sand and I threw it at him, but I didn't hit him fortunately. [laugh] And he turns around and he throws it back at us, but he doesn't hit us, fortunately. [laugh] That was weird. And this is the most startling and weird part of all. It wasn't scary, but it was weird. It was disappointing. I dreamt that Mom's Bose wave radio CD and her boombox both needed batteries to run. Her Bose thing needed AA's and the boombox needed C's, like it's always needed. And I dreamt that they were both prone to falling out of the machine, and with both machines, if the batteries would fall out while the machine is playing, it would start making this, "Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo" sound instead of your audio. And you'd think if it would still have enough power to make that sound, you'd think it would have enough power to keep playing your audio, but no! So I dealt with that for a while, and in my dream it was scary, and so I was thinking up all kinds of ways to tape the -- the thing of it is, I don't think the boombox had a door to keep them in and so they would fall out. And so I thought of taping them, but I woke up before I could do that.
