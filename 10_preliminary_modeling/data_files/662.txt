I am in a play but I forget my lines. I go to the wings which are to the audience, and sit there amongst a bunch of junk and watch the rest of to play. When I get home my husband has been drinking. There is something about a violin and he is wearing a yellow suit. I get ready to leave. The kids are home and they are small but I'm not concerned about them. I try to get an outfit to wear to work the next day before I leave. We are living in a beautiful, many storied, elegant house with a curved, carpeted stairs. My husband is sitting on the stairs and I have to walk around him. He says something derogatory about me and the kids say "you never say that about Grandma" and he mimics them.
