I'm following somebody down the street. In my hand is a gun and I intend on shooting this guy. Just as I'm ready to shoot him, someone pulls the gun out of my hand and shoots him. All that happens when the gun is fired is blue ink comes out the barrel. I take the gun back, put a new clip in it, and start following him again, but he keeps running out of sight. And I can never catch up to him to shoot him.
