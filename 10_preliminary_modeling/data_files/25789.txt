 I'm in woods with my friend Kevin Simpson and two other people. More people are coming; we see them as they come over. Among them are my friends Bubba Hacker, Sam Kingsley, Wyatt Belzer, my roommate Stephen Ramos, and others, including some women. They come and greet us. There is a pause before Sam and I greet each other. We are assessing the changes that we have gone through since last seeing each other. There is a cabin at Mud Lake. I'm staying there with friends. There is a lot of sex going on that night. I see Sam, Kevin, and Stephen's erections and compare them to my own in terms of length and thickness. I see one of them grabbing onto two trees, posing. <br/
