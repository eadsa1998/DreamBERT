I am in a place that reminds me of Italy. Studying abroad. I'm part of a program with my roommates from Brussels -- Katie, Ashley. We have a mission to do. Sort of clandestine. Other friends, closer friends come to help. I end up getting lost around the big company elevators in the main building in the company tower that's rising from the middle of this old city. I need to get inside to get some documents for what I think is a story. I end up in a wine store and get turned around in the old viaducts that are made from old brick and such.
