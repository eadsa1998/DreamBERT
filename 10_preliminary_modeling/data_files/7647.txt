I was in a car with Bill F. He was driving. We were in SC. We were going to be moving there. We had found a condo to purchase and live in. I don't remember if we/I was going to purchase or rent. We were driving by the condo and I wanted to stop and look at it again but we decided we could on the way back from wherever we were going because we had to come back for Matthew before we left to drive back to our home state. We were headed to a meeting. When I arrived at the meeting with a female business partner, Bill F was not around. We were the two principal executives of a multi-million dollar company. It had something to do with hair salons. The place where we were meeting was a very large hair salon. Someone was showing us around and introducing us to everyone. I think my partner and I were buying the salon or taking it over. I'm not sure which. One of the women that was working there was wearing an apron. It said something like I do shampooing or some such. I said I wanted one like it, even though I wouldn't wear it. David Letterman was at the meeting. He was telling me that he had invited someone to dinner and she was very reluctant to go with him. I told him he could invite me or me and my partner anytime and we would be there.
