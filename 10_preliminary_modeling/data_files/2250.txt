Someone brings me some toy-like things that are promo's for a new play. I am supposed to display them to do PR, but I only want to keep them. They are so cute. I see a line of women who look like Ru, in wheelchairs! Each has a lap full of stuff. She's moving out of her room and her family is here to help her. Her dad and brothers are sort of tough Okies. I see a kitten whose head has been caught temporarily because a hassock stool has rolled too close. I know I need to let the kitty do it herself, but I feel sorry for it and move it. The kitty is mad at me and goes and hides. I go back to Ru's room. I look in. She's seated on her bed and one of her sisters is doing new wallpaper. She (Ru) says, "See the new floor covering?" It's a flower print linoleum. I am amazed her family completely transformed her room in just a short time - yellow and white fluffy curtains, matching bed spread, lots of ruffles. It's pretty. I go to my room (like a dorm or hospital) and notice I have paint and am relieved. It's easier to do than wallpaper. I sit in my bed and am putting white pearl nail polish on my left thumbnail. A nurse comes in and wants me to apply a jelly-like substance to my "infected (affected) area," the vagina (the jelly is like diaphragm jelly!). Instead, I wipe yellow diarrhea off my butt and then put the jelly on the vagina. Before I did this, I asked a nurse to pull the blinds. She was incompetent and couldn't follow my directions.
