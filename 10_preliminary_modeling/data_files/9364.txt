There was a convention of all the nations of the world for a "Walking on the Water" contest. Before it officially began, a man with seven silk top hats walked briskly down the dock and onto the water. He slowly sank. Each hat was carefully labeled (starting with his head, Historian, Artist, Scientist, Economist, Literary Man, Political Man, and on top was "Walker on Water." After he sank, one hat floated, the "Walker on Water" and beside it rose to the surface and floated was his pair of sandals. Similar to old stories in the Bible and other primitive lit; in an odd way, this man had won the contest!
