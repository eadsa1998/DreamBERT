A Mexican man and myself are walking toward the beach. We are told by the gatekeeper to take a certain path. The Mexican suggests we take a short cut between two houses. We sneak by but the gatekeeper comes after us on a motorcycle. I plead, "The reason is that I can't walk well," and I ask for a ride on his motorcycle. He agrees. I can't figure out where to put my feet. I figure it out and we go. We are taken to a cottage. I look for the bathroom and sit. As I sit, I see a huge mama cat feeding her many babies, some were blue and some were pink! The motorcycle man comes in and I'm a little embarrassed. Someone else points out a room and tells me there is something scary. I feel a little scared. A M.R. person comes in and I tell them it's the wrong room. I notice someone has palmed off that dead rotting on them.
