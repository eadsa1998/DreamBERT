["Not my type, but surprise, I like him."] A plump pudgy man likes me a lot. He's nice, but I am not particularly attracted to him. He comes close and kisses me softly. I find it pleasant and soft. I begin to like it a lot. I become sexually excited and want to make love. He is very happy and I am very surprised.
