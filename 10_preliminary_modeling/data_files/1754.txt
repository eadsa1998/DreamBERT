I am very upset with my "husband." He's in a room with "the guys" and ignoring me. I go into the room to give him some 6-packs of beer which he doesn't need as he has plenty on the counter. He doesn't even acknowledge me and I have to lie on the counter and force myself through a mail slot in the door to get out! Very uncomfortable. Then I see a newborn baby and I pick it up, walk down a long flight of stairs into a pool of water (swimming pool) and bathe the baby, total immersion. The baby is good at holding its breath. Then I'm hopping across a blue, yucky slough. I say, "Here's the slough," and I hop over it. I look, thinking it would not be pleasant if I slipped and fell in. After I cross both channels of the slough, someone and I lie on a raft/boat and go upstream in a wide and busy water channel. Someone asks if I hated crossing the slough and I say, "Yes, but when I was younger it was fine." I liked the slough then because it was alive and not polluted and it moved slowly. I looked behind me to see speeding boats approaching. I then say, "I've left my husband." The man says hopefully, "You've left him!" He wants me to connect with him.
