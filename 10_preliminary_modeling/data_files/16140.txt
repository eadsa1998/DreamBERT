Dad and I were taking a walk through the city, and we were like, it was like almost like Disneyland. There were like these rides set up and these little booths, but somehow I had the notion that it was just the city the way it was. And we were crossing busy streets and going through alleys, and I was carrying Mom's little flat recorder, the black one that's flat. And I had the shoulder strap over my shoulder. It was kind of under my arm, the way I carried it. And I was playing the Wee Sing tape as we were walking, and for some reason or another I didn't want Dad to hear "Bluebird" when we came to it, and I kept hoping that somehow this tape would stop or something. And I don't remember exactly what the final -- oh, I remember. We had finished our walk before "Bluebird" was supposed to come on, and we got back to the house and I shut off the tape, and we went on with our day, and then I woke up. That was kind of a strange dream, wouldn't you say?
