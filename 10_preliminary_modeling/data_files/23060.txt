There were three different boxes of "love kits" for sale.  There was a fancy variety, for about $1 each, another for about 50 cents, and a cheaper one for only 6 cents.  Being thrifty, I took one of the latter.  It had the advantage that you could just carry it around with you in a conspicuous place, and others who had them or knew what they were could spot yours and know you were on the make, and vice versa.  This greatly facilitated making contacts with willing members of the opposite sex.  The "kits" were just about the size of a matchbook, yellow, and had printed instructions for how to heighten the sensuality of your experience.  The first girl I saw who had one was in a building much like one at the university where I work.  I had hoped to be more selective, but I didn't know how likely it was that I would run into another anytime soon, and besides, this girl was rather forward.  She took the initiative, and I was reluctant to turn her down.  The room was rather dark, and I met her as she descended a staircase.  As we walked, we passed through a little more light, and I saw that she was not too attractive-she had pimples, and a large mouth.  We passed a couple of full length mirrors like the kind in the clothing departments of stores, but only double-faceted rather than several.  She suggested we make it in front of one of those-but for some reason it didn't seem worthwhile to me because there were only two faces.  We passed through a set of double glass doors and came to another darkened stairway.  She suggested that we do it there.  She was eager.
