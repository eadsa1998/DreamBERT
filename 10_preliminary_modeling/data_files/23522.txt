Kathy was in the hospital. I was there (to help her?). I went away and came back and couldn't find her -- there was just a tangle of blankets. She was in the bathroom and having trouble. I tried to help her with her catheter or something but I didn't know exactly what do. I tried to talk to her when she was in bed -- she wanted me to be with her and she wanted to see my photo album.
