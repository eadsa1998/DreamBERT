Nate is there and he's aware that I won't have a relationship with him when he is still drunk. Lucy and I are doing a play together and we are talking about the difficult parts. I say to someone, "Yes, there are some sexy parts, and the action parts we'll just tell. I'll tell the stage directions." Rochelle is there in a small car scooter-like wheelchair. Her hair is very pretty, groomed nicely.
