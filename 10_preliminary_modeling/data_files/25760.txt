 I have sprained my left ankle. It begins to swell and turn red. Two young men who are trainers or doctors are there. One of them does most of the examining. He looks at my ankle and says it is hot. He presses it in a few places, which hurts. He tells me I have a broken ankle. He shows me what has happened inside my ankle by taking the interior structure out of my right leg. First he pushes some liquid/ice cube-like content and it moves up along my leg from the ankle. He says there should be a different amount of this substance there: that is how he knows it's broken. The interior structure of my right leg consists of thin tubing, a few joints, and a couple of stretched springs in the ankle. The man starts putting these together to show me. I see this and complete the ankle spring system. I explain to the two men, and others who are there, including my old neighbor Natasha Lens, that I have had trouble with this ankle in the past: I sprained it a few years ago. It was a bad sprain in November or December, and then I sprained it again in March. I have been active on my ankle, playing basketball. I tell them it is still sore in the morning when I get up. The doctor who hasn't said much says that it sounds like a misdiagnosis when I first injured it. I say the doctor then told me we could get an X-ray, but I didn't have any money. It is time to leave. <br/
