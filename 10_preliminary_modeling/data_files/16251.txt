I just woke up from a dream I was having and I have a real clear recollection of it. I dreamt that we were at Six Flags; well, no. I dreamt that we were at a carnival thing like in somebody's parking lot, like and it was almost dusk and we were riding these rides. There were only a few of them. I can't remember exactly what they did, but I remember we were riding some rides and it's too many in my dream, and it was really, really fun. And then we were at home and for some reason Dad had some errands to do or something, so he was hanging like that in the truck and would drive away for like half hour to an hour increments, I don't know, something like that. And I was setting up to jam in my studio. Of course the task ____ board is on my desk now, but here's, Mom gave me this fresh set of batteries from somewhere and they were fresh and there was no ones in her boombox. And the next, oh boy, this is getting just all fragmented, isn't it? [laugh] Mom was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, "Do not enter, surprise things." And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries Mom gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task ____ board, and I don't remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, "Oh man!" But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like [sings a little song] "______ in the song I sing today. You're in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there's a ______ of my slumber. You're never out of thought." The best I could sing at 4:30 in the morning. [laugh]
