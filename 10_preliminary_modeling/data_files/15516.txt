I got a letter saying that I had a dentist appointment at 9pm tomorrow and it would cost $87. I also had something else to go to at 10.40[m. I went to some place and checked my phone for the Movies group and Dad had posted and I asked why he was in that group. He said Gunnar invited him. Then Dad was with me and we went out to the car. Rover and a black dog were there and it kept going in my car and then lying on top of Rover. I tried to get rid of it and it somehow 'fell up' into my car. I waited for the owner to come out and then it was tiny and in a bottle. There was a greenhouse type of thing and the door was thin and wiry, but started to crush me. Ezra and his friend were there and were ignoring me. I couldn't breathe and then managed to get away. Benjamin was then there. I was in a car with him and Mom and it was awkward. He said he was getting messages all the time recently and Mom was like 'oh, because of Izzy, she's always checking her phone' and he said he doesn't go online with his phone.
