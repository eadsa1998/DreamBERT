I had a dream that I was at my high school, but it was just like Hogwarts and was magical. Professor Dumbledore was the headmaster. I had been going there before Kylie came too. So we dueled, and Dumbledore was on my side telling me what to do because my wand was messed up. Finally it snapped in half and we all had to go to Diagon Alley to buy a new wand. On the train Kylie made fun of me for being blonde, even though I'm not. So I got mad and then she cursed me to death. Then I woke up.
