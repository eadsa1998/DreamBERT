I'm in the Army, I have been to war, and now am in a large military warehouse. I'm climbing up a huge pile of boxes that are packed with thousands of small black toy trains. An MP comes by and harasses me. I start to climb down from the boxes, toppling them, causing the trains to spill out and onto the floor. I tell the MP nobody pushes me around. I threaten him, and he leaves. I walk to another part of the warehouse, a gymnasium. Off to one side, a small group of black women are watching TV. Otherwise, the area is vacant. In my bare feet, I start to skate on the wood floor. I'm going fast, making large sweeping turns. Then a man with movie star looks grabs me. He's kidnapping me. He and others put me in a car. He keeps telling me not to fight him, but I won't let him go. They drive me to a place where criminals do business. The man in the car wants to kill me. We struggle. He keeps trying to break free. I call to the criminals as they walk past, but it's hard to speak, I make only garbled sounds. Then they hear and see me and approach, and I say to them, "Kill him." I wake up moaning those words.
