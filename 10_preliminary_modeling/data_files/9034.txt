I was doing computer work for someone and not at my home. There were other people around. I had two Excel workbooks open. One had a lot of sheets to it with many entries on each sheet. I was looking up something about some of the numbers from the first workbook in the second workbook. The numbers I was looking up looked slightly different than the others. That's how I knew which ones I needed to look up. If I found what I was looking for in the second workbook I would cut and paste the entry from the first workbook into the second and then go back and delete the empty line. I had gone through all of the sheets. I was now going through them again because something had changed that led us to believe that I might now find more of them. I did sheet after sheet and find no more. There was a discussion about a disagreement going on between some of the people.
