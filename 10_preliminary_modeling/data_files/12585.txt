I was at school and my voice was going. Tiny Firefly (House of 1000 Corpses) was rocking on a chair facing me and I was facing the other way. I moved and he stopped. Lorelei was there. I was trying to tell Ms Braun about my voice. I found some school photos and one was from Year 2 and Forrest was in it. I was trying to locate his last name, because I couldn't remember it (in real life, I rediscovered it in late 2007). I was then in the photo and I was looking at him close up and realized he had freckles; he was extremely 'vivid'. There were more photos and videos of me when I was young. I acted a lot like I do now.
