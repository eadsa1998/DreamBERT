In one of the dreams I saw myself in the yard at my home. It was nighttime and suddenly I saw a red VW coming towards us, but this VW did not have a driver. Suddenly I saw I was not alone in the yard. A friend of my sister, named Mona, was with me and she happens to have a red VW. And I asked her if this was her car and she said no. The car stopped going and then Mona and I went to see what was happening, and we opened the door of the car and a man covered with blood fell at my feet. Mona and I screamed, but then we reacted and saw that the man was still moving, that he was still alive. We started to run to get help, but saw that we weren't getting anywhere. We were in the same spot.
