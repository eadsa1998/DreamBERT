 I see some people plant a very large marijuana plant in the desert. They dig a hole for it and plant it carefully. I see a big bush with a black snake in it. It seems to be near, on a car, where others and I are. The head of the snake may or may not be poisonous. The tail looks like a head, with eye and mouth-shaped features. A man may get bitten on his nose. I don't think this is serious, or poisonous. There is a man who leaves his house with his teenage daughter and her boyfriend. I may be the man. The boyfriend drives. They are going to kill the snake. The man has a black handgun, loaded and cocked with the safety on. I sit on the left side of the boyfriend and shift gears. He is a beginning driver with a stick shift. It's dark out. We approach an intersection where we have a stop sign. The boyfriend doesn't stop. I look to see if there is cross traffic, and see none, so I don't do anything. We go through the stop sign. I tell him we just ran a stop sign, he's lucky there were no police, and that I looked for traffic.
