I am in a second floor apartment which is not mine. It seems like the apartment where a high school friend lived with her family in my hometown. I turn some company away and they are angry. The company is the boyfriend of a woman I work with, my parents, my aunt and uncle, cousin and her husband. I lock the door. I and someone else are trying to leave via the back stairs when I hear the owners opening the front and I am trying to get out but I can't move.
