Matthew was home. We were supposed to be going to a family gathering at Todd A's, but I don't know where that was. We were talking about the weather, about how neither of us wanted to do the driving, and concerned about whether or not we should even go because of snow. It occurred to me that we could call Jody S and see if we could ride part of the way with her. that might help some. Then I was having a conversation with BJ. She was going from home. We were at home. So I must have been talking to her by phone but I could see her. She said it would take her about four hours. I was trying to decide how to respond to that because I didn't understand why it would take her twice as long as it normally takes Matthew and I to make that drive. I think I finally just said, Really? It normally takes us about two hours.
