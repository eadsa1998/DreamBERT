In the darkroom we mixed chemicals in empty soda bottles with the labels taken off. The developer looked just like ruby red grapefruit juice. Mark was pouring it out into shot glasses and taking a swig and then dumping a shot glass full into the developer tray for good measure. There were so many kinds of juice at the store it got confusing and you had to look real close. I was looking for orange pineapple. It had mango and lemon juice in extra. There were 4 kinds of juice in bright orange cartons and boxes of cheap store brand and ice tea powder mix in canisters stacked too high to reach. The cheap ice tea mix was $1.99 each. The price was confusing for the orange juices, mostly $4.99 but one was $2.99 but it was too high to reach.
