I traveled through a dimensional rift to a place and time where me, my friends and family (parents, brothers, some college friends) launched a successful pub/ice cream shop in the heart of a college-campus/trendy city place. Like a "lifestyle center". Business was booming and I was looking for a way to expand even more, without compromising our "core values" of ice cream and service.
