I had to stay after school for, oh no, I was sitting in this room taking a test. It was kind of like math class, but it wasn't. It was like some room I've never been in. And this fire alarm box in the back of the room had these like wires attached to it, and what you were supposed to do was attach the wires to some kind of big appliance, and if the big appliance gets too hot, it'll go off. So everybody in the class gets this form to fill out about what they've done in the school year, and so I've ______, and so we're all sitting there writing our papers and the room is so quiet, and this boy in the back of the room is sitting there fiddling with these wires. And Melinda and me are both telling him to stop, but he won't. And then the class starts getting all more commotiony. And then for some reason the teacher switched off the lights and put them overhead, and was teaching us how to write 8's so that they looked good -- you know, how they used to teach us how to write letters in kindergarten? Well, this teacher was so upset with the way we'd been writing 8's. She wanted to teach us how to write them right. And then the class cleared out and Mrs. Dougherty came by and said, "If you wait here fifteen minutes, I want to come back and practice with you." Well, I was waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting for it felt like two or three hours, and I went to this little room that had a bathroom. And I took my clothes off and left them in the bathroom, and I went to the bathroom. By the way, I really did have to do when I woke up. [laugh] And it was getting dark outside and I thought that it was like way past the time when I was supposed to go home, so I was going to call Mom and Dad, but just as I was going to call, Mom came up to get me and said that she had been vacuuming the track and so it took her forever. [laugh] That was crazy.
