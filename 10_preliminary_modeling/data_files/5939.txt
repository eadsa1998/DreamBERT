Am sitting at home looking at TV when doorbell rings. I don't want to answer. I hear someone outside and see a head raise up to peek in the curtain. I ignore it and lean back with hand over eyes as if sleeping, but continue to watch TV thru closed (partially) eyes. Later hear nothing and get up to look out curtain. See a small woman of Latin origin standing at door with small boy. He looks up and sees me peeking out and then quickly pulls sleeve of woman.
