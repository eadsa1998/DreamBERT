I am walking down a sidewalk and a homeless woman lies down and wraps herself in a black blanket to my left. I stand there and look at her. It seems she did this deliberately so I will notice her. I see she has the blanket wrapped tightly around her and over her head because it is very cold outside. I look at her exposed feet in moccasin shoes and watch to see if she is shivering. She isn't. I choose to walk away from her, feeling a bit guilty for not trying to help. [BL]
