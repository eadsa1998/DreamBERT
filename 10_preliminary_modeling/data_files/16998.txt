My brother and I are in an apartment, somewhere abroad - perhaps Germany. The apartment is on an unknown floor - it's large, long and modern. It is also clean, tidy and empty - perhaps this is a hotel? We are only there temporarily for 24 hours or so. My cousin Clive was there before us, and we cross paths briefly. He gives me a book to read. It has impressive illustrations in it (etchings?) My brother and I chat to kill time, but neither of us is keeping track of the time. We have a flight to catch this evening - we don't even know exactly when it is, or where the airport is. I go online to check. I find out we have only an hour and a half before the plane leaves. It's a disaster - we are so stupid.
