 I'm in the back of a car with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. My friend Jack Miller and others are in the front. Annie leaves so I can have time with the boys. I don't necessarily want this: I'm enjoying being with her. We drive. The driver is a woman, maybe Annie. The driver revs the engine as we drive, confused as to why the car won't accelerate. I point out that the car is in neutral. We drive past a carnival at Hill Park in Oak Valley. There are people there, but no lights are on, even though the rides are operating.
