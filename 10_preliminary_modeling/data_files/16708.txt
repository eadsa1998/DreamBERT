I remember being in Africa- a quiet wooded scene outdoors. I think it was a school trip. It was night, and it was rather warm and the air felt humid. I remember being in my bedroom or one much like it, and many frail looking boys coming in- many of them wearing the smallest bit of clothing. I felt rather bad for them, and realized how hard it would be for me to live like that. There were at least 2 beds in the room, and about 5 or 6 boys got into each bed. It also seemed like it would be too crowded if I also got in the bed- I'd barely fit, and I like having room. All I remember thinking is that since there were so many people on the beds, I'd rather sleep on the floor. They didn't say a word. Then I'm in a hotel. Certain doors I wasn't able to open, maybe. I don't remember much, but recollection of it makes me shiver (even though the dream didn't seem too bad when first experienced). There's some recollection of being trapped somewhere, although it didn't feel too pressing of a situation.
