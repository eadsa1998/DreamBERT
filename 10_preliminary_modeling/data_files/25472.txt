 I pull my mom's station wagon into the alley of the block across the street from home. I pull the car up to my neighbor the Wilson's driveway in back of their house. I am here to pick up my friend Tim Robbins and his younger brother from school. The younger brother says I'll have to, "Wait till Watson", at 8:00 to leave for school. It is 7:50 now, and I'm 10 minutes early. (Note: there is no younger brother in real life)
