I was flying along as the boys were walking. I worked my hands like wings and flew. I flew above two dogs and they came along. I looked at my tires and they were worn. The treads were worn off and I was irritated at the car. I was driving along with Ed P. on my running board. I went down a steep hill and I came to a narrow bridge going across the river. I missed the bridge and my car went over on the side of the bank and hung there. Ed was just about falling into the river. I helped him out and then I got out and said, "I hope the car falls into the river." The river was swift. I saw a man floating in it. I don't know whether he was swimming or was drowning, but I saw a gush of air come out of him because of the water made bubbles as he did it. Then my car slid in and disappeared into the swift river.
