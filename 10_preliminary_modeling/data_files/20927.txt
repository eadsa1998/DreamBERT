A man brought out a small wildcat. He let it out and it ran around in a large circle. He said, "You better run if you hit him and don't kill him." I threw a rock and hit him. He fell over and was a black pigeon. He started to move and then flew up. I thought he was going to chase us, but he took off and another pigeon flew after him. They disappeared. I saw two other pigeons flying by. I picked up another rock and threw it at them. I hit one and down he came. He was knocked out for a while, then came to. I told Ann, "Boy am I good today." I walked up to the pigeon and he was on his feet. He flew up and away.
