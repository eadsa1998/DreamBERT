Ezra was a bad guy, who was sometimes Ezra but sometimes not. I had to keep hiding Porky from him. I put her in this fridge and I had to take her out after a certain time. I went to the toilet. When I came out I went to put Porky in this room with beer. Ezra was there and he had big eyes and a firecracker had gone off. He said not to worry about hiding her.
