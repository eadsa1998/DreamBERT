I was walking along a deserted street in a small town. It was about seven in the evening and starting to get dark and I thought people were staring at me from behind closed windows and doors. There was an unnatural quiet in the air and the only sound I could hear were my shoes scraping the cement. All of a sudden a shuttered window opened and a gorgeous girl, unclothed, beckoned to me. I wanted to run into the house where she was staying, but something was preventing me. My feet just couldn't move because all the people were shouting and calling me names. They told me not to go. The girl was pretty and I wanted to go with her very badly but my feet could not move.
