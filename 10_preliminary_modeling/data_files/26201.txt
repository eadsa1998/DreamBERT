 My sister Ramona and I are in a boat fishing. We drift into shallow water. I'm going to pull up the 25 horsepower motor and put down the trolling motor. We move, and are in a very rocky area that goes from very shallow to very deep. It's quarry-like, and the water has a reddish tint. We go through a narrow channel. I use the trolling motor. I see a tree ahead of us with bald eagles in it. There are three larger figures on the tree. They move as if to capture or kill the eagles. They have a huge red flag on a pole about 20 feet long. We get closer. One man is standing in front of the other man on the water. The man speaks to us. He has a weapon and tries to make us stop. I won't stop: I start the 25 horsepower motor and go full throttle, steering straight for them. They say they need help. I run them over, and they dart out of the way. I turn and go back again. The man who was alone grabs the side of the boat as I speed past. He climbs in the boat. I use a fishing net to hit him in the glasses to get him to fall out of the boat.
