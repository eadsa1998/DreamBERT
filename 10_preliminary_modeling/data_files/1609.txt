I see a high rack filled with books, like in a book store. A man is seated near it, in front of it on one side. He looks a little forlorn. He says, "You've got your books and people. I just want a job." I go to one of my "aunts" and tell her about him. We all own a big ranch and we agree to give him a job as a cowboy, riding a horse. I ride the horse to the ranch, which is a little like V's house. I go toward the front enclosed porch. There is a busy restaurant there. A woman has ordered eggs and is unsatisfied with the ones she got, so I step in to cook her new eggs. I give her the eggs and then try to scrape the old ones with a bit taken out of them onto a platter to serve to someone else. I pick up rice and eggs from under the platter with my spoon. A man watches and I feel a little embarrassed like I'm cheating or being stingy.
