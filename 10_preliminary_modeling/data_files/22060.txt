I dreamt that I had died and that I lived in the coffin, but I wasn't afraid, that I went in and out of my house (strange thing, even though I was dead, I could walk, talk, go from one place to another, as though I were alive). And then I saw the rest of my family in the same condition. But I asked myself: "How can I explain this to my friends? They are not going to believe me."
