I was in a mansion or more like a castle and there was a person who was supposed to be the devil in the castle. He was snapping his fingers and slitting people's throats. I was running away and riding my bike through my neighborhood. Then I arrive at the preschool where I am doing a field study, and I am a teacher and my students and I are playing a name song. When it gets to one of the male volunteers, he leans in and kisses me. I don't recognize his face, but I seem to know him. I have a strong physical attraction to this person and throughout the dream I hope he feels the same way. Then I am with the children again and we are running from some other children who are the devil. The devil looks like someone from Bach's era. He has a wide grin on his malicious-looking face. The children and I are escaping in a jeep, but have to leave the jeep and continue on foot. We are in a jungle now and I lose one of the children, which has me scared, but then I found the child again, alive and well.
