I am leaving the house for work and notice that I am 4 months pregnant. I am surprised. At the age of 44, it seems odd. It is also a little pleasant. I try to figure out who the father is. I am a little disappointed that it's not Nate. Maybe it's one of the two Pats. I go to work. I am depressed and keep to myself as I work. I go to the lunch room and see a newspaper article of Delta S. I try to point it out to the others, but they pay no attention to me. I eat chocolate chip cookies and toast with honey.
