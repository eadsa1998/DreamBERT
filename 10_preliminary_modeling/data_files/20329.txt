I met a teenage girl. She said she wanted to learn about words, literature, and writing. As she spoke, I saw an object, like a mirage, crescent-shaped slightly above my head. Then she went on to say that she liked be-bop music, and wanted to compose. As she was speaking about the music, I saw a rod-like shape emerge from the center of the inside curve of the crescent-shaped object.
