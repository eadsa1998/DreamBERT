I was at a train station. I tried to tag on and something went wrong and then I didn't know whether I tagged on before or if it had worked. I asked a policeman to scan it but nothing showed up. I think it says I posted it on a forum. The train station was huge and inside. There were heaps of shops and escalators. There was a message on the forum and some girl said she was bisexual and for ages she had [done something I can't read] and that it might be the reason for something. There was a group for a plan or something but I can't read what it says. This screen said "John Wonchomber" but it meant Dean Winchester (Supernatural). My tag off hadn't worked. I told Mom and Darren later. I also went to university for a few hours. I was at a shop which was actually a house? I was looking for a door. Outside it was rainy looking, but hot.
