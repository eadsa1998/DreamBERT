I was at an amusement park and I went on the water slide. But it wasn't the kind that you sat or lay down. You stood up, kind of like waterskiing. Anyway, it was crazy, and there was no way anyone could last this ride. The slide itself was metal and I remember looking around, and it looked like I was inside a factory or something. (Now comes the strange part.) I made it through the whole ride and landed in a pool of water. I went underneath and came up, and there was Michael J. Fox in the water with me and we started kissing. I guess he was my boyfriend or something. We just swam and kissed the rest of the dream. (???)
