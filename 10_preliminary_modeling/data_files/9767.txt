Church: one of Wendy's friends comes to Church; she does not believe; she sits in corner and turns into a dog (looks like Fido, Marissa's dog). He lies on his back and pees all over, a high spray of urine.... I am terribly upset: Father Andrew takes him and Phyllis into a corner and talks to them about religion; I am very embarrassed, sit in school like chair and desk; see janitor bring in a lamp tree and break one red glass....
