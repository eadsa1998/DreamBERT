I hear a punk boy pounding on my door and I am angry at him. I open the door and yell at him to stop it and leave me alone. He is mean and refuses to stop. He seems to enjoy my anger. That's why he's doing this. I try to keep the door locked, but he keeps pushing it open and the door isn't very strong. So I open the door, grab the kid by the hair and slap him on the face, bite him on the forehead and in general try to beat him into submission. It doesn't work, of course, and I drag him by the ear to his mother's, across town in the bad section. It becomes clear they don't give a damn, and not only are they not going to help me, they are going to make it worse by being vengeful.
