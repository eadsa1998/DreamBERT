A young boy around 8 years old is in an orphanage. The head mistress doesn't like him and picks on him. Now he is 14 and has given birth to a baby. No one knows who the woman was, or maybe she gave birth but he has the baby, I'm not sure. Anyway, here comes the dark-haired, fierce, stone-faced head mistress looking for him. He hides with the baby in a box in the closet, covering them up with clothes. She is suspicious and sniffs around very close. A sheriff is called in and he and his men are around looking too. The boy calls out for help from his peers. They decide to create a diversionary tactic so he can escape. The boy comes out of hiding and runs. He calls the head mistress a lesbian. Her face goes red. She is livid with anger at this accusation. It is unclear if she's angry at a false accusation, or if she is feeling caught and embarrassed. She clearly is angry. He runs and then stops long enough to pick up a small box which has a tiny woman in it. The woman is a teacher at the orphanage and is the mother of the baby. She seduced the boy and he kept it secret to protect her. He says goodbye to her and goes off. Now time has passed and he's a grown man in his own home. He works hard and has a nice home, but he loves to iron clothes because it feels satisfying to get out the wrinkles. He does this when he wants to feel relaxed and happy. The sheriff returns to question him about the origins of the baby. He calls to a man, a gay man, to come and tell the sheriff they were together that evening to help with an alibi. The man hesitates and then agrees. Someone tells the young man he acts like a woman and prefers to be like a woman, by that I mean not physically, just in the things he likes to do, like cook and clean and raise the baby and so on.
