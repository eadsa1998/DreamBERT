I saw final peuer in a magazine. I saw a stars and one was crossed off, so there were 5 stars on a piece of paper. I saw look. Judy was running after her mother. She started to walk. I called her and she walked over to me. A fellow told me another smart kid threw potatoes at me and missed me. I saw him going up the hill. I caught up to him and told him what could have happened. "You can kill someone and then you would be sorry, but it would be too late." Then I met him again and gave him a talking to again. I said, "Now what if you killed someone and you were in court and a sister, brother or wife were crying for their loved one you had killed -- how would you feel?"
