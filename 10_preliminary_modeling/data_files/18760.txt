I was at the church. I was going to be doing a music concert in one week. I had to find some music for piano with hand bells and recruit some bell ringers. After my run, I stopped at the church and ran up to staircase beside the building and followed the Lindleys up the stairs. I know I could count on one of them to play. It was going to be a lot of practice before we played. I was walking without any pants on. I was wearing only a white t-shirt and it was just long enough fro me to hold it with both hands over my butt. I had to walk around the corner right past some construction workers. I found a pair of long silky black shorts. I had got a scholarship and I didn't know if I could schedule my classes. I had forgotten my chemistry book and I was looking for Mr. Brady. ???. It was very important. I saw Sarah Pratt in the school parking lot. She had gone away to have an abortion and the only school she could get into so late when she came back was Sarah Lawrence. She sat in a thick swamp with another girl and their school books--waiting for an over-the-hill past-his-prime country singer. On the way to his concert in a borrowed truck, we tried to remember as many of his songs as we could. When we got to the set, 2 homeless men and a homeless woman came in, showing him their feet--with only socks and asked for shoes. The girl crouched over to see and one of the homeless men picked her up. Then he picked up the other man. They were trying to show they deserved the money.
