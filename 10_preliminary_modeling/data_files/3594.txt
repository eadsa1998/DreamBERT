I am an extra actress. I'm just in the background being a person sitting at a cafe table. The main actors are at other tables doing the play and I am supposed to improv gestures and pretend I am talking to other people and so on for the entire play. I keep coming up with ideas on what to do and even make a few funny remarks that could have been good lines in the play. The director, a man, wants me to make what I'm doing even bigger because it is so good. He dresses as a woman and wanders across the stage pretending to be one of the cafe extras and signals me to act as if I am leaving to go to the restroom. I do so, going off stage and he says to me, "I like what you're doing; keep on and make it bigger." I nod and go back on stage. More extras are there imitating me.
