I am watching a movie. Ernie and his boys are there, maybe Ginny too. Ding is in the movie. Later I talk to Ding and tell her I'm working hard on my issues as a full-time counselor, and then I amend that and say I haven't seen her for weeks. Actually I'm thoroughly searching my dreams for the answers, who, what, when, why. I'll find out what happened. She's not terribly interested.
