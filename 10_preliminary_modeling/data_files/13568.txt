We went to Nana's. I was at the table doing a 1000 piece puzzle. I had almost finished it and then realized that it had pieces that weren't in the puzzle and I'd just had extremely good luck picking the right pieces. Calvin, Ezra, and Emery, I think were there. They were mucking around and Nana was a bit annoyed.
