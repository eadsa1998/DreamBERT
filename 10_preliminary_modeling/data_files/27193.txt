I dreamed about a young married couple whom I have known for a long time. They came to see us at our home. Although the home was ours, it resembled my Uncle's home in C___ and yet the dream seemed to take place in C ___.. They drove up in a Model A Ford &amp; parked it in the front yard. We were in the living room talking when another Model A Ford drove up &amp; in it were my sister &amp; a friend of mine. I went out in the front yard, got in this couple's car, and started to talk to my sister. D___ my sister, asked me if I wanted to go to a play with J. She said that she and her husband weren't going. I realized that I would have to go with him alone, so I refused. Then they drove away and the wife came out in the yard. She seemed perturbed at my getting into their car, so she got into the car and backed it away. The car then suddenly changed into an old-fashioned bicycle. It was at this time that I felt antagonistic towards this couple.
