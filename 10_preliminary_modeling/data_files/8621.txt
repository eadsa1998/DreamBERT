I learned that Bill C is not nearly as pleased with Bryan N's performance at CAS as I thought. I either wondered or had a strong impression that Bryan N might not be there much longer. I immediately thought that I could not let myself feel happy about this in any way. that such thoughts or feelings would be totally inappropriate and not Christian-like. Besides, I do still think that Bryan N is the closest I've seen to someone who could actually get on-going results for the company in terms of revenue, as long as he stays focused on that.
