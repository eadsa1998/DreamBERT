I was at an event or something like that and went into the public restroom. There were two stalls. I went into the one furthest from the door and proceeded to use the toilet. Someone else came in and started to come into my stall when I realized that the door to my stall had not shut completely. We both were standing there trying to figure out why the doors would not shut or how to shut them so they would stay shut. The doors were much shorter than is typical in waking life. The closures were on the outside of the door so the only way you could use them is if you could reach over the top of the door and down far enough to the closure. A third woman came in and was helping us try to figure this out. Now the doors seemed as tall as in waking life and the third woman noticed a closure on the top of the door. At one point that closure was on the outside then it seemed to be on the inside. I went into the other stall and was going to use it then. The second woman said something about still being hesitant. I said I didn't care that I had to go bad enough that I was just going to use it. I noticed that the toilet was kind of nasty and that it had not been flushed by at least one person who used it previously. I debated for just a second whether or not to flush it before I used it, which is what I would typically do. I was concerned about the impression that would give these other two women so I decided against it. As I sat down I was concerned that I would not be able to go with these other two women in there, as is often the case for me. But I had to go bad enough that it turned out I didn't have a problem at all.
