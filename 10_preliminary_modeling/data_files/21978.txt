I was living by my mother's house. She had a door and a stairway upstairs in the back of the house. There was a nice breeze or air thru the house. I seemed to be in Florida on several occasions. I saw or met a lot of my neighborhood fellows who were small boys when I was home by Grandma's when I was single.
