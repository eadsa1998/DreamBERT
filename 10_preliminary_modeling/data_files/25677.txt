 I'm at my neighbor Andy Jones' house in Oak Valley. There is a boy outside with a dog. A different large dog growls at me. The boy tells it to be quiet. I go inside the house. People are in the basement or another room. I go to the green house on the corner of Home Avenue and 3rd Street. I knock at the door to get a woman who is a friend of mine. I say we're waiting for her.
