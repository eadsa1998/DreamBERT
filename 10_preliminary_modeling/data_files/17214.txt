I was Sam from Quantum Leap again, I think.  Riding in the back of a super fast car, going backward, then sideways.  Then swimming.  A black girl at the end, and my French classmate Briana was riding a bike on a pass over the pool.  I talked to her.  She liked the bike, but really wanted to swim, only she wasn't good at it.  I got out of the pool, put my coat on to keep warm, and was supposed to give her some tips.  I got back in the pool with my coat still on, so I had to take it off.  I had a baseball, and that was somehow supposed to help me teach her how to swim, as my coordination isn't all that great either.  Then, from behind, Ann Margaret rode up on a motorcycle in a wedding dress.  It's Friday and we're supposed to get married.  I looked at her dentures and the jaw was spaced wide, like a dinosaur's.  Some of the teeth were clear, and I poked around, rearranging them.  Then we went to bed.
