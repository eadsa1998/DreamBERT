I was in my birth home but I was saying that it was my parents new home and it was raining like you wouldn't believe. The ceilings/roof was leaking something terrible. It was like it was raining inside it was so bad. My parents were away and I was trying to track them down and get the message to them and try to figure out what to do. Because it was just everywhere, so I couldn't even set buckets under drips. It wouldn't do any good to mop it up because it was raining so hard and was coming in so fast.
