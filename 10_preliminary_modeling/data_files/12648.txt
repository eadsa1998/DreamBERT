I was at school and we had swimming. Ezra was making fun of this other school. Tiana was there and she said to look at the clouds, which were black. There was a car and something about summer and an older guy. There was a truck full of soil. Mom picked me and Ezra up early at 10:30am, but it was actually 3pm.
