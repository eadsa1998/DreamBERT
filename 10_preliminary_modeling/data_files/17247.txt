My family and I were riding busses that floated about 5 feet in the air.  The area we were in was interesting but hard to describe.  I was involved in a cultural (Indian?) wedding, with two other girls.  They were helped into toga type outfits.  One had a tattoo of stars traversing her back.  I was given the men's outfit, though.  Bellbottom leggings and a shirt that hung loosely down to the knee.  The father of the bride was the one we were helping because he was the bus driver and we needed to get home.  Rode through a beige area of town.
