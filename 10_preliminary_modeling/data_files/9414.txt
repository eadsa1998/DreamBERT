I am looking for a new apartment. See this incredible bed. It has pockets for bed clothes. On either side letter boxes, ash tray, book pocket, magazine rack, etc. Also is collapsible and adjustable to any size. Shift: go swimming in large swimming pool. Don't worry because it is my day off. See a young doctor (?) who asks if I read German as he just read an interesting article in a German medical journal. He asks if I can translate it. Yes I am delighted. Then embrace with Edward who was standing just behind the doctor.
