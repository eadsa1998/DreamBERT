We are in a car going somewhere. There are others in the car besides me and Mary, but I don't know them. Mary is not feeling well. She opens the window and the driver of the car orders her not to -- that open car windows bother him. Mary complies and closes the window. She fans herself. She looks awful. I remonstrate with the driver, telling him Mary isn't well and needs air. But he insists that the windows must remain closed. Mary tells me not to bother. I suggest that if she's not feeling well that we turn around and go home. Mary says not to do so -- that somehow she will be OK. I come over to her and put my arms around her and she nestles into my arms. She tells me that this is what she wants -- that I should hold her. Then she tells me I've not been fair to her. I don't understand what she is saying -- something about my not being close to her. The dream scene shifts. We are in a bank and someone hasn't got enough money. It's a very small sum that the person wants -- less than five dollars. The person informs the teller, when submitting a check, that there is not enough money in his account to cover the amount of the check. The teller gives him the money on condition he promises to repay the bank. But as soon as he gets the money, he says he's not going to make good on his promise. I get angry and take money out of my pocket -- either to give it to him or the teller. There is a bit of an altercation between me and this other man about what to do with the money. Throughout all of this Mary is standing nearby, looking on and saying nothing.
