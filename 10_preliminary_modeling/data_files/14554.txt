I woke up to people talking and Amelia crying. I tried to get back to sleep for an hour with no luck. I got up and closed the hallway door and yelled at them to shut up. This girl was there and was Quincy's girlfriend. Darren was there. I managed to get to sleep, but I woke up again from a movie. Samantha posted a comment on Facebook about how there was a bridge which had her name on it. I checked the time and it was 3am when I went to bed. Everyone was asleep, but later on Ezra was out there. On Battlestar Galactica, Helo's last name was Penikett. Boomer was in the episode too. This girl got pregnant but the guy was pregnant and they shot him because he wasn't human. I needed to do five things but I couldn't work out the fifth (I was a medical person). I pretended it was done. I said to a girl that Helo's name was actually Penikett.
