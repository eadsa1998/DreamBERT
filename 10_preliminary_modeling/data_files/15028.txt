This guy took me and some others in a car. I knew was bad but he didn't know that I knew. It was night time. We got to this snowy place and we stopped and I got out of the car and I ran. I ran up this hill which was covered in fake snow which was like a carpet and I used it to pull me up. There were a lot of houses and they all had these LED signs with temperatures written on them (all the temperatures were different though). I went into a house which was dark and empty. I heard a noise coming from the front of the house so I lay down and started to pull myself into the house, but this guy came in and had a look. He said 'I think that's Izzy' but he was looking for someone else first. I watched his shadow to make sure that he left and then I went out the front way. They turned off all the street lights. I went into this other house and there was a kitchen with steps leading down to a kid's room with two beds. There were a heap of blankets and whatnot at the end of the first bed and I hid under the blankets just as some people came into the house. This young boy found me and said 'I see people... in my head'. He tried to help me. His other sibling was getting smacked. I said that I should leave and ended up staying the night. In the morning I heard the mother saying that she filled in the blanks - he had written some stuff on the window which mentioned my name. She wasn't in the room so I quickly opened the window and climbed out. It was now day. I had asked the boy where the good hiding places were. I ended up at a pet shop. I wondered if everyone in the town was evil. Seth Green worked in there. I saw this official guy in there as I opened the door so I hid my face and pretended to open the door for him.
