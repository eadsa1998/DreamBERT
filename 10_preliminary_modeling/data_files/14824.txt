Ezra was driving on the highway or something and he had missed the turnoff. It was night, but sometimes it was day, and there wasn't much traffic. He kept driving but Mom told him to turn back because he wasn't "experienced enough to drive that long". Then Dad, Ezra and I stopped at some deli thing and it was day. I thought it was dodgy. This hot guy owned it. There was a magazine with Jensen Ackles on the back. I wrote *love* and showed Ezra as a joke.
