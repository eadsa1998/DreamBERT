We were on an excursion. Calvin and I were wandering around somewhere. He found this gown on the ground and put it on. This guy came and said it was his and I'm not sure what happened, but he started trying to rape me. Calvin hit him with something and we ran off. We started calling him 'Gay Boy'. Later, he was giving a talk to some people from school. He saw us and kept staring at us while he talked. Then we were somewhere else and it was 1:50pm. We needed to get back by 2pm. We thought the bus left without us. I saw people from Whitehall and we were throwing stuff at them. Later, there was this weird game and we could turn into things. I was a frog in a jar and Calvin was a chicken. We had to try and get out of the jar. I also turned into a llama. Later, I was having a bath somewhere and I finished and when I dressed, Darren came in and told me to pull the plug out. He looked in and said "Try and get a redhead next time" and left. I said "Why are people so obsessed with redheads?". The water looked funny as it drained. I picked up a CD I had in the bathroom and there was a dead lady in the bath. I couldn't scream or move, but eventually managed to run out. Darren went in but there was no lady. Later, Farrah was on a lounge and I thought I saw the lady in the hallway. Farrah was a clone of Farrah and was called something else. The lady came back but she had short blonde hair. Mom was there. I couldn't hurt the lady because she was a ghost. I was trying to 'believe' and then I could hit her. She disappeared. I went to the mailbox with Ezra and there was lots of mail. This poodle went up to Ezra. There was a grave next to the mailbox and I was scared that a hand would come up. We saw this court trial on TV and 'Gay Boy' was on there. Then we were there, and Calvin was staring at him because he loved him or something. We thought that Gay Boy was cool.
