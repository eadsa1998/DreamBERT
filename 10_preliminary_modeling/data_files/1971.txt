I'm at a park, some community hippie function, lots of long tables. On one table are piles of clothes for sale, used clothes. I look each pile over. A man stands near me and also looks. I find an emerald green tee-shirt (turtleneck) that's too small. I think, "I don't like green, but this shirt is beautiful" (like Ginny said years ago). Then I look to the next table. Picnic stuff. I think, "This could get boring," but I see a band, so I know there will be entertainment. Everyone else is already seated with their food. I go to the end of a table and say,  "Is this where you start?" A man says, "I guess so." I ask where the plates are. "Over several tables." So I go over and get two paper plates. I find a tiny teaspoon and dish up macaroni and cheese from a big pot. Then I go back to the food table to get a hot dog. As I'm walking toward it, a fat hippie guy says, "I have to go to the bathroom. I hope I can make it." The crowd answers sympathetically. He starts to walk, then his face grimaces up as he has a bowel movement in his pants right there in front of everyone. "Oh," he cries, "I couldn't help it, and it's a hiney." He turns around so we can see his butt. Two pounds of butter is in a plastic sack and stapled to his shorts. Some guy jokes about it, "At least it wasn't chili," to ease his embarrassment. Raul jokes, "Is there any money on it?" (betting he could do better). I walk to the table and see a warmer with one hot dog left. I try to lift the lid. A guy offers to help. It's a huge bun with a dozen tiny hot dogs laid sideways across it. It weighs a lot and my paper plate has trouble not crumpling up.
