I was at the old house. Ezra and I had to share my room and my bed for a while. I had a double bed coming out from the window. Nana also shared it sometimes. His computer was in there too. I complained about it one day. I locked the door and was getting dressed and then he opened the door. I was like "what are you doing?" and covered up. There was a joke to do with a boat and The Princess Diaries and it was a quest on RuneScape.
