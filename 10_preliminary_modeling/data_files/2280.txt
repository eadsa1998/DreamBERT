It's 1:30 am and I let some talented piano players play a grand piano at my parents' house. I shush him because he's too loud and might wake up my parents. They do wake up but aren't too upset. The piano player asks, "What happened to his computer? Is he poor?" I explain they used to be poor, but are doing much better now. I go and ask him what happened to his computer. He says, "It's being fixed and will be returned."
