I am in a two-room office. It seems to be in the M. A. building. There are two women in the office. I recognize both of them as being co-workers of mine when I worked for the MMC three years ago. Another woman (just a blurred image) is dictating to one of the girls. She seems to be worried because the mail had not yet arrived. I go down to the basement of the building and look in my box. "I find two notes. The top seems to be located in M A, but is on the wrong side of the hall. The notes seem to deal with some papers which I forgot to turn in at the bookstore. I am extremely puzzled. "How could I have known about those papers when I am not a Mstudent, " I say to myself. As I am standing by the box I see my cousin (a married man of 29) put a note in his sister's box. (She is 31 and does not go to M.) I then go to the bookstore which is also in the basement. I am told it is the wrong one. I go upstairs, still in search of the bookstore and meet my S prof (the one I had at OSU.) I seem now to be at 0. S. U. He asks me why I returned and I explain that I am no longer going steady. At this point my dress blows up and I have difficulty holding it down. Ask him to help. We admit that teachers seem to get along better with pupils in class than out. I walk away.
