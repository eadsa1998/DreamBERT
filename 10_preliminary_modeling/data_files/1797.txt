I am at a table. I pour sugar-frosted shredded wheat things into a bowl. I pick up a cup with a drop or two of tea in it. Dwight says, "I'll get you some more tea." I say, "Thanks." Paulina is on my right. He gives me back the cup and I see that there is barely enough tea to cover the bottom of the cup. I feel robbed and say, "There isn't very much to eat here." My mother says, "Don't be silly. Let me see." I hand her the cup, which is now a huge glass bowl. As I hand it to her I feel a little embarrassed because I realize it is the size of the bowl that makes it seem I haven't enough tea. I drink the tea and realize I've picked up the wrong container and I had started to sip from a bag of coffee beans. I spit it out and wonder if all this sugar and coffee will hurt me. I then drink my herbal tea.
