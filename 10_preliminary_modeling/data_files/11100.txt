The B-W bus was on its way to our back to the B-W on Parade program. They (the bus) kept swinging back and forth. Then it gained speed and went very fast. The kids in the bus were laughing and crying. I could see my roommate in one of the windows and she was crying and crying. I knew she was unhappy, but I didn't know why. Then somebody, it was a man, sneaked out to the middle of the road and put down a big log in front of the bus. Then a train came along and hit the bus too. Kids went flying all over. I couldn't do a thing to help--couldn't stop the bus--the man--or the train. Then I couldn't find my roommate anywhere. I was very unhappy.
