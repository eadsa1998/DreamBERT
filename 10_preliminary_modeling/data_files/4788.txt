["Weird shoes."] A man is making a special pair of boots or shoes for me. He puts insoles of bright yellow material in them. I take them up a long flight of stairs to my bedroom. I am changing my clothes to go out with the man. I open the closet to find an outfit. Lots of clothes. I can't decide if I should be dressy or casual. I choose a yellow long skirt and matching top of a kind of silky material. It is tight on me, showing my plumpness. I try on the boots. One, the right side, is very tiny. The yellow insoles come out easily. The left one is very large and the top of the boot is not sewn on. The insoles also come out. I walk downstairs and feel awkward and ugly.
