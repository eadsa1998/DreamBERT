I can't remember properly, but I was driving and it was flooding everywhere because it was the end of the world. But then there were zombies. The zombies were smart and could learn. They also weren't rotting and dead, they pretty much just looked normal but with blank expression. At one point I was with some others trying to hide and escape this place. I ended up at this space station place, in space, with Mom but it wasn't actually Mom. We snuck around and took these pods to this other section of it. I can't remember what we were trying to do. But we couldn't leave to get back and they'd found us.
