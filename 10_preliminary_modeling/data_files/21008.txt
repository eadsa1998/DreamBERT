Johnnie Matuck and Peter were put into a glass-sided patrol wagon because Pete got porky. When the cop wasn't looking, he made a run for home and got away. The policeman ran the wrong way. I walked out of the union supply store in Rivertown and sat on a step and found out I was in the large display window. There was a nice girl playing with my toes. And a fellow was barefooted and he put his toes against me and wiggled them. I saw he looked like he had athlete's foot, so I pulled my foot away from him.
