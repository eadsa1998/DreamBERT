I was outside my house, at dusk, with Steve and Matt. I was wearing my boots. Also, Bill Murray was with us. we were running up and down the side of my road on that rise, like I used to do, when all of a sudden there were dogs. I remember my dog was there, and I knew the rest, but I can't remember them. Then I had a memory of something in a book (probably a hunting book) and I yelled something that made the dogs go away, but not before many bites by all of them.
