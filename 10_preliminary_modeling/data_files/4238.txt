["Three eyed mexican."] I am in a room, gathering up pictures of Hector and the other Mexican students from when they were here years ago. They are returning and I want to give them these pictures of old times. I look up and see Hector on a couch. He is happy to see me. And I him. We hug. It is OK but slightly uncomfortable and distant. I look over at several others and give them pictures as well. One of them has wire rimmed glasses, for his three eyes. It looks very strange.
