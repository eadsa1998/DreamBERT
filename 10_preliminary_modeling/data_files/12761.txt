I was at a shop and was logged onto something. Dmitri was logged on also. There were math problems. I was at the shop looking for shoes, clothes and a school bag. I forgot my phone and no-one knew I was there. A lady asked me how much a bag was. There was a cool bag there but it was a girl bag. Harlan popped up and started talking to me. I told him to get lost and that I couldn't stand "looking at his ugly head". He kept following me. He said he liked me and I was absolutely disgusted. He offered me a lift and I refused. I couldn't work out how to get out of the shop.
