I met a movie producer and he took a liking to me, so I kind of hung around him. When he was giving a fellow a tryout, I was watching him. He didn't like how the man expressed himself as an actor. So he dropped him. He was looking for another man and I was giving it a serious thought of becoming a show man or actor. I could act. I would feel as though I was in real life, what I would say or do. One day we were talking with the producer and he said, "I think you would be a good actor. I have been watching you." I didn't say yes, but was acting a little shy. The producer said, "You can take a tryout and there is no harm in that," so I agreed. I don't remember the tryout, but I was a success and I was now in a show business and an actor. On one occasion I met Bill Kruse, a fellow worker, and he was an actor also. I had a sort of whip or switch and so did Bill. I challenged him and I heard someone say to me, "You better not take him on for you will be fighting five guys." I went ahead and I lashed at him, and then I poked him in one eye. I kept on poking him in one eye and he was helpless. Later I told this to my producer friend and it amused him and he liked it. Ann was with me on my work lot. This play would last about seven years, said my producer friend. I was happy with this work.
