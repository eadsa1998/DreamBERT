 I'm at home with the family. My mom's piano student arrives, so we all have to leave. We go to the neighbors, who live kitty-corner to us, to the south of Alvin Broud's house. My sisters Heather and Ramona enter. I lag behind. I'm flossing my teeth. I wait outside the door, not wanting to go in by myself because I will feel uncomfortable. I wait for my brother Wally. He arrives and we enter together. A married couple lives there. They have two sons, who are in their late teens: young men. I have not yet met them: they seem very peaceful and friendly. I track mud on their floor. The woman tells me to wipe my feet next time, but does not say this in a harsh manner. In fact I did wipe my feet this time, but will wipe them again, and better, next time.
