 I'm in a movie theatre with my fishing pole. I've come to see my friend Marge Drummond, who is my girlfriend. Marge and my friend Esther Thurman hit on me. Esther grabs my penis. Marge, Esther, and two others abuse me. We may be in a truck. I jump out of the truck. My friend's father, who will be my math teacher, Phillip Hacker, drives his truck by. Two boys go to a movie with a man in a truck, whom I dislike. I think I must be dreaming. I fly, twisting and spinning. I have sex and nearly ejaculate. There is a tour of some sort. I am the guide. Some old men have guns. I get a gun. The guns turn out to be unloaded. They are 6-shooters. My classmates Robyn Masters and Katie James are there.
