Howard comes back. We get married again. I can't figure out why I did it. It feels wrong. Howard and I are going to the coast for our honeymoon. He says, "We'll talk." He says he's a very unhappy man, 13 unhappy marriages. First to me, then to Karen, and then to me again. He tries to commit suicide in the ocean. He comes back. He wants us to go down to the ocean and play. I say, "No, let's sit on the sand right here and talk." He keeps pulling away and wanting to go do something. I say, "Wait. I'm feeling really frustrated. This is what happened before. You won't open up. I just want to feel close. I want to feel emotion. You feel so cold and distant." Then I say, "Ya, I know. I do it too. I'm afraid, but let's try this time." He can't. I feel sad and relieved.
