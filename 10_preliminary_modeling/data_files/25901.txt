 I feel pressure on my back as I lay in bed. I know a man is there. I can't move. He laughs a wild and stringy laugh. I know I'm dreaming, and I know this is a night terror. I'm scared. I thrash about in my sleep, but my body doesn't move. I swear at the man, telling him, "Let me go, you fucker!" I'm scared. I awake and see my alarm clock with red digital letters flashing 12:00.
