I was crossing a valley (a small piece of land between two hills), and I heard a friend of mine, a young boy in my neighborhood of about the same age as myself, shouting to me from the top of one of the hills. I looked at him, and he kept on shouting my name and something else to me. I started to run very fast until I came home. I then awoke.
