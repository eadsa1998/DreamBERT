I am handed a small baby boy to take care of for a while. I try to bathe him and have lots of trouble. There are two men there. One sleeps on the right side of the couch bed thing I am using to bath the baby. The other is trying to help me by getting the water and so on. I finally get him shampooed on his head and then I see I didn't rinse off the shampoo. I hold his head under a faucet spray thing and get it cleaned off, get a blue crocheted thing on him for a diaper and only get one side pinned and then I see he's had a bowel movement. I decide not to clean him up again because it is such hard work and someone on the next shift can do it better. Now I hand him over to another woman and we are packing his things. She puts him on the arm of Uncle Lionel who sits on another couch and says he likes to be touched. So Uncle Lionel lets him lean on him. I sit on the couch at the other end, and as the baby leans back, I put my legs up on the couch to create a fence to hold him. Uncle puts his leg up also and we keep him safe. I say, "This baby sure has grown since this morning," aware that is pretty fast growth. [NOTE: ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS (AND ASSOCIATED NARRATIVE) WERE DELETED FROM THIS DREAM REPORT.]
