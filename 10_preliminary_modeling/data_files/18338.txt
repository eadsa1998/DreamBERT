The dream involves me and someone else watching some people thru a window. We're perched in some tree branches at night watching them. One scene inside is a family consisting of 3 or 4 people and 3 or 4 servants having dinner together. The servants are going to murder the family or something like that. I and the other person with me get involved in preventing this or acting as police or something. I do recall that the action was very complex here.
