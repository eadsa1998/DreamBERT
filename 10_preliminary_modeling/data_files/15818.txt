We were all given 'roles' like in Town of Salem (medium etc), but they were 'super powers'. A medium guy died and then his brain was in the computers. We were trying to get away from bad guys and were holed up in this house. I was trying to get the medium guy to help us, but he seemed reluctant. There were also bad guys trying to hack the computers. Later I ended up in this place where we were like prisoners. I got a shirt from someone which had a code on it. There was a sentence with every first letter highlighted but I could only glance at it for like a second before someone would enter the room. I could only read 'too' so far. Later I was being talked to by one of the 'leaders' and managed to read it whilst getting something from the fridge and it read 'toolshed'. I knew this was related to a prophecy regarding Sydney's mother (Alias) (who was either my 'lost' mother or someone else). I saw her run by the window of the place I was, and I just got up and ran out the back to the door of the toolshed. She said something to me and we held each other as the place exploded.
