I dreamed that I was attending soccer camp again. Hannah and Sue were there. We were all having so much fun and looking forward to the next weekend when we'd go to Hannah's house. It was then Friday and we were done with camp. We were all walking towards Hannah's car, when all the younger campers practically killed us by kicking their soccer balls at us. We loaded our bags into the car and went to Hannah's house. I remember us all showering when we got there. Then I wandered around the house into a beautiful Renaissance style living room where two people were having sex. It was really weird, so I left and then woke up.
