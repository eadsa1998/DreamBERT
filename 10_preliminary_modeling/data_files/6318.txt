I was in a subway station, but not any of the ones in Boston. I think it may have been in New York. One of my bosses from a restaurant that I work in was there. He had these two guys chasing me. They chased me all over. I fell down a large set of stairs and then got up and ran. All I can remember is that they were still behind me.
