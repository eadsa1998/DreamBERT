We had a new house, but some of it was temporary. Some had been built has rooms and had some of our stuff in it, but we stayed in this big tent thing just outside. Mom, Darren and I were working on something outside when I saw this dark grey cloud coming towards us and I said 'grab Rover and get inside' and we ran into the tent thing as it started raining. The tent was attached to the bottom with hooks and the wind and rain was lifting it up and letting the water in. I said we would drown and we had to leave. We started grabbing our things and got to the car but it had stopped raining. We didn't know if it was going to come back so didn't know whether to stay or leave.
