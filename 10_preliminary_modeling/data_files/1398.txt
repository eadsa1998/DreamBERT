The Birds are doing another show at Wow Hall. Rochelle and Lucy get mad at me because I tell them what to do. I tell Rochelle she can't play the piano now because we have to set up the lights and sound. They go to the dressing room and cry. I am angry and try to be everyone as I heroically set up the show alone. Then they come back out and are snotty. Paulina understands and says, "They expect you to lead and when you do, they refuse to follow!" I tell Rochelle to set up her synthesizer. She argues!
