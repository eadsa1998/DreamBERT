 I'm in the student union at Brimson on a Friday. I get my mail, although I've already checked it once today. I check is again because my friend Melanie McDyss is there. I have a crush on her, and am nervous about approaching her. I skirt around her, avoiding her, getting my mail, and not going to talk with her. I have a lot of mail, surprisingly. In my mail is a Jurassic Park book in a yellow on-campus envelope. I get a letter for which the return address is my former boss Mike Hollow. It seems to be a business advertisement. I open it and see it is from my dad. It's a birthday card with several condoms on the outside cover.
