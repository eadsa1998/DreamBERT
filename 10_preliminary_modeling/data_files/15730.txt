I was with Dad and he was taking me to this really posh shopping centre to meet his friend who owned the whole thing. It was very fancy and I was worried we'd get chucked out. The guy ran a clothes shop in there as well, so was in the office for that one. We went in and a black security guard stopped us and asked if we had an appointment and Dad was like 'we're friends' and we went in. The guy was Robert Downey Jr (not actually him, but he was 'played' by him). We sat down and said hello etc. Later, we caught him kissing a woman in a car. He was married as well so we were shocked and didn't know what to do. We interrupted him and the woman left. Then it was a movie and I was now a young girl who he'd been helping. He gave her a hug as his wife drove past and she assumed he was cheating on her with 'me'. I tried to tell her it was just a hug.
