[1997-06-21] Had a dream that I was fixing a lawn mower, because that's what I do, for a hobby more or less and everybody was hollering to get it fixed and get it fixed and I remember in the dream what the lawnmower looked like from feel and I was trying to get the parts in and some were going in backwards and for some reason everything was not going together right. The crummiest part was suddenly I got it started and I have no idea how and as it started things started to disappear and I couldn't find it and I was looking all over the cellar for it and I couldn't find the lawnmower.
