I enter a square room that is sort of a vacation cabin. It has been unused and neglected for years. Today I am cleaning it up. Old food, all moldy and yucky, is in cupboards and the sink and on counters. I don't relish the job but it must be done, so I dig in and start cleaning. Howard is around somewhere. [BL]
