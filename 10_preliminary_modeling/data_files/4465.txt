["Can't find the money."] I am in a bank. Someone has stolen our money. I am in a line to a teller. We are in a large basement room. Now all the customers and employees are searching all the places for hidden cash. We feel along the counter edge thing there might be a recessed hole where the money is hidden. We don't find it. I hear a man, the actor that played John Glenn in The Right Stuff, say to his friend, There's that Sanders. He is excited to make my acquaintance. He is behaving like a school teen waiting for me to pass by him so he can make conversation. I am pleased and begin walking down the hall toward him. He and his male friend are sitting on the stairs. He is grinning at me. I drop eye contact with shyness. I can feel his excitement. As we get close, I look up and smile. We begin talking.
