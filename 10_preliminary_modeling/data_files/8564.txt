I was creating an Excel spreadsheet to help Bob F and family. I had taken a spreadsheet that I had created for another purpose and was making changes to it, thinking that this was going to help their family deal with the very difficult situation they are currently trying to figure out how to work through. The weird part is that it has nothing to do with finances or anything like that. It is strictly mental and emotional.
