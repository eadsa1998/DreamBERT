I was at a gas station with my little sister. We had filled up our tank and I wanted to buy a six-pack of beer, but there was no one at the register to ring me up. I rang the bell on the counter but no one came. I decided to make a run for it and take the beer. I noticed someone had left their glasses on the counter. I looked outside and saw an old woman sitting on the curb looking lost. I figured the glasses must belong to her. I placed them by her side so she would find them, but I didn't give them to her directly because I didn't want her to witness me making off with the gas and beer. Then I saw one of my old housemates, Frank, walking through a meadow. He was the one that was supposed to be at the gas station cash register. I was called to the gas station by the owner who told me had my theft on videotape. I told him if he was going to bust someone he should bust Frank because Frank should have been there and besides Frank steals a lot, so it is likely that he has stolen from the store. The owner guy rewinded the tape and sure enough he found footage of Frank stealing. He decided to let me go. The old woman who I had left the glasses for came up to me and gave me a hug. She looked at me with knowing eyes. Then the man who owned the gas station was talking with Frank. He told Frank that he wouldn't turn him in if he would take off all his clothes and let him paint him. Frank agreed. The man was clearly very aroused by the sight of Frank's naked body and Frank didn't seem to mind at all. Then I realized that it was all a movie that I was watching on TV And I thought, "Wow, I didn't know Frank was an actor."
