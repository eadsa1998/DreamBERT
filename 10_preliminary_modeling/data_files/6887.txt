Elsie had come and we went to a neighbor's and talked with her in the kitchen. She brought out cards with messages on them. The second was from Coa. Asking for me to call them. They wanted to take us to Barber's Point. I said we'd better go home to phone and we left. We went across the street and then down but I couldn't see. Realized I had gone over with sleep shade on pushed up and felt embarrassed. Now it had slipped down and I stumbled and bumped into someone.
