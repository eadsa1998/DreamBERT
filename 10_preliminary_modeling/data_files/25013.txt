 I'm at Grandpa Redding's house, or a place that has the feeling of that house. I'm in a swimming pool with a bunch of other people. My classmate Molly Villareal is there. We are sort of playing a game in which one person goes under the water for a while. Molly goes under. People forget about her. I am swimming underwater, and I see her. She looks dead. I drag her to the surface. I yell for help. I say, "I killed Molly." Molly starts breathing after she gets CPR. This is the second person's life I've saved today. Two of my friends died. Two babies were born. I can name one of the newborns. It's Molly's child.
