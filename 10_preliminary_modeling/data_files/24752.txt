I went snowboarding with two of my friends and I was really good but really bad. I had no control, but I could do all the flips like 360 degrees. I could go upside down and land on my feet. There was this edge and I went upside down. Setting: Somewhere with snow - a ski slope. Characters: Two friends - I don't know who. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. Cool, proud.
