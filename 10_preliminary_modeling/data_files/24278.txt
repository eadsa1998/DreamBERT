I was in an office-like setting. I worked for a real estate agency like Paul Rudd in I Love You Man, the movie. There was an old, supposedly empty office building in the same complex as the functioning offices. I had gone in repeatedly, because my world had been merged with one where instant travel, dream-like strange states and weird stuff, like alternate dimensions, were the reality. I asked my boss for the task of the day. She said to go follow up on some accounts, close a deal, something like that. I had a couple numbers. I thought this should be easy. Then I went out to do this. But I needed to go inside the abandoned warehouse, which existed in its own bubble of reality. It was completely flooded at one point. The drain goes down and away to some other place in time. I didn't want to go in alone because I knew the host of that dimension, a rather scary woman who seemed like she held resentments. It was dank, old and musty like a back room of a bar I know. I'd gone in a little earlier to retrieve some of the things I'd left behind and got that very eerie vibe. Other scenes in this dream took me to an auditorium; felt like a large one on a college campus. People who I knew were there, and I think they were in on the alternate reality, but they all soon disappeared.
