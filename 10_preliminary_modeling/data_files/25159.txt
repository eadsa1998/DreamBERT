 I'm playing paintball in a field with my friends Stephen Ramos, Hank Anderson, and Norman Noman. It is winter, and snow is on the ground. I have a paintball gun with orange paintballs. The paintballs aren't round, but rather have a flat side that must be put into the gun correctly. My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles and my friend Emerald Reinhold are there.
