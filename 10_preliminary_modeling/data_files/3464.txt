I make a joke to a woman that I really did a good job with turning on the radio program, when it is a totally automatic job at the radio station. I am in a huge warehouse kind of building. I walk away from her to go to my "room." I turn back around and notice that the van, which I thought I had parked near a wall, had been moved over to another position, AND the vandals had taken off a wheel, stripped off hub cabs and mirrors and so on, which are laying on the "ground"/floor. A spray of water is spurting up from a rupture in the "ground/floor" like a pipe had been broken in the violent dismemberment of my van. I wonder if I should leave there. Maybe I'm in danger.
