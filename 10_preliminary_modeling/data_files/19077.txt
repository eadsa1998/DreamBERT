I was shown a diamond ring by someone, I believe by my girlfriend's father, who happens to be a jeweler. I thought it was fairly attractive at the time and I showed it to my girlfriend who said no, that she thought it was rather small and cheap. I kind of agreed with her. I think the price on it was about $175 and we had planned to spend about $300 for a ring. Then later on her father, or whoever it was that was selling the ring, showed it to some other man, an old man I've never seen before. He said immediately yes, he would like to buy it. So I was thinking, gee, what a fool that he wants to buy that dinky ring. In fact, he offered my girlfriend's father about $300 or $350 for the ring, which again I thought was very foolish. But then he said, "Well, look at this ring. It's beautiful." I looked at it and it had at least three very large, beautifully formed diamonds and many small ones. Even the small ones were at least a quarter of a karat large. So I remember thinking at the time that gee, we missed a very good buy. I was rather disappointed. That was about the only emotion in the dream, slight, not great, but slight disappointment at the end. The setting was kind of nonexistent. I don't remember setting at all really. Of course, the characters I knew, my girlfriend and her father. I didn't know the man at all.
