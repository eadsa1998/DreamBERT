Our house was different and joined with the neighbours. There was a door between them. I'm not sure of the whole story, but I had a boyfriend and he somehow got stabbed. I rushed to drive him to the hospital because it was peak hour and I couldn't call an ambulance. I was on the freeway. I kept yelling at him and hitting him to keep him awake. I think he died. Then it changed to a guy in a wheelchair who got stabbed. He was a quadriplegic and his mother drove him to the hospital. They saved him and they did something to his foot and he felt it and he could use his arms. The doctors were shocked. Then Rover ran off and we went looking for him. People speared him and he died. Sometimes what had happened was Mom had accidentally stabbed him with some glass. I was really depressed about it and crying all the time. I woke up (within the dream) crying, and had a dream he was alive and woke up crying again. People were over and didn't seem to care. Mom was on the lounge and she said that I was crying out 'fat puppy' in my sleep. I collapsed on the floor, face down, bawling and saying that I hate waking up. A retarded guy was over and asked me to make him a sandwich and I told him to make it himself.
