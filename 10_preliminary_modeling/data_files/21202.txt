I was in the city and I could smell the smoke and see it. We lived there again. I was sitting on the ground and I moved over and touched some shit that was near with my hand. Boy did it stink. I got some of it on my hand. I looked out the window and I noticed a house that was burned, was on fire again. I gave a child a broken bottle. I touched the sharp edges, then took away the piece I gave her for fear she would cut herself.
