We had created a defense robot that was so good I couldn't protect myself from it. I am shooting laser beams at it and the beams ricochet off his head and around the room. I duck and barely avoid being killed. I figure out its weakest spot behind him shooting at his spine down its pants. I fire and kill it. I am relieved.
