There are a man and a woman and me. The man and I kiss. It is very nice. He says, "You must kiss her now." He pushes me. I resist and give an "air" kiss very close to her mouth. He says, "Am I pushing too much?" She says, "Yes, let it be." When I kiss the man, I want to hug him too, but don't. Something holds me back. He's a writer, the creative part.
