 I am on the next block where my neighbor, Mary Robbins, is using a Tiller to work her flower garden. There are tulips planted. She is tending her tulips, and those of our neighbors, the Smiths. I say something to Mary about feeing the tulips. I pick her tulips, or those of the Smiths. Mary gets angry with me. She wants to call the police if I pick any more tulips. I say to her something along the lines of "What's the point in calling the police if you don't feed them (the tulips)?" She threatens to call the police. I sarcastically say to her, "Have a nice day." <br/
