We were in Florida. I was on the beach. There was sand all over. There were battles on the beach, shooting at one another. We hid behind a wall and the other guys were shooting holes in the wall. I went on the shore and I put my feet into the ocean water and said, "Now I can say I was in the ocean water." Then I had a feeling. I took a dive deep and then started to swim for the top. I was going fast and was holding my breath. I saw the rattlers of a big rattle snake in a pool of water. I got a stick and I saw the big rattler's head sticking out of a hole. I started hitting away at his head. He moved slowly and his head pulled into the hole, but the stick was bent and pointed, so I kept on hitting him with the point. Later I saw him again and he was supposed to be a pet. I came close to him and he didn't go for me. I went into one of the buildings on the beach and the windows were closed and there was air conditioning. I said, "That's nice when it is too hot." Then I was in Florida again. I was flying and Otto was so tall, he must have been about 20 ft. tall. He reached me before I could fly higher. I looked in the paper and I saw Flying wave. I am not quite sure it was wave. It was in the last race 1 p.p. I said it was at Tropical Park and I said, "I can go to the track and play it." I had a woman in the house. I was going to intimate her. I had a hard-on. I called her into the next room and was going to do it to her just as someone knocked on the door and my sister Mary walked in.
