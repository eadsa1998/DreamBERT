I was an Indian on a reservation but it was also a ski resort. All day we went up and down the mountain. There was a border which was marking white man's land. There was a bathroom right across it. I really had to go so I did. Because I trespassed I started this whole war, and the whites started invading and attacking us. It was cold, and I managed to get a fire started to keep warm, and all the Indians were huddled around it while the whites moved closer and closer in on us. Setting: At an Indian reservation which was a ski resort. Characters: I don't think I knew any of the other people there, but I wasn't lonely or anything, that's just the way it is. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. Maybe I dreamed about Indians because we are studying the Battle of Wounded Knee, and we are reading a book about reservations.
