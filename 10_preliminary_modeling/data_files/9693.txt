Garbage can: someone is trying to take ours away; later at Church: many visits from other Orthodox Church; I am relaxed waiting for service to start; go back to sacristy; big crowd; Father Andrew tells me in a whisper: "Did you know that Ruth (sister of Karina Palmer) and my mother's 9th cousin got involved?" I am very puzzled, but elated that he should tell me this gossip.
