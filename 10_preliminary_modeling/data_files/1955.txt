I am seated on a stairway thing like you can roll out to an airplane. Suddenly it starts to move. It rolls into a room and it starts dancing with the projected image of Alister Cooke. After the dance I smile and point to his retreating figure and say, "I know I danced with you." I go into another room. I'm standing now. A fat girl is looking over at a fat boy. They are making eyes at each other shyly. So I open some object to attract the guy over for her so he'll have an excuse to come talk to her. He comes over and they walk off together. Some man calls to me and wants some glue. I see a bottle and throw it over to him. It's old and sticks badly as it lands on a wall near him. He is angry and asks for fresher glue. I throw another one. It's not good either. He's very angry and comes at me. I must kick his balls and hit his face to protect myself.
