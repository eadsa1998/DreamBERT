Last night I had a dream about cigarettes. In reality, I recently gave up the habit of smoking. In the dream I saw people who I have never seen with a cigarette lighting two or three at  time! I recall that I was at work participating in some kind of activity, when all of a sudden I saw my manager with a cigarette butt in his mouth. The look on his face was kind of strange because he looked like he was mocking me. As I walked past my manager, I saw one of my work buddies with a cigarette in his hand. He was calling me over to do something, but his words were jumbled. All I could see was the smoke coming from the butt. I felt worried during the dream.
