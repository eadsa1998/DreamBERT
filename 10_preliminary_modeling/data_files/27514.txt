I was walking along the street with some other people, all about my age, when we started discussing Carl Becker and his writings. I said that I didn't care for his history book at all and that I thought history was boring. Everybody disagreed with me. It seemed as if we walked for quite a long time still discussing Mr. Becker and his history book. I remember saying that I enjoyed casebooks much better.
