I was at school and we were getting ready for graduation photos. I was in this room that I'd never seen before and it had 'steps' with chairs on them. I saw Tiana there. Everyone was sitting in different groups and I was by myself. Tiana's group was called out first and I followed since I was nearby. I sat next to her and she wanted Eliska to sit there, but she didn't tell me to move. I thought Eliska was Alessandra at first. Daryl was in the same group. I saw Eugene and did a reality check but it didn't work.
