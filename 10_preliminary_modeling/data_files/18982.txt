In this dream I was like a t a Marine Corps Reserve. Everybody was outside in this field and they seemed to be jumping around, just jumping around. And then I went from there to this office where there is this sergeant who I know out there, and he started using some, got out some hair cream and started combing my hair for me. In this place where I'm getting my hair combed there is also a line of other guys in there, I presume waiting to get their hair combed too. The sergeant who had this hair cream when he was working with it, a big blob of it fell down on my pants legs and one of the guys in the line thought this was real funny and made a joke about this.
