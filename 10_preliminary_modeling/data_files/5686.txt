[1997-07-07] A very long time friend, Jack, had picked me up at point A and gave me a ride to point B, but point B was not home it was someone else's home. But then Jack left and this person was a stranger to me. Seemed like a young man, I didn't feel awfully uncomfortable because I didn't feel afraid, he seemed to be very welcoming to both my son and I. But I was confused. I didn't know why I was there. I didn't know why Jack hadn't just brought me home. That was it.
