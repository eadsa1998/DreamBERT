Mom disappeared for 2 weeks. Then she was in the driveway at home. Ezra and Dad were there too. There was a movie which was done with clay animation. There was a guy poking a black blanket? I thought I recognized the movie. There was something about Graham Masterton. These people had lights in their mouth. Everyone had one. Samantha and Rebekah were around too.
