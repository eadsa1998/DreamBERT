I am my hometown and must walk home. An older man contacts me and wants to walk too. He says he is lonely. I am suspicious but agree. Somewhere along the way his wife shows up. We get to my mother's house and she is taking care of my kids but she is still in bed which is in the bathroom. The kitchen is isolated from the rest of the house. The man, woman and I are talking in the kitchen and I realize he has disappeared. I suspect he is going through the rest of the house. I ask the woman where her husband is and she says she doesn't know. I go looking. My mother and the kids are still sleeping in the bathroom. She is upset with the kids and me and says she thought I was going to get an apartment. I say I am but haven't found one. The truth is I can't afford one. My son says he wants to put his bed in the bathroom. My daughter is crying. I am trying to get away to find the man and don't want to tell my mother he is in the house. We are arguing. I get away. I think the man is upstairs. My mother comes out and catches the woman going through her purse. They get into a fight. My mother is sitting on a chair and the woman is standing in front of her and I either feel my mother is going to bite this woman's breast or I see her do it. I feel a sense of danger. Still I don't know where the man is. I suspect he is in the attic. I try to call the police but 911 doesn't work. I need a police number from my town, even though I am in my hometown, and I must look it up but I am having trouble finding it.
