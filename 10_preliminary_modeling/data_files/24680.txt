The first thing I saw was my friends sitting somewhere talking. Next they started to talk to a man behind the counter. When I saw this it worried me a little. I'm not sure what happened next because this is where the dream went away. Setting: At the counter of a bar. Characters: There were three of my friends in the dream (whom I know), plus a lot of people in the background. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, worried. At first I was happy when I saw my friends in my dream, but then I got scared and worried when I saw that they were in a bar.
