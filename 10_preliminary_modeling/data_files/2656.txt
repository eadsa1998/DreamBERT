I am seated at the very back of a huge theatre area, with steeply raked stairs. A woman sits behind me. Two ugly, big men in business suits sit next to me, crowding me. I hear my name being called from the stage and I get up and try to run down all those stairs; apparently I'm getting some kind of award. I get there and I'm given a prosthesis leg for my right leg and then I am challenged to get into a huge diesel truck and drive around the audience. I get in, not sure if I can do this. I struggle and get the hang of it and drive well up those stairs, around and through the audience and back down. I choose to return to the stage via a path that is barely underwater. The audience is impressed with my daring and skill. I am back on stage. They tell me I have to drive the truck again and I say no, I don't want to. Then they say, "Give us back the prosthetic leg." Then there is more, about a woman who has her exhusband still around and a new man is moving in.
