I was in a city that I didn't recognize and I am with a group of people. I think the group was professional psychologists, but a friend of mine was in the group and it seemed wrong for him to be there. Then the scene changed, and I was in a street and I saw a car that came out of nowhere. I heard screams and I saw a man on the ground in a pool of blood. I saw two people in the car and the one who was driving happened to be a good friend of mine. He was acting like he was drunk and didn't realize what he was doing. Then the scene switched and we watched a person bleeding in a kitchen. I put water onto a handkerchief to stop the blood. I remember arguing with a young girl who wanted to come and see the victim. We said no because we didn't think she could handle it. Then somehow the girl gets outside to see the accident scene and there is no more body. We then started to clean up the blood and a police car that has been wrecked comes out of nowhere to survey the scene. I try to get out of the path of the police car. The car stops and my friend gets out of the car, and the police officer comes running up and arrests him. I am standing there in disbelief.
