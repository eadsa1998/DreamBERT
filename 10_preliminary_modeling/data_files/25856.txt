 I'm in a car waiting for my mom to arrive in her car. I ask a man to awaken me when she gets here. Just as I am going to lay down my mom arrives. I see her and sit up. The man comes to awaken me. I know the man from working at Fishing Haven: he is a customer who was a member of a party whose 17' lightweight canoe leaked when they were out on their trip. He is smoking. I am in a group of people. Everyone seems to have an area of interest or specialty. There is another person in the group who is a dream enthusiast, besides me.
