A guy I'm with behaving as if I'm "pursuing" him, when I just like having his company. We're riding in a car first, I think, then walking down a hall/mall, and he says he's going a different way but he doesn't get very far before we're both interested in some person or thing on the way. He's a nice guy but reluctant to invest himself.
