 I'm at my friend Kevin Simpson's house. I seem to be alone, and am staying there for a length of time: at least overnight. I go out to the garage. I'm standing on a stepladder going up to the rafters. I find a long pole in the rafters, and I suck it like I was giving fellatio. I think I would be good at fellatio. I see a broom with a wooden handle. The handle is a good width for a phallic object, for anal stimulation. The handle has a ball at the end of it, carved into the wood. I take it and start back to the house. I notice Kevin's father Dilbert's vehicle is there. As I get to the deck I see Dilbert in his old bedroom, though the window. He seems very happy to see me. He comes to the door as I enter. I think he knows I was staying here. We greet each other. Kevin is there. I go back towards the old spare bedroom. Dilbert and Kevin are involved in some sort of ritual. I see Halloween cards in front of them. I can't tell whether this is a game of if it has real meaning for them, as in a religious ritual.
