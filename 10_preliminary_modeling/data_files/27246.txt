I argued with my brother. We were in my room. He threw me to the floor &amp; began dragging me around. I remembered being afraid of getting floor burns. When I came near to my dressing table I pulled at the skirt of it until the thumbtacks fell out. I gathered a handful of the tacks and when my brother approached again I threw them directly at his face. I saw his face vividly. He was wearing his glasses.
