I was standing in front of a mirror contemplating my physical appearance. I had few clothes on. I was frustrated with being stuck for so long with my weight loss goal. I've read and been told that I need to love my body as it is. The theory is that alone will help me get unstuck. if I can embrace and love my body as it is. I was thinking that I really didn't look that bad, though I certainly feel better about the way I look WITH clothes on. But as I stand there I noticed my upper legs, and decided that this was the thing I was most unhappy with. I was surprised that I had never noticed this before. They looked very different in the dream though, than they do in waking life. I started thinking about what I would need to do, or could do, to improve the physical condition and look of my upper legs. Obviously my morning routine of walking isn't doing it. I decided that in the meantime I would help myself to feel better about my legs by focusing on the way they look in a dress or in a pair of slacks. because I nor others can see this part of my legs then.
