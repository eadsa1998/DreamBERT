I am in Charla's kindergarten class. the teacher is looking around, and so am I, at the mess created by the children; things flung all over. Two bunny rabbits are hopping around underfoot. She asks the children to help clean up the mess and they aren't very interested. She starts to pick up things and gets the kids into their seats. I see some things still on the floor under the desks and get down and gather up plastic forks and straws. I arrange them on the side counter and then I am now putting silver forks in one dish, and spoons in another, and knives. Some are still wet from being washed. I put the odd-shaped serving utensils in a nice pattern and arrange a couple of pretty glass dishes in the center. Then, as the teacher is doing the lesson for the kids, I go to the back of the room and start arranging my stuff. I decide to take my things back to my room -- Evangeline hats, pretty sparkly jewelry. The teacher joins me as I am straightening things up and talks to me. I figure she gets lonely with only kids to talk to and lessons to do. She starts helping me put things on the dresser. This isn't what I wanted to do, but I let her. I have an owl and a pussy cat (two stuffed animals) and I point out that these three particular hats are Evangeline hats. Charla comes up just as I am pulling out a crumpled old Mexican straw hat out from behind the dresser. She starts pulling at it and wanting to take it and play. I say, "No, this isn't the time for that." She needs to be doing her lessons. She finally agrees and leaves me. The teacher is talking non-stop and I notice her nice teeth. She says, "We should do some of the lessons outside, it's so nice. Maybe you could a lesson on disability." I realize I have become like a mother's helper, teacher's aide for the class and wonder if that's what I want to do.
