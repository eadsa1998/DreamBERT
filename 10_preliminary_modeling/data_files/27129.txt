I had a date with a boy that I used to date about a year and a half ago. I did not want to be with him because I was afraid the boy I am pinned to would see me. We were driving along the road on the way to a dance. When we finally arrived, a girl whom this boy had been dating recently was standing outside waiting for him. I was very relieved. We did not go into the dance but got back into the car again. The other girl sat in the middle. I was impressed by the wierd atmosphere. It was very windy and misty.
