About being in the office. Some Asian-Americans visiting there. being in the shack (police bureau) that doubles as a bedroom. I fall asleep when I'm supposed to be on the job. I get dressed wearing shorts. Javier (co-worker) comes in as I had just gotten ready. Checking my voicemails. Jake (a friend who lives in another state) leaves me a rambling nonsense message. There are conference rooms. Supposed to be covering something at a park but the event is scrubbed because they are afraid of graffiti -- what's the point then of the event if they are afraid? a trash boat throwing away pumpkins into the grinder. flames come out. molten metal shoots out to where I was standing behind a pole. fire hose.
