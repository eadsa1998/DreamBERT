I am in a room where a woman is standing facing us and we are seated, like school. She is giving us instructions on how to properly take this test. This has something to do with the elections because I can hear a voice droning on about the elections. I am not really paying attention. I don't think I planned on actually doing the test. At the last minute I decide to do it, so I look carefully at the paper on my desk and look up to see the example. There are two parts. One of the parts is called "Checker." I must compare patterns and choose from #1 or #2. #1 is red and #2 is orange. I have to describe how they are in relationship to each other. I use the &lt; and &gt; signs to say orange has less intensity than red. I then see a drop of lotion. I try to wipe it away. It is bigger now and I keep wiping at it and it keeps getting bigger and bigger. A big messy drippy puddle of lotion now all over my cat Bootsie. The cat looks emaciated very lean and skinny, naked of fur with enormous yellow eyes, the black pupils dilated and huge. I hold her over the waste basket to let the lotion mess drip off her. Finally I get it all in the waste basket.
