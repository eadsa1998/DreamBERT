I was at Nana's. Someone had a baby. I went to bed. Ezra was in my bed there and I didn't remember him coming up. The beds were different. He woke up and said that Mom had dropped him off. The next morning we were packing our stuff away (we had a lot) and the bag was heavy. Ezra had a made-up friend called Brendan and he was dropped off to stay, but he was three years younger than he was last time we saw him. Dad was annoyed. There was this house which was on a car or something; it moved around.
