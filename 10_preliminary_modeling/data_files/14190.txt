I was watching Lost. Charlie had met Jack ages ago and he had almost made him give up drugs. Someone secretly saw some guy. A lighter had no gas, but there was still a flame. Someone told Locke to watch out for some guy. I watched a trailer for Twilight, which showed Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. I told Darren it had a 4.5/5 rating on Flixster which was really lame, because it sucked. In True Blood, Sookie was in a chicken suit and her feet were on an angle and she couldn't work.
