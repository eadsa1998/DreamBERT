A man, sort of like Doug, has bet $2,000 he can find the golden key. He cannot afford to lose this bet. Someone places the key near the left front wheel of my chair. I get up and stand nearby watching. He looks all around and isn't finding the key. I try to give him hints. I clear my throat and look at the key significantly. No dice. I start talking about my chair very loudly, and about my left front wheel, but he just doesn't get it. I feel sorry for him. It will matter to him to lose all that money. He can ill afford to lose, but he can't seem to find what's right out there in the open, even when hinted at with clues.
