I had gone to visit my father. On the way I passed by a narrow street and suddenly I found that my father appeared out of I don't know where, but anyway, he started to talk to me about his present financial situation. He said he would have to leave his job, his business, because I did not give him any money and, besides this, a series of bills to be paid appeared from everywhere. Then he suggested that I should do the same thing he would do after leaving his business, i.e., look for another job. I answered him that I had already thought of that and had applied for a part-time job. They would give me the answer within two weeks. I do not remember well what followed this dream, but I believe that the dream was a product of a conversation my brother and I had on the previous night. He told me that my father had written him a letter saying that he would not be able to send us our money allowance because his business was not making any money, and that, therefore, my brother should assume all the financial responsibility for our home. While my brother and I were talking about this, I kept thinking that I would have to get a job to help in some way. As can be observed, my dream was nothing but a product of the impression that my conversation with my brother had on me.
