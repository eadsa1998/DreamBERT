I am the director of a film. I am filled with the enormity of how important each decision is, and I have to make each decision frame by frame. Millions of dollars ride on it. I look into the camera viewfinder and give direction. We are filming a getaway down a very big and steep mountain. I am getting different angles. Now I take time out to look at photos of the shoot. People keep coming up and asking me questions. I tell them to give a few minutes of my own to enjoy these photos, pictures of a crevasse in the mountain and so on. One woman says "Oh, the plastics" meaning the photos. I have trouble getting a few moments to myself.
