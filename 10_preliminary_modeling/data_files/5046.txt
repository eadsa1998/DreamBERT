Rochelle tells me she's glad I've changed. She was getting to where she hated it when I'd talk long and lengthy, using phrases like "whereas" and other bureaucratic terms. I agree and ask her to do me a favor. I say when I slip back into my long-winded style, would she lean over and whisper, "You're doing it again." Then I can continue to do better. [BL]
