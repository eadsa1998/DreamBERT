A boat ride is happening and I don't really want to do it, but go ahead anyway. It costs $3.00 sand I have to walk down lots of stairs. I'm to take three little girls with me and they won't mind! They run away and play on merry-go-rounds and I angrily yell at them, "Come here right now." I am embarrassed to hear the harsh anger in my voice and I'm very annoyed at them for not minding. They dawdle along and we go down lots of steps and come to a crossroads. I don't know which way to go. I see Ellie seated dejectedly on a step. She says, "It's too late anyway. The boat already left." I'm very angry now, wasting $3.00 and tired from unnecessary walking.
