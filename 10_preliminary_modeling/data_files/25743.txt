 I'm in a small town high school like Barden High School. There are signs up saying half the hallway is closed down for the basketball players. Other hallways say half is closed down for the wrestlers. I like this. I think this is neat. I walk through the hallways. There are small signs outside some doors that have the names of one of the five starting basketball players on them. I see the names for four of the starters near different doors as I walk. They are good players: they score many points. I am looking for Ernest Jones, who is scoring 31 points per game. I somehow see Ernest. I see he is abusive towards his father for breaking a radio. Ernest is a jerk, a bastard. He is white trash. Ernest is a black young man wearing a wife beater. I see him looking washed up with a broom or a newspaper.
