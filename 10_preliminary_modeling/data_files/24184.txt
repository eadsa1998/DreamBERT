I was dreaming of returning to school for spring quarter. For some reason the entire class was floating in rafts and boats in a river down a stream like the school was the rocky steep cliffs on either side. I was trying to get down to the river but couldn't find a spot that was accessible, all the sides were to steep. I remember someone close to me died and I was trying to find a friend to tell them but no one could  understand what I was saying.
