I, as my maiden aunt (51), was standing in the front yard of my home in the country. I was not myself, but my aunt. A car drove by in which were my sister (my mother, my aunt's sister) and her husband. I did not determine whether her son and daughter (I) were in the car. I felt very sad that I had no husband while she did. I envied her. Immediately, I changed back to myself (f, 20), although the setting remained the same. I got in my car and followed that of my parents. There were several cars between us. My parents and the cars following approached a curve on an upgrade. The right side had no protection from a considerable drop-off except the guard rail. My parents' car was first in line. Upon executing the curve they came upon a piece of heavy road construction machinery traveling slowly ahead of them. They could not have seen it until rounding the curve. I saw them swerve to avoid it and, in doing so, they went through the guard rail and over the bank. The line of cars halted. I rushed from my car, over the bank to them. My father (wearing a blue shirt) was slumped over a piece of the car, his back toward me and motionless. Farther on, my mother, wearing a red and white figured dress, was brushing off herself. My young brother (11) sat farther on and wore a bright red shirt. I awoke.
