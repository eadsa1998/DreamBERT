I am in a very nice house and my father has put me and a little boy in a closet for punishment. The "father", however, is not really my Dad. He is just a man I am thinking is my father in the dream. I am crying "Oh Daddy!" The closet has glass doors that look like smoked glass and wood or painted cross sections. I can see my father but he is ignoring us. It is hot and stuffy in the closet.
