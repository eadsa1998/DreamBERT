First, I remember wanting to dress up as a girl for some reason. I was putting on makeup, and eyeshadow and some weird stuff in my hair and I was actually starting to look like a girl. I think I actually was, after looking in the mirror. Then I remember this guy smoking a cigarette in my house (my mother's friend), getting really mad at my mother for letting him smoke in the house, and then he started singing in French- incomprehensible French- I only recognized "voulez" something, and even that barely. Then I remember some other guy I don't know is doing the same thing (trying to look like a girl), and we were walking to the beach where the tide was very high.
