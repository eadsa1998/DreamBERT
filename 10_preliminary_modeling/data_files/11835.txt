We had these tapes of The Young Ones and how they were now and they were old and stuff. I also had tapes of other The Young Ones episodes, they were the same episodes but they did it differently (like Bottom Live, everyone would see a different one). Also there was a fake The Young Ones show and they were playing in a pool. I was doing a skateboard thing. There was some freaky test with a lion?
