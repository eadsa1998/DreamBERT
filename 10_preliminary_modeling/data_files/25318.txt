 I'm with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We are walking down the alley behind my house to SuperAmerica. I start to kiss her, so we slow our walk and kiss. I lead her over to the space between my neighbor Greg Olson's house and the house adjacent his. We lie down and kiss and touch each other. She tells me to stop, pulling my hand away. I think I am moving too fast. She pulls out a piece of toilet paper from her underwear and says she might be having her period. She runs back to my house. I can see that my mom is out in the garden. I continue walking to SuperAmerica. It is dark out. I run down the alley. Near the Knife's house I run through two fat ladies, who may be Hispanic. Further on, there is a nice lawn that is decorated for a party. Most of the guests have left but a few are there. I run through the lawn. The host is demonstrating something about how much two fat ladies have eaten. It is not very much. There are some tomatoes and other foods that have been set out to ripen on one side.
