 I'm at a gas station filling up my truck with gas. I don't have any money to pay, so I go home and get some, riding my old red Huffy bike back to the gas station. I pay for the gas and get a scratch lottery ticket with the extra dollar. It doesn't win. I get five more. None are winners. I get another, and it's a Q-Bert scratch ticket. I get five white Q-Berts with black glasses on and win $10,000. I wonder if that is my big winning. I think not, I am going to win more sometime. When I get out of the gas station, my truck is gone. The trailer part of the truck is by Curtis' house in Oak Valley. I have a man go get it, driving the cab of a semi.
