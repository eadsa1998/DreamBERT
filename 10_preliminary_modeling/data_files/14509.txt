This guy had a dream book that started in the 1930's, though he wasn't that old. A bird was in the book and had stayed in a nest in there for a long time. Darren took it out and then I realized and he put it back in. It then got out on its own and I told the guy. He came to look and it was gone. We then found it out the back of home. It was now a kitten and it fell in the pool. I dropped my iPod and jumped in. At The End had been playing, but now it was loud. I grabbed the kitten and tried to bring it to the surface, but I fell forward and so did the kitten. Then there was another kitten so I grabbed that one too and put them both on the ground. I realized my iPod speakers were in the water and was making a fizzle noise. I told Mom we needed to get new ones. We went to the shop with $50. We got two eggs for something (it was medicine). They had the old dream books I used to use, so I got seven of them.
