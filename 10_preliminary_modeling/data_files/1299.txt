I'm angry at Lisa. She tells my brother Dwight to drive her to school. I tell her to wait and I'll take her to school. She ignores me and goes. My "step-mother" keeps spraying me with perfume. I am annoyed and I tell her to quit it! I tell her that I am what I am and I won't change. I dress casually and act informal. I'm still trying to get ready for school. Jake keeps squirting water at me. I'm annoyed at everyone.
