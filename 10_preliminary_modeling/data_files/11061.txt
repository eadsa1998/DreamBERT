I was walking down a long road with odd-shaped trees alongside. I kept looking for a house and trying to locate a person to find where I was. All I could see were strange-looking animals running across the road and disappearing behind the trees. Then up ahead of me I saw a large dinosaur coming for me. It looked like it was at least 75 feet tall. I was frightened and started running. I threw sticks and large rocks, but it didn't stop. It kept making funny sounds and knocking down trees as it walked. I ran until I came to a cliff and jumped over. I could feel myself falling and this woke me up.
