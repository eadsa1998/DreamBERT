I was put on two jobs on the same day. One in Rivervale with Hector and one at Brookland High School with Esther. I went to the school in the morning and then wondered when I was supposed to be at Rivervale. I noticed I had a new job booking with just the Rivervale job, but wasn't sure if it was correct. Esther said she would have a look at the job sheet, but for some reason it was locked and she couldn't access it. The school was different and we were set up in the 'office', which was next to the canteen. I remembered it was school holidays and there wouldn't be any students. Esther and everyone else disappeared and I was wandering around waiting. I got a muffin from the canteen and started eating it, then wasn't sure if the guy had given it to me for free or not, so I asked how much it was and gave him the money. Esther returned and said the job had been cancelled because of some issues with the file.
