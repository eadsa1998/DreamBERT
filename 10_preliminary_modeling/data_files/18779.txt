The dream that I had on the morning of the 4th which I just recalled now involved a friend of mine, which is a boy, and I and this girl that I've seen around, but I don't recall her name. The time was at night. We were in a small car, I think it was a convertible, and we were going hunting on a hunting range or a shooting range. I don't remember which. So we were driving down this old dirt road. There was sugar cane on both sides. The story was that we had never been in this place. That an old lady owned this shooting range. We were driving through it, and we parked the car and we heard some shooting, and people were shooting directly over our heads because we were between the firing line and the target. So we turned the car around and we went back and this old dirt, we found ourselves between a high hedge on the left and tall stacks of sugar cane on the right. On the left behind this hedge was a horserace track like Gulfstream Park. The race was in session and there was all kinds of people and noise, cars but on the right hand side of the road. It was complete wilderness, far from civilization. So we went down this road and we came upon another shooting range. We heard that the price to shoot was $10, but we thought that that was a fantastic price. My friend told me that the price to shoot was $10, but I didn't believe him, so we all got out of the car, and we started to shoot with all the rest of the people. This old woman was behind us and she was yelling at us and she said it costs $20 to shoot one round. With this woman was a nun. The nun was dressed in black and white and she didn't say anything. She was just standing with this old woman. When we found out it was $20 to shoot that was the end of the dream. The colors that I remember are black, white, green and brown. This dream doesn't seem to be too realistic.
