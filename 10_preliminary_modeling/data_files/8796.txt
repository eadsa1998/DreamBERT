I had twin boys. Darren and I decide to separate. It turns out that he already had three other women in mind to replace me. He had been discussing them with his parents and his sisters to get their opinions on which one to choose. I found this out when Ray and Kay H came to see us. They weren't being very nice to me. I asked Kay H why she has never liked me. If she answered me I didn't hear it. They had brought a bunch of food with them. It was in several different containers. I thought it was odd what they had put together in some of the containers. One of the containers had something like chocolate brownies and deviled eggs. I like both so I ate one of the eggs so I could get to the brownies. I was very surprised, and yet not, when they told me which of the other women they had decided on. I was just so glad to be done with him.
