I was at a school. A guy and I hid in a closet in a bedroom. There was a monster and it opened the door and sniffed -- its sense of smell wasn't great, but it had good hearing. It left and it went into a classroom and killed everyone within seconds. I hid behind a bench but it saw me. It was right in front of me, but killed this other girl and then left. When I left the room everyone else was alive. It was then the end of the 'movie' and supposedly only virgins could see it and it left them alone. It was black and scary looking [possibly influenced by Ten O'Clock People].
