I dreamed I was being multiply awakened by my uncle. Uncle Paul -- he owns a body shop downtown. He was concerned because I was so tired, and I said it didn't matter. It didn't bother me particularly. When I left there, I saw my aunt and my other uncle (I have two uncles), and we were discussing finances about school. I was telling her I was getting along pretty well. She was saying that was very good because this was the year that her son got school clothes or something and that my uncle couldn't help me this year anyway. She's a little funny that way, I guess. Hall: Sam felt he was wired up in a peculiar manner, that the wire ran from his big toe to a push button which he held in his hand.
