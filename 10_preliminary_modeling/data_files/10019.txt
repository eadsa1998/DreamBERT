I am at a friend's house and look out of the window: see a red airplane make a loop-the-loop and graze the trees; then another airplane crashes in the yard next door; I am relieved and scared. I get impatient and urge my friend to get out of the house. I finally get home and entertain our Prayer Group; but there is NOT ENOUGH FOOD, but somehow I "make do" (vague ending)
