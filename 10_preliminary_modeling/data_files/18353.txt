I was sleeping in a bedroom in some house, or perhaps just lying in bed, and there was a big crash from upstairs in the attic. So I told the people -- I think that might be my wife -- that I was going to go upstairs to investigate, and if I didn't come back in five minutes, to call the police because it must have been a burglar and he got me. So then I went up the attic stairs, turned on the lights and looked around, and finally decided that some boxes had slipped and fallen, just by themselves. Then I think I went back downstairs and back to bed.
