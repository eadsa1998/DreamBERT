There were four deaths. Two female children, one male child, and one female adult. There was some kind of military accident. It was civilians that got killed. I see these planes crash and I could see them underwater. It was as though I was looking through a glass tank. I could see all the planes nosedive down and hit the bottom of the ocean. The men got out and were all dressed in white uniforms, that looked like astronaut uniforms. They grabbed a pull-cord and something inflated and pulled them to the surface of the water. Shortly after that, I was at the funeral for these four people. It was as if I was having the dream of the mother of these four children. I was dreaming inside a dream that I was cleaning up the faces of these children. I had to sew up the boy's face, right down the middle of his chin and down around his chin. Then he was good as new and came back to life. I did the same thing with one of the girls.
