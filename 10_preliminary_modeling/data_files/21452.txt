My granddaughter was only about 4 days old and she got into an airplane and flew it, then crashed and didn't get hurt. She became  wise. She talked and said in front of her mother that she loved Grandpa more than anyone else. We were very friendly and I loved her. There was a reporter came over and wanted to get the story from me to put into the paper.
