I dreamt of waking up to find myself with tattoos.  On the side of my right calf, I had one that read, "BEAST" in large, abstract, decorative letters.  On my left ankle by the heel was a portion of another tattoo looping around to where I could not see on the outside of my calf.  From what I could make out, it was the crocodile from Peter Pan.
