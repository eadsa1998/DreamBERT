I live in a very large shared house with several other people. It's an old victorian building with several several stories and rooms in the roof. We may be students, because we have piles and piles of records. There was previously a flood here, and all the stuff got destroyed. It's pelting down with rain outside, and the river has burst its banks again. Brown water is rising gradually. We panic and move all the stuff to the attic. There's chaos in the house, and arguments break out.
