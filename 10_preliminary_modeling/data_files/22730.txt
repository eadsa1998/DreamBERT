I dreamt that I lived in a house that had stairs at the entrance and next door there was a boarding house whose owner was a black woman. I looked at the people who went around there; I don't remember who they were. I do remember that they were asking me about something. I don't remember what they were asking. I also remember that the boarding house also had a staircase at its entrance, and I saw the black woman cleaning the steps. At the end of the dream, I remember having a discussion. I don't know what it was about.
