I dreamed that I was with my girlfriend. Then a Chinese person began throwing stones at my back car window. In this confusion with the Chinese person, I also remembered having ice cream with my girlfriend. Meanwhile, the Chinese person was still throwing stones at my window, but the window would not break. I remember shouting at that person. That is all I remember.
