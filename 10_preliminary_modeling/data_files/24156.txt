I was in my current house watching my housemate talking on the phone when I suddenly realized that there was a doorway in the kitchen that led to a whole other section oft he house, I had known was there, but had forgotten about until that very moment. I walked through it. My housemate warned me (jokingly) not to go in there, but I went anyway. The place was filthy, uncared for, falling apart. I could ell someone had been living there. I rounded a corner and saw the back of a chair. The person sitting in it had his/her back to me and was smoking a cigarette. I became angry because someone was there without my knowledge. I ran around and faced the person and yelled "What the hell are you doing here?" Only then did I realize that it was a little girl. She looked awful. She had been living alone with no one to take care of her. She responded to me by laughing and then she began to cry bitterly. Then I woke up.
