I was inside the building of the newspaper where I now work, though it was vastly different. It's as if the newspaper tower and the television complex nearby had merged. There were the transparent glass stairs like in the Apple store and in much of the newspaper building architecture inside, though the building was much more sprawling, low and disorganized. There was a convention going on inside. Melinda, a managing editor, was the host for the speakers coming up to the lectern to give brief speeches. My name was somehow on the list. I did not expect this. But I ran up anyway, just as my time was about to expire. I gave a brief, but heartfelt speech. Some people made sounds of agreement to what I was saying (I forget exactly what I said). I left and went down the circular steps to this basement level--a part of the newspaper's building I haven't been to before. It was lined with light hardwoods and glass and a lot of natural light still, typical renzo piano design. A girl came down the hallway. She worked here, though I hadn't seen her before. We paused and looked at each other then passed each other by.
