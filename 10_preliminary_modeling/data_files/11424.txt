I went to my dentist's office to get my teeth checked. He looked into my mouth and drew a picture of what my teeth looked like. I looked at the picture. The teeth had brown patches on the tops of them. That is, looking down at the crown of the teeth, they were brown on top. One molar had a large cavity in it. I asked him the price of fixing the teeth and how many needed fixing. He said 12 were in need of fixing and had to be pulled out. It would cost $160. I then told my mother. The alarm rang for me to get up.
