I was at Mass in the auditorium in a hospital. Patients changed seats. I went outside and started to pick a flower. I was stopped by a hand. When I looked up, I saw that it was my sister's hand. She said, "Don't pick the flower. You may break the bulb underneath." I decided to pick it. I did it very carefully, but the bulb broke anyway. My sister and I were very sad, and we started to cry. Then she said, "It's all right. You did the best you could." Then we held hands, and tried to smile.
