The XFM shows were recorded at this place overlooking the ocean. It was a see-through booth, and I'd go every day and sit next to them and just stare at Steve. I think it was only Ricky and Steve there. I wasn't sure if they even knew I was there because they never acknowledged me, so then I wondered if I had actually been going there every day or if I just imagined it. Anyway, on this one particular day, Ricky left and Steve started talking to me about Die Hard. He said he hadn't seen Die Hard 2 and asked me what it was like (although in my mind, I was thinking of Scream 2). I said that I liked it, but the first one was better. I then realised they were still on air as well and I got nervous and didn't know how to speak (my voice was coming out really weird and monotone).
