I went to visit Mother and Daddy. The house was different than their house in waking life. They had sold that house and moved into a retirement community where they had their own apartment or condo. It was very small. It seems that Mother was spending most of her time in bed. There was a little table by the bed and Daddy would sit in the room and read. You could see the front door from there. There was a little kitchenette off that room. It seems that was all there was to it. It was a very steep windy road leading up to their apartment. It was one lane. When I was getting ready to leave, I think Bev was in the car with me at that point, I had a string around the steering wheel. I was trying to steer using that string rather than putting my hands on the wheel. I was in someone's way and I had to maneuver the car around and in doing so I lost control a couple of times but we did not get into an accident and no one was injured. I didn't do any damage to anyone's property. Bev finally said, You don't have any control with that string. You have to hold the steering wheel. There was something to do with a cake. Maybe a wedding cake or an anniversary cake. It was chocolate. When I was in their apartment I was going to put that cake away. One of them said something about me taking some of it home so I put some of it in a separate container for me to take home. After I left, the car I was driving turned into something more like a skateboard except that it was larger. I could sit on it. It seems that Matthew was on it with me. A couple of times we missed our turn and we had to backtrack. Once we had to stop at someone's house and ask for directions. It almost feels as though we were in a race.
