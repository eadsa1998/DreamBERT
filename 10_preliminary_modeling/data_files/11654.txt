I dreamt that I was out for a ride in my car. My girl and her sister were along. Betty's sister, Gladys, has a driver's license so I let her drive the car for a while. I remember that we got off the main road and were driving up and down hills on a side road. Gladys is a good driver and she wasn't breaking any laws. I remember this very distinctly. However, as we were going down one of the hills we were stopped by a police car. As we stopped I asked Gladys if she had her license with her. She said no and became rather angry. Instead of the cop coming up to me in the car, he just sat there in his and I had to go back to him. He wouldn't tell me what we had done wrong, but gave me a ticket anyway. The police car was a very odd affair, being gray, very long. As a matter of fact, it was more like a bus than a police car. After the police had driven off I began to think the situation over and it burned me up. I was about to go to the police station and demand an explanation when the dream ended.
