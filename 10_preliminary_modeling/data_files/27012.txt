My husband (age 20 &amp; really my husband) and I were watching a football game which was being played on the sandy beach of the lake. My mother and father were there too, sitting nearer the lake than we were. We left for a few minutes and when we got back there was nothing left of the football field, the football team, or the spectators. I was scared to death and finally saw a boy riding on a bicycle. I asked him what had happened and he said that a wave had washed everything away. I felt so badly because my mother and father were among the lost.
