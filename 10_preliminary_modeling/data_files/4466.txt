["Burning client."] I am in a bar lounge and make an appointment for a time to talk with Ellie. The bar woman asks what kind of music it will be. I explain to her that we aren't entertaining, we are going to have a discussion, a talk. Now I am in another room with a client. She shows me her hand which is on fire. I am very concerned and want to put out the fire. I ask her if it hurts. She says yes, of course it hurts, but she isn't interested in putting it out. Then she does slowly put out the flames. Then I see a fire in her pocket of her shirt. She allows that one to burn as well. I am worried for her.
