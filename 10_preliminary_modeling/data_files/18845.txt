The setting was a golf course. Someone whom I couldn't recognize gave me a tee and a ball. As I was about to tee off; the tee was where I put it in a yard close by. I went in to get it. The yard transformed into a rough lake and the tee became long and I think like a cane. I was determined to retrieve the tee. Someone shouted it was a snake. I was being thrown  around on the waves like a buoy. The next thing I was being chased by the snake towards shore. I had almost reached shore when it bit me on the ankle. I then started to try to kill the snake. I first grabbed a Budweiser beer bottle and smashed the snake over the head. The bottle didn't break and the snake was still alive. I then had a big shoe brush in my hand. It split in a quarter and finally killed it. Meanwhile there was pain in my foot, real pain that I felt physically. My mother now is there. I told her I got bit and it's too late, that the snake was poisonous and I'm going to die. This is all that was recalled of the dream. [fear, frustration, perplexed, unpleasant, no color]
