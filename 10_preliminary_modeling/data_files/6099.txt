This dream deals with me babysitting a 14-year-old with my next door neighbor. We were at the house and three boys, about 12 years old, came in. We didn't know who they were. They were friendly but made us nervous and scared. I tried to pick up an object to defend myself, but they questioned what I was doing. They took cans of coke and made them explode. They took the keys to my car and when they left with the car I called the cops. The lady who I spoke to didn't acknowledge me. She was placing a mail order for clothing over the phone and told me to hang on. So I got even more scared and ran next door. That lady let me in and called for me, but she ended up talking to the lady on the phone with the mail order. I ran home (to babysitting house) and the boys were back. I heard sirens in the background and woke up.
