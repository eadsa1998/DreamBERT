I was at a dentist's office, in the chair.  When the dentist came in, I was surprised to see that it was Gary Santelle .  The chair jacked up like a barber chair, and he kept jacking me up, up, up-almost to the ceiling.  It was a fairly high ceiling, too.  He was on a stand that came up that high too.  The waiting room was in the same room, and in two chairs on the side of the room opposite me sat Judy Waldron and Larry Poponovo.  I thought about telling Larry about how often I had dreamed about him, but decided he might think I was weird or something.  I suggested some plan for keeping up with our high school classmates-something like a newsletter or an exchange of personal newsletters, but they didn't go for the idea.  I admitted to them that I was rather sentimental about high school days.  When the dream began, the office building was completely dark, but open, and I was wandering around in it wondering if the dentist had gone home or was on vacation or something, when I bumped into Gary.  Later, I thought of something else I needed to have done, or something I needed to ask him, just after he had left.  There was something like a screened-in porch, and I ran out on it to shout at him as he drove away.  Even though he had driven some distance down the street, I could see his face clearly in his rear view mirror.  He showed no response to my shouting and waving, even when looking directly at me in the mirror.
