I was in the Game of Thrones universe. Jon and Bran were there. Bran could walk. There was a castle thing. I was then in real life and some weird thing was happening. I was out the front at home at the curb near my car. I wasn't sure what the problem was, but something felt off. I kept seeing something in the corner of my eye and when I'd look I could see this creepy white kind of face making a noise like The Silence. It was fuzzy and would disappear when I looked away. It would only be visible sometimes. I went back inside and noticed it was silent. The house was different. There was a big screen door to get out the back and I could see 'shadows' of people who I kept referring to as 'the villagers'. They'd been 'taken'. I could see blurry colours and faint outlines of people but nothing substantial. I found Mom and was glad I found someone. Then the house was something else and there were a few more people. Someone touched one of the shadows/white things and an egg appeared in the air. I grabbed the egg and a purple splotch came out. Later, I touched one and there was another purple splotch. I noticed a shadow that became more real looking. I came across it again later and I realised it looked like clothes I would wear and it 'came through again' and it looked like me but had a tiny, badly cut fringe. I said 'you're me' and she said yeah but that she'd taken liberties during 'editing'. She couldn't be seen by everyone yet though.
