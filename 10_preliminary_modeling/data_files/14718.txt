I was watching a movie about a girl who was getting stalked by demons or something (like Drag Me to Hell). She thought she'd got rid of it and she got pregnant. One day it came back and it wanted her baby (she was now pregnant with another one) and she was like 'no, don't take my baby!' but it like, flew into her stomach and ripped it out. Then Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and I were looking for it. We asked a friend of ours to check for similar occurrences such as "weather patterns". This guy had this puzzle where you had to get rid of this imprint. He said if I did one I would get a prize and I did it. This girl was talking about 'endocrine' and I said I knew it what it meant and that I wanted to be a vet because "I like animals. The only other things I like are movies and video games". She said "vets don't get paid that much". Then I was watching Dawson's Creek. Dawson, Joey and Pacey were at this farm thing. Joey had a full break up with Dawson. He broke down, crying saying "I love you, I need you, I can't live without you! Oh God!" and fell on the ground crying. Pacey comforted him. Then these people wanted to get photos of them and Dawson walked up, like nothing had happened and said "hey guys". Then it was the next morning and they had all been drinking all night. Pacey joked about it, but then they found out someone had died. I wondered where Jack was. This guy told us to say something to warn him because he was going to die. He liked swearing? Then it was his wife and she collapsed from a heart attack. The guy kissed her and it resurrected her.
