 I'm riding a bicycle on what feels like the road in front of Bob's Sports Arena in Wilmerton. My relatives are around the area, also riding bicycles. There are some rich people driving nice cars. Some people play a game of soccer on their bicycles. I have work to do. I twist a nut on the collar of my jacket, and the connection falls apart. I stop and pick up the pieces, and try to repair the jacket. I have a huge blue tattoo on my right hand, wrist, and arm. The tattoo looks like flames. People go past me on their bicycles. I have a Blind Melon or Pearl Jam song in my head. I think to myself: did Blind Melon steal this song from Pearl Jam?
