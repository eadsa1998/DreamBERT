I saw approval as a winner in one of the races. It seemed he paid about $20. I had a hammer and a nail. I was driving the nail thru a rag on the bench and I was looking at the entries. There were a lot of nails on the bench. I have a vague thought that I saw a Mac horse run 2nd and it seems I saw a reward horse that won. There seemed to be entries on a race. Then under the entries these horses were marked larger in print and were winners.
