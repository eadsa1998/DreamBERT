 I'm at Armstrong High School in Wilmerton. I'm in a group of people. My high school classmates Gino Teavor, Annie Thomas, Kari Otis, and others who are not usually there are in my planning room. The whole planning room class is over by the freshmen lockers. I go to the bathroom to blow my nose. There is no toilet in the stall. I see myself in the mirror. I look like my friend from Brimson Holly Lapson. My hair is long, dark, and clean. I go out of the bathroom. The planning room has moved. I wander about, going through the commons, and find it near the doors by the lunch line. There is a stage or platform and the class is sitting around listening to the person on the stage.
