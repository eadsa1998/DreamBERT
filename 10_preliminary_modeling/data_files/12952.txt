I was at school. Evelyn was next to me and Jeremiah and Alejandro were sitting in front of me. They were discussing Pokemon Diamond and Pearl and they had it. I asked how they got it and Jeremiah said "off the net". I said "We ordered it off the net too, but they still haven't arrived. I want it now! Pokemon rocks!" etc. Jeremiah was like "calm down!". He went over to the other side of the class for a while. I was looking down at the floor and someone sat down. I saw Eugene's shoe. I looked up and Evelyn was talking to him.
