["Excellent Teacher"]  I am a young woman with pretty curled blonde hair, wearing a professional looking suit. I am teaching a grade school class. I have two boy students that are difficult. One, Mark, is from a dysfunctional home and is acting out all the time. He is smart, but failing. Merle is from a rich family and is always doing the right things academically. Merle is always on Mark's case pushing him verbally. Mark then responds angrily and gets himself in trouble. Merle is verbally attacking Mark and I walk up to Merle's desk amd lean in on him until he is in a corner. I look him straight in the eye and insist he listen to me. I tell him to leave Mark alone. I tell him he is jealous of Mark because he is so smart. They could be friends, if they'd let go of the animosity. I turn my attention to other children in the classroom. I am an excellent teacher. A man walks into the classroom wanting information about traveling. I help him find maps, even though I feel frustrated at being distracted from my classroom duties. I point out a city he is interested in visiting. I'm not sure if it is Hawaii or Mexico we are talking about. I show him where more maps are. He appreciates my help. I return to the classroom. Mark is standing up showing off to the class. He is smoking a white pipe. I wordlessly hold out my hand. He gives me the pipe and the matches and a wad of money, $5 and $1. His payment for goofing off. I put the pipe in the ashtray. I lecture him. He listens. We both know he'll continue goofing off when I'm not looking.
