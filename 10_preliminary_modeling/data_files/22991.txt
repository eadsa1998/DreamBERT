Yet again the agency.  But this time no badge problems.  The office was set up a little differently -- more like the way it was before we moved -- and Janine Joynes was in our division.  She was slightly taller, and looked a little older, but otherwise hadn't changed much.  She was very sweet and friendly and asked me a lot of questions-so many that I thought I'd never get a chance to ask her any.  I asked about Keith, and she said that he was fine and was no longer in the ministry-which didn't surprise me.  We were going to play a softball game, and either before we left work or at the playing field, Joey Brownell read the lineup.  I expected to be near the top, but kept waiting for my name and was terribly disappointed to find that I wasn't in the lineup at all.  I was also embarrassed, because Janine was there and made some comment about my not being in the lineup, and I told her I didn't understand it because I played every inning of every game last year.  <p
