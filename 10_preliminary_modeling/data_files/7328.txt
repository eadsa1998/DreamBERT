Now if you (a man and woman) will hike along that new trail for an hour and then turn back, we'll meet in time for dinner. Now I'm in R's room across the hall from mine. She is rearranging cartons to be placed on a wire rack at one side of her room. She offers me a taste of her peach preserve to which she has added something that she thinks makes it much sweeter. I take two bites. Then I start across to my room. Miss G. tells me to shut the hall door. I ask why so soon. I need the extra air. F. G. can't remember or find what it means. "Well I don't have to cover that point with my class." As I go to my room, a little girl is entering it. I ask, "What are you doing in my room?" She says she wants her aunt's room. I ask her aunt's last name and tell her that she's in the next room. I hang up my purple dress and start to change to go for a walk. Won't have much time for it for it's four o'clock and supper is at five. Mrs. Mc and another lady barge in when my dress is off. I protest, "Please don't come in my room without knocking."
