I'm in the passenger side of a car. A man is drawing. We pick up hitch hikers, a man and a woman. The woman is really talkative. She soon is sitting next to me and chatting away. She has my books under her arm and I'm concerned that she's going to steal them. I watch her closely. We get to a house and go in. It's time to clean up. I ask her to help put away the food. She balks and complains. I don't start work until I see that she has done her share and then I start doing it too. She put lots of things in the wrong place and I correct it. The man watches all this and as I'm washing dishes, he starts to talk to me. He says, "He worked in Louisiana, do you know what that was like?" I said, "Ya, bugs, heat, etc." He tells me about getting malaria. His feet were too short for the first 8 years of his life.
