I was playing softball, in left field.  We were practicing.  I couldn't coordinate my movements very well, and if I could catch up to the ball at all, I couldn't catch it, and when I finally picked up the ball I couldn't throw it accurately in the direction I wanted to, nor anywhere near as far as I wanted to.  It was very frustrating, because I couldn't figure out any reason for it.  My arm felt its normal strength.
