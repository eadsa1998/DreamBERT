I was in a chemistry lab and was working with cleaning solution. One of the things I had to do was to put a rubber glove which had been turned inside out into a flask containing the solution, and then to pull the sides of the glove over the top of the flask. After this I remember having a mouthful of the solution. I had to keep it in my mouth for 10 minutes. When I went to rinse it out, I first took a mouthful of water and as I rinsed it out, I felt very faint. This happened several times until the water was colorless and then I no longer felt faint.
