I found myself in a swimming pool at school. Miss S--, a Gym instructor described what we were to do (the rest of the girls and myself). She then asked me to poll-parrot back what she had said but I was too nervous to remember what she was talking about because I didn't have a bathing cap. She gave me the keys to her office drawer to get a cap. Instead I found a salad of tomatoes and lettuce which I brought to an unknown prof. for lunch. I watched another man and him eat by a window. Miss S-- then ran up to me to ask me where I had left the keys. I had left them in the drawer.
