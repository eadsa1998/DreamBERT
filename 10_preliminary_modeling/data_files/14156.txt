I was at a shop called Shoe Stand, which consisted of walls and shelves with shoes. It had bags too. I then went with some people into a school. One girl actually attended the school and her younger sister did as well. These people were doing media in a classroom and they unlocked the door for us. One of the people didn't want me using the desk because I'd move them. We had a big argument. Then one of the girls got this thing out of a desk and made the whole room over in a few minutes. It was now night time and somewhere else. This girl had a gorilla suit and was in the woods. Someone came and she hid behind a tree. They were looking for her. She went back. The next day there was a dead deer with two holes in it outside someone's door. A vampire was questioned and it was Bill (True Blood). He said "When we turn, the urge to feed is too great, we cannot protect our prey", which explained why the deer couldn't have been killed by a vampire as it would've been shredded. Then I was the girl and I was coming into a barn through the roof. Bill hung out in there. He got me and I went to look up and he turned my head away. The 'camera' showed the roof and it had bits of insides in the roof. Then he was someone else (it was still him though). Take on Me was playing. We were covered in mud or something and he was naked (I don't know if I was) and I was rubbing my hands on his chest and stomach and then I put my head on his stomach to sleep.
