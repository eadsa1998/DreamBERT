Dream I had while my wife was rubbing my head, and we were talking. And I was falling in and out of sleep with little dreamlets. And at this one point I fell asleep, and in the little dreamlet, I had just come into a room which was full of electronic gadgets of some sort, and I then proceeded to pull a whole bunch of connectors which cut off all messages coming into the room, and then I was going to get involved in something else, and my wife woke me up, by asking me if I'd fallen asleep. Sort of symbolically indicating that I'd gone to sleep and cut off sensory input. That's all.
