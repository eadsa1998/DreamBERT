["The river of dreams."] I am watching a ritual like dream. A long and elaborately shaped log is in a river. A man dances and bashes his head against it. It is a courtship dance for the attentions of a woman. I am amused by it. It is also beautiful. The log curves around and comes back toward itself. Now I am in a house. Neal is there and his mother. Ginny and Jake and I are visiting him. I am describing the log and the ritual dance to him. His mother is watching with interest as Neal and I are attracted to each other. Jake is making fun of me describing the powerful feelings I had seeing this log and dance in the river. Ginny and I look at each other sympathetically. Jake is embarrassing us. Neal sees him and smiles because he recognizes him from my descriptions of him. Now Neal says something about I have an interesting job for you and begins to walk away. I am intrigued. What kind of job is it? It will be wonderful to have a fascinating job to do. His mother says to him. Tell her!! She is encouraging him. I get up and follow him. He is limping and walking up stairs. I follow, limping also, saying, Don't make this hard for me. Meaning I am determined to follow him and get the information. Even though it hurts. He gets upstairs and walks through a bedroom to another smaller bedroom which is dark. No lights on. He sits on the bed. I follow him in. I then see a huge window and he says Go look. I walk to it totally enthralled at the view. A huge beautiful river with logs floating in it. I exclaim, it's the river and the log just like in my dream. It is very beautiful. It is significant he knew about the river like I'd gotten the dream from him. I feel very connected to him. Love blooms.
