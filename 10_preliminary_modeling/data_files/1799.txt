It is raining very hard and I decide to drive to L.C.C. The traffic on the freeway is very heavy and I almost do get let into the line of traffic. The road has dangerous broken places that are not marked and hard to see. I think, "How foolish to be out here at all," but there I am. I am now driving up hill and I see the river. I suddenly realize there are waves coming, flooding. I am now on top of the hill in a hotel. I see several waves and ten I see a tidal wave crashing over the river. The water comes clear up to the lawn of my hotel! I am surprised and think, "I may still be in danger up here." I go to look out the windows. Then I go to the living room. There are two small children wanting to play with the books and toys. I take away a toy I think is dangerous and offer them cars and books.
