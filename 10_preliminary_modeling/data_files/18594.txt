I was working for Bryan. He was having a big Christmas party. It was for Jewish people and shrimp was the hoopla for the party. A big bowl of big shrimp. I was suppose to work at the party and I was trying to get there but the subway trains were new. We longed for the day when the E train went directly from WTC to 34 St. But now the trains (3 to a train) cars--entire cars switched like musical chairs--only the seats were never the same. People kept forgetting their stuff. I found 3 black bras--1 real nice on the subway seat and it came close to fitting. And a great clear plastic dress with mirrors, so you could see the side off your boobs. It had some white plastic and was shiny. I wished it was black. I was training for the marathon and I kept saying I needed to run before 8:30 because it would get dark. The train kept turning but I got to see Dora! She had some make up and it was rolling around on the floor of the train. She didn't need it anymore. She had to leave before dark because my mother would not let me play outside after dark. I said as long as I get out the door before dark, I'd just do what I wanted to. I'd just get in big trouble when I got back. I went to use a theater bathroom in Tribeca and there were waste receptacles that said, "Oyster shells." "Vodka Bottles." But not one for regular old trash. It was snowing hard. The party was quickly getting g started. I heard bits of conversation. A guy said, "I've been to re-hab 3 times." Everyone there was Jewish, but I didn't think Hunt sounded Jewish. I figured Jews were a passing interest for him like the Tibetans had been. There was a big, light-colored, unpainted, sanded and matte-waxed--rather, buffed piano there but Brian had chopped its legs off. I assumed he did this because he'd watched Schroeder playing the piano on Charlie Brown Christmas. I lost my Mozart Sonata music and I was frantic about it.
