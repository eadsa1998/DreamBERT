I'm in my wheelchair and my job is to try out a downhill path to see if it is accessible. I have an able-bodied woman with me who looks like a community college student from Women's Center, possibly lesbian, but mostly abused. We get to the top of the path and I look down and she says, "Well, what shall we do?" I say, "It looks pretty bad. I'm not sure." Lots of AB students are walking around me. I decide to try the path and somehow we slowly manage to get down the path, talking with people as we go. They ask how to help and I'm not sure how to tell them. A man in a manual goes by on another downhill place and calls out a friendly challenge. He admires me. We get to the bottom and I think, "Let's go," but then I realize in order to do a good job, I need to go back and do the path again to find the specific places where it is too steep or the stairs too tall. I'm afraid to tip my chair over those stairs for fear I'll fall, but I decide to take strong spotters with (I am unaware in the dream I have actually already managed doing the path). I get to the top and look for the beginning of the path again, but can't see it. I find an elementary school and go in looking for signs telling me how to get to the gym downstairs. I can't find it and walk past the clothes shop areas and so on and then start walking (now with braces on my feet and wearing a brown pleated skirt and a blazer) upstairs. I see student teachers on the bleachers as I walk up. I realize they don't know how hard this is for me because I'm not in my chair and they don't know the difficulty of a difficult mother or a woman (how it cripples them). I get to the top hall and realize I'm going up and not down and can't find the gym. A woman comes over to me and says weakly like she's going to faint, "Did you know if a woman can be in trouble if her period starts like a tidal explosion?" I look around for help for her.
