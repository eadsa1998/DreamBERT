Ginny and I rush home because Blake and Keith are going to come over to visit us for dinner. As we come into the lobby of the apartment building, we see Blake and Keith. They are drunk. "Wahoo," we think. I'm in a hurry to get to the kitchen to finish dinner prep. We go up an elevator. It's not the regular one. It's skinny. I think, "Hum. No room for a wheelchair." We then are in a store where everything's on sale, Wards/Penny's. I try to get through the jumbled aisles, but everything and everybody is in my way. I walk over and around jumbled boxes of slippers. I see some that have heels high enough I could wear. I'm interested but keep going. People are in the way. I try another way, clothes and appliances. I see an automobile tuning light for only $64. I decide that's a good deal, but I'm concerned because I've already over spent. Blake follows me. I look and under his overcoat he's hollow, empty. The coat is stiff, like looking up a christmas tree or a toy. We roll him to the apartment. I finally get there. Ginny buys something. The sales lady demands to know if she paid her $11 monthly money yet. Ginny gives a disjointed explanation (half lying).
