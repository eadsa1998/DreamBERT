I am walking on a side walk, my arm is linked through my brother's. On the other side of my brother walking with us is my partner, I'm not sure if their arms are linked. I remember the three of us walking along but I don't remember where. We are walking and all of a sudden I'm start in surprise because my partner and my brother violently hate each other. I can't see around us, it's all fuzzy and white.
