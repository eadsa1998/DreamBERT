The dream occurred in a beach/outdoor setting, pleasant day with the sun shining. I was with my friends, probably two close friends watching, their descriptions and gender I can't recall, only their presence. My boyfriend was there, looking much as he does in real life, with familiar height and commanding presence. We had, in real life, broken up several months prior and recently resumed contact. In the dream, for some reason I cannot recall, he was trying to persuade me to say something, and did this by pretending to put his cigarette out on his bare leg. The scene shifted and he became my ex-boyfriend of shorter, more stockier stature, who burned me with the cigarette. I woke up after it being burned into my skin with me not reacting to the pain.
