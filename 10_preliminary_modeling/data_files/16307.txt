I was gearing up for my graduation party and Dad was setting up this salad bar that kind of reminded me of a sound board because the salad went in the place that the faders went. Anyway, that was dumb of me to blast the radio in the background, but I thought it would be cool for one or two of these. Okay, anyway, we had this salad bar set up and it was kind of, I don't know why it put me to mind to a sound board except it had faders on the front, and the salad went where all the rest of the pots would normally go. And Dad was trying to get me to do a mathematical problem to see if people would get more salad if they divided it up evenly, or if people just went up there and just got however much they wanted. That was kind of dumb. I know there was more to it. Lately I've been real bad about not putting my dreams on the tape when I first wake up because that's the best time. I say, "Oh, I'll do it when I wake up more and my voice sounds a little better," but then I forget and then it's like blah. So even if I sound half asleep, I should do it and capture everything I can, and I'll wake up as I go.
