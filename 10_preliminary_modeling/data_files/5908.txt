Have answered a test in a magazine on recognizing religious subjects, art and design. The magazine invites participants to an evening meeting. I decide to go to design group and when arrive and sit down, realize with disappointment I am in the religious subject group. I must have made a mistake, and then decide to stay until they serve coffee. I am sitting partially behind woman whose hair is neatly wrapped in a chignon of braids in the back. The hair is dark brown and as I admire its beauty, she gets up and turns to leave, and I realize with disappointment her hair in front is short and blonde and stringy. I look at her carefully to be sure she is same person. Later am in art group and as arrive there to sit down, I realize am still wearing my hat. I nonchalantly take it off and toss onto top of coat rack nearby. It rolls across other hats and falls on floor. I pick up and place on table near my seat. We are then asked to go to tables in back of room. I find myself sitting next to an old man. I want to ask him why we are at the tables. But as look at him, realize he has a rather stupid face and I get up from my seat. At another table is a slide projector and I see a slide in it of a black and orange drawing. In front of machine is a questionnaire with five questions on it. The slide flashes on a screen and I realize I am expected to fill out questionnaire.
