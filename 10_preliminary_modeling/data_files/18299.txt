Another dream. I and Bob are standing on a hill overlooking the ocean. By the ocean is a red barn and an old red farmhouse, which Bob says had been his home when he was young. As we watch, suddenly enormous waves, taller than the house, break over it and destroy it, becoming larger and larger. Though we are miles from the sea, we can hear its roar. I suddenly realize that we are in danger even where we are, so we begin to run up the hill. I think that there has been a terrific series of earthquakes and that probably this is the end of the world. As we run, it becomes my husband and I. We get onto a platform on a slow-moving passenger train that is going away from the ocean. For months we ride. At last the train stops. The effects are over. We are in the middle of the country somewhere, and must start picking up the pieces and making a new life from the chaos. The people on the train are a mixed bunch. We realize we will have to share each other sexually; this doesn't seem to be too big an issue in the dream. But there is an event: a movie or something in a little town we are near and eventually will move to.
