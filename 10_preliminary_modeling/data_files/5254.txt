I dreamed that they were redoing the post office part of the main building to look more like the Sistine Chapel. Mr. Links was trying out different practice schedules. I studied for exams. Anna and I were trying to figure out when we had practice. I kept falling over and falling asleep throughout the main building and around the athletic center because I was so tired. I told Charla she needed to get Jay to ask him something about our class. So he came over and tried to wake me up. I felt so weak. I only woke up when Lou came to get me. We then walked to the Sistine Chapel to find out when we had practice, but there were so many staircases that I couldn't find where to go. Then I was in front of the dorms. Then I woke up.
