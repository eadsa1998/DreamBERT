I was sitting at a sidewalk cafe in a city a lot like the city where I had my first newspaper job. Someone was supposed to meet me. She was late so I ended up walking around the block. I passed kids playing basketball. Then I circled around and saw my computer stuff. I was worried someone had taken it. She met me. We went to space. I was a substitute for the mission. Before that, we sat in a bar. Debated things along with friends, other people. I'm missing the emotional significance of this dream, though. I can vaguely feel it, but I just can't say it.
