Merc and I are going in the direction of a huge wall of water. I look up and realize this is a tidal wave and it makes no sense to be moving toward it. We turn and run as fast as we can for high ground. I climb and climb until I am up on a roof area and see that I am just barely high enough. To my left now is a huge raging river of water. It's close, but I am safe.
