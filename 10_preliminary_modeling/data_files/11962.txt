I went to school and people were talking about a new Beatles song. I don't know what it was. They also kept saying 'Paperback Letter' instead of writer. Then I was in the library and Svetlana, Yelena and I were doing weird colouring-ins and playing Uno. Some people were also wearing Green Day shirts. I sat at a table in S+E, and then that gay Classmate-M-30 guy also sat at the table and a camera kept moving. There was a strange map. I had a shower at school and Mom was supposed to be taking me to get an x-ray but she sent me to school for a bit and I walked out of the school.
