I am in a bed. I wake up and look out the window. I see high winds and lots of debris swirling around. Then I see a funnel cloud, dark and whirling. I exclaim, "Oh. I just dreamt of a funnel cloud. I get up and stand in the living room at the window. It comes right at us. At the last second I throw myself on the couch and cover my face. The window smashes miraculously no one is hurt. The wind is ferocious. Then I pick up a puppy and carry it into a small nook room. My father brings my mother in. I sit there and tell her about the funnel cloud and how I dreamt about it. She smiles and talks to me. I am so happy and surprised. I show her the puppy. She says she wondered where I was last night. She had thought "Barb will know where I put my things when I unpack." I say Oh I wish you had awakened me. Then she requests I make some cranberry juice. I do so in a pretty glass tall pitcher. My father is so happy to have her back and so well. She is sitting in a robe in a manual wheelchair. My father pushes her out into the kitchen table. I open a small refridge to put the juice in and see 2 other pitchers with just a small amount in them of cranberry juice. I say OK everybody, drink the leftover juice first. Dwight jokes and my mother suggests I put the full one on the left side in the back.
