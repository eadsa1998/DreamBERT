["Unfinished writings."] I am going to write a play or screenplay. I want to do this. It will be fun. It is good to be back into writing again. I then see another script I had started. A movie script. I leaf through the pages, realizing it is good and needs to be finished, but the one I'm starting wants to be done now. I see yet another notebook with another unfinished script. I have lots to do and finally some energy and enthusiasm to do it.
