I was mowing my lawn. The strange thing is my yard was totally different than the real world. There were vast areas of grass, [illegible] wire fences separated each person's property. The houses were far apart from each other. It was also a bright sunny day. I was mowing my lawn and so were the neighbors. But I noticed that they were starting to get hostile. I stopped and saw the two neighbors upsetting each other. The blades of grass and other small particles were flying into each other's lawns due to the mowers. Before it got too ugly, I woke up.
