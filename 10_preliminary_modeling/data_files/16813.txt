I was at my dad's house packing up to leave. Some women were downstairs waiting to take me to the airport. I yelled to them I would be down in a minute. I had some things I needed to get together. I realized that I was taking a long time and I was afraid I would miss my flight, but my things were in major disarray and there were a lot of things I couldn't find. I went downstairs and the room was set up like an auditorium with rows and rows of fold-up chairs. I was crawling around underneath the chairs like they were a tunnel, finding all sorts of things that I had lost.
