With a black man I am on a boat or the tip of an island, at war at sea. People are trying to kill us. I have several grenades strung together like a six pack of beer. I unhook one frag then activate one by pushing the safety off and pulling the pin, hurling the remaining grenades into the ocean. My aim is short but effective. There is a very big underwater explosion and subsequent whoosh and blast spout of water. We laugh and grin, knowing we have killed the enemy.
