There was a family reunion thing. It took place on a 'ghost ship'. I went alone. Abigail was there and I asked her to call Mom and Ezra and ask them again to come. There were lots of people there. I was in a room where there were people I knew, along with others. Buffy, Willow and Xander (all from Buffy the Vampire Slayer) were there. We had to take our clothes off to cover ourselves with stuff. There was meat, newspaper etc. We rubbed on this slime and put it on. None of my stuff would stick on. We were all nervous about taking our clothes off. I only had my pants off though. I put on lots of this glue but all the stuff still just fell off. I went into this bedroom, which was pretty cool looking although there were no beds. It was given to Ezra. I got a less cool one. I had no laptop and said I had to get it.
