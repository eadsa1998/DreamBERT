Fisher and I got a job in a steel mill, but it didn't last. Fisher got another job in another steel mill, so I went to see O'Neal who was personnel manager, but he said he was full. But he said, "Come in with your working clothes at 11 pm and we will see what we can do." So I did and he put me on as a helper and I pushed out trucks from the hot room, then closed the door. Then I helped another fellow and my job was done. I was laid off.
