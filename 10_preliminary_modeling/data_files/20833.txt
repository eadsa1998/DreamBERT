I was on a cliff. I was walking along a narrow ledge that ran on the side of the cliff. About 500 feet below was a shack housing a poverty-stricken family. Some hungry-looking children were outside. Later I was looking down from a rafter near the ceiling of a cathedral. The light was dim. Below, near the altar, people were gathered.
