I had been waiting a long time for some duck eggs to hatch. There were 13. I didn't count them but I knew there were 13. As I watched, twelve of the eggs began to crack open and pieces of the shells were scattered all over. Then, just as the tops of the little ducks' heads appeared, all activity stopped and I knew they were all dead.
