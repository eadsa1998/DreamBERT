I looked at the results and I saw cat and Brave at Sea as winners for the mutuals. There were numbers like 44+ 86 etc. I saw Hornet in parentheses. Not as results as the two above. When I had the paper open on results, Dr. Coon, our country doctor, was standing beside me and when he saw me looking at the race results, he said, "Oh oh," or something about me looking at the results. I had a toy train. It was on a davenport or something like one, only it was long and like on a stairway inclination. I started it and it ran up this inclination, then it started to go to the edge of the davenport and I tried to hurry up and catch it before it fell off, but I seemed to be slow in my hurry and it fell off and rolled on the floor.
