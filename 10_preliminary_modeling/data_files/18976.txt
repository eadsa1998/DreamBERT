This dream takes place at the Reserve unit. I dreamt I was talking with this sergeant that's in charge there. He and I don't exactly see eye to eye on everything. And he kept telling me that if I didn't get squared away, he was going to ship me out of there. And I remember saying that wouldn't be such a bad idea, to do that at all, because I don't particularly like it around there. It would have been worth it just to get away from him.
