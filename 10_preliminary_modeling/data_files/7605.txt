I was driving down the road passing all these very strange and odd-shaped vehicles. They were many different shapes and sizes. I was in a vehicle that you could drive on the road or in the air, similar to what the Jetsons cartoon characters would drive. I was trying to get home from Kentucky, I think, with some friends. We were all in our own vehicles. We were disagreeing on what highway to take. We were all in the air looking down at the different highways branching off from where we were. As I started on my way, the surroundings suddenly changed. I was no longer in a vehicle and no longer on a highway. The best way I can describe this is a car wash for people. I was lying down going thru their curves and down the hills through machines, sponges, etc.
