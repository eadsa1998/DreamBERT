 I talk with my sister Ramona about Princess Diana's death. We're in the stairwell going to the basement. At the bottom of the steps is the wreckage from Diana's accident. There is a bullet hole in the wreckage that glows orangish-gold in color. All the wreckage fades black, but I see the bullet hold that looks like this: [diamond shape], but with rounded side edges, keeping the top and bottom edges pointy. I know her death has been a murder. I walk out the front or hour house. I'm leery of things because of the murder. A car pulls up along the curb. I'm leaving, but am suspicious of it so I go over to see what the man wants. The man sticks his head out of the sunroof and says he wants "pows", which I know are caffeine pills. I say, "Okay, pull over." He doesn't pull over right away. When he does pull over, he runs away. His car is parked in the front driveway behind my truck. I threaten to push it back into the street by backing into it with my truck, if he doesn't come here. He is the "crazy paintbrush man", I know. He runs all over our yard and house. I chase him, yelling out for others to help me. Ramona, my mom, and grandpa Redding all see me chasing him and yelling for help to stop him. I chase him over past our neighbor's house. I jump on their porch and run across it, chasing him. He is dangerous: I see him as loony, unstable, and threatening. We all chase him. I catch him with help from others. Ramona and I corner him by a tree, and a clothesline is there. I get tangled up in the clothesline as I try to grab him, especially the little finger on my right hand. I catch him. He talks about catching a big northern pike. I rip him apart: he is a clothespin. I eat him, chewing up the clothespin, chewing up the metal and the wood. He is a crazy, dancing, loony, happy man: a fruitcake!
