I had one dream about meeting Lil, but there was really nothing much to it. We went to their house, which was modern and on a large secluded sort of lot. Her husband reminded me somewhat of Engstrom. She was dark-haired, thinnish, and dressed in slacks, sort of quiet. She had a sort of study off from the kitchen. When we went in it, we looked out the windows. I thought I saw several people wandering around in her back yard. I pointed it out to her, and she said it was just our reflections in the window. This was hard to believe because they looked so different, but finally I saw that it was.
