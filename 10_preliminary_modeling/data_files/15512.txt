I woke up at 8am and Benjamin and Blaine were going to watch a movie. I asked if they had started and if I could join. I somehow met up with Benjamin and another British guy to watch a martial arts movie. There was a row of recliners on the side of the room. Benjamin was filming it and was better looking in real life and his accent was cute. The movie was silent and weird. We played a zombie shooter game. I watched the video and he had been filming me and my legs. I went to a fast food place with Ezra and some of his friends. There was an Asian guy that I knew from somewhere. I accidentally threw Ezra's burger at his face and he said 'I hate you and said he'd had enough and would kill me, but was over it after a minute. There was a video of Mom taking off an earring that was supposed to be funny.
