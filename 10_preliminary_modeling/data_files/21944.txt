I was looking at the entries and I had day with 2 pp or #2 to win on him, so I said, "I may as well play him." I had a small garden that someone came and paid me rent to use it. I got some papers to enter Italy and also a return paper. I was delivering some items. I made the trip several times. I walked in and out and this seemed to be Rivertown that I was walking thru. There seemed to be a battle of guns at the plant. Fellows had guns and were shooting at one another. I was at White's working. Ernie Keleping had an oil can and was squirting it around. It had a lot of force because it seemed to squirt about a hundred feet. Then Louie Kaufman had a plue can also and was squirting it. They are both dead and were playing with oil cans. I was in Rivertown. Our cow Cherry came to her barn and we were chasing or steering her to the barn. She walked into the garden and lay down on some vegetables. Sister Mary made her get up and go into the barn.
