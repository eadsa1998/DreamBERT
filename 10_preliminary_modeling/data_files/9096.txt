In the dream I was having a dream about James K, a man I went to high school with. I decided that since it was so unusual for him to show up in one of my dreams that I should call him, so I did. We decided to meet. He was living in an apartment with Chip P. Chip P looked just as he did in high school, not appearing to have aged a bit. James K looked as though he had aged, but as with many men, looked even better than he did in high school. I was remembering how he looked in high school, as though I was looking at his senior photo. He no longer wore glasses. He still seemed very reserved and not very confident around women. Chip P was just as outgoing and confident as ever. We decided to leave the apartment and go somewhere for a cup of coffee. We developed an attraction to each other and decided to go on a date. I knew he was dating someone else and she knew about me. He had to choose between us. I had a sense that he was going to choose me, though I wasn't confident of that.
