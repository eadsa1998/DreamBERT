Mom and Ezra were going to see a movie which was three cartoons. I watched one on the TV. Mom and I went to the theater and this guy gave us a ticket. Then we were outside at this Asian looking place. I didn't know where to go. Everything was written in some foreign writing and I said "In this country we speak English" and I was thinking of Pam Cook.
