These people were coming to kill us. We were in this room. There was some guy, his mother and I. His mother hid and the guy ran out this back door and I followed him. There was this big staircase and I was like "up or down?" and we went up. There was a bed there and we turned off the lights and they didn't find us. I think someone had died and come back to life.
