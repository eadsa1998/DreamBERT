I'm behind a counter and I've just gotten out of bed. Audrey is asleep, and I'm looking around for something, half embarrassed, and hoping that Audrey won't wake up, and half wishing that she would. What I'm looking for is like something for a child, paints, crayons, dolls. I get the feeling that maybe it's a celluloid doll. The kind that kids put different kinds of clothes on. There is a man there like the store owner and he's trying very hard to please, but he really doesn't have what I'm looking for. I'm wondering if I should be satisfied with what he's got since I can see that what I'm really looking for isn't in this store. It's like this store is a store for religious articles. I get the image that one of the things I'm getting is a little stick like a cuticle stick, something you use to push back the cuticles of your fingers, and I also get the image of these little dolls and painting clothes on them. I think Audrey wakes up just as I got awakened and I wonder if I should tell her what I've been trying to find.
