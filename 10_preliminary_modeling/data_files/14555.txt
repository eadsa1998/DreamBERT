I was at a house and I had a different family. I had three brothers called Tom, Aaron and David. I went to ask my 'mother' for something and this guy was naked in her room, so I kept walking. I went to hide and went in Tom's bed. He was naked and threw the blanket over him. His bed was next to a balcony (an inside balcony). Because of this, we would often see a naked girl up there as he would bring random ones over. I asked why he didn't have anyone over this time and he said it was in order to hide me (because if there was a girl there, no-one would think to look for me... that doesn't seem to make sense now). Later, someone misunderstood what happened and broke up with him. I tried to explain it. Then I was playing a game where I had to catch the bus and trains at certain times to level up. Later, a few of us were in a classroom. The teacher asked for a volunteer, and I knew it was going to be me and I hated doing it. The girl next to me volunteered but he made me do it. I had to make 3 (the number was a random number between 1-4) sandwiches. Dmitri was in the class and finished his sandwiches. The teacher told me to get them finished by the end of this week -- it was Thursday. I decided to leave. I went to text Mom, but at lunch, the teacher was in the room and I couldn't. There was another teacher and they were playing Runescape. He was riding a bike and it was slow because his agility level was only 21. I said that I'd been playing for five years.
