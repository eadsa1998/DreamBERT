We moved into Nana's. I was in her room. One day Mom packed up all my stuff and moved in there. I got really angry about it. I complained about lack of privacy and that I have nowhere to sleep now. She was just like 'oh well'. I said it would be better if she and Darren stayed in the room in the hall because Ezra's room was near mine.
