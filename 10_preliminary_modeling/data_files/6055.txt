I dreamt that I was walking along the beach with a bunch of my old girlfriends who I had not seen in years. There were six of us together and we were talking about all the changes we had been through since graduating from high school seven years earlier. One of the girls, to whom I was the closest, had told me that she was getting a divorce and she needed a place to stay. The dream ended with us moving her in.
