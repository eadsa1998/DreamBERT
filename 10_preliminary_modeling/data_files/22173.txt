I dreamed about two boys of about 15, with whom I was in my dining room. They are friends of mine. One of them is tall, has dark brown hair. He is fair and has brown eyes and wore a light blue shirt and grey slacks and sat to my left. The other one wore a light blue shirt, blue slacks. He is rather short, has dark brown hair, brown eyes, is fair and has straight hair. He was at my right. I was doing my homework, but at the same time I was dancing with them because the record player was on. It can be seen that this dream is appropriate for me.
