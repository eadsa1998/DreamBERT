A girl in a pair of pants and bra only was standing on the stairs. I identified the girl as one in my dorm. Her legs were very tan and long and more thin than any I have ever seen. It seems my boyfriend was looking in and admiring her and stroked her leg once. I was somewhat jealous, but I tried not to appear so. I don't remember for sure, but it seems that I dismissed Helen, whose legs are not like that, by saying, "That's all," as though she were a model or something. There was no rancor in my tone, only command.
