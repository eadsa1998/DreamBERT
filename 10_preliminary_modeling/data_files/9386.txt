Mother returns home. I tell her that my brother Ronald is running the house and therefore she should not boss him too much. Shift: In a rickety old plane with Marita; and there is an old man, a bum, on the plane who has to go to the toilet urgently, so the pilot carefully lands the plane on a bridge. (Vivid image of flying inside the bridge span). We land safely and no one is hurt; the bum is carried across the street to a man-hole and already a huge bowel movement is coming out and they are much too wide for a human bowel--feeling of terrible disgust and upset at the sight.
