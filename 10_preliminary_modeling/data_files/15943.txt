I was in this house for some reason. It was full of ghosts, most of which were hostile and causing problems. We were there to get rid of them, I think, but I didn't really want to be there. There was a room where we had certain lights installed to see them and we were trying to get Ma (the name of the 'leader' ghost) to come in but we couldn't work out how to turn them on. As the ghosts piled in though, the lights turned on (a weird red colour). There were a lot in there, it was almost like a ballroom. I pulled out my phone to take a photo and only a few of the ghosts could be seen. Fletcher came in and was apparently a ghost and he explained that it took energy to not be seen, so only the older and stronger ones could do it with ease. I got him in the frame for a photo and could see him and I took a photo. I went out at one point with a couple of the ghosts. They were obsessed with orange juice and I took them to a bar place and they ordered orange juice and the bartender sent it sliding down the table to us. I got one too. One of the ghosts used to be an alcoholic and said they couldn't have alcohol, but then ordered something alcoholic and choked on it and spat it out, but then kept drinking it. I wondered if they could get drunk.
