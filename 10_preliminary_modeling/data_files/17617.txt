I think I was living with my boyfriend Jeremy.  I was sitting on the edge of the bed, and I tried to fart.  A 6-inch clearish-grey blob popped out of my vagina and bounced across the floor.  I had miscarried my baby after only two days gestation.  It was Jeremy's baby, but somehow it had some cow DNA in it.  I was worried.  I asked Jeremy to find some type of formula.  I found a small toothpick sized hole in the blob that I determined to be the mouth, got some sort of eyedropper, and started attempting to feed it.  I had a loose tooth and next to it was a loose piece of my gums.
