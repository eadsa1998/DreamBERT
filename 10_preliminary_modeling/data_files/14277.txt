I was on my laptop and had my PowerPoint presentation open. I left the room and when I came back I was talking to Ezra on MSN and he had changed my font colour and background colour. The font was now a light blue and the background was yellow. He sent 'Bart rules!' and this colour change had something to do with The Simpsons. There was a movie on later with George Clooney and I laughed and said "milk!" and thought about the milk thing.
