I am in M City house. I go out and get the mail. Lots of magazines are in the box. I decide I'm late for class, so I'll skip one. It's just Career Planning. I need to clean up some food messes on a floor in the kitchen and on a table in the L. room. I go to a bed in a hall part of the living room and lie down in broad daylight. My parents come home. Arthur helped me clean up the mess.
