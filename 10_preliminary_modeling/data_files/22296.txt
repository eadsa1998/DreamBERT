Again I write my dream, but it is going to be a short one because I wrote it the next day and I don't remember it well. My sister and I came out of a tenement where we lived. It was a tenement in a slum. We came out with two buckets to look for water. When we passed by a door, we realized it was the house of a friend whom we hadn't seen in a long time. Suddenly we felt we were being followed. They were two boys and one girl who were brothers of the boy who was a friend of ours. We got to the well to take the water and the boys came over to us. My sister told them not to come near us or talk to us. We returned with our buckets filled with water and suddenly, in a room, we saw our friend who was tied and we couldn't get to where he was.
