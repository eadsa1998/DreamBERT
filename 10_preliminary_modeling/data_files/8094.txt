This is very sketchy but important. It had something to do with the CAS office. My sense is that there were people who came to work there but either decided that they couldn't do the job, so they left, simply because they knew they couldn't or because they knew they couldn't and they wanted to make the decision to leave before they were asked to leave. There were people who couldn't do the job and were asked to leave, or maybe it was suggested that they leave. It wasn't the typical office setting. I have this picture in my mind of people along two opposing walls. They aren't really standing in a row. they are but there is a significant space between each one. as though there is a room for a desk between each of them. They are just standing there. I don't remember any furniture in the room. It seems that it had something to do with changing clothes. Maybe I was changing clothes. I realized. Or. I don't know. For some reason I'm noticing about the fact that I have shaved off my pubic hair. The only reason I notice is that I'm looking at my pubis and thinking, What is Doctor Pf going to think when I go in for my annual exam and sees that I've shaved off all of my pubic hair?
