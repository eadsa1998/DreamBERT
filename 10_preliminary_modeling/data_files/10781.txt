All I remember of this dream is that my brother (16) re-entered a room I was in. He began upsetting everything in the room and doing everything he could to dirty it up--emptying the earth from flower pots was one specific way I remember. He was doing all this to spite me because I pleaded with him not to dirty the room. He also knows that I like to keep a clean room clean. Then I went seeking persons to help and I remember begging someone to convince my brother to stop but the person said he couldn't help me. This person was a nonentity. I don't even remember seeing a face.
