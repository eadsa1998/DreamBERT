In this dream I awake after a deep sleep on my sofa. When I stand up, I am very groggy, not fully awake. I am not sure where I am. I go out into the hall and look into the bedroom. Mary is sound asleep. All I can see is her black hair. Her back is to me. her body is covered by the blanket. The light is on in the hall so I turn it off so it will not disturb her.
