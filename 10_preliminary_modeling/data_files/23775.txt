My oldest sister had an inflammation or swelling in her genitals.  She and I and Mom and Dad were sitting in the hallway by the atrium here [in my childhood home, to which I have come back to live in reality], at the corner between the playroom and the master bedroom.  Her clitoris and labia were so swollen it looked like she had a penis, and it changed in size often as we looked.  She was holding it or touching it, saying she had this bad swelling and did not know what to do and wished it would go away.  It showed from beneath the hem of her shirt.  Dad looked quickly and agreed it was bad, but looked away quickly too, he was very embarrassed.  We were not too concerned with how weird this was (her showing us), more with how to make it better.
