I was playing World of Warcraft, although sometimes it was my test. There was a movie or something and there was a guy with two kids. One of them was a 5/6 year old boy with a French accent. I thought it didn't sound real. They were in the car driving. They went to some place and they wandered off. Then I was with Dad and Ezra. The material my pants were made out of made Ezra sneeze and he was telling me to take them off and take them far away. I went inside somewhere and people from Arrested Development were there. Alia Shawkat screamed. Michael Cera and Jason Bateman were also there. Jason Bateman came over to where I was to a camera and video player thing. I was recording. I went outside for [something I can't read, but it looks like pant) and something about a deer. Then the French people were chasing a cat [something I can't read, looks like 'go missing']. There was some insect on this thing and he said it meant this girl had taken Mom and I for a drive? Something screwed the road up and it made us "drift" and slide all over the road. There was a guy with Pokemon cards. I thought about buying some. I managed to get to the 'end' -- it was World of Warcraft again. There was a Pokemon like Celebi. I went up a hill. I had to fight it to get this girl back.
