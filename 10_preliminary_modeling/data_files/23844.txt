Mom and I are out on a road in the country, there are big fields and cliffs around.  She is showing me the land she is going to buy.  It is attached to land they already have.  It is a big parcel, over a hundred acres I think.  We look at it, sort of sideways.  It has bright green grass, and a big drop-off or cliff.  It's in Texas, but much more cliffy than the farm.  I am not sure how I feel about this, either - why, you already have land, or envious, or just that there's something wrong about it, like where is dad, is he dead and that's why you're buying land.  I feel weird about it too because I am looking at it with my head sideways or maybe upside down, a strange perspective, not quite real.  And aware that we are on the road.  Some thought about that road, thinking Lynn is driving down it or something, because next I am in Utah.  I wonder how I got from Texas to Utah.
