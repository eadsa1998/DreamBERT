I was sleeping on an air mattress in my friend Stephanie's apartment. It deflated. So I inflated it. I was worried that it was too full. I sat on it. It wasn't. I went out to take a shower. I was worried Stephanie and Mark would be awake. I didn't want to go walking through their apartment too early in my underwear and disturb their day. It had slept in -- it was 11:30 a.m. already. Nobody was awake. I was in luck.
