There was a 'flashback' to old times (looked Roman-y). These young guys were coaxed into seeing this woman who would have sex with them and they could lose their virginity. One guy had already done it and had these spots on him, but he encouraged his friends anyway. They had to go through this portal door into this weird cave like place. I can't remember what happened exactly, but they changed their minds, panicked and went back through the door. As they did their skin began to bubble and melt off and they screamed and died.
