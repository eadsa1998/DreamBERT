 I'm at my house. There is a small party going on. My classmate Robyn Masters is there. There is a pizza box there. Robyn asks me to come closer to her. I do. She says she wants to go back to Brimson, and asks if I want to go too. I say okay. I reach for the pizza box. It's gone; people have taken it. I'm not quick enough.
