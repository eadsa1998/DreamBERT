I was at school and my hair straightener was on the ground. Classmate-M-17 threw it there. Rebekah pulled it and I yanked it and it got thrown into the wall. Eugene and Seamus were fighting over a piece of paper which was something of Eugene's. It fell into the air and Eugene ran to Seamus so I grabbed it and it was photos of this actress called Mel something and reasons why he liked her. He started wrestling me for it. I had Media but I accidentally went to S+E. Dmitri said that he the best looking in his group at the time. His music video was for Only Sixteen, which was also what we were doing.
