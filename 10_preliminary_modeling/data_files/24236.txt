I am waiting for my mother outside Wal Mart. She is taking too long to pick me up because I suspect she is distracted. She's turned into an impertinent, rude, stupid person lately. When she finally does arrive, I call her on it. She is having long phone chats with someone. A dentist named Barry, an older guy who works near the old dentist place near Wal Mart. I demand to meet him, so I stay in the back seat of the mini van until she goes over there to see him. He seems like a nice enough guy. He gets out of his car and gets into the front seat. I shake his hand. He says something. I lean forward because I can't quite hear. "Nice to meet you" is all I say. I want to fight back tears at this betrayal. I don't let him notice. The exchange is brief. I get out and disappear into a dark space, then re-emerge deep underground.
