A musical play is opening. I am in my wheelchair. The lines of marchers with their flags line up. The stage manager wants me to be well out of sight and grabs my chair and drags me to the place. I am angry and tell him not to do that! He should tell me where the place is. I'd get there probably faster than he could. He apologizes. It's my car. The marchers are behind the audience and they have sung and marched up the aisles to the stage. I suddenly realize there is no ramp but only stairs. The stage manager says he'll carry me. I reluctantly agree. We (the birds) go up the aisles singing the same song and as we get to the stage I see that R. has ramped it! We glide up to our places backstage. The marchers enter singing about how they have two feet and in bluesy notes we add that we have one and do the same things! It's an upbeat fun song. Rochelle forgets her lines and I cue her. It's Mark H., not Merle. It's a fun choreographed opening with walkies and wheelies working together. "We've got two feet and we can walk..." (stamp, stamp). "We've got one foot and we get there too..." (roll, roll turn).
