I am in the kitchen. At the sink, I turn on the tap and the water comes out rusty, as it does after a plumbing repair. Mary enters the apartment. Her hair is wet and drooping, and her clothing is disheveled. She is not completely dressed and is soaking wet. She is hurt, angry, and crying. She has just returned from the apartment laundry room. When I see how upset she is, I gather her into my arms to comfort her. I ask her if the rusty water had ruined her laundry. She tells me that that is not the cause of her upset. Her laundry is OK. But the electricity is shut off and she had to walk up the stairs to our apartment because the elevators aren't working.
