I am in a school room that's sort of out in the wilderness area near a river. I am helping the teacher. In fact, I'm a student teacher. I point up on the blackboard to some colored shapes and ask if any of the kids can show me the yellow squiggly ones. Mike (of 3rd Grade I taught) comes up and tries, but just doesn't understand. I then notice the children are leaving in the middle of the lesson. They are out and walking in the river. The teacher (other woman) comes in to critique my lesson. She asks me about my hair and wants to know if its length had always been the same. She asks questions about the color of it. I am impatient. I really want a critique of my work and she doesn't seem to be anywhere near that subject. Even things closely related to the lesson are not to the point. I feel frustrated.
