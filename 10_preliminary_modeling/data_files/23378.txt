I'm on the freeway heading home from work. As usual, I'm in a hurry, but find myself stopped cold by a traffic jam. It is so severe I get out of the car and walk up to see the cause. Cars are stopped in both directions. They are also jam packed. I get to the head of the problem but do not see why precisely we are stopped. For some reason, we are to be there for days. I meet a man in another car and we instantly fall in love. Somehow, somewhere, we end up making love. We plan to build a life together. I don't remember how this one ends.
