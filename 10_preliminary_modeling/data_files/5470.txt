I was at my parent's house that I grew up in and I was going out with a friend that I have here. I saw the house in fairly clear detail as if I were seeing it, and I went out with my friend to her house which was another large place with a lot of stairs. Again there were a lot of visual details. I could see a lot of colors in the rooms, the colors of the carpeting and the furniture and all the different shapes and different lighting as we moved from room to room, and she and I were talking, I don't remember what about, and I got to the top of a long flight of stairs inside the house and I was looking around and I said to her something like I forgot to close, to lock the front door of my house and that I had better go. And I had forgotten to lock the door of my house, but mostly I just wanted to go home, so we went back down this really long flight of stairs, and I don't remember if I had my brace on, that I wear, or not, just for some reason I was focusing on the stairs a lot. She does in fact have a long flight of stairs leading into her house, but they are outside not inside.
