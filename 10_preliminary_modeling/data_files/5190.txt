I had a really scary dream that I went to see the movie 28 Days Later, which is supposed to be a scary movie about everyone getting a plague. So I was watching the movie in the basement of a factory or something. All the people I was watching it with got the plague from the movie. I got so scared and ran to my brother's room. He was there and we sat in his room and we were listening to Harry Potter on tape, but then he got the plague too! It was horrible.
