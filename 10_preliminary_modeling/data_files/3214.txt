I'm at a class and the man teacher is drawing things on the board. I am amazed that in just a swipe of the chalk, he can draw quite complex pictures with perspective. I say, "Does everyone but me draw good?" Then I go closer and see that the complex pictures are already on the board and when he swipes the chalk over it, it raises the picture up so we can see it. I say, "Oh, so that's how you do it." He shushes me; he doesn't want the others to know. Then I put a pink baby bonnet I made on his head, as a joke, and giggle at how silly he looks. Then it's graduation time and I receive some plants and some cats as gifts, a black cat and an orange one. The plant looks like a bird of paradise plant. It needs to be transplanted to do well. Now a fat woman named Velma (from high school) says she's getting married right now. She wears a pretty pink night gown and I go get the baby bonnet made and give it too her to wear as her veil. I give her the orange cat back. I carry it to the car. Her husband gets in, she gets in and I hand her the cat. They drive away. I go in to transplant my plants and take care of my black cat.
