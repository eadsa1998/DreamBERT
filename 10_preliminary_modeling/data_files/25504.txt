 I'm at home with my mom and my friend Nate Nelling. My friend Matt Yams is there. He has a large brown van. I drive to The Greasepit with Matt in the ban. The Greasepit is in the mall. Matt is my connection for free food. He is a woman. The Greasepit is out of burgers. They have chicken or turkey brats, two Mountain Dews, and one Pepsi. I think of Nate liking pop brown in color, and I get a Pepsi for him. I discover I have an extra $50 in my wallet!
