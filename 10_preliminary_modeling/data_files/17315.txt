We were at the my kindergarten teacher Mrs. Moore's house, I think.  I had to give a report twice per quarter.  This was to be the last.  While my brother Stuart stood up and gave his, I had to prepare a new subject.  I started thinking, "wait- I'd already given more reports than necessary".  I thought about continuing on cats, and started cutting out pictures and things.  I started to think no, I'd report on the family.  Better filler, more substance.  But then most everyone left and only the family was there, so it seemed silly.  We were considering going to a movie in what looked like an airport.  My godmother's sons the Swenson triplets were there with passes.  They had nicknames on their white tee-shirts.  One was "Second Mambo".  We went into one room and my old best friend Candy's mother Dena was there.  There was a white tape running across the middle as to direct the lines at a movie theatre, and I tried to hang upside down on it.  As it was flexible, though, I couldn't get it in the crook of my knees.    I showed Dena how to get her feet above the tape.
