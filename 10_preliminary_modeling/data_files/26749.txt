 My brother Wally's girlfriend Karen Hamilton is pregnant with twins. Wally is the father, but this seems to make little difference. Karen is talking with my mom about abortion: if she should have one, how to do so, and if it's too late. One way is to wrap a rug around her, she says, cutting off support for the fetuses. I'm eating a small plate of noodle-like food. I bite a noodle with my front teeth and then realize I've just bitten the umbilical cord to Karen's fetuses. I don't know if I should tell Karen or conceal this. I feel bad. I'm not sure if she'll be happy the baby was aborted, or mad and sad.
