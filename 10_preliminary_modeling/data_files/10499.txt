I am in the hospital -- why? They bring me a huge tray of food with lots of meat!, soup, bread, plus extra for a guest. Good talk, then interrupted by a tall man - an acquaintance, who stands by the door and asks Marissa some questions... I am at home, I just walked out of the hospital and no one stopped me; I call in to explain, so as not to get a bad mark on my record.!!
