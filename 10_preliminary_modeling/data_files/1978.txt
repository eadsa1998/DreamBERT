I'm going to go swimming. I find the lockers and then I'm in a cafe at a University. I see my friend. She points to the exit. I pay my bill and go after her. The exit is in the rear of the cafe. A group of men are seated at a table near the door. It is difficult to squeeze through. They tease us and then make room. We go out and I remember I had a bicycle. We look everywhere and can't find it. I realize it's been stolen. My friend (Shannon or Jennifer) says I should have chained it! Next time I'll remember to lock it! I feel a little guilt.
