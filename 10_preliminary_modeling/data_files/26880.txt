 I'm at my step-mom Lisa Lawson's house in the basement. There is a woman lying on a massage table there. I'm standing next to the table. I have my right hand on the woman's back, giving her a half-hearted massage. A woman I know is standing behind me. This woman starts to give me a back massage. I'm very tense: my back muscles are tight. The massage feels very good: relaxing. I start to feel rubbery, as if I'm melting. I focus more on the massage I'm receiving, and my right hand does not massage the woman as much. The massage I'm receiving ends. I'm sexually excited: I have an erection, and I direct my intent towards the woman who was on the table, and is now standing. I am behind her. My erection protrudes between her legs to the front side of her body. She is fully clothed. I squeeze a blob of pre-ejaculatory fluid, which looks like semen, to the top of my erection, and lick it off the head of my penis. The woman leaves. I'm upstairs with the woman who was behind me. She is my sister. She has long, dark brown hair. We're on the floor. There is plutonic physical contact in what we're doing. I creep my hands into a position where they are over her breasts. I think I'm being nonchalant, as if she won't realize what I'm doing or go along with it. Suddenly she yells out, "Incest hands!", accusing me of my actions. I deny what I'm doing, and try to play it off as being normal or insignificant. I don't think she accepts this lie. We are soon in a sexual situation. She says something to me along the lines of, "You wanna fuck?", in an obnoxiously cocky, teasing voice. She is on top of me and pulls up her skirt to have sex. There is some action: wrestling-like play. I see she has no genitals. I know that she is male, and that she cut off her genitals she was younger. <br/
