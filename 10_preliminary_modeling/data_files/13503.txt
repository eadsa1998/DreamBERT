I was watching a talk show and the host was Joshua Jackson, who was very gay and looked like he did in Cruel Intentions. Scott Lowell was his guest. Joshua wasn't funny at all and the audience was silent. I was thinking 'how the hell is this on?'. He said something about "Jimmy Jackson" and reached over to Scott and said "Ooh! I said his name!" and giggled. Then he said something about his wife and sobbed. I was reading a review and Scott comforted him and they were saying stuff about life and the director knew what they were doing and everyone seemed sad. I thought they were going to say that Scott had tried to kill himself.
