I was about to leave home with Mom. I had just locked up and started walking towards the car, when these two black guys drove past then pulled up in the driveway. They were trying to get my keys off me. Mom came up and distracted them and I unlocked the door and went inside. I called Dad. When I got back to the front door, the police were there and the black guys were gone.
