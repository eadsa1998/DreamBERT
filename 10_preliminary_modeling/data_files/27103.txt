I was at my friend's (male-age 23) home which was a very large converted theater. We were in what appeared to be the living room. I was holding two cups and saucers belonging to my friend's mother (age 55). I walked into another room (the kitchen) and there I accidentally dropped the cups and saucers. They broke upon my bare feet and I had many cuts on my feet. The maid (who in real life is a worker in M--- dormitory-age 50?) was there and she gave me several pieces of chicken which I put on my feet to stop the bleeding. I walked back into the living room. My friend's father (age 55) had joined him and when I entered I was very embarrassed because I knew the father (who is an M. D.) would think me very foolish for putting chicken on my feet.
