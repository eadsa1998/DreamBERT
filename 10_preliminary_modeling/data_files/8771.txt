I opened the door to the downstairs bathroom intending to go in and get something. Without turning the light on I started to place one foot in the room and realized that it was flooded. There was about 3 inches or so of standing water. Apparently the toilet had overflowed. The rugs were under water, not lying flat or topside up and out of place. The wastebasket had fallen over and was out of place. There seemed to be other things on the floor that were simply out of place. The standing water would not be possible in waking life as the water would have simply flowed out of the opening under the door. I had found a small puddle of water outside the bathroom door a few days ago. I wiped up that water, thinking that I would check in the bathroom later because I was in the middle of something else at the time.
