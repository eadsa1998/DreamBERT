I had sex with Dona Massey, a friend of my sister Nancy's.  Although in real life she is immaculately clean and wholesome appearing, in the dream I was warned that she had a "dirty cunt."  The words came to me as if written rather than spoken or originating in my own thoughts.  That didn't bother me, though, nor did it bother me when there was a knock at the door and someone entered the room even as we were in the midst of intercourse, in the "chair-astride" position.
