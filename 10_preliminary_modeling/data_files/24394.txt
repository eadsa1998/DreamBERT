There were these cowboys traveling. They were really good trainers, and they trained these buffalo to carry their stuff while they were on the horses. They went to this fort. This man, who was the head of the fort, gave them a sheet promising that they wouldn't kill the buffalo. Except it was the opposite on the sheet. He thought maybe they couldn't read, but they could read. They said, "We need another sheet." So finally he had to sign the thing, saying they wouldn't kill the buffalo because they carried the cowboys' things. When they were trying to find the sheet, the guy said that his mother was in charge. At the top of the sheet, it said, "Sam" something. And, he said his mother's name was Samantha. He was just trying not to sign it, but the cowboys wouldn't be tricked. They were smart. So he finally signed it. Finally, it was the day that they were going, and they saw that one buffalo was missing. They saw a Native American riding off on the buffalo. They got a rope, and they roped the Native American around the waist. The buffalo was already roped, and the Native American didn't see the rope because the rope was really long. The cowboys said, "Do you want to walk or do you want to be dragged?" The Native American said, "I'm sorry. I'll just walk." He walked over to them, and they finally unroped him. I don't know what happened to the Native American. But the cowboys rode off with the buffalo. I was just watching. I wasn't in the dream.
