I was with another man in a courtroom. We were waiting for a judge to come and sentence us for something. I walked outside the room into a large lobby with columns in it and a lofty ceiling. I looked around to see if there was anybody around. I went back to the room and I told him that no one was around and I could have run away. Then the judge came in and examined his papers regarding our cases.
