I was out somewhere with Mom, at some kind of shop. There were lots of people. I saw Grayson there and there were a bunch of woman fawning over him and Mom made some comment like 'I heard he was good looking' and I was like 'uh, he's not my type'. Later, I was at home which was like the old house and I was trying to get into the bathroom. I went through the bedroom and the door was like mottled glass and I opened it a little and it was steamy. I saw a glimpse of Mom and Grayson like kissing and they shut the door. I was confused how that had happened.
