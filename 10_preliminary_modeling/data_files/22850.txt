I am in church somewhere with long rows of pews-sort of like First Christian Church in my hometown.  Mother is sitting far to my right in the row in front of me.  While the preacher is talking, Mother starts talking to me out loud about something not pertaining to church; I can't make her be quiet, and Daddy won't do anything about it.  Pretty soon the preacher stops talking and begins just looking at us.  It is causing quite a disturbance.  Finally I can stand it no longer, so I get up and rush toward the door in humiliation.  When I get to the door, the floor there is on a terrific slant, sort of like in the Reflection Maze, down and to the left.  I grab the knob as I fall back.  The door comes open, my hand slips off the knob, and I start not sliding but flying backwards toward one corner.  I am horrified, because I am trying to make an inconspicuous exit.  I land almost on top of some lady I know (Mrs. Butler, I think).  Some people come around to the corner, and I hear one of them say something which indicates that they think my neck might be broken.  It isn't, though.  After I get up, I go around and apologize to almost everybody.
