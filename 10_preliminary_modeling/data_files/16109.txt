I was at a boarding house somewhere. I thought it was somebody's birthday. And before we celebrated the person's birthday, we had to have everybody put their bags up on the table and have a writing essay thing as to describe somebody's bag that you think is neat. And I started out and before I knew it, it was Sandra's birthday, I think, and we had presents for her and she had presents for us. And we were going giving her her presents, and she was giving us ours, but I woke up before we could open them.
