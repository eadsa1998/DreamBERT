I was in Bali, staying in these weird cabin hut things. A group of people were outside at night on the beach singing Agadoo and doing the dance and I joined in. I posted on the forum what I was doing. Then it was day and Bali was close by, like a few km away. I could see the city from where I was. There was a tidal wave which was small and got bigger. I climbed a tree or building or something to get higher. I managed to get over to the other side eventually but the world had been overtaken by creatures and bad dudes. Then it was normal and I was waiting outside an apartment block thing and Cecelia and Fletcher came out. I was waiting in the passenger seat of a car. Someone said Judah wasn't here yet and I got excited because I didn't know he was coming. I turned around at one point and saw him and someone else waiting behind the car.
