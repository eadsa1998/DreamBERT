I saw a couple of cows in a green cornfield and a horse. I ran for a tree because I thought the horses and cow would get mad and go for us. I climbed a tree. Walter went for a tree paper. I dug a ditch and put a water line in. I planted a small tree when it was in. It was a large tree. I put manure on the ground and it rained on it. I had a bulb that the light was dim from it.
