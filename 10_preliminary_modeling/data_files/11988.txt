Mom picked me up from home to get food and I didn't wanna go to her house so she went to drop me off, but we walked through some scary park and some black guy was getting beaten up. I got home, which was very different. I was at Seabird and I ran down from the shops to the park. Nana was there and there were like 20 kittens which I had given birth to. They had names like 'Hungry'.
