We were just going to the car to start off for Cleveland from New York. We were carrying our belongings in valises. I had my raincoat and (I thought) a jacket on one hanger which I had on my left arm. I became cold and gave what I had in my right hand to someone to hold while I put on my jacket and coat. When I took the coat off the hangar, a dress fell from underneath. I put the dress aside and my mother remarked that I never wore enough even when I was sick. She told me to don the dress saying it would keep me warm but I threw it away.
