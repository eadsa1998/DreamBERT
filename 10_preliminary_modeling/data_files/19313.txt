The setting was not familiar. I was in some sort of sports stadium and it was empty except for myself and some of my friends. I was with my good friend from school. She is 17. I was also with my other friend who is 17. Suddenly the guy I liked appeared sitting with his parents in the stadium. He came over and talked to me and we hit it off. It was great! Now, will it happen in reality? But anyway this dream seemed real. There was no unexplainable things or unusual settings. The dream was good. I hope it comes true. Everything was in color.
