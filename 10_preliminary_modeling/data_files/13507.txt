I was at this place with Calvin. We had to write down some thing for a future story. I couldn't think of anything. I started doing it and used a picture of Penn Badgley for a character. The photo looked more like Gale Harold. The teacher was annoyed at me. Sometimes Calvin was Charlene. I started writing a plot outline for the story, which again annoyed the teacher. I was then at Nana's and she said Easter eggs were in the study, which was in Poppers's room. They were little ones so I took two bigger, hollow eggs from the hall. I hid in this room and this guy saw me. I think Mom came to look for me later. I hid in a cupboard which had clothes in it.
