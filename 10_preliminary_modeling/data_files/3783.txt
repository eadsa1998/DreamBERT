I am firing Angel. I am on a campus, like the community college. I see some women teachers I know and stop to chat. Dovre is there. She tells me she and Paulina had invested in some children's gold, children's jewelry that is made of gold. She says they lost money. It was at 6 and now it's at 3. I say, "Don't worry. Keep it; it will raise back up in value." She keeps it in a safety deposit box in a back room. Now she and I are walking and see a booth with Archie running it. He is demonstrating Contact Improv in a small, square pool of water. He smiles at me and at Dovre. I introduce her as my daughter. He invites her to join him and he'll teach her. I laugh and say, "She won't do it." I think she will be shy and say no. She dives right in and swims underwater like a dolphin. I am surprised, pleasantly so, and say, "Ok, I love being wrong." Now Mr. Spock is there. He is wearing weird glasses that don't have a nose bridge and is two long rectangular cardboard flaps with designs on them. He and Archie are friends and Spock is excited about a class he's going to teach. He's been researching and preparing for some time. He says to Archie, "I haven't felt this good since 10 years after the wake," meaning someone he loved died and he has been miserable since. I am attracted to him and would like to have a relationship. He says, "Maybe you could help me teach the class, take a few sessions." I say, "I'd like that. I can do communication skills and my disability stuff." He says, "Then we could later co-teach it." I liked that a lot. I remember I could teach about dreams.
