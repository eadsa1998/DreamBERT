I was at some freaky place. I had two puppies called Chico and Widget and they were the same size. Some crazy stuff happened. I took Mom's car, but it was a manual, so I took the auto. I drove out to this place and got in and it was like a jail. I got Eli (Children of the Corn 3) and we went back, but the cops were chasing us.
