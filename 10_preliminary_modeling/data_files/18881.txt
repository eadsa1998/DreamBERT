In this dream I remember being in a room, brightly lit, with hardwood floors. I think I was standing up, but I'm not sure. On the floor there was an insect, at least it vaguely looked like an insect. It was reddish pink and had two black eyes and two tentacles coming out of its head. It was about a foot long, and its body reminded me of a balloon. It was oblong and it looked as though it would split or burst if I stepped on it. I had the idea to kill it, and I remember starting to go after it, but then the dream ended.
