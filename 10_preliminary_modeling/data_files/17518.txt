I dreamt about a tortilla camel.  I became close with a band member from my Tuvan instructor Jim Hale's band.  I was sitting on his lap.  Someone ate a bar of soap and acted crazy, making for a wild performance.  I tried to give Jim a kiss on the cheek but he didn't like it.  I had crossed some line.  I tried telling him about the Richard Bach book Illusions.
