I had a very bad headache. It occurred to me that I had read about someone having a dream about a way to get rid of a headache by pressing their fingers together. I decided to try it but then I couldn't remember which finger they used to press against their thumb. I thought it was the third finger so I started by trying that one. After only a few seconds I changed to my second finger and then to the first. Finally, I used all three at once. I was disappointed that it wasn't helping but then decided it was just because I didn't remember how to do it correctly.
