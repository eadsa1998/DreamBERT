I was working in a sports equipment store and I saw Zack in his flashy car parked in the parking lot. It was odd that he was sitting in the passenger's seat and I automatically got angry. I went out to the car and asked him what he was doing there and who the hell was driving. Just as I suspected, Alice the Bitch, his ex-wife, came walking up. I jumped in her face and started yelling, "What the fuck do you think you're doing, you sorry bitch?" Then I got control and turned to Zack. I said, "You're a fucking loser and you deserve to be with a bitch like that. I always knew that I was too good for a scum like you." Then I turned around and went back to work. I was so angry, I could not even concentrate. A while passed and I looked out the window. They were now parked in the middle of the parking lot and Zack was in the driver's side, which was closest to me. He was pouring champagne and as he lifted his glass, I threw a baseball as hard as I could. His window was down and the ball broke the glass right out of his hand. When he turned my way, I threw a second one and it hit him right in the face. I felt satisfied and went back inside. One of my friends was there. She was laughing so hard and she gave me a high five.
