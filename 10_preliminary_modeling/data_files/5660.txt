[1997-07-09] I fell asleep and then heard both of my toilets, upstairs and on this floor, having some problems. I heard all this water going all over the floor, both upstairs and downstairs and all kinds of stuff coming out which smelled kind of gross. The water was going everywhere, I couldn't remember where the shut off switch or faucet on the pipe was on either of the toilets and I felt I was going to drown in it.
