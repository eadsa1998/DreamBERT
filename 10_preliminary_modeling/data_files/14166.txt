I was at home and it was Father's Day tomorrow. I was sorting out the DVD's in the family room in a row. Then it was food, venick like (or however you spell it) and I arranged them into a circle. When I came back they were gone and Mom said she put them away before Tigger ate them. Ezra was coming back to her house to stay. I had to get my external hard drive. I had Your Love playing as I was packing it away. We went to a petrol station and this truck and a car had had an accident and were pushed to the side so they weren't in the way. Then it was just me and Mom there. We were going to get something for Dad and I said "those trees are gay". We were then outside this hospital and there were lots of tables. Nana had been at the hospital a while ago. Ezra, Dad and other family were there. There were these computer booth things scattered around and Ezra had made a quiz on them. Kate (Lost) was there and drank out of this cup and then spat back in. I was really thirsty (in real life too).
