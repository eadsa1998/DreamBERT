I was taking out Silver Dollars out of a pillow. Then later I was picking up money on the street, all change that people lost. I dreamed something of two or double of a kind. I met a lady that I was going to associate with as some kind of society. I was outside and I was surrounded by a gang of hoodlums. I yelled for help by calling someone by name. Then I kind of talked to the boys and they turned out to be good fellows and wanted to be my company. I saw Cecilia Lippert. She was walking down the street wiggling her rear like the twist. She was looking for me. I was walking with John Arendas (deceased) and I made off I didn't want to see Cecilia as we walked by her.
