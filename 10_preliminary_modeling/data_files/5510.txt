I was playing an organ in a big church in a loft high above the congregation. I believe it was a pipe organ, a bit strange because I've never had any training playing pipe organs, yet here a I am at the console, playing an original piece of music that I composed. Very discordant but at the same time very pretty. I was really doing a wonderful job and the minister came up to the organ and I don't remember why he did or what was said but all of a sudden I was down in one of the pews and there were people with dogs just literally running around, all through the sanctuary.
