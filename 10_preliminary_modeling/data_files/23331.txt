I was passing our house at twilight and glanced up to a lighted window. I grew cold as it came over me that I did not know in what room that light was burning. In a moment I was in the attic. I opened a scuttle and looked down into the unknown room. Dust and disorder were there; all was as if the place had not been occupied for years--save that upon a chair there stood a lighted candle! I started broad awake and lay trembling with dread.
