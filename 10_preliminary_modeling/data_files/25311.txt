 I'm in my bedroom with my friend Edith Sherman. We are engaging in sexual acts. I give her cunnilingus. There are two mattresses with no sheets in the center of the room. There is a lamp near the slanted wall that is shining its light towards the mattress. I pull Edith's legs and pelvis up onto the mattress, while her torso is on the floor. Her vagina tastes bad: salty. He clitoris only responds to certain types of stimulation. It becomes long and stringy, like a bean sprout or a piece of hair. <br/
