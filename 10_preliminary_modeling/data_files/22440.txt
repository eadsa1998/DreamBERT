I was with a friend in a place that I don't know (it looked like a gym), fixing the tables for a dinner that was going to take place there. There were more people, but I did not know them. Later I was with the same girl in an old bus on the Southern Highway. We were going by a place with a sign that said "Exhibit Club" and I, trying to think of where that name came from, was slow in getting off the bus. We went down and we started to walk. It was sunny. At the end, wit the same girl and two boys from the university, we were in the living room of my old home. It was somewhat dark. They were dancing, and I was kneeling by a couch, laughing.
