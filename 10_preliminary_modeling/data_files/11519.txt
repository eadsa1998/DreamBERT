I dreamt that I was walking down a street and someone stopped me and asked if I could do any kind of physical activity and I kind of made a motion as saying yes. Then I found myself in a big room with mats on the floor and people were wrestling, then one asked me if I wanted to and threw me on the floor. All of a sudden I found myself in another room where a boxing ring was and I was standing in the ring with big gloves on (and these gloves were on backwards) and I began to fight and was hit with a right across and the bell sounded. I woke up to the alarm going off.
