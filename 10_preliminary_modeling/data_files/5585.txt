[1997-06-02] I was at work and there was a new lady doing my counseling job and she had been a friend of mine a long time ago and she said "yeah, I'm doing this now. I go to meet with this guy S and he tells me how to handle different things." I said "yeah, I used to do that when I first started too" but I don't do that now cause I don't have S now. And it was like I missed what she used to have because things had changed and I remember how good they were for me in the beginning and how I used to like the job and how I don't like the job anymore because I don't have S the way she did. So I said "well, that's good."
