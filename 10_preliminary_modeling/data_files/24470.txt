In farm country I am one of the last survivors of a group starved, shot and burnt from their homes, Everywhere, the decaying dead rot in tall dry grass, We wait for death, I talk with the opposing force. A young man, friendly, gifted in mathematics, offers to end the fighting by settling monetary debts. He shows me how much we owe in relation to what is owed us. His side has wealth from lottery winnings, Quick calculations reveal the debts are equal, I accept his peace offer, stating I will tell the others if he does not kill me first.
