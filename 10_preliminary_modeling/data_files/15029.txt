I was going on a boat ride with Mom although we mostly swam. It took us five days to get where we were going. Rover was with us. Then there was like a road in the water - there were two sets of buoys on the far ends and two smaller sets of buoys in the middle to make it into two lanes. The weather was bad and stormy. Then we had to hold onto the big buoys and stay within the lane. I got sent underwater for "15 seconds" although it had been 20 and one more second and I would have died. Mom gave me a coat hanger and told me to bang this pipe to see if anything was stuck in it. I grabbed it out of the water and whacked it but nothing happened. Then this guy was with us and he was Mom's boyfriend or something. He was actually a swimmer. Mom was yelling at him and they broke up just before we reached a 'rest' save point. Then we were on the boat. Rover and Gizmo were cuddled up together. There was a German shepherd and some puppies and I picked one up. I held it like a baby and it was adorable. They sent them out but they kept coming back in. Some time later the guy from before had lost weight and now had a six-pack. At first I was just on a computer and saw some pictures but then it was real life. He hit on Mom and then on me and I said I wasn't interested. Some time before, I was on the internet and years ago I had this online game, called 'Hotie'? I had made it and it was for ages 12-14? I hadn't been on it for years and I had applicants from 2002-2009. I think the point was to choose yourself and some others and then you pick a sentence and then I give a list of 'muffins' and they would choose one and I would put the word at the end of a sentence. The 'muffins' were like round balls and were made of fudge, ice-cream, mint and then white and brown chocolate mixed together etc.
