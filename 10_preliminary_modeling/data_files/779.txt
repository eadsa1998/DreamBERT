Some heavy journey in the wilderness. Then, a young girl in a white satin bride dress comes into my shop. Everything is white. She is snotty and doesn't like me. She then goes into the next section of my shop, all white tablecloths, glasses, etc. She sits on red velvet. I think, "How beautiful." I then go to get in my car that I have finally gotten from my brother. It's a blue and white '55 Chevy with a continental kit. It's in good shape. It's punch hooked beautifully all over the outside. Both of my brothers are in the enormous backseat. Dwight is laughing and saying that the bride's brother doesn't want to marry me, but his family will force him to. He teases me because he knows I want to marry this guy. I think, "Hum, it could be interesting if we married," like it would be a challenge to get him to love me. I then tell Dwight the car is his. He grins and gets into the driver's seat. We start going. I grab at a styrofoam cup with coffee, cigs, ashtray, etc. and put them in my lap. I am sitting on a car seat that is sideways to the rest of the seats. Hot wax (pink) spills on my pant leg. Dwight drives us to a "turn-out" on a bridge that over looks the town of M City main street.
