It was a strange place. There was a table and I was on top of it applying eye shadow to another girl of my age whom I don't know. Suddenly everybody wanted me to make them up, but I couldn't because I didn't have cosmetics. There was a garden with a fence and many tables. A lady teacher of about 50 put out medical samples and gifts from the medical companies for us to take. There were many hair clasps in the shape of flowers. I chose one which was full of little flowers, and the other girls didn't want to pick any, but the teacher admonished them and they started to take them. There was a clasp shaped like a daisy which I liked very much, but I didn't ask for it and they gave it to another girl. I didn't know anybody. Suddenly on the table there were also plants with leaves. I took many, especially one with leaves that were red with green and white stripes. I wanted them for my garden and they showed me how to do it. Among the flowers there was a lilac thing that had been ordered by a girl. She took it, saying that it was beautiful. I wanted to touch it and it was plastic. I was happy with the gifts and I wanted more and more and searched the desks which were filled with papers to see if there was anything else. I was stunned when I saw the teacher with glasses and wrinkles on her face. It was the same teacher that I had for music, but she was older.
