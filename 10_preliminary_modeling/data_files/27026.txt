I was in a house with a lot of girls--it was on a main street where street cars ran. Across the street were four men and one of them knocked another one down and shot him. The men ran toward the house where we were and we were scared to death. Then two policemen were there protecting us from the bandits who had run around the house somewhere. The policemen had their pistols all ready to shoot if one of the bandits should appear. There was a street car waiting to leave right beside our house, but it wasn't going near my home. A friend of one of the girls picked her up, and I begged the girl to take me home but she wasn't going my way either. I kept trying to call my Dad to ask him to come after me. The policeman left and there were only two of we girls left in the house--we were afraid to go out on the street and wait for a street car for fear the men would return. There was a drunk under a back window of the house, and we hung out the window and tried to keep him quiet so he wouldn't attract the bandits attention to the house.
