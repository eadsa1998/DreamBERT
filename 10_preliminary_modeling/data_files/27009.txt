I don't remember how I got where I was, but I was standing beside a lake wearing my sister's best black print dress. I wanted to get across to the other side of the lake and was marooned on an island of some kind. In order to get where my friends were it became necessary to swim across. The first part of the water I went into was thick with slime and muck. As I got toward the middle though the water was clearer and rinsed me clean. I was worried about ruining the dress, but when I came out of the water it seemed to be all right and somehow didn't stick to me.
