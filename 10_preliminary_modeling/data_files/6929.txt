Stacking up clean dishes at the sink. As I pick up last plate think I'll have to take them to the kitchen to scald them and put them in the rack. I pick up the newspaper to finish it but the light in the room is inadequate. Top of lamp is missing. Living room too cool. While trying to find light enough, I see on table two brown wrappers with 4c red stamps. Think I must save them for Miss Ko. (Mrs. Ko. collected stamps for a charity) but examining them more closely see one is slightly torn, the other is printed on.
