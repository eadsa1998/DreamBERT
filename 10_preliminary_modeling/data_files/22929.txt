There was a huge Tudor style mansion (the term seems to fit even though I don't know what Tudor style is).  To get there I had to go through a part of town with very narrow streets lined with very tall (8-10 stories) apartment buildings.  They were multicolored-each apartment in the same building seemed to be a different color outside.  And there were an unbelievable number of people with their heads sticking out windows-out of almost every window.  They all seemed to be black, and they were all watching me.  It made me a bit nervous.  After that I had to walk through a street with ruins on either side, sort of like the Roman Forum.  Here I was afraid I was going to be attacked by muggers.  The mansion itself, though, when I finally got there, was a very enjoyable experience-though unfortunately I don't remember what made it so.  Some friend with a sort of British accent  was showing a group of us through the place, and it was fascinating.  In the process I formed a mutual attraction with a girl on the tour; maybe that accounts for the pleasantness, but I was also really taken with the place, and I believe I was going to live there or something.
