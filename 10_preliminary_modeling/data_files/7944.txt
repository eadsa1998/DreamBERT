I was in the kitchen backing chocolate chip cookies for Matthew as a reward for something. I don't know if I forgot about them or what but I came back to the kitchen and the two trays in the oven were very done. I had not even switched the bottom tray to the top yet so I took them out and then I noticed that there were different kinds on the one tray from the bottom. I realized that they were left there from our cookie baking day in December. There were snickerdoodles, chocolate chip cookies and something else. I had newspaper spread out on the kitchen counters and was spreading out these cookies. I ate one or two of them. Some other people coming through the kitchen would grab one and eat them. I said that I was baking them for Matthew. Matthew seemed to be younger than in waking life. BJ came in and said something about these other kinds being in there if I was baking chocolate chip cookies. At first I just kind of grinned at her, afraid to tell her what they were from. She guessed, ah. They were left over from cookie baking day. I said, yes they were. There was another child there working on some homework. At first it seemed like boy and I made some comment about the cookies being a reward and how well that works as a reward. Later it seemed that it was a little girl and she was working off the money that she had wanted and her parents had bought for her. She didn't realize how expensive it was. Somehow I lifted up a piece of paper or something to see how much it cost and it was $300+ dollars. I just thought it was going to take her forever to work off, that she had no idea how expensive that thing was.
