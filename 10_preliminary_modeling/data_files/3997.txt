["Younger man"]  I am standing near a young man, maybe 20 years my junior. He is some kind of sports person and I am watching his workout. We are attracted to each other. He asks me to sort out some papers for him. I do that. I wonder if we are going to sleep together that night. I assume we will, but no one has actually said the words. I have a wooden tent like accommodations all picked out in case. He says his Mother lives near by. We can stay at her house tonight.  I ask if she is going to mind us being together. He smiles and says it doesn't matter. I know now we are going to sleep together. The age difference bothers me a bit.
