["Lucid dancing."] I am backstage wearing a beautiful feather mask with very long black and white feathers. A feather elaborate headdress and a beautiful spangly outfit. I am in my wheelchair. The back curtains are pulled open and I come out on stage, dancing, spinning, doing wonderful graceful moves. The audience loves it. I am enjoying myself greatly. Then a group of able bodied dancers join me. We do this choreographed number involving tap dancing. I have a board where my foot pedals were and I tap with them. At one point, with balance help from two other dancers, I stand and do some dance moves. It is great fun.
