I did a scratchie and won $2250. I was reading about Dylan Moran on the net. I found some pictures from something I did. I was in them, but I can't read what it says next. I showed it to Mom. I went to this place in the woods and got this cabin in the woods. I was with Eugene, who was my boyfriend, but sometimes he was/looked like Robert Knepper. This guy there was creepy looking and looked a bit like Robert Knepper. I can't remember what happened for most days, but we suspected the leader guy of being dodgy. I 'remembered' having sex with Eugene near this river. It was actually a movie sometimes and that happened in the movie and I was imagining it, very vividly. Anyway, one night I decided I wanted to have sex with him. The lights in the cabin weren't working, but one little light came on. I was on the floor doing something, when Eugene came in. He lied down in the bed and was talking to me, while turning off the lights outside. I took my clothes off and went over to the bed and climbed on top of him. We kissed and then I realized the lights were on outside and someone was watching us. I got up and covered myself with a shirt. Eugene then found a camera under the cupboard and we realized they had been spying on us. I put my clothes on. We were packing up to leave. Earlier, I was going through a video camera that Dad had. There was a video of Mom on the toilet, pooping. I also found some video of Eugene and I having sex, but he didn't film it.
