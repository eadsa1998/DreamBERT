I was getting ready to go to work. Bob was tinkering with my car, so I took a walk to Tony Marlot's cafe. I asked Julia Marlot for a shot and coke. She gave it to me. I drank it and she gave me a free one then. I put a half dollar on the bar and she gave me the change as I walked out. I looked at it and I had about 4 dimes and some pennies. I thought to myself she made a mistake and gave me change for a dollar. I met a fellow on the way out. He asked me for 15 cents. I ignored him and walked out. When I got out on the sidewalk, a young fellow said, "You forgot to give the fellow inside 15 cents. He asked you. He won't like that, so I will have to get it." I thought for a moment and said, "I may beat up the fellow and still he may beat me up. I'm going to work now, so it's not worth 15 cents," so I gave the fellow 15 cents. I went across the street and the traffic was heavy. The drugstore man said, "We don't sell the paper, but we're getting it soon." I came home and went into our bedroom, walked thru a door and was in Yankua's bedroom, our Rivertown neighbor. Someone was in bed sleeping. I walked back out and jumped from the porch and was going to fly to my car. Ann said, "Judy is coming down the street. She wants to give you a kiss." I looked down the street in Rivertown and at first I saw a light and this light turned into Judy. She was running. Then Audrey and some other girl were running. They passed Judy up and came to me. One of the girls was down like doing the splits, but she was showing how she runs and it bothers her when she does. They were running very fast.
