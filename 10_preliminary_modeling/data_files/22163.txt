I dreamed I was a hippie. I dressed in an extraordinary way and told everybody that we had to propagate love and peace, that it wasn't right for wars to go on and that too many innocents suffered from political causes. Then I appeared in a war between the Arabs and Palestinians, in a battle. I was between the two sides sitting like an Indian with my arms folded. When the chiefs saw me, they stopped the fire and each one sent one soldier to get me out and I didn't want to get out, until they took me out by force and they continued fighting until everyone was dead. And I went to sit at the same place from which they had removed me. I heard a strong, terrible noise that scared me, and I awoke.
