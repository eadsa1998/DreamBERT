Nate dove into a pool and was caught by something strong and fierce, maybe a snake because he swirled and struggled in a downward struggle. I felt very detached. Then, I was sitting in my room and I heard a door in the back slam. Nate stumbled in clutching his stomach. He was in terrible pain. I went to him and he cried out in pain when I touched him. He said, "Call the hospital. I was attacked!" I was shook up. I tried to comfort him and looked for the hospital # in the phone book. I was looking in the yellow pages. I couldn't find it. I felt scared and frustrated. I talked to Nate. "It's going to be all right." He said, "Hurry, hurry, oh, the pain." I felt guilty because I realized that I had watched him struggle and didn't lift a finger to help him. I was also aware that the attack was meant for me. We were 1 block from the hospital. I said, "Can I help you over there?" He cried out, "No, get an ambulance because of the pain!," (possible internal injuries). I tried looking in the white pages, but I couldn't find it, and then I noticed the part of the pages in the "S's" had been tampered with. I felt ominous, like the attacker had done it. I tried the yellow pages again. In frustration, I called information. A tired woman came on and said, "I'll help you look for your number but I won't do it for you." I explained the emergency and she grudgingly agreed to find it while I was waiting. I said, "Oh, I guess I can't visit you because I'll run into your wife." He said, "Yes you can, I'll call when it's clear."
