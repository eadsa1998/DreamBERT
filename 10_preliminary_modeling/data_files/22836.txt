I am going to River City for a week.  It seems as though I am going to go on the plane and Uncle Joe is going to pay my way, which I don't feel right about.  But I am walking and have been walking for some time-roughly the distance from church down Marble, down Wistful to Harrison, and through City Park until about Malabe Park-though it seems farther.  It seems to be both approximately that route but also, at the same time, a dusty country road toward a big hill sort of like a road toward Jagged Mountain on Joe Duggan's paper route.  I suddenly realize that I am not taking any luggage and the only pair of shoes I am taking is my old tennis shoes.  I am hesitant at first about going back, but then I remember my job appointment (from the previous dream), so I turn back immediately.  On the way (on Wistful, I believe), I pass a little store with a little car I recognize in front of it.  I go inside, and Uncle Ben is in there buying something.  The roof isn't very high and slopes down below head level.  I am glad for the opportunity to get a ride back.  Technically, the car doesn't really look like Uncle Ben's, but it is very familiar, and I associate it with him.
