Children of the Corn 3 type of movie. Eli, his 'mother' and 'father' were the same people. The father started bashing Eli at the end of the movie. They had a boat and it was sinking. I think the father died. This guy called David came on. First it was Brad Pitt, then David from 40 Year Old Virgin. The narrator was saying that he was the town hero, and then he went crazy. He ended up in a mental hospital. There was a song playing called "St Elmo's Fire". There was something about Jesus. David had a split personality and his other half was called Robert Larry. There was apple crumble.
