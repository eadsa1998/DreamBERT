I was uptown in my hometown, and I was going to the movie, but I had two or three hours with really nothing doing. I went by this hotel which was being remodeled. They had a big sign out which said for tonight any rooms which were on newly remodeled floors were free. You could have the room for as long as you wanted. So I thought it would be nice to have a room to sit down in for a while until it was time to go to the movie. So I went in at the desk and they assigned me one. I went over to the elevator, which I thought would have an operator, but which it turned out to be self-service and I went on up to the 9th floor where my room was. I got off at the 9th floor and started looking for my room and part of the hall I was looking in wasn't very well lit, and I couldn't read the room numbers too well. I was looking around for a light switch and couldn't find one, but finally a maid came along and showed me which room it was. I went on in. It was a nice looking room except the furniture was a little bit disorderly and the beds weren't made up very well. The maid and I talked for a minute or two. Then I thought I would like a girl with me, but I didn't say anything about it. Then the maid, whose age was undetermined, sometimes she looked in her 20's, other times in her 40's. Anyway, the maid sat down on the bed and laid down on it and I thought that was pretty flirtatious so I thought I'd see how I could make out with her. And I did and pretty soon we were in bed together. One other detail -- when I first met the maid coming down the hall and told her I was looking for a room, she had a key by which she turned the hall light on.
