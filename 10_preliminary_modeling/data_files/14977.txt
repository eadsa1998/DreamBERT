Cory Monteith and I got married. We were at the old house but it was new. People were sleeping. It was night. We took this lounge bed out the front and we had sex. We lay on it outside. Then it was cold and I asked if we could bring it inside and we took it into the games room. As we passed the kitchen I saw that the oven light was on. I went to my room and checked my phone. I had over 30 messages and they were all from Mom and Dad. I had forgotten to take them to the wedding? I went back out to go to bed.
