[Just before going to Utah with Dave - April 19], after our weekend in Encinitas April 13.]  I dreamed I got up from bed with him, nude, I was standing in front of a mirror, like my full-length mirror.  Dave looked at me, or at me looking at my reflection in the mirror, and said, you don't have that great of a figure.
