I am trying to figure out how to simulate flight in zero gravity to show my class. My father suggests I get some swings and swing up high. When I start to fall back down, I'll feel free flight. I try it. They are surprised I can do it. Then I see something that belongs to Corrine in the financial aid office. Then Curtis of Nighthawks (the harmonica player), is watching me. I go to a small office where I'm locked in by him. I look around the desk. I am aware that I've found some secret things, a file folder with paper. A voice (male) on the telephone asks me some questions and I answer carefully pretending that I'm whomever he thinks he's talking to. I see tape cassettes in the desk drawer and I think, "Talk Southern." He gets suspicious. I stay there all night. Curtis comes to open the door and I have hidden under my clothes some papers that are incriminating. He's suspicious of me but I get away with it.
