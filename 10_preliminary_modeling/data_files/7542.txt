Mary is lying on a sofa reading a book. The head of the sofa is next to a stove. A kettle of water is boiling on the stove. I ask Mary if I may make her a cup of tea. She agrees. Then I pour the hot water from the tea kettle into a mug which is on the arm of the sofa at Mary's head. The tea spills, fortunately missing Mary. I apologize profusely and grab a towel and start wiping up the mess. Mary bursts out crying and seems to be taking the blame for what happened. I tell her it's my fault and not hers. She says she's going to quit taking this course. As I question her -- what course, where and why is she taking it -- she tells me she's taking a "Bad Boy" course in which she's supposed to learn how to drive out the "Bad Boy" in her. It's very complicated and I ask more questions, trying to understand what this is all about, when the dream ends.
