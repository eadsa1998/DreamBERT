I was watching an older man, but he tried to fool. He couldn't hit when a ball was pitched to him. He gave a mighty swing and missed. We were eating. I ate a big potato chip out of the frying pan and meat also. I picked Jack Lasko up. One arm and then let him fall and he said he hurt his back. I was very strong.
