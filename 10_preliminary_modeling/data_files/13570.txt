I was at home and it was the first day of school. I was getting ready and realized that my hair hadn't been straightened so I called Mom. She said that the hair straightener had been "nicked" but she was just about to come over. I was shaving my legs. I realized that I had no school bag or anything. I woke Dad up and Ezra was in his bed. Mom said Ezra had seen this dude who had said that Ezra's stress was due to being left home alone so this woman would randomly check to make sure someone was with him. I thought it was 6pm but I checked the time and it was 11am. I said we should go shopping for school stuff instead of going to school. Later I was at home and this creepy dude, who looked like the driver guy in Superbad, was outside so I got in the car and drove to Mom's. But I couldn't control the car and Ezra was making me drive erratically. We went to Midvale shops. Some people had been to a Britney Spears concert. Sean Astin (as Harrison Bergeron) had rebelled and was going to be killed. They trapped his head between two fridges and let this blue stuff out. He died. Then it was the future and there were other planets we lived on. There were some bugs and snakes somewhere and I screamed and ran.
