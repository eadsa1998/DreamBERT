I was in my kitchen. Very familiar place. Trying to cook something in sauce pan. It was kind of smoky in the room. I was just out of the shower and had my robe on and a towel on my head. One of my housemates came up behind me and surprised me by putting her hands around my chest. I didn't know what to do at first, then I decided to relax. The man was light and airy feeling. I never looked at my housemate, but I knew it was him. It felt comfortable and good in my house.
