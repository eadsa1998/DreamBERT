I am flying in Terence's plane. I am a little scared that there will be an accident. I am the passenger. First, we fly just fine. Then we get to close to the ground but we can't get higher because of the wires. I am nervous we won't see them and attempt to rise and get caught in them, or hit buildings or cars because we're so low. I cry out, "Look out for the building!" And we swing around it, barely missing it. Then the engine stalls. Terence just opens the hood and dinks around in it. He says, "It's nice we have such a compact little plane. Easier to fix." We go on.
