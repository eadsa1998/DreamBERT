Last night I dreamt that I was at a party. It was a small room, about 18 X 12 feet, with lots of lights, which were yellow. As more of the guests arrived, the place got hotter because to me the lights represented the sun and I thought that when 12 o'clock came, the temperature would be very high because when I go to the beach, that is the time when one gets more tanned. It was about 7 p.m. and we kept on dancing. I was with some very good friends of mine from different places, but they hardly knew each other. I remember that I often looked at my watch as though I were waiting for someone. I started to talk to a lady in green, fat and of a rather advanced age, and she continuously asked me why I had come alone and had not brought my girlfriend. She asked me her name and I told her that it was Edith and that we weren't going steady any more and were just friends. We hadn't quite finished the conversation when suddenly, as one more guest, Edith, came in. we only looked at each other. I wanted to go and greet her, but couldn't decide to do it because there was a great indifference between us. In the middle of the party, I was talking to her sister about places in Peru which I have never seen and we heatedly disagreed until the end of each song. Around 11 p.m. the heat was unbearable, so I decided to leave the party. I didn't say goodbye to anybody and got out, finding that it was raining, in contrast to what was happening inside. I don't know how, I found myself in bed, thinking that I was going to sleep very peacefully and the first one to disturb me was going to be told off because I very much wanted to sleep. It ends here.
