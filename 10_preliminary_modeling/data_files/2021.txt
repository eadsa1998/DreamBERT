I'm going up a mountain trail in my wheelchair. I see the crest of the mountain looks like a huge eagle-type bird. It's so real, I think I see real feathers. Then as I approach it, I see it is a real bird, only smaller now. I'm a little afraid of it. Now other members of my group come up. Each one tells me they have four or five in their group and have other things to do, so they won't be joining my trek. I am concerned and say, "I understand you'd like to do this other thing but everyone is pulling out and I can't make it with only two women to help in case my wheelchair gets stuck." The man (Tim) says, "Are you listening to what you are saying?" I say, "I know, but it's true."
