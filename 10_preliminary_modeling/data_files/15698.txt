Dan Palmer joined the forum. His username was Dan Palmer. He posted on the Welcome thread with a nice little introduction and said his birthday was 7 Jan 1978? Maybe the 9th. Anyway, he posted on a few threads and I was worried about him seeing my posts about him. Benjamin sent me a message on Skype saying like 'he sounds like you' because he'd said 'I'm awesome' and similar stuff in his intro.
