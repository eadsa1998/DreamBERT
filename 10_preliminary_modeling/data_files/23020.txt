I was clinging to a telephone pole in a harbor somewhere, as the water swept me about in wild currents.  There were ships in the harbor, and sometimes I thought surely I would crash into one.  And at other times I thought surely I would be thrown up onto the shore.  I couldn't imagine how I managed to ride over enormous waves that thrashed about on the surface.  Somehow I ended up on one of the ships -- unconscious, I guess -- and when I came to, I saw Norma Grimson standing over me and examining my teeth.  It seems she had predicted that I would lose my "eye teeth"--and sure enough, she was able to lift them right out of my mouth.  To my horror, all the others were also so loose that she was able to take them all out.  I was brokenhearted, and may have cried.  But she was smiling and reassuring the whole time.  She began to fit all my teeth together on a table, in the shape of a mouth.  It was like a puzzle-they all fit together in such intricate ways, I thought she really must have been an expert.
