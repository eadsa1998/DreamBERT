I dreamt I was in danger. I was on a fairly deserted street and this one guy kept following me. I kept looking over my shoulder then I started running, and ran into my boyfriend. In turn he started following the guy who was following me because after he saw him he turned around. I stood at the top of the street and watched him disappear around the corner. Then I started following him because I didn't want him to get hurt. Around the corner I turned they were having a boxing match, but no one got hurt.
