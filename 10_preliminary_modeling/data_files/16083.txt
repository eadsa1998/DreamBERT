Mom had brought me a Beauty and the Beast doll that sang the way Ariel (sp?) does. And I was, before I opened the box I was wondering where could the audio module be, because in Ariel it's in her fin. And when I opened the box, I saw that she was just like a regular Barbie Doll on top, but she had, she had like a thing without a tail. She had no legs. And apparently that was the sound thing for her. And then, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park. Anyway, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park, and she was singing louder than anything without a microphone.. This pen is driving me insane. She was singing as loud as she could without an amplifier, and it was just like that she had one. And then I walked in to her hotel room and I saw her and her kids kind of peeking around in there. And I got to see the outfit that she was going to wear to the concert, and I got to talk to her, and her voice was quiet, just like Sandra's voice. Anyway, I dreamt that me and Melinda's family ran into her family and just talked. And then I woke up.
