I was watching the first episode of season 5 of The Office. It showed the end of the last episode again with Toby in his neck brace, but it was actually his twin. The real Toby was coming back to Dunder Mifflin. I was in a car with Phyllis, Pam and others. One of them was a guy Pam used to date and he had lots of rings on and was kind of stupid. The camera crew had requested an interview with Toby's family, but they denied it. We stopped at a trashed bus stop.
