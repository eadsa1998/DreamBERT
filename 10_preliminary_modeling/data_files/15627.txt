I was at a school type of thing at an old house. We were put in pairs and had to have a baby or something. I was curled up on a lounge waiting for people to come back. Alexander Skarsgard and a girl came and saw me and approved. They wanted the names Tiffany and Tina for a girl and apparently they were very picky about who they accepted. I went into the games room and pulled out Monopoly, but it was not the British one. We didn't say a word to each other the whole time. We started playing and I rolled 21 and I had trouble counting then had to just skip to 21 since each side was 10. The lot was orange, but should've been green and then I ended up in jail.
