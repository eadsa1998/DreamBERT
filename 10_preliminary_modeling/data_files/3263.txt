It's time to go somewhere, but the bathtub had just been filled with warm, pleasant water. Oh well, we can use it later, only it won't be so warm then. The tea set is set up under the water already. Then Ginny throws herself into the tub and splashes around, showing me to spontaneously have fun. I smile and go out to tell people we'll be delayed for awhile because Ginny is bathing. I see a woman with long hair down to the floor and another woman cuts the length and it still touches the floor. The hair is luxurious, thick and silky. I admire it. I see my own hair and it sort of has some length to it, but it is thin and falls out easily. In fact, the hairdo is short now, not because I had a haircut, but because it falls out.
