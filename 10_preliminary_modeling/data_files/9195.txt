I was at the SAID conference. There were many people around, though Ben D and I were sitting with a small group of people. Someone said something about me that used to be true. When he heard this, he became very upset, got up, and walked away. I jumped up and went after him. He didn't want to talk to me. I felt as though he wanted nothing more to do with me ever. I kept trying to convince him that what they said is no longer true. That I have worked hard at changing that old, negative behavior. I asked him if we couldn't at least talk about it. He sat down in a chair with his arms folded across his chest in a very closed-body, defiant position. It didn't seem that he was going to hear or believe anything I had to say. I don't know if he was so angry because of the actual old behavior or because I didn't tell him about it. I kept saying that I continue to work on it and continue to make progress. I continued to ask him to talk to me about it. I was very afraid that he was never going to spend time with me or talk to me again.
