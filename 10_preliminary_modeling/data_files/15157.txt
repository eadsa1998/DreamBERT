Mom, Ezra, someone else and I went to this carnival thing which was all organized into different sections. We were looking for some people. Rover was there too. Darren and Rover were acting as spies? Rover and another dog had a conversation to confirm that he had a box of porn. The one on top had a cover like Not Another Teen Movie, except they were all fat. The cheerleaders were all black. I went to meet with others and then we were at a porno party which Dad was hosting. I was looking for my friends, one of whom was Neil Patrick Harris. Neal (Freaks and Geeks) was with another guy and I grabbed him jokingly and said "what are you doing here?!". A lady was talking to Ezra and then he was like 'oh, you're from Modern Family' and they hugged and I was thinking that I didn't remember her. Ezra said she was the one who "sleeps with Alan (from Freaks and Geeks)". To get an 'achievement', you had to get her to say a special nickname to you. Her name was Leannie Bird. Jason Segel was then there too and we were friends. I think he liked me. He ignored all the other people and kept trying to hang out with me, but I was looking for something and didn't notice. I complained to Dad that I forgot my phone and couldn't take any photos and he gave me a camera.
