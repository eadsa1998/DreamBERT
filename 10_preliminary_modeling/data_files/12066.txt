There was an assessment thing and something called Cubance. There was an excursion. On the bus, the teacher was choosing people to meet some celebrities. I remember Calvin and Silas got picked. We went to this 'hotel' place, except it wasn't a hotel. The people who got picked were allowed somewhere special. These people snuck me into the place because Calvin wanted to talk to me. Then I was in a car with Mom and it was night time. These people broke into somewhere. And there were weird religious people.
