I was riding a bicycle with a boy who is a student here at school and we were going to the movies. The surroundings were unfamiliar and we both suddenly realized there would be no place to put the bikes, so we returned. On the way back, however, he had to cross a bridge and when we got to the middle of it, it opened like a draw bridge, only too fast for us to get off. We both fell into the water, which seemed to be a canal. The water was very clear ad green like in a swimming pool and it took a lot of effort getting to the surface.
