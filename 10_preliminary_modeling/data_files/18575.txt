There was a girl singer named City Girl. She wrote personal letters to God with a light, aqua-blue, fat magic marker. One letter said: "Dear God, You are not here. You are not here. Love, City Girl." She was asking God to come closer to the beach where she was wearing a white hip-hugger bathing suit. And she was dancing by herself on the beach--very provocatively. She had her entourage with her. One was an Indian woman who didn't have her "hide your face" outfit, so she draped beach towels around her head in the fashion of women from ancient India. I found a tattered piece of paper with sitting on the floor. I said, "Is this yours?" I said, "Dora told me." Liz was in the high school office tacking green tickets to the bulleting board. It was a free concert sponsored by God to benefit unfortunate children. It starred Kid Rock and City Girl. The time of the show was 7 p.m.
