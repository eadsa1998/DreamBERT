I was at a party. Inside there was a big section of water and a few square blocks floating around to rest on. There were fish in the water. I accidentally went underwater and saw what looked like a hammerhead shark and I told some people near me about it and we moved to the edge. A crocodile ate someone. Everyone started rushing to get out. There were no doors. Supposedly there was a portal thing -- a guy ate someone's head to open it, but nothing happened. The crocodile came and got him. I tried smashing a window but it didn't break. We managed to open it and then I ripped off the hinges and the flywire and we crawled out. There were cars in the driveway (and the house looked really old). There were two motorbikes and a fancy black car. Jewel Staite was then with me and she grabbed some keys from inside and gave me the one for the car. The crocodile poked its head out the door. I remembered that my phone and keys were inside and wanted to get them. It started coming toward me and the passenger door wasn't closed, so I quickly closed it. I couldn't get the key in, but the car still came on. I drove off, but it was really slow. I tried to hit the crocodile but it kept dodging it. I waited at the top of a road and a car came and then I kept going. A guy was trying to get out of his driveway and honked. I yelled out "I didn't see you, sorry!". There was a woman in front of me driving slowly, so I overtook her. Then it was a movie/show. A kid drove to an oval and there were triplets, two of which were called Claude and Clyde. One of them was stupid. The kid told them to get in the car. The crocodile was circling them. A pedophile guy smiled at it.
