My mother and I were driving to church for an evening service. We got to the front of the church when I realized we were supposed to pick up my boyfriend. I told mother to go into church and I would pick up my boyfriend. The next scene, my boyfriend and I were entering the church. The setting was very familiar to me. As we started in to take our seats, I noticed 3 boys sitting in the back row. I had some sort of obligation to one (whether I had a date with them I don't know). Since we would have had to pass him, I told my boyfriend that we had better go up to the balcony. As we reached the top of the stairs, a brick or stone came through the small window in the balcony. The dream ended.
