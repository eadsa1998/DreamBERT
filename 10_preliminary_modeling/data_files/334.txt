I'm sitting in on this high-school class. [I don't remember why I'm here, but it's sort of a matter of circumstances.] They're studying science, parts of the atom and chemistry. It's a room where the teacher is at the bottom and the seats go up like a theater, quite steep. The teacher (actually I think there's more than one) is asking questions and I can answer most of them, that's fun. Then they stop - I guess for a study break - and I go to the opposite side of the room and sit with this male teacher, who's talking to a few of the boys separately to find out if one of them is responsible for something. I'm just waiting for class to be over so we can get on with something. I live in a sort of community house with several other people. I'm trying to work out how this TV (or something) antenna works, trying to get a better picture (or reception?); I pull out the 2 ends till they're even, that's not much help, then the phone rings and a woman wants to know something that I have to go find out about. While I'm talking to her I realize that another fixture has an antenna, it's attached to the column here and pulls out sideways. I just give it a tug and find it's longer than it looks, I didn't think it had that much length to it. But I go off, and I think I know the answer to her question but I get distracted in the bathroom, talking to somebody else. Then she leaves and I'm dawdling. Princess Diana walks in, someone shouts from outside, "Who is keeping this line on hold?" and I have to go. I'm supposed to be in this one bedroom on the left side, center of the house, and I like it best, but there's been a mixup and someone is shuffling people around. This young man has been put in here with me and we've both got beds so we've spent one night in here, but now I'm overhearing the landlady saying she's going to put me somewhere else. That's not fair, I was here first.
