I was in Ireland below the Rock of Cashel. I rested under an oak tree near a ruined monastery in a big cow pasture. I left my day pack under the tree to go to see the old stones. When I returned, two people were under the tree, our librarian and an unknown young woman, glasses and thin. I gathered up my things and left.
