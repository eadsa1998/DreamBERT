 I'm at the Uptown Mall in Oak Valley. There is a man at a stand selling jiggle sticks. My brother Wally and I walk by. The man has a jiggle stick for 59 cents, and one with a reel for $20.00. He is showing them to another man. Wally goes on to an animal or bird restaurant. The other man buys the rod for 59 cents. I ask the seller if he has any more of those rods. He says no, it is too early in the season. I have been holding a jiggle-stick. It has become tangled up. I try to straighten it, untangle it. My grade school classmate Brownie Bruny is there with her father. She looks at me at doesn't recognize me at first. She remembers me as a big dork. I go to get Wally. My mom is there, with my sisters Heather and Ramona.
