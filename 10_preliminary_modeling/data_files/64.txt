There's an outdoor fair of some kind. Loretta's there and has something in a bag she wants to share since somebody else didn't or couldn't take it. We talk to somebody. I have to go somewhere for a while - it involves riding home on a bicycle and doing some errands. I'm going to return some books in the OL chute but as I go into the drive I see Muriel [Brown], wearing red pants, (and some other woman), standing in the driveway, I guess just passing through. Rather than go past her to the chute and have to speak, I cruise past at a distance and don't return the books. There is some question about doing an errand at a much greater distance, but I conclude I don't want to go all that way on a bicycle - though I can - today, since I want to get back to the fair. I also go into a restaurant. I'm not intending to stay, but somehow I do have a cup of coffee or something and am pleased about it. The waiter (this place is in the neighborhood somewhere, and the waiter, if not gay, is young and in keeping with the atmosphere) brings the check and, oddly enough, change as well. There's a stack of coins on the check - or is it 2, as an alternative? - in the amount of $1, in case you want to make your own change. I'm concerned about the bill, since (as is presently true) I only have $1 and some change on me. It crosses my mind that I could just take this money but I decide not to and go back to the fair.
