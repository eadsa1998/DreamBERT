At Father Andrew's house: a party: He looks different; has strange little ear deformity; he seems very compulsive. I stay on longer to take home a baby crib; he shows me his room; Fr. James is there too; I help him sweep his room I sweep up empty sheik box, and he helps me with tax forms; he is very compulsive about dates; earlier talk about me being such a good Latin scholar.
