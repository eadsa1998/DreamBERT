I met a dark-haired woman about 25. I left her at her house. Later I was at a printing plant. A press was running and the type fell out of the form. I did not stop the press because I was carrying something, and I reasoned that the press would not be damaged if I let it run until I put the packages where they belonged. My mother came and asked me if I know where that woman whom I had accompanied earlier lived. After reflecting, I had a mental picture of the house, and I directed her to it.
