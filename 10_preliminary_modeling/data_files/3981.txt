["Steve McQueen and me."]  Steve McQueen is cool and aloof. He has all the women falling for him. I am a shy young woman and know I haven't a chance with him. But he seems to be attracted to me in a casual way. He lets me hang out with him. He insists I cut my hair very short. It already is a short ball of curls, with multiple colors in it. His mother laughs at me as she mimics snipping my hair down to the scalp. She takes a snip out of it in the front. I go to him and say why do I have to cut my hair? I like it this way. This is pretty brave of me. He grins and I know it's ok.
