["Sleepy and tired."]  I am in a single bed. I'm very tired and want to go to sleep but I have a visitor come. Wayne. He sits on the bed and we chat. He says he's gone back to school, a community college. I ask what's his major. He says "Preteen." I am surprised but agree it's a useful major. Another visitor arrives. My cousin. He sees Wayne and is jealous. They chat with a bit of an edge in their voices. I say I have to go to the bathroom and leave them there. I find the bathroom. A woman is in the shower. I wait. She comes out and I am so sleepy I can hardly stay awake. I know I should go back and "rescue" the men from having to talk to each other but I smile a bit mischievously and think hell, why not let them sweat. I talk a moment with the woman and go back to take my shower. But another woman is in the shower. I am a bit annoyed as I am so tired but I let it go. I wait.
