My wife Ann changed her clothes. She was nude where my friends could see her on two occasions. Frank Kogler was walking with me. All at once he put his fingers into my mouth and pulled my filling loose from my front tooth. I was with a group or party of friends and relatives. It was a wedding party. I was told to go see M. Monahan.
