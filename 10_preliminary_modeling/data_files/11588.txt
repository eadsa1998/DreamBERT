I was climbing up a mountain slope through a dense forest of evergreens. It was dark and cold and a thick mist hung low in the woods. I had the feeling that I had been climbing for hours and hours. In some way although it was not actually visible, I could see the top of the mountain, a great, white gleaming mass of ice and snow. I felt somehow that everything was against my ever reaching the top, but at the same time I had an odd feeling of confidence in the fact that nothing could stop me from reaching it. Next I found myself at timberline and looked back down over the miles of forest through which I had climbed. I suddenly felt marvelously happy and laughed and shouted, "Fools, fools," at person or persons unknown below me. Then I turned again toward the summit which now seemed very near and awe-inspiring in its beauty. I woke feeling very lighthearted and was quite disappointed when I found that I had been only dreaming.
