I was watching The Soprano's. Tony and some others were in a pool. There was a part they couldn't see and it was swirling. One noticed and they tried to get out and they managed to. Then it showed Carmela at their house. Her character was called Edie though. Tony was away and I was thinking that I hadn't seen Meadow and the others for a while. Mom bleached Gizmo and she shrunk. The top half of her was permanently changed to white.
