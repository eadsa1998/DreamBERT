Most of the dream takes place at night. I'm running continuously through a place that looks sort of like my town. I half realize I'm dreaming, but not really. I just remember thinking that it's so easy to run in a dream without getting out of breath, and how fun running is in dreams. Although it looked a lot like my town, I get a feeling at some point I was a long way from my hometown. I just remember asking someone where the bank was. Since I knew I was dreaming, I wanted to rob a million dollars from the bank and "play liar liar" was what I called it (I don't exactly understand why, except that in the movie "Liar Liar" Jim Carey played the part of a lawyer who couldn't tell the truth). Having fun playing cops and robbers in my sleep, for real. I never got to the bank or anything. Again, if I really knew I was dreaming, I would have known that I didn't need money in the dream world and just done whatever I wanted. Oh, there were also a few things about lucid dreaming I thought up, during my dream. I remember thinking, at one point during my dreaming, "I wonder if I can hypnotize myself while I'm dreaming so I'll be different in some way when I wake up," and someone told me that thinking of some of your idiosyncrasies in real life will make your dream stronger when it's fading. Somehow it worked for me, but it was so crazy, it probably worked only by the power of suggestion (besides, I was thinking of things like, "I don't shower enough" as idiosyncrasies).
