["Little Aliens can't be trusted."] I am in a spaceship. I don't really know what I'm doing, but I am trying to figure it out. A man, Charleston Heston, has more knowledge of how to make the ship work. We team up. I ask him to help me. He agrees. We like each other. He needs to activate something. But then we are landing on an alien planet which is covered with bushes that have many pink flowers on them. I open the space ship door, to look out and see a group of tiny aliens maybe 2 feet high, that look more like round faced elves. They are tricky and want to get in but I don't yet trust them. I call out to one, her name is Barb, to ask for her help, even wondering if that is too much trust. We hurry to get the systems working so we can leave this planet.
