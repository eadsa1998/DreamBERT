I dreamt my parents were going to some sort of performance.  They knew it would be awhile so had things arranged that the Thai restaurant would have things ready for us after closing.  I was amazed that they were willing to do that for us.  We had dinner outside, it was quite elegant.  Then we went into an interesting building with counters.  We talked to my brother Stuart, and it was surprisingly easy to convince him to break up with his fianc√©e Sheila.  When we were leaving, Sheila was there.  She and Stuart said short, unemotional goodbyes.  Sheila was obviously a little angry but things were still polite.  She'd lost a lot of weight and looked pretty good.  I considered saying goodbye to her, but just walked past without saying anything.
