Dora and I had pushed our bicycles up onto the roof of a house. Dora took her bicycle up via the tree and I went up the least slanted rooftops. We met at the top. We were in different places. I could not see Dora. I walked across one roof and looked while Linda and Marianna had been working. Linda's newest store was on Lafayette. The entrance on Crosby. Marianna had been cutting out wooden dolls with a chainsaw. Linda was getting a show ready. Lots of little dolls and stories and photos she'd cut up for the stories. About the people not having money for a place to stay--so one person checked into the mental hospital and everybody slept in/under the bed with him. There was a picture of the guy in bed with a blanket and so many other faces cut out and put in there with him. There was a break with a fashion show of Linda's dolls. Soho-ish ladies were there. One had on a lightly sequined pale green dress with buttons and labels across the back. 4 labels on back, one on front. "Medicaid" one said. She was a high-class society lady trying to look hip. Linda had a sister named Lee--who used to be a crack head and lived in the park. Now she was a skydiver and adventure enthusiast. There were dolls to paint. One person said, "This should be relaxing," and I said, "You have to concentrate like if your ears are real dirty and you're trying to clean them out and you just can't get them cleaned out." "A good analogy," Linda said. I was painting in the girl. ??? Dora. He said his Dad was killed by a drunk driver and I told him about ??? Marianna had found my old invites. They did not invite me. William was driving. He had a dark blue mustang. It was parked in the yard. There was a beautiful butterfly painted in the intersection of the road. A mysterious person had painted it.
