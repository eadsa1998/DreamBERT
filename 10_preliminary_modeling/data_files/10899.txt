I remembered more of this dream than usual. It is a good example of how the scenes change. Usually all but one or two are forgotten. In this dream I came late for lunch to the cafeteria, bought steak, potatoes, peas, etc. Bill $1.05. I sat with some friends who left shortly. I was next in the chapel singing the words to a bib. Lit. theme which I held in my hand--not my own theme, the name was that of a man. Another girl played the piano. An organ student came in at 1:05 to practice. We (who?) went over to the recital hall where my singing teacher was auditioning on the violin with a quartet. Soon there was a whole orchestra and we found that we had missed the overture to Carmen. A group of singers were putting on a concert version. Saw the first act in English. Don Jose was a short blond boy who kept getting shorter, ending the scene with the words, "I walk just like my mother."
