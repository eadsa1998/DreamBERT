I went to a second 'FrightFest'. I had a full pass but it was a different image. There were not as many films and didn't go for as many days. I was seeing Stalled again. The cinemas weren't enclosed and it was like a screen, some chairs and then two rows of chairs right at the back. I saw Dan Palmer and some other people involved there. There was a girl second from the end in the first row and I sat next to her, but didn't sit entirely on the chair. I asked if someone was sitting there and she said no and she seemed friendly. I got comfortable. Something was playing on the screen but it was like trailers and interviews. Something happened and Dan got on a bike and was chasing after someone. I had something and he took it off me and I was squeeing inside and Christian James and the girl started recording it -- he recorded with his phone and she recorded with her iPad. A fat guy was there too. Somehow I got involved with the short film and then it was edited and done. We missed the film though. Dan was walking up to me and I was getting nervous and excited. He was just chatting to me about stuff. They also got my name for the credits of the short and I was excited about getting something else on IMDb and being right under Dan's name on the short.
