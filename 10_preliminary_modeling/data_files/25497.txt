 I'm on a farm with people, including some friends. We talk about chickens, and there are some chickens there. If one person kicks the back of another person's shoes, sperm comes out of the toes of the person who was kicked. I am in a school where one of my old basketball coaches, Todd Banner, is teaching second grade. The kids in the class are having a meal. Todd is dressed in white pants and a long sleeved, yellow and red patterned shirt. He talks about "bloodied toilets" for the girls if they need them, and other bathrooms for boys and others. His only requirements are that the students chew and eat.
