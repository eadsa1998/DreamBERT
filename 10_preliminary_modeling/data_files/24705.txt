It was the same dream I recorded on 1/20/97 at 8:22. ("I was in the dining hall at my camp and we were singing camp songs really loudly and having a great time. Then the background changed, and I was in a forest under the stars with my sleeping bag, when I realized that I forgot to pack my clothes. The background changed again, and I was in line with my camp friend to vault. She said, "Well, if your mom brings cool clothes that's great, but if she doesn't you can borrow mine." I then saw my mom rushing by and I asked her to make a list of the clothes I wanted.") Except that before I got to the dining hall, I was in a bus, and they let a kid drive the bus and we got in a crash. Setting: In my cabin at camp, and in a strange metal bus. Characters: My parents, my friends at camp, many kids I didn't know, my sister, a bus driver, tons of unknown pedestrians. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, sad, worried, jealous. I felt happy and jealous when I met my friend, because she didn't want to talk to me, and later I felt angry, sad and wounded.
