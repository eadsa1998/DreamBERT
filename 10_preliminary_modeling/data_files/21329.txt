I was out hunting. I saw a hawk sitting on a tree. I had a double barrel shotgun, but only one shell in the gun. I pointed the gun at the hawks and it didn't shoot because I pulled the wrong trigger. The hawk started to fly towards me. I aimed the gun at him, but the gun wouldn't go off. The hawk turned into a duck and disappeared behind the old brick schoolhouse of my boyhood days. I was out hunting again in the fields of my boyhood days. I put a lamppost in the center of the street, which is narrow and then I looked how narrow the lanes were on either side of it.
