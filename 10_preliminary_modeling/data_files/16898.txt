Next door, on a street that reminds me of Amsterdam there's the premises of a society of artists. They are young and arrogant - slightly annoying people - they think they're great. I go over there for some reason. They publish a magazine about themselves. It's a slick marketing campaign. I meet one of the artists who tries out his sales tactics on me, but I won't have it. I bring him down with sarcasm. He responds with even more sarcasm.
