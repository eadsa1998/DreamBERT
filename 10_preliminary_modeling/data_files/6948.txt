I asked, "did I ever tell you about my exam for a teacher's certificate in Colorado?" I tell the story exactly as I remembered it when awake but couldn't think of the question, "which of the states where you have taught has the best educational system?" See a picture of 5 or 6 men on the state board. (This exam was in Denver in 1919.)
