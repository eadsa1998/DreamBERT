["Ashes, ashes, we all fall down."] I am in a house. I suddenly notice that the sky is black as if it were night, but it is still daylight. I am concerned. What is happening? I look out the window to get a better view. Now I see black snow like things falling down from the sky. I wonder if they are ashes from a fire, or toxic poisonous stuff. I go into another room and am organizing things. I see index cards I can use to write notes on.
