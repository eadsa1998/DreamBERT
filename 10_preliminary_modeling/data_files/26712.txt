 I'm in water. I see a picture of a ferry ship. Something is unique about it. Others are with me, including my brother Wally and friend Paul Jones. There are some mattress/floatation devices. Wally craftily manages to stay on top of his mattress when it flips over. There is a wharf on one side of us, and a reddish building on the other side where the picture of the ship is. I walk into a casino with other people. There is a table where one person is playing blackjack. He is someone we know, and gets paid off well. Others and I join. I try to sit at the first hand at the right end of the table, but my acquaintance Bill Vanderbil is playing there, he is just absent from his seat right now. I move over to a spot in the middle of the table. The game is poker. I get two pairs: aces and kings. I draw one card and get a king, for a full house! My acquaintance Geoff Hamilton is the dealer. I'm surprised to get paid eight-to-one for the full house. Geoff draws a few cards. I see the draws three 4's, and that he has a four in his hand, for four 4's, which beats me! I'm a bit confused, because this has been divided into two hands, and though he has four 4's, I'm still going to get paid for my full house, because they occur on different hands.
