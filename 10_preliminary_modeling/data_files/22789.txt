I am with Patty, Doug, Jimmy Creagar and Jimmy Duggan, and possibly others, in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.  We go through some sort of house-type museum.  There is a lady upstairs who doesn't seem to like me, and when we come downstairs I look up just in time to see two metal ornaments which she has dropped from the second floor landing rushing down at me.  I catch one, and the other crashes to the floor.  With this delay, I am the last one out of the museum.  When I get to the car, a station wagon with Mrs. Witherstone driving, kids are piled up in the back seat almost as high as the ceiling.  Mrs. Witherstone, however, is the only person in the front.  I figure there must be some reason for this, so I tell her I will ride on top of the car.  I sprawl out on my stomach on top of the car, but as she accelerates, I start sliding off, so I jump off before we get moving too fast and run alongside the car, keeping up quite easily.  Next, we are downtown shopping and we come upon two "pee-pee stations" side by side jutting out onto the sidewalk.  The front wall of these was made of almost clear plastic-sort of milky translucent but not completely transparent; nevertheless, you could see through.  Jimmy Creagar went into one, and Patty into the other.  Doug and Jimmy Duggan watched intently from outside.  I needed to go too but had no intention of making a show of myself.
