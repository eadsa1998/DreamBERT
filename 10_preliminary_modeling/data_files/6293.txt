I was at Fenway with a childhood friend who I haven't seen in over 10 years. Bucky Dent was coaching third base. While the game was going on he came over to the seats and asked me what my name was. The whole time the game is still going on but in a way that didn't make sense. I can't remember why it didn't make sense. The next thing is we're standing in a living room. He's signing autographs and giving me all the baseballs that he signed. It was much longer but by the time I wrote it down I could only remember this small chunk. I do remember seeing this same scene over again about 5 or 6 times.
