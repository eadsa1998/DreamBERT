Mom was babysitting a kid who was about 3-4. We were at a big house. I was in bed and got up to see the kid crawling around. I called out to Mom and we looked for it. Eventually we ended up outside shops on a road and the kid was right near the road. I went near her and she walked in front of a truck and was decapitated. The body was still standing though and I was shocked.
