I was walking down a very nice street in C--. The houses on it were attractive and there was an air of middle-class substantialness about them. I noticed the pretty lawns and trees lining the walk. As I was in the market for a house I decided to buy one of them. But suddenly I noticed railroad tracks to my left and the atmosphere seemed to change. I looked over to where the houses had been and then everything seemed to recede in the distance. There were hills and little buildings and winding paths.
