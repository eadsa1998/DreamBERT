 I'm fishing with another person. There are bystanders there. I use a spinner bait. It may be a Mepps. It goes on the surface during the retrieval, and then I use it in combination with a bobber. I get a hit. The fish pulls me in! It fights awesome! The line doesn't break. I have hooked a white duck! It comes after me. I kill it by breaking its neck. I also kill other ducks.
