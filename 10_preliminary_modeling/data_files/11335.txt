My mother and my aunt stopped in at a department store to do some shopping (the outside reminded me of Taylor's). While I was waiting for them to come out I watched some colored people play a hide and seek game -- one would hide behind a pillar and the other would try to find him. After I had walked down the street quite a ways the thought came to me that I had lost my aunt and mother because I didn't get back in time to meet them where I had said I would. Later I finally did meet them. They looked as if they had gone to the hairdresser's and gotten new hairdos. told them that they looked great and that there appearances had changed. My mother told me that the hairdo's hadn't changed their appearances. When I got up close to them I agreed with her. My mother had on a cheap skimpy dress that I thought I could almost see through. I thought that I almost could see her cunt. When that thought went through my mind I thought jokingly that it was an incestuous idea. I noticed that there was hair on her leg. I didn't feel proud of her.
