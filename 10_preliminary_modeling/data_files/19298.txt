I was staying at my grandmother's house for some reason and my grampa told us that later on some business partners of his were coming over and to be sure they don't see you or your face. I laid in my bed and could see across the hallway to an empty bedroom with a green bedspread on the double bed and tan carpeting. I got up to get a drink out of the bathroom and glanced out the window. I heard screeching tires and soon black cars sped in front of the house and stopped by the driveway. I shouted, "They're here!" and went back to my room and hid in my bed, knowing if they saw me, they'd kill me.
