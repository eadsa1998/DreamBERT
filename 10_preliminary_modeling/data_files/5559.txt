[1997-05-17] I'm in this thing called the Runway at Redwood, its between the dining room door and another door to the main part of the building where the classrooms were. And there are lockers and they're made out of wood and another door which leads outside. In the middle of the runway were these great big, structures made of a like Tinker Toy material almost four feet high. You could take your hand and grasp these pegs, these things and take them apart. And they said, "and you guys gotta help out because we only have 10 minutes to get this runway clear because there's going to be a lot of people coming through here, we've got to get these things taken apart." I pulled on one and it came apart pretty easily. So first I was at one end of these things trying to help out, and there were a lot of others helping too, some ladies that are head consultants that work with us. And to my surprise, I pulled on the Tinker Toy-like peg and it came out of the 2 ends it was connected on, and it came off the structure pretty easily, but I didn't have anything to put them in, so I had about 4 or 5 of them in my hands and I was trying to figure out where to put them. I started out at one end, couldn't figure out where to put them and then I went to the other end, see how long it is, how much progress people are making with this thing. It was pretty good, it was going pretty fast but the project never really ended because I woke up.
