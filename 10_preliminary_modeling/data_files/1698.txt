The boss, who is a vampire, I think, calls me in. I'm in the middle of preparation. He tries on a collar. His helper tries it on and says remember, I have a very short neck. The boss smiles and says with pride, "I have a very long one, of course." I enter and he says, "I might ask you to recon the cost of the dinner." I say, "Oh, I can already. If your figures are correct, and I know mine are, we should make a profit of over half the cost on the dinner."
