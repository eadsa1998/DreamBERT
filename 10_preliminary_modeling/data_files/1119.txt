I am very angry. I see my old diaries and journals and I'm aware that some people have read them without my permission. I say to them, "I am very angry. I trusted you." I feel their guilt and I feel somehow that it's at least partly my fault because I left them out unattended. I feel good to say I am angry. [BL]
