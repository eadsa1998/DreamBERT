I was in a class- supposedly my last before graduation.  The class was to split into two groups.  One sat while the other acted, and then they switched.  It was something we'd done before.  Five or six kids crouched below the front seats near the stage to avoid being picked for the first group.  Our teacher was a black woman named Nina.  For some reason she had to leave, and so my boyfriend's brother Jeff and I were supposed to take over, since he was good at art and I'd already graduated.  We went into a multipurpose room.  One of the girls looked familiar.  She recognized me too, and then I realized who she was- Marissa from fourth grade.  I was messing around doing the splits, and she made a comment as to being able to do them at least as well.
