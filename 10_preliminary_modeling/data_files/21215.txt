Ann had a horse named Progress on a sheet. She was to play. She wrote "run" in front of him. The phone no. 17?? was the one she was to call in to. I had one picked and gave Ann the name and she was to play 5 on it, but I can't remember the name. We had a little blonde boy baby. I told Ann, "Now we have 2 boys and 2 girls." I was at Tom Lasko's home. Ed was talking of buying a 21 inch tv. They had small trees in the house and it was hard to get by them. You had to brush by them to walk thru the room. Bob was playing ball with a board for a bat. I said, "I'll find you one," and I found some old bats on some dump. One of them fell apart when I tapped it. I was driving my car over tracks. I met Peter Arendas and I talked to him and asked how he worked and said "Days, afternoons, and nights." I was looking at the race entries and then I looked at the time and it was 1:45 p.m. I said, "I must hurry because I start work at 2 p.m." Then it dawned on me I was not working that day. I saw the results in the paper. A man shot another man. His wife took the money and ran with it. The murderer then shot her. I was watching this. He spotted me and wanted to get rid of all witnesses, so I started to run between buildings and he tried to get a bead on me. I was afraid when I was running that he would shoot me also. I came to a lit up store. I ran into the place and told the occupants that they should call the police because a man and woman were shot on the hill. I then went for a window to get out the back way so the murderer would not see me come out. A boy came to me as I was going out the window and said, "The police don't believe you." I said, "They'll find out. I'm going out." There was a pink in my dream. I can't remember what it might have been, a pink horse. I was talking to Kucera and he does a lot of giggling and we were imitating his giggle. I came by Margaret. I put my hand around her hand and pulled her close to me with same. She was short, about 4 ft. tall.
