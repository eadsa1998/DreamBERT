 I'm in Carter School. I'm walking down the upstairs hallway. There seems to be a dance going on. I walk by the third grade classroom door and say hi to my old teacher Liza Minikel, who is at her desk. I may have been at the dance. I walk down near my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's door, which is open.
