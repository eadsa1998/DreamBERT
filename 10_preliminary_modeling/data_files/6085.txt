I had a dream with this guy who a friend of mine likes so much. I don't even speak to him. I just know him. In my dream this Greek guy was in Portugal with me and my Portuguese friends. Somehow we are in this house with many rooms and he is in the living room just staring at the wall. Meanwhile my four girlfriends and I are trying all sorts of clothes and we came out to the living room to get his opinion. The funny thing is that we never came together, always one at a time. And that's about how far I can remember.
