I had a dream that I was in the main building holding a key. I knew it was a key to get into one of the dorms, only on, the one I lived in. I walked out to Langton because it was closest and tried my luck there. The key opened the door and I was thrilled, until I saw about 100 boys draped all over the furniture. They told me that I didn't live there I was so scared I went back to the main building. I tried to figure out my schedule, which I didn't have, as usual. I can't really recall all the details, but I remember waking up and thinking that it was an "outrageous dream about school."
