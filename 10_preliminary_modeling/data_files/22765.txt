I dreamed I was at the beach, but it wasn't a beach I knew. It was a strange beach because suddenly the sea came both in front and behind the sand on which I stood. However, it didn't look threatening. Little by little I found myself on an island. I was with other people, both familiar and unfamiliar, but I don't remember who the known ones were. I awoke, but I was not frightened at the advancing sea. It was strange. The dream seemed to have a feeling of danger, but I wasn't scared.
