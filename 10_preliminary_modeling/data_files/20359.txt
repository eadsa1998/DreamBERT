I was a hospital patient. My ward had to go to bed early because some of the patients had misbehaved. I passed the bed of a patient who resembled a patient on my ward named Reynolds. I noticed that he was almost bald, and I recalled that his hair a few months ago had been falling out in chunks. (The patient is a close friend of mine. He has a thick head of hair. He is intellectual.)
