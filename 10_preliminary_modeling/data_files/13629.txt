There were these houses. One had bright green on it. Some guy told a cop that he and some others (including some guy called Cooper Anderson) were part of a group. I told him to pretend. I went to the other guy's house and was begging him to let me in and he kept refusing. I gave him $10 and then he let me in. I explained to him that they were in a 'group'.
