Another dream - I was standing with a tall muscular man, holding on to him.  I was facing him.  I saw my hands grip his shoulders, his shirt on his shoulders, he was my man, and I wanted him.  I knew we were about to make love.  I knew he was mine.  I noticed very much his muscular shoulders, his masculinity.  I did not see his face, although we talked together and I knew we were going to make love.
