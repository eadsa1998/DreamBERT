I was in a huge ocean. I was at the bottom of it and I contemplated its beautiful underwater landscape. The fish were happily writhing their small bodies. The algae seemed like creeping vines. The oysters at the bottom seemed to be paving the sand. I understood the message and the infinite beauty of aquatic nature.
