I was hunting bear. It was dangerous. The bears were in caves and one could come out and surprise you. My sister Mary was holding a small baby about 4 or 5 months old, and I was surprised that the baby could speak talk. Then Mike's baby boy was very small, about the same age, and he said, "He's a very nice boy." I was waiting in a downtown restaurant for a meal. I was lying down covered with a blanket while the other people were standing in line. My sisters Mary and Sue had the tickets for the special meal. The meal was ready. The proprietor motioned for us to come in and Mary and Sue were not there. They finally came into the line and handed the tickets to the proprietress now and she said, "Evans, come in now." I got up from my cover and was scantily dressed. We walked to a table and Sue moved over a little and I sat on a plank next to brother Mike. He had on his sleeping pajamas. He said, "What a dump." We sat on boards.
