I dreamt I was a very brave cowboy and that I was in a saloon and suddenly a bandit who wanted to kill me appeared. But I was faster and pulled my gun faster and hurt his arm. He asked me, "Why didn't you kill me?" "Because I want to let you live." I went out and got on my horse and left. I got to a town where there were many women with guns and they were very pretty. They took me prisoner and tied me to a tree and lit a fire below. I felt I was going to die. When the others were sleeping, one of the girls, who seemed to like me, let me free. I asked her to go away with me, but she said she was afraid of her boss. Well, I left. Suddenly my dream changed and I was in a castle, hearing steps that never came close. Outside there was a storm. I heard a loud and ugly voice and it was there that I woke up.
