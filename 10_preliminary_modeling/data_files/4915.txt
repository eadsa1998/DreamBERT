I am in a room. I am unpacking and setting up for display pretty glass bowls and goblets, some of which belonged to my Grandma Anne and my mother. Suddenly the entire brick wall starts falling in on me. I sit there thinking Oh my God, I'm going to die. But somehow it crashes down and nearly hits me but I am safe. I am very surprised. Mitch R. from High School sits with me. He is loving and helpful. We cuddle. I am concerned about the special glass fragile goblets of my Grandmother's. I am worried it was smashed during the fall. I begin to look for it. Mitch helps me. Somehow the wall is fixed back up again.
