I heard the toilet flush and my boyfriend Jeremy came back to say goodbye before leaving to go home. He came in, but I could not move to greet him, hug him, anything. Frozen in the position I was in.  But I didn't panic, I resigned myself to it.  I felt exhausted when I actually woke up a few minutes later when Jeremy actually did come to say goodbye.
