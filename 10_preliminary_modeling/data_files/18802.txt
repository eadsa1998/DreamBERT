I dreamed of a buddy of mind, and how he got a ticket for not having a license on his car. The only thing about this was that the ticket was stapled to the left rear fender of his car. I was standing off at a distance and I noticed that he got out of the car and was looking at the pieces of paper stapled to his left rear fender, and I was standing off at a distance and asked him what happened, and he said he got a ticket for not having a license plate. Just then another buddy of mine came up and all three of us started laughing and talking and thinking how silly it was that he got a ticket in the first place for not having something so common as a license plate. It seemed like it took place in a gas station near the airport.
