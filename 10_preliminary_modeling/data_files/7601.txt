I was asking someone to do the remodel at the store. I was worried that if the committee followed my advice and went with the lowest quote that they wouldn't work out. It turned out to include Cliff S and Don St. I kept reassuring the committee that it was going to be great because I know these men. I told the men that my job and reputation were riding on this and the work had to be good. I kept remembering when Cliff S and I had a crush on each other in the eighth grade. The building they were remodeling was now a church. We started the work without approval. When the committee came by, they thought it looked great. The carpet went clear up the walls in some places. In one place, they had a huge multi-level flower cut into the carpet. It looked great.
