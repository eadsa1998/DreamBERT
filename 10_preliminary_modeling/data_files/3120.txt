I am in bed next to Merle and we sweetly hold hands and talk like friends. I get up to get ready to go to the beach with Ellie. I'm choosing what to wear. Later I am standing in a bookstore in France, and a man stands near me. I really like him and it is mutual. We are like lovers before we really become lovers, that warm beginning of a love relationship. We look into each others' eyes and smile. He shows me where the small section of books in English are. We are in the political (said in French) section of the store. I say, "I'll be curious to know what they consider political." I laugh at the book I look at. "This is political??" We stroll on down the aisle. He and his business partner are going to buy this place. I look around and say, "We could rent out these spaces and people could build gardens and we could gain from their labor." It all seems fair and equitable. We provide the space and they pay a rent. We go into another room. I ask where the freezer room is. He points it out to me. I look in. It is empty and cold as a freezer room should be. I am pleased. I say, "They can buy a half a beef from us and pay us to cut it and wrap it and freeze it here." I see stairs and we walk up to the second floor. It is only partly done, partitions marked on the floor where the previous owner wanted to build. He's run out of money and declared bankruptcy. That's why we can move in and buy a good bargain so well. Our money and energy will finish the project. I feel a bit sad for him, but maybe he can join with us in some way to be a part of this project. The other man asks, as I am saying I'll do this and that with the space, "Well, what about us? What will we get?" I say, "Anything you want. Name it -- what spaces --  and they are yours." It is a pleasant relationship.
