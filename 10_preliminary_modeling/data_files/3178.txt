I take the part of "Tommy" in a play. In makeup no one knows I'm a woman. I do it so well. Ethan gets suspicious and follows me. He discovers it is me and says, "We must talk." He walks me to a room with a big bed and a couch. He sits on the bed and I sit on the couch. He just won't give me any good feedback, no compliments. He's upset I tricked them. Now he and I are seated side by side in an invisible vehicle and he's driving backwards along the coastline. I look back over my shoulder, apprehensive he'll drive us into the ocean. He parks in the grasses where we can see cars drive like they are going to hit us and then they go past. A cop goes by. He says, "Hope he doesn't catch us. I kind of do this a lot." I say, "How often?" He says "Oh, 10, 11 times a day." I say, "OH! Obsessive! The cop doesn't approve." Ethan puts his arm around me.
