I was walking around with an IFB box clipped to my belt, and I had a set of headphones on, and I had two microphones, one in each hand. One was a lavaliere clip one and one was like a wired heavier one. And I was talking to people and people were talking to me. And the level in my ears was like really loud, and I was trying to figure out how to turn it down so I wouldn't feel so nervous. And instead of turning it down, I turned it up and it was even louder, and I just couldn't control it after that. And I was like walking around the back yard with this stuff and stuff. And then I dreamt that I was going to create a mermaid poster show, like a mermaid audio show with topic figures, and I was going to use all my voice except Flounder was going to be a kind of my voice at a faster speed. My voice in real time was going to be Ariel, my voice slowed down a little bit was going to be Sebastian, and my voice slowed way down was going to be Triton. And I was going to like make these figures on a cardboard and make them go around the stage and play this strange audio. And I was thinking how I was going to write all the music and stuff for it and everything. And I got to drawing the figures, and then I just kind of woke up. Now maybe that's a really good idea. I should do that for real now, shouldn't I?
