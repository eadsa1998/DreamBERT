 I'm in Utah at my brother Wally's house. It's a very big house with many rooms and a deck. There are other houses around it. I'm on the deck with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We start to have a sexual encounter. I give her cunnilingus. Something I do with my mouth or teeth hurts her clitoris. I try to learn what it is so I can change what I do. A bit later we're inside one of the many rooms. We start to kiss again. She says to me in a firm voice that I love her but she doesn't love me. This is a very bold statement, I think. Wally and others are in the house cooking a meal. The meal is prepared, and he calls for me to come join them. It's easy to get lost in so many rooms and hallways in the house. I have some difficulty finding where the rest of the people are. I look for them.
