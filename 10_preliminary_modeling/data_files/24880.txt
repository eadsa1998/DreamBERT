First, I was getting ready for a party at my house. Then I went to my school, and all the kids were there. Everyone was hanging out in this weird lounge room. The only other thing that I remember is that my male friend was making fun of the outfit I was wearing. Setting: My room and then My school (my school). Characters: Most of the people in my class were there, and I knew who everyone was. Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. It was all just very blurry and bizarre. I knew where I was, but it was very weird.
