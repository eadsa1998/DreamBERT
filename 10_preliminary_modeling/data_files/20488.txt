My mother was trying to clean a horse's stall, but the horse kept trying to come in, so that she could not work. Later I was looking through a window and I saw a horse running fast toward my mother. I tried to open the window to warn her, because she was looking another way. The window would not open, so I put on a glove and broke the window to attract her attention. She heard me and saw the horse coming and she was able to get out of its way. I began repairing the window. Something was hanging from the ceiling.
