My friend Tom was once married and divorced quickly. But he had a three-year-old son and almost had custody. The mother had not seen him for a while but finally broke down to see him. When she did the boy was ten years old. She now wanted full custody. Tom never had full custody, so chances are she could get it. Eventually she gained custody and took the boy. Then Tom had to be nice to someone he absolutely hates to see his son. But because of the great loss that he could not be with him, he went and adopted another [illegible] just like a new [illegible] expensive and frustrating without a mother. Woke up.
