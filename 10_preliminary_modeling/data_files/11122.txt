My girlfriend Marlene and I were in an outdoor bowling alley which had a lot of shrubbery and trees around. There were a lot of younger boys around there as if something was fishy. Then we went into the bowling alley and there was a Chinaman's head in one of the crooked bowling alleys and when the boy bowled, he broke the Chinaman's head. The manager of the bowling took after the boy and I felt sorry for the boy, so we rode away and in the country was a park where we hid and no one ever found us.
