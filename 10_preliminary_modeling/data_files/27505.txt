I was going to a fairgrounds when my two girl friends and I were notified that there was going to be a big show in the auditorium in a few minutes. We rushed to the auditorium and there we saw some old friends. I remember one very distinctly. He was a boy who went to high school with us. Now he goes to Harvard. In a Bostonian accent, I told this to my friends. They all smiled knowingly. I noticed that the Harvard boy was wearing a white tie and tails. He was a member of the local band. The show began and the announcer said that this was a special show with many acts. The first act was that three girls from the audience should come to the stage and each sit next to some boy and they would be married. It turned out that we were the three girls. I was the first one to walk down the aisle. I sat down next to a boy named Douglas and we were married. After the marriage, I left him and wondered if it were true. I then woke up.
