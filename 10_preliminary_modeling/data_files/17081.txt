My crush Stan was sitting in a desk in the hall at school.  It was some sort of reunion.  My elementary school violin teacher, Mr. Baker, and my kindergarten teacher Mrs. Moore were there.  I talked to Stan, but he didn't remember my name- he thought it was Melissa.  Then he looked like Marty Stouffer.
