Out in a beautiful garden: under a blossoming apple tree; in a tent: earlier at a wedding ceremony: Fr. officiates. We are together (Fr. and I), Frank goes away, leaves me with Father who is very warm and friendly: WARM GLOW. He calls me my first name and smiles warmly. We belong together; sense of fulfillment.
