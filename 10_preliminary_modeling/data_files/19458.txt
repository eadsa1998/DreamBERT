Melanie Hardy eating alone at table. I told her we had found a book bearing her name in our hometown library, but didn't know whether or not I had the volume with me. She said that was immaterial, as we could look for it, and other things belonging to her, at hometown. I felt nonplused, as it was news to me that any of Melanie's books or other possessions were mixed with our things in my hometown.
