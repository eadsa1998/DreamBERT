I dreamt my mother took me for my driving test.  My godmother's children, the Swenson triplets and their older brother Milt were around the house.  My old elementary schoolmate Carla was at the DMV.  I was appalled because my mother made me take a drug test with the driving test, drinking a bottle of water and then another gallon afterwards.
