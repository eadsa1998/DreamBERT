I own a hotel and there is a conference being held there today. I get dressed in a pretty dress and walk out to greet the people, timing it carefully to come out just when the good-looking man comes in. I miss it a bit and try again. The women come in and I give them the keys to their complementary resting rooms and try to connect with the man. He is allusive. I suggest I show him his room; he can use mine. I take him to the elevator. He turns and walks away. I turn and push number 4 and the elevator opens. It is tiny and crowded with a wheelbarrow with a small girl in it and a metal container that smells very metallic. I get in, resigned, and go up to my room. [BL]
