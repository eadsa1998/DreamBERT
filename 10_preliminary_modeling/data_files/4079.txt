["Can't See The Light"]  I am in a house. There are lots of bright windows. Lucy is there complaining about there not being enough light. I say to her, there is plenty of light. She says we need more. I think that is silly. She's blind. No matter how much light we have, she will still not be able to see it. Later, a man named Scott Corbett and another man named Michael or Marshall both like me. They watch me, affectionately. I am up to my neck in warm water. I am wearing a swim suit and look very good. In shape and sexy. I am watching myself in the water.
