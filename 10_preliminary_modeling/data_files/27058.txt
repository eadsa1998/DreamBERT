A friend and I were driving in a car with a fellow we knew. He got out of the car to see about a new one. Next I found my uncle driving the car. He also got out to see about buying a new one. I took over the wheel. It started to rain. A colored family got in for they knew I was going in their direction. As I drove men kept popping up from man-holes and trying to attract my attention. I drove down the street and turned into a garage so as to make a turn. No one was in the car with me and I couldn't stop it except to put my foot out and stop it like I would a bicycle. I got out of the car and before I knew what was happening, some men came and drove the car down to a lower garage. I couldn't get the workers to return it to me for they were watching a clock and on the stroke of 5 p.m. they dashed out of the garage and left me all alone.
