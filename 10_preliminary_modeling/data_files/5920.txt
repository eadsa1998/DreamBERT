Some sort of show for children is taking place in our house. I am astonished at so many children in attendance. A crippled boy with one arm is in a basket suspended from the ceiling by an adjustable rope. With his good arm and the stump of the missing arm he skillfully controls the rope and swings back and forth, up and down, over his applauding audience of children. He is marvelous to watch. I leave and go down a sort of hatchway to floor below, using a ladder attached to wall. Some rungs break under my weight. I slip down easily to next rungs and test them with my weight. They seem weak, so I force them and they also break as I land lightly on floor. I then stand aside with regrets at the broken rungs, thinking how difficult it will be for children, especially the cripple, to get down the useless ladder.
