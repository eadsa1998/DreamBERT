I was on a bed with Mark Duplass. He was propped up on a pillow (like lying down, but sitting up), and I was lying the opposite way, resting my head on his leg. We were talking about something or other and I took a photo of us. I posted on the forum mentioning what we were talking about and said I was talking with Mark Duplass. I was thinking about whether or not to post the pic but thought it might seem dodgy. At some point I snuggled closer so that I was hugging his leg and was half touching his crotch area. This seemed like normal behaviour as friends, though I did wonder if anything would happen.
