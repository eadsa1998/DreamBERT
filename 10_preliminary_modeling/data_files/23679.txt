[Saw Mindwalk last night.]  Since people feel powerless at doing something about pollution, set up coin-op river (or stack?) scrubbers, like a little parking meter, you put in a dollar, and so much charcoal is emptied out into the water to purify it.  Then people will feel an immediate part of the solution. Low cost per person.
