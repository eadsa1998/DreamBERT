["I say no to nice lesbian lady."]  Jennifer is in a room. I am visiting her. She has two women friends. One of them, a young woman is attracted to me and comes very close. She tries to kiss me and flirt with me. I turn my head away and say nicely that I am not interested. I am straight. She is disappointed, but persists. I keep deflecting her energy. I think of leaving because it is tiring having to deal with the constant attention.
