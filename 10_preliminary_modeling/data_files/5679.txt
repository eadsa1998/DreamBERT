[1997-06-13] In my dream I was hungry and I was fixing this plate of food for myself. I had some hard boiled eggs, that I had cut lengthwise, in half, I had some chips I had put on the plate, I was cubing cheese and I put crackers and olives. This was very typical of me, if I wasn't having the usual sandwiches and potato chips for lunch, it would be very typical of me to fix this sort of a picnic plate for myself. When I woke up I wasn't hungry.
