They've been giving me parties at work because I'm going to work at PF temporarily - reason they need me is a new branch is being built and they're expanding - it looks like being permanent though, and I'm thinking I may as well not go back downtown at all - they may not want to give me more parties - PF has another problem - the construction people have struck oil - it's gushed once already and it's right next to where the building will be, so something major has to be revised before they can build. I'm talking to Belle and we go look at the oil eruption - looks like it broke up through the ground like a pimple or little volcano - I don't wanna get too close in case it spits up again, don't want it to land on me.
