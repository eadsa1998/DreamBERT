I was leaving some building with several people, including (I think) Mother, Grandma, Alma, and some strange kid with glasses.  I left a couple of minutes ahead of the others, and Jim Duggan was there.  He asked me if I would like to see a "Bank Evaluation Corporation."  I wasn't at all interested, but to be polite I said yes, so he took me to an office on the first floor at the far end of this building where a heavy-set young man met us at the door.  He gave me a short tour of the premises, including an auditorium where employees were being shown some far-out movie about outer space.  I never did figure out what it had to do with "bank evaluation." When I left there, everybody else had already gone to the car and had been waiting for me for some time.  On the way to the car I met Subby Long, who made some kind of face, for some reason.  The group in the car were taking turns driving, and it was the turn of the kid with glasses.  I thought it was strange that one of us would let a stranger drive the car.  I don't remember him actually driving, but I remember Grandma driving.  The car was a VW, and she was driving at breakneck speed-60 to 70 mph through city streets.  When it was called to her attention, she would look at the speedometer and slow down, but the distraction would also cause her to veer into the wrong lane, and I would have to shout at her to get back.  I couldn't believe Grandma drove so recklessly.  (In real life she doesn't drive at all.)
