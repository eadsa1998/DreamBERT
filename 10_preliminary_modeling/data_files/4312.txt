["Blood tests."] I am learning how to be a nurse or a Doctor. I am doing blood tests on my own blood. I don't really know how, but am trying to follow directions. Now I am exhausted. Ginny and Ernie come and take me to their house, but I am dead asleep. They drag me blankets and all and leave me on the floor in a room. I am so tired I can't seem to move. Ernie questions whether I am really asleep and all that tired. He teases me and I have to fight to not smile. I guess I am awake, just too tired to do anything. They let me rest on the floor.
