At a social gathering, seemingly in somebody's attic, I was introduced to a man with whom I danced, a person whom I have seen in school but do not know. At an intermission there was some sort of a program in which three girls, dressed in formal gowns, sang, sitting down. They were quite informal about it, giggling and glancing about as they sang. One girl I vaguely know as being in one of my classes, was wearing a yellow formal--the only color in the dream. One of the girls has moved recently to California (the two vaguely physically resemble one another). On the other side of the trio, still another girl (B) got up and left, saying she felt embarrassed because her skirt was too short.
