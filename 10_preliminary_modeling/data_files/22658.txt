The bus in which my mother and I were going had stopped working. We had to get off. It looked like a town in the mountains. The houses were made of stone, with inclined roofs, and it was very cold. We covered ourselves with blankets, and we walked about one block, and we stopped and found a man with a brown muffler and a suit of the same color who was smoking. He brought us to a door. It looked like a house, and when we opened we saw it didn't have a roof and it looked like a bazaar. There were several women selling food and drinks, and drunk men. Others were dancing. The door was closed and we couldn't get out. My mother went over to a woman and asked her for something hot, which she took, and then she became very pale. It seemed as though she were paralyzed; she couldn't walk. Suddenly a big noise was heard and the people started to scream with horror. They opened the door and I had to carry my mother on my back because she couldn't walk and she seemed to be drugged. When we got out, the floor seemed to be covered with mud, which ran like a river and was hot so that when we walked, our feet were burned. I couldn't run because of my mother's weight. I had to go up some stairs until I finally reached the top and I was near a truck. I got my mother in it and I waited for more people to come, then the truck started by itself, I don't know how, and we crashed. We fell into an abyss, but there was nobody there. My mother wasn't there; there were only a bunch of rocks.
