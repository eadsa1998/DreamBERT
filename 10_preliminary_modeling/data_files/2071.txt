Now someone has checked the fluids in me and I see a plastic vial with some pink stuff in it. Some bad stuff is still there. We hadn't gotten it all out. There are two doctors then. A good one and a bad one. The good one had left me in the care of the bad one and the bad one deliberately didn't do part of the procedures so that I wouldn't get healthy and might die. They are going to do the procedure again and the bad one is smiling. The good one says to him, "Go on with what you were doing," and prepares to leave. I sit up and call out, "Wait. No. It must be you!" He agrees to stay. Someone says, "She must have 20 immersions in ice water baths quickly." Now things are going to be all right. I grab the breathing tube I must use that sucks out the fluid on the lungs and suck hard to help. Someone says, "She looks scared." I nod. I am; and determined.
