I was at home and it was really late. We got McDonald's and I hadn't had lunch? Dad ran out the door and as I went to lock up he and a girlfriend drove off and it was raining. I went back inside. The next-door neighbour let me go to their place and we were all complaining about Dad's girlfriend. Ezra was there and we were all going to sleepover there. I was thinking about missing school. I was thinking about Calvin for some reason.
