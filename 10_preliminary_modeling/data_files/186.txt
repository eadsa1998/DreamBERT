I'm in another theater, a big one, not many people here, and I'm with a group. We're sitting down close to the front, center, and somebody asks us to move. I don't know why, but we do move to the back, where there's some other things, like an opening into a large hallway with pinball and video machines. There's a ledge where some of the older ones of us sit down, and I'm not real happy standing, so I take a spot there too. The show hasn't started, won't for a while yet - this isn't entertainment we've come for, but something maybe political or social, something dramatic - I think we're planning to "do" something ourselves and that's why there's this tension, a real sober undercurrent among us; I don't know about the other people here. Nobody's talking about it.
