 I'm at my friend Hilary Nano's apartment on High Avenue. I may have been drinking alcohol. She and I have just arrived. She walks back to a bedroom. I follow, tentatively. In the last bedroom are Hilary, her friend Annette Gollum, and Annette's boyfriend Travis Hampton. Travis is crying. He has short light brown hair. The mood is somber: someone has died, it seems. I'm in a flirtatious mood as I walk back to the room. Travis greets me somberly. Annette is distraught. I'm outside the room. Hilary is inside, next to a bed. She looks at me and firmly says, "Get out." I hang my head, turn, and go out. I feel hurt and ignored. Hilary doesn't follow me, though I want her to so we can have a sexual encounter.
