I saw an old man. He wanted to play football with the boy when I came up close to him. He was not so old. He got a monocle from a fellow and put it to his eye. It made a double vision. I could see two eyes and when he looked at two eyes, it was four. My sister Sue came from PA and brought some catsup pies and my brother Steve and I said we didn't like them. I said cabbage was the best. I took them back to the rubbish and there was a 4 ft. hole in the ground to put the rubbish in.
