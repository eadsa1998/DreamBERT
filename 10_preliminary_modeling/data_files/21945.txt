I saw a girl with a pet of some kind. She stood on the hillside and there was some kind of wild animal sneaking towards her. I called to her, but she was stubborn and wouldn't come down. Finally she came down, but she was a fierce and tough female. I finally got close to her and caressed her and she started to get gentle and was now talking of love that she never had. Ann, my wife, was coming into the room, so she hid under some cardboard boxes and then when Ann went out, I looked for her, but couldn't see her. She disappeared. I was outside. I looked up into the sky and up there was a crow. He was stationary, did not move in the air. Then I saw branches of trees floating in the air with birds sitting on them. I saw two crows. They flew down from a sky perch and landed on a tree. I made a feint as though I had a gun and pointed it at them and away they flew.
