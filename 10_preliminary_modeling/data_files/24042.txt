I was flying. It was the best feeling in the world. I started drifting with the clouds, but soon I was really flying. I could control what direction I was going in. The clouds were blue, purple, orange, pink and green. They were diamonds. I landed on one of the light blue ones. When I got up and tried to fly again, I found I could not fly any more. I was falling.
