Dr. Beck (my physician) adds new medicine. He says, "Take it three times a week Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays." The same days I take the capsules. No, you had better alternate them so on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. "That'll leave none for Sundays." "All right." I wonder how to turn the new medicine in to Miss W.
