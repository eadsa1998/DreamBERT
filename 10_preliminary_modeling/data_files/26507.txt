 I'm in line at a grocery store. A woman that I've been talking to in line writes down her phone number for me. The people around me sort of congratulate me on getting this woman's number: they laugh and cheer softly and make comments about she and I. The woman is very attractive. She seems to be a cashier at this store. I think of getting a food discount because of this. We walk out of the store. She has a dog that is in a puddle, almost completely covered with water. We get separated in a place that seems to be around the block where my friend Gino Teavor's house is. I hope that she will follow me, but she doesn't.
