Laura and I are half-buried in the mud at the bottom of the train tunnel, laying down and hiding out. We were hiding there, I explained, for the same reasons the bums hung out at the opening end every morning -- it was a hell of a lot warmer than any other place at that time of day, due to the draft. Suddenly they built a train station around us. It would take you to New York City. It was all shiny and modern-looking, and Laura and I did go to New York. I considered how close New York was all along, and wondered why we never went. We came back and I went to work at the Green City Library with Larry. That woman Patti was at the desk. At closing time, a woman walked in and Patti refused to help her. "We're closed. Sorry. That's all. We're closed." Then she started *doing her makeup* and putting on jewelry. That annoyed me a lot. She refused to help someone at one minute to closing because she wanted to put on makeup? Larry walked with me across the wierd hills to the train station and explained how he could take my job on Mondays since I didn't like it on that day. And I was going anyway. "Yeah, but I want to *save* money before we go, and I'd lose $120 a month that way!" ($120 is 1/3 of my paycheck; I work 3 days a week.) "Besides, Laura wants to take Biology 3C and..." "But, I'm not *in* highschool anymore," she protests. "We could leave any day!"
