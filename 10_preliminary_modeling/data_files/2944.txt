I'm in a sort of playground area, only it's in a room. There are three round circle toys and two other women are with me. One says, "Let's play on these." I say, "OK." She stands on one, her arm hanging on to the circle and I stand on the middle one and then I say, "No, I want the one on the end." It felt better to have the middle one between us. Then you lean back so the circle thing starts spinning and you hang on for dear life. It goes really fast and the centrifugal force pulls you hard and I wonder if I can hang on! I say, "I don't know if I can do this!" My arms are so weak. Maggie, who has MS, agrees it's hard. But it is fun. Then we get off and the woman says, "There's one thing you do that I don't like." I turn away and say, "What is it?" not really wanting to hear. She says, "I don't like it when you say that men don't like you because you're overweight. It doesn't have anything to do with how you look." I feel annoyed and say, "Oh, I suppose I have to remember that when I'm out with you, I should never make that type of remark," like this is a great deal to ask of me. She says, "Yeah, I do expect that." I shrug and walk away from her. Now I'm standing in a street and I see Zippy dog. I call him over and he lays down and I lay down and we cuddle as I pet and hug him in a friendly way. I croon, "Oh, silly dog." Then I look up and see some cars coming and wonder if I should sit up so they realize there is a human here as well as a dog, so they'll think twice about running us over. I get up. Now I want to walk to the store and get something to eat. A girl, mildly mentally retarded, says she'll go with me, but only if we take the bus. I smirk and say, "Is the walk too much for you?" She smiles and says cheerfully, "Yes." I feel my body vibrate and say jokingly, "OH! What is this? An earthquake in me?" I laugh and look around to see a man in the distance using a jackhammer which has caused the vibration. We cross the street to go to the bus stop.
