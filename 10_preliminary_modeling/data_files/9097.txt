I was at my first dream class. Malachi B and three other male members of SAID who were equally accomplished in their dream research were students in the class. Instead of individual student desks, we had six or eight foot tables. I was rearranging them so there were would be groups of two tables and that they would be sitting at an angle to the front of the room rather than in straight horizontal lines. I was going to divide them into their theorist groups and have each group sit together each week. Some of the students changed them after I had put them where I wanted them. Mark dropped the class because he decided after that first week that it wasn't what he was looking for, but the other three SAID members stayed in.
