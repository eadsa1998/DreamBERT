There were lots of people and they were running really fast. I was really hot. I felt really weird and I was supposed to run. Then I woke up and I was hot and felt really weird. I was sick and when I'm sick i have really weird dreams. Setting: In my friend Susan's house. Characters: Runners? Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, hot. I didn't like it.
