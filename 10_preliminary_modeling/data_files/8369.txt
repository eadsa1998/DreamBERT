I was helping BJ and her organization prepare for a garage sale of sorts. We were having the sale in one of the buildings they own. In part of the building they had very tall warehouse-type shelving. We had taken all of the things that they had received and recycled - fixed up for reuse - and put them on these shelves. I told them to be sure and remove the things that they want to use in their new office. Someone was worried about some type of criminal activity so a man there said he would have a gun placed somewhere near the shelving and bullets in a separate location but also nearby. At first I didn't think that was necessary but later agreed that it was a good idea. There was something going on that we were either debating about how to do or what to do for quite a long time or something that we couldn't resolve.
