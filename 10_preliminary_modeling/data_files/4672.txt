I live in an apartment with a nice man, like Alan A. There are a few other young Chicano roommates that I don't like. They leave for awhile. A woman, like Lucille Ball comes in. I told they'd gone for awhile. She rushes in to steal anything of value from them. I go in to help her because I don't like them. As I help her carry stuff out, Alan wakes up and I feel guilty and embarrassed. I tell Lucille I don't like this and I start putting their things back in their room and telling Lucille it is wrong to steal. She is furious with me and threatens to get her gangster friends to come beat me up. Now that Alan is awake, I feel strong and righteous. I tell her to pack up and leave and help her pick up her many colored pens. Boxes of them. I also see lots of LP album records that belong to the Chicano roommates. I sort of pile them up.
