I dreamt that they gave me marijuana to try. At first it seemed to me that my body split in two. Then I felt I was really flying. I felt like a midget, my ears were burning and my face was getting bigger. I saw many different and absurd things. In another moment I felt I was in the jungle, sitting on a tree, eating oranges. Underneath the tree many people, whom I didn't know, were walking. All looked at me and kept walking without saying anything. That was it. If there was more, I don't remember.
