I had gotten a series of responses to an email I had sent to Ben D. I happened upon them when I was going through other emails and realized that I had missed these when they first came. I was reading through them and didn't understand them. He had abbreviated some things and I didn't understand his abbreviations. I was debating whether I wanted to write and admit to him that I didn't understand what he meant.
