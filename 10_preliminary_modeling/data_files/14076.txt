I was doing a quest on Runescape. It was a 'choose your own ending'. Ezra, Roland and another friend of his were there. First I was by myself and there were zombies. I had to right click and press zombify and then quickly kill them and save something. I got bit. I was then in a shop/museum and I had to get something. Also this fat kid stole some yoghurt. I got in the car. There was another place and all of us were together. I had finished the quest and gotten the reward which was three lots of 70,000gp. There was a room with a king and a person we had to release. I walked past and we were looking for the key to take a car. Someone saw us and we ran. We went into the water and they came after us with a canoe. We took a canoe. We had to pick two random colours and/or numbers. I climbed up a ladder. Darren said something to us. We were then little and in a fridge in a kitchen. We had to make food for this old lady. There was a still picture of a cat. Ezra got this same ending.
