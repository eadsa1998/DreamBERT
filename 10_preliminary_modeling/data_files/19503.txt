I am driving along a street leading into Maryland Ave. Just before reaching Maryland Ave. I cross 2 transverse streets the second of which is so very full of traffic that I expect every instant to be struck, and am greatly surprised to reach  Md. Ave. without mishap. I transverse this route twice, the second trip seeming to be a virtually exact duplicate of the first.
