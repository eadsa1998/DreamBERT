I was at a SAID conference in a hotel. I had checked in but was working on something in the registration area. Attendees began to arrive and I realized that I had less than an hour to get ready for something else I was scheduled to do, attend a meeting or make a presentation or some such. I quickly left and took an elevator upstairs to my room. As I hurried towards my room I realized that I had left my room key downstairs at the registration area and had to go back down to get it. I was feeling very frantic but the other people down there were trying to reassure me that I had plenty of time. I did not see how that was possible as I had not even showered yet. I didn't want people arriving and seeing me before I had a chance to shower and dress better. There was something physically wrong with me so I had to see a doctor. I saw one doctor but then decided I wanted to see Doctor Pf, who was there. He asked me to explain my symptoms. One of the symptoms was a feeling of pins and needles in my hands.
