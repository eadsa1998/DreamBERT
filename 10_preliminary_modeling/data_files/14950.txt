I was at Nana's. Rover was there. We stayed the night and they had a cat door. I was worried Rover would fall into some little pools. I went to one. Simba and Cuddles went in and there was a metal face on top of it? I was tired and I watched an episode of Big Brother. One woman stood in the bathroom for 15 minutes. They hadn't plugged the heater in and they found a cave. They saw a girl ghost and she was buried there and the place was covered in oil, so if we lit a match, it would explode. Mom was watching the same episode. Ezra came out of his room. In the next 1-2 episodes, someone was going to wear a wedding dress?
