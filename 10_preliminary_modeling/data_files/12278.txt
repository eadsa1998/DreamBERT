The gym at school was only for gay guys. Elijah needed to get changed. He was flicking the shutters on the side of the gym to see if they could see, then he was like "Screw it" and went to the toilet. I was watching Nickelodeon and there was something about five shows on one channel. Granny gave me chocolate. I was then at Nana's and Nana said that Big Brother was sexist.
