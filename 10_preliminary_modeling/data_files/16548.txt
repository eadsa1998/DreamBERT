Terri was taking a photography class and she was learning all about different color compositions and stuff like that, and she was showing us a package of pictures that she took. And there were two or three pictures of Celine Dion, there were tons of pictures of flowers, there were one or two pictures or like sunsets and things, and I guess -- I don't know -- but I guess she was going to pay me to scan some of them for her. And I was telling her she didn't have to pay me, but the thing was that, oh, I know -- I asked her, "How many pictures do you want, and what size?" And I asked her how many. And she thought I was saying, "How much are you going to give me?" But she took quite an amount of time making up her mind which ones she wanted, and she just kept sitting there, thumbing through them and saying, "Well, maybe this or maybe not, maybe not, maybe not," you know, like Mom does. And I got the mail, and this thing came in the mail, this funny envelope thing from Modern Media College and it was real classy. And it was this box. It said, "2003-2004" on it, and it was this box that was real pretty and real classy, and you just put things in it, I guess. And that was all there was to it. And I was noticing, as I looked at it, it kind of changed, and I noticed that on the bottom it said, "Westport Town Center" instead of "_____ Park." And there were little flowers and there was sort of an indention in the middle of it. And then I woke up.
