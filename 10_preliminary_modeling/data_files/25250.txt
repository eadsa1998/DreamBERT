 I'm in my mom's station wagon with three other people. I am in the back seat with Jerome Michaels. We are wrestling and jokingly fighting, in a power struggle. I am on top of him, and then he flips me down on the floor. We are on a college campus, but the driver takes a wrong turn, and we go the wrong way down a one-way road. We turn around and go through an area we're not supposed to go through, and get out. <br/
