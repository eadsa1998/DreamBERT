The boy I go with (20) and I were being chased by a policeman (do not remember why). As he (policeman) rounded a corner, we were way up the street. The policeman however took aim and shot my boyfriend through the back. No blood came out, but I could see the holes in his sweater which were singed around the edges. Bullet went through his shirt. He sat down on steps leading up to a walk of a house. I was hysterical - kept screaming I love you. Policeman came up and led him away. He (boyfriend) could still walk, although I could not see how bullet could miss puncturing his spinal cord.
