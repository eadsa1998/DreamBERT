A long journey through the night. At one point, I am in the back seat of the car, and no one is driving. We nearly hit a parked car! I crawl over the seat to get into the driver's seat. I feel tired and sluggish. I drive. We arrive at a cafe, like 5th street market, counter culture hippie haven. Raul is there. He came with me and immediately finds another woman to flirt with. I keep moving back into a corner, looking all around me. I see Raul lie down with the woman. They are going to make love, right in front of me. I feel hurt, angry. I don't say anything, I just think, "Don't you dare make love to her!" I see charming, bearded men; they don't see me. I keep backing into the corner, my hand covering the vagina area.
