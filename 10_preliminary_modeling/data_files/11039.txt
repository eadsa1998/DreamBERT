I went to a picnic with another boy, only to meet my boyfriend with whom I'd had a fight the day before, although I can't remember what about. I kept trying to catch his eye and to smile but he refused to look at me and I knew it was the end of our relationship. I felt terrible because I hadn't known he could be so stubborn or get so angry and I was terribly sad. I turned around to look at the boy I was with. He asked, 'what's the matter?' and I answered nothing. He had the most understanding look on his face that I have ever seen. The strange part of the dream was that his face was the only part of the dream in color. I distinctly remember his ruddy cheeks and pale gray-blue eyes, with their understanding expression. My brother, sister in law, and their baby were also in the dream but I can't remember where. The alarm clock awoke me and I was very relieved that our fight hadn't actually happened.
