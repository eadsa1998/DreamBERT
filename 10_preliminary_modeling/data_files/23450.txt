I was in a forest, probably a rain forest, looking up at tall trees, just seeing birds. After a while there was a bridge near the treetops. A staircase had been built in a large tree (fig?) with large roots and there was a platform where tickets to the bridgewalk, and souvenirs, were sold. I was with my husband and daughter and we bought tickets and went delightedly on our way. It was a great view.
