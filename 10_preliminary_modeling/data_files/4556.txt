["Camping with the girls."] I am camping on a vacation with Dovre. Paulina and her family are in another camp down the road. We hadn't gone to see them the whole day, so we decide to walk down the road and visit. However, I decide that's a long way so we will drive. I go to the passenger door of our large black car. It is so close to the campground railing I can't get it opened more than a few inches. So Dovre drives it carefully out of our camp area, barely squeezing around a van in front of us. We drive over to Paulina's. Now it seems to be breakfast time. I ask for some cereal. Paulina says the boys ate it all. But Ellie goes to a cupboard and finds a fresh box of Cheerios. I am pleased. I can eat that kind. Then I want my pills. There is confusion if there are any, or the right kind.
