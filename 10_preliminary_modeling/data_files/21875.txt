I was batting ball or playing ball. I thought I would hit harder, so I swung hard and hit one far on top of a bank where there was a railroad track. I saw where the ball hit and duct went up from where it landed. I went to look for the ball with another fellow and I found the ball. It was lying in a hole where a pipe was and the impact of the ball made a dent or nick in the ball. I was working and wanted to see Banks about something. I found him and John Serin washing windows.
