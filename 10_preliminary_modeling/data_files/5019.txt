I go to find Lucy. I knock at her door. One of her children calls, "Come in." I see that most of the furniture is moved out. I ask if Lucy is here. "She's in the kitchen." So I walk to the kitchen and look out the back window and see her grooming her horse. I remember she loved that horse and must be feeling sad to leave it. A phone rings and she tells one of the kids to be sure and answer it. I realize that I will be able to talk to her if she comes in to get the phone. I walk toward the phone in the living room. Lucy comes in,; she is naked. She gets up on the wooden rickety table (the only furniture left) and undoes the lamp fixture in the ceiling. There are lots of cobwebs. She tells the girls to be careful of the strings. I say, "I know you're busy, but could you tell me, in a nutshell, what made you do this? Just a few months ago, you were not going to have him and now you're gone." [BL]
