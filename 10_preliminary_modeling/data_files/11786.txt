I was at a dinner thing with people from West Whitehall Primary School. It was a big building and there were lots of windows. A thing called a Grurie attacked us, but I managed to escape. I ran off and I was near Midvale High School and I saw the Grurie following me so I called Mom but she started carrying on about her day. She wouldn't come and get me. She kept saying "Ooey gooey Grurie". [I then think I woke myself up].
