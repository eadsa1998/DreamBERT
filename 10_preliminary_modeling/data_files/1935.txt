I enter a large room. It is my apartment that I share with my husband of four months. It is late at night. He's already in bed. He's black and I'm white. I tiptoe in and lay down on the bed beside him. He is very aware of me. We've never made love, even though we are married. He wants me but he does not approach. I look at his sweet young face and am moved, maybe pity, or caring. I curl up to him and start kissing his cheek and neck. He is happy and excited. Finally, I have cared enough to give him this sexual gift. I sit on top of him and we have orgasm. It feels very good. Then we rest. Someone knocks on the door. I get up to open the door. He says, "Wait! You must not. It's the police." Our being of different races and together is very bad and against the law. I see the heavy deadbolt locks on the door. I go hide in the bathroom. I write phone numbers and names on a piece of paper and try to hide it so he can find it, but the police can't. Then the police are in the bathroom, questioning me.
