I dreamed that the boy I go with at Bowling Green (Doug) and I were going to get married. His mother and father had given us a whole lot of money, just so we could get married. My mother and father were very much in favor of the marriage too. Doug and I were very surprised and happy to see everyone so pleased upon our decision. We also had a home to live in. When we acquired it, I don't know, but it was real nice. All through the dream there was happiness.
