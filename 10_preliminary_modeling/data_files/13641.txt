It was about a year before Mom's birthday. I was planning it and I got all these people from school to do a presentation thing. Everyone had a fish and I had tanks. Calvin, Samantha and others were playing a 'hide-and-seek' computer game. Calvin reminded me that I had 15 seconds left (the game). But it said I had 50 minutes. Mom came and said she wanted to take us shopping for her birthday rather than shop for herself. I was thinking 'Sims 2!'. Clayton did a presentation too. Ezra and Clayton were staying over. Then Dad took them back to Mom's and got dinner. We went to some weird bank building and we left and then we went to this old school of Mom's. It was then her birthday and we brought her to her old house (but it wasn't) and people started coming in and she was like "Oh this is great, but I have to go". I was at home and putting the rest of the presentation together. Some evil guy was around and Dad told me to stop all these singing things. The air-con suddenly became stronger and we realized he was here. There were some letters and one had something do with an elephant. There was some Greek thing. The guy came and stole someone's sister. We went to a sewer where he went. He was a Macedonian God. Someone shouted "I am the werewolf!".
