In a big building - church, library? - with a lot of people dressed up - church, I think. Right now I'm walking with some people - couple of friends, maybe - and I've got on a red outfit that I just borrowed from somebody. Someone notices up near the ceiling a bird - real high ceiling, the place is stone or whatever, not wood - we look up and it's a cardinal. Well, it doesn't need to be in here, for sure - I decide to take it outside, I climb up on something and hold out my hand. It comes down to perch on my hand and I very carefully take it down and walk out with it, my friends coming along. We come to a more open space with more people, it's the church proper and just before or just after service. Once or twice the cardinal flies off my hand and I hold it steady and it comes back. I'm talking gently to it. I see my grandfather and some other people I know, we stop to let them look at the bird briefly. Then we carry on as the building widens out and opens up, then there's no more walls, then no roof and we're almost, then all the way outside, and the bird sees it and flies away. It's all green trees and lawn here, pretty. All very Sunday morning, even Easter-y. Anita lives out in the country somewhat - has she retired, or is she commuting? She has a metal box, jewellery or notepaper, and it's maybe aluminum, like those ice buckets and tumblers from the 40's and 50's, all ornate, flowery things on top like a candy box. There's some driving involved, from this little house way out here down the road a piece to somewhere else - I'm wondering if I'd like to live out here and drive to work this way - could I make a living out here?
