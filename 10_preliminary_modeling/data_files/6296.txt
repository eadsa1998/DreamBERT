Inside of a store there was just like an empty box. No front. This [illegible] building and there were stores on each side like you would find at downtown crossing. It was 4-5 stores from the corner. In the back of the store you walked out a door and onto like an [illegible] channel of water. It was like the underground passageways in Istanbul. A friend of mine and I had hooked up a guitar to an amp and run an extension cord to the corner. Neither of us plays the guitar in reality. I'm in the back on the indoor boardwalk. I walk down a couple of shops having a cigarette and I hear this song playing. At first I think it's a radio but as I walk down to the "store" there is my friend playing the guitar with a drummer and two back-up singers. The song sounds great. I've never heard this song before yet I'm singing the words in the dream. They finish. There's a large crowd in front of the store. I feel envious that I missed a chance to play. One of the singers collapses what it looks to be a baby stroller. My friend asks me if I'm going up to school. I think to myself, "Do I have time to go home and change first?" I remember [illegible] It ended there.
