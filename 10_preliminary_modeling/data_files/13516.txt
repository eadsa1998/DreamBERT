I was watching this movie with Jason Lee in it. I had read that it was about a guy who wasn't interested in women, but was interested in his 10 year old daughter. But I don't think it was. He was driving a car and his daughter (played by Dakota Fanning) was in the back. She said "Dexter?" and Jason said "Yes, that's my name. Dexter Morgan" and I thought of Michael C. Hall and then that everything Jason Lee was in recently he was called Dexter. I was saying that I know him as Beaver from Dreamcatcher. Her grandma gave her "shackles" which were people who "gave off good vibes".
