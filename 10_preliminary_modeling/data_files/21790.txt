I saw smoke coming out of a door and out of a chimney from our shanty. I went in and Mike Brown was putting some coal in a small potbelly stove. I said, "There is enough coal in the stove. It is not cold." He went out and I put a couple lumps of coal into the stove. Then I looked up at the pipes and they were disconnected. That's what caused the smoke to come into the shed. I was putting the pipes together. I stretched one of the wires holding the pipes and it broke. There were a lot of safety pins fastened together to hold the pipes, so I coupled them and fixed the pipes. I drove my car in the dark. The lights were out and I could see I was steering over the curb on the sidewalk. I was afraid I would hit a lamppost, so I stopped the car.
