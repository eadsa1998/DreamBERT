All is set. On top of the shanty I was pushing a new kind of toy car. It was to run indefinitely. There were two of them. They would get stuck in the weeds and I would have to give them a lift out of the weeds. Then they would go. A lady was loading a bag with milk bottles and head lettuce and the bag broke. A blonde lady sat on a stable top with little Bobby and a different small baby. I saw a picture of a shotgun shell 6 inches long. John T. shot at me with his shotgun. I ran for cover and saw someone moving in the tall weeds, so I shot over his head.
