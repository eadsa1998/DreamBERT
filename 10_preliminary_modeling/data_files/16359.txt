I had an assistant. It wasn't really a hired assistant, but another student helping me. And I was back at Westport High School, or Westport College -- I couldn't figure out which one it was. And she was helping me find my room numbers for next year's classes. I think it was Latisha from the Wilcox Center. And she was showing me where my psychology class is, but she said that if I go too far to one side, past the psychology class, I would be in the Special Ed Department and there were all kinds of whackos in there that I didn't want to be around. And so she advised me to go around one way to get to the other thing. And then we met up with Samantha and Derek, who had driven down, I guess, and Latisha kind of turned me over to them and went about her away. And Samantha and Derek and I were trying to find an elevator to get down and we found one. We got down and out to this like pool area, and it looked like the pool was outside, but I guess it really wasn't, because it was an echoey echo chamber around there. And I can't remember if I wanted to get in and swim or not, but I remember that it was an echoey echo chamber. And Derek went in there started walking around and around the perimeter of the pool, saying, "It collapsed, it collapsed, it collapsed! The World Trade Center collapsed!" And this was kind of upsetting Samantha, but she didn't want to show it. [laugh] I mean, this is totally off the wall, but that's what he did in my dream. And then we got back in the car for some reason, and we were going to go home, and Samantha was like laying in my lap and crying. She was like the size of me and I could like support her, and her legs were like falling on the floor. I could support her body. And she had dark hair like me. And, but I knew she wasn't me; she was Samantha. And then we kept driving, and then Derek was talking about next time maybe that Mom can run him down. And about that time I woke up.
