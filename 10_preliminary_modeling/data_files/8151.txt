I was explaining to a man about the Maori Drawing. I was telling him about drawing a circle in the dirt that is as tall as your body and as wide as your arm span. I said to him, which is probably pretty close to the same. He doubted that was true. He went up to the wall, maybe a chalkboard, and was calculating what seemed to be his arm span. It was 66 inches. I thought to myself, That is five feet and six inches. Since I had been standing next to him I realized that he wasn't much taller than me so it was likely pretty accurate. I went up to him. I don't know if I actually said that to him, or something about what he was doing and my thoughts that 5 ft 6 in was pretty accurate. Maybe I was going to ask him that. Then I thought, I'm 5 ft 3 in and I have 2 inch heels on right now and you're not much taller than me. I don't know if I was just thinking it or if I actually said it to him.
