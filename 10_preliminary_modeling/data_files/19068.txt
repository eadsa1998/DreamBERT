I remember being at a hotel, and I recall that I lived there and I was leaving. As I was going out the door, I recall that my wife was coming in. She was coming in with some friend of hers. My wife looked exactly like the television wife of Danny Thomas. I remember telling her she hadn't been in and hadn't cooked me any breakfast for two days. I remember that she griped back at me, and I recall that I said, "Cook breakfast and I'll be right back and cook 2 breakfasts." As I walked away, there was someone coming up to the door. This person was a tall young man. He fell in with me and we started talking. Then we went down on the elevator. I remember some business deal. I can't recall actually what it was, but for some reason we went down to the bathroom and he was shaving and I was with him, and I invited him up for breakfast. I recall that I was describing what we were going to have or something, and I said, "We are going to have spoon bill." He said something about not being able to afford it or something like that. I recall I said, "It's on the house," or something like that. "Don't worry, my wife is going to make it." Then I remember talking with him. For some reason the conversation worked around, and I had asked him if he was in the dream research project, and he said yeah. That's the last I recall. [I'm not married, so I don't know why I would appear to be married in this dream. This tall person that I met and went downstairs with and had invited for breakfast for some reason was familiar and reminded me of a friend of mine who goes to Florida State and is due to come in any day now. It wasn't him, but for some reason, it made me recall him.]
