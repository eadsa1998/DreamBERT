We stayed at these people's house and they were really rude. They lived in a mansion and I kept getting mad at everyone for everything. Then we went to Disneyland and I saw people from school there. They said, "Hi," and I followed my brother and mom onto a roller coaster. I was really mad at them because I hate roller coasters and I was on one. Before I could get out, the roller coaster started moving and I started to feel sick, so I closed my eyes and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I got lost because my mom and my brother disappeared. This scrawny black guy who was supposed to be nice picked me up to kidnap me, but everyone just sat looking at me. Someone set me free. I chose not to go with all my friends. There were always homeless hobos on the benches at Disneyland.
