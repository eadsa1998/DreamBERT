Mom and I were supposed to go to Jackson and on the last minute our flight was cancelled. And we were running around trying to get our bags, and then we were at the house. And Dad was telling us that he was going to register with the government that he was deceased [laugh]. And then this rescue truck came by and Dad told them to turn on their siren, and they did; they turned on their siren, it was so loud. And then we were riding in it and we got down to the pier area where those cabanas are, and Philip was chasing me around trying to get my elevator key because my elevator key was able to start, he was able to stick it in one of the poles, electrical panels at the top of one of the poles and he would start, turn on a siren with it. So he was trying to get my elevator key. By the way, at school I usually use the elevator so I have a key and I keep it on my wrist. But in my dream he was chasing me around for it, and he didn't know that it was on my wrist. He thought it was in my pocket. And he finally got it, and just before he was able to do anything with it, I woke up. Last night I had a sort of bizarre dream. I had a dream that I was sitting in the car with the engine off. You know how you turn the engine off, but you leave the ignition on so you can still run the secondary circuits? Well, I dreamt that I was sitting in the car with the engine off but the radio on, and it was on 94.9, and we were at a gas station and Mom was filling up the tank. And all of a sudden Dad comes in and sits in the passenger seat and we call on Zach for some reason. I don't know why we called Zach, but we did. And Mom starts the ignition, I mean she starts the engine, and Dad starts -- I don't know -- he starts really falling around, and then Mom starts driving like a crazy woman and saying, "Zach, Zach, would you please stop!" Well, she's the one driving like a crazy woman, and we were just about ready to crash and I woke up.
