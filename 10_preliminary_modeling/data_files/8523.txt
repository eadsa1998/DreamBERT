I was at my birth home and had called some landscaping specialists to come and trim my geraniums, though I don't know why they would be mine. They had grown as tall as the house and had grown into the gutters, like between the gutters and the roof in some cases. One of my brothers or sisters walked up and I explained what was going on. Using my hands I showed them how big around some of the stalks had grown. They were 3-4 inches in diameter. There were so many men there working on this I couldn't keep my eye on all of them at once. Some of the workers were on the roof working and some were on the ground. They were also on various sides of the house. I went to the end of the house where Mother and Daddy's bedroom was and saw that they had cut down a dogwood tree there. I was extremely upset because they weren't supposed to do that and I had no idea why they did. It was not nearly as tall as the house and there was no way that it could be interfering with the gutters. I asked someone about it and they tried to tell me that it would be causing a problem soon and that's why they cut it down. I was very upset and didn't believe them. There was a small Maple tree nearby and I was very stern in telling them not to touch it, to leave it as is. One of my brothers walked up and I told them what happened. I was so afraid of what Mother or Daddy would say about the Dogwood being cut down. I kept walking around the house, watching what they were doing and talking to other siblings that were there. I used my hands to show someone else how big around the Geranium stalks were. I was very nervous that they were going to cut the small Maple tree down as well.
