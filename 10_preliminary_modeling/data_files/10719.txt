I dreamed I was to be married to the boy I go with (20) when he appeared. However, it was not him but his father (50). Everything was very confused. I remember emptying my father's (48) suitcase in my bedroom and then hurriedly putting everything back in again, remembering asking my girlfriend (19) whether the wedding announcements were sent out. Then I remember having rings on my finger. Father of the boy I go with changed into boyfriend. Rings were large and black made of wood and etched with gold. I thought them very strange.
