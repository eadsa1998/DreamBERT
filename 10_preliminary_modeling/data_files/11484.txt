One evening I went down to my friend's house to pay him a visit. When I came in, Richard's mother told me I would find him resting in his bedroom. I walked into his bedroom and was quite surprised to find his younger cousin there and Richard in his pajamas. (He always lies down in his street clothes when he takes a rest, and he never wears pajamas.) When I came in he jumped up grinning and we started to wrestle around the room.
