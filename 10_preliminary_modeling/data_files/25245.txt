 I'm at Grandma Redding's house in the upstairs bathroom trying to urinate. My sister Heather comes in the door and says there is a tornado 5 hours west of Langville. I figure that is about 1.5 hours from where we are now. My brother Wally goes into the room where my sister Ramona and I are sleeping. Ramona is still asleep. He looks out the windows, to check the weather. I think we should let Ramona sleep. I go out of the bathroom. Heather goes into the bathroom, saying she has to vomit. She is staying in my aunt Raquel's old bedroom. My brother Wally is staying in my uncle Danny Redding's room. I never get a chance to urinate.
