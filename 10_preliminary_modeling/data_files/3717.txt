Two men, one tiny and one large, are in partnership to poison us. I am a member of a rich family and the large man is like a butler to us. We have to become like detectives to figure out what they are up to. They have a spittle-like white substance they are using to poison us with. Somehow, the man in my family manages to poison them with their own poison. It takes a while to act, so when they learn they'd been poisoned, they suddenly stop chasing us and decide to go to the theatre. We don't trust them and follow to keep an eye on them. The woman of the family, Polly, comes with us. I am sort of her. We follow them outside the mansion. A large group of our employees are out there, doing yard work and cleaning things and laying down a layer of dirt for the garden or the patio. They stare at us in disbelief, because we are not dressed up fancy like we always do, but in ordinary comfortable clothes, even though we are going to the theatre. I (Polly) pause, then say, "You people are sure snobs. This is a style called comfort." They then laugh and relax a bit. I say, "I bought it at the best store in town for this sort of thing," and I name a local, cheap clothing store. They joke back. Now the two poisoned men don't feel well and decide to come back in the mansion. We try to follow them, still not trusting them to cause us damage. The large man has changed into a robe and is laying face down on a couch. The tiny man is locked in the bathroom feeling ill, so we assume. The large man had said something to me on the way back in about how they had managed to take Polly with them, meaning they had poisoned her on the sly. I try to find the piece of paper in a sheaf of them in my hand to prove what they said, because I didn't really catch it all and was unsure if they said that or not. I need to know because if it is true, I must tell Polly. I can't find it. Finally the large man says it's all right. We didn't poison Polly.
