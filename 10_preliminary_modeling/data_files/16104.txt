I didn't get up for school until 6:45 and then I was rushing around trying to catch the bus, and nobody was here. So I didn't really have to report to anybody about why I was so late. But anyway, I dreamt that I didn't have time, I still had time to recover. And then I was at school. I don't remember the rest.
