Last night I dreamt that I was playing bridge in the middle of the Adelbert main walk with JS (fraternity brother, 19). The other players were unidentifiable. At 12 o'clock I ran into the Adelbert main building to see Dean Jones to take him to our fraternity for lunch, but I returned to continue playing bridge until 1 o'clock, when I again dashed into the Adelbert building to call someone at my fraternity to say I was unable to bring Jones over for lunch. I don't remember ever seeing Jones in the dream.
