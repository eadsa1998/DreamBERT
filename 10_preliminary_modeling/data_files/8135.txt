I was with Matthew at PLU. We were driving around campus. There were street flags hanging on every block, maybe 2 or 3 on each block. Each flag was advertising 4-6 things on campus. The flags were green and had two different colors of lettering. Some of the words were in a brighter color than the others. I think there was someone else in the car with us. I asked how students would know something, though I don't remember what, about the difference in the words on the flags. They said by the brighter color. Now I was with Matthew in a store on campus. He was going to be putting up one of the Christmas trees on campus. He had a tree, some silver garland, and some grapefruit-sized orange ornaments in a shopping cart. I didn't want to say much because I knew he probably wanted to make the decisions about how to do the tree but I also wanted him to think through what he needed. I asked him if he was going to put garland on the tree, even though I saw it in the cart. It didn't look to me like he had enough. When I asked he lifted up the garland from the cart and I saw he had plenty. Then I asked him if he was going to do the whole tree in orange ornaments. Again he lifted some things from the cart but this time he saw that he didn't have enough ornaments. We went down another aisle and found maybe two more groups of orange ornaments. The one group he was looking at actually looked like oranges. They appeared to have a long, 5-6 inch stem on them that was a hook shape on the end that you would use to hang them on the tree. Matthew picked one of them up and was looking at it. We realized that they actually had orange juice in them. I said that was a cool idea since there were so many viruses going around, they would be pretty on the tree plus they would serve the students well.
