I was a bookkeeper for some firm downtown. My boss was Carl Helms, 51, an old boss I had when I worked before entering college. Instead of posting accounts or figures I remember myself pasting pictures in a scrapbook with scotch tape. I had difficulty tearing off the scotch tape with my teeth and also sticking the pictures on the page.
