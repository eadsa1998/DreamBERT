They brought in heaping plates but mine looked less than the rest. The others had ice cream as well as meat and vegetables. When the waitress came near again, I told her I had no ice cream. As she went to get some, I told her I also had no water. She said I'd been away so I didn't get any water and should have milk instead. I protested that I had not been away and that I never got milk.
