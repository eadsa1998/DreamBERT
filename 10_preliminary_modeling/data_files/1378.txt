I am at a big feast. A young kid is being obnoxious. We decide to not wait for a friend of a friend, and start eating. I go in and walk past the long table. As I pass one man, I ignore him and go sit at the head of the table. I have 2 choices, a high stool for sopranos or a lower one for altos. I sit on the high one.
