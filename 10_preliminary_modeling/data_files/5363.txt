I dreamed that the girls from my Spain program were al having a party in my old 6th grade classroom, which was actually my 1st grade classroom. Anyway, we were making a huge mess, and Jessica started ripping things off the wall. She kept saying something like, "Well it's not like the teacher's out there or anything." And of course, when I opened the door, Mrs. Montana was standing there and was very angry with us. She told us to clean everything up. I ate all her food and she just gave me a disappointed look, but I didn't care for some reason. Then I was at the beach with Alexis and Pauline, and Pauline had to come stay with me for 2 weeks. We were going to hang out and have fun! We were talking about our AP scores, and she got a 1, which I had found odd. Finally, I was online in the dining room where our piano is, and there was a huge storm outside. I was planning to meet all my friends at this baseball game, but the power kept going out, so I kept getting disconnected. I ran outside because I had to go save Mason. And then Anthony sent me a back-to-school package.
