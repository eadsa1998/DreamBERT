I am in a long hall and reach a door. A male siren spirit in a white tuxedo or formal dinner jacket approaches me. I'm backed up to the door and can't get it open. He's coming closer and I'm afraid, maybe he'll kill me. Maybe there will be pain, but as his transparent body floats into mine, I become aware of love and passion and don't want to leave. I can't feel him physically but I feel his emotions. They are intense and I am so hungry for those good feelings, I don't attempt to escape.
