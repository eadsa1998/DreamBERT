I was shopping with my mother. I left her and came to a narrow street. There was a lady in a hole about 4 feet below the sidewalk. I jumped down there. Women were doing erotic dances. Men were there too. They invited me to stay, but I left. Later I was in a store with a lunch counter. (When I awoke, I did not at first recall the dream. I only recalled two squares above a straight line. When later I recalled the dream, I guessed that the two squares represented the room with the dancers and the store, and the straight line represented the street at the start of the dream.)
