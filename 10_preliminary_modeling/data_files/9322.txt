I was at the library doing research on Ezra Pound. Later on I was sitting on the curb or by the street on an easy chair. A friend came by with a recently discovered book manuscript of Pound in Pound's handwriting. He showed the first page--title had a Pound touch like "The Lyric Bottom of the River Boater's Moonlight Wife." He flipped through to show the tacky re-writings and scribbles in the margins and pasted paper as he cut out and rearranged the order. My friend said, "Pound is a magnificent poet and this early work shows it." I didn't see it, but felt I must not be critical since my friend is a poet and critic, and I am so weak as poet and critic. My friend didn't seem to notice me, but he was lonely for someone to talk to and I seemed the best person under the circumstances to share his zeal for Pound. The last page of the book had the word ELLIPSE done by Pound. I studied it a moment and said, "Like Blake," but he didn't respond very much--just nodded. It was to me Blake's swirls of angels, spiral nebulae, man-in-moon, and fetus curled up.
