Oriental man playing recorder-like instrument to his dog, which showed attention to his master and sat at his feet while the Oriental played. I tried to play, but the recorder was made of stone, and the dog would not pay attention to me. There was more than I can't remember. Oriental setting -- not recognized. No feelings. Indefinite time.
