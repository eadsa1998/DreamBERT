 My friend Melanie McDyss shows up at my house (not my real home) to visit. We haven't seen each other in a long time. We talk and joke. I'm lying on the floor and she is sitting on my chest. She spreads her legs and sits with her crotch facing my head. This is uncomfortable for me because I interpret it as sexual but know that she has no sexual intent by this, and is just comfortable sitting like that: she is trusting of me not to abuse, alter, or threaten our friendship. I ask her about her life. She tells me about a relationship with a man named Luis. She says she is in love with him. At 8:01pm she jokes that I've never asked her to stay over later than 8:00pm. I'm then cooking and eating broccoli with spaghetti sauce. We continue to talk. I joke that I try to keep a three to five day schedule in keeping in contact with her, while she seems to keep a five to seven day schedule in keeping touch with me. I say, "I always try to get you, get in touch with you every three to five days." Instantly I recognize the parapraxis, but continue talking, nonchalantly joking as if it didn't occur. She doesn't let on that she recognized it, which is characteristic of her, regardless of if she actually recognized it, which I think she did. She explains that by coming over to see me tonight she was consciously breaking out of the five to seven day schedule. Earlier, we talked about her and Luis going to Luis' paternal grandmother's funeral. Luis is Catholic.
