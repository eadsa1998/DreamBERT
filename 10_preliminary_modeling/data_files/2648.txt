I am flying a plane, or I am flying, not sure which. A man loves me and is supportive. Another man is trying to win the race with me and is quite willing to kill me, if need be, to be the victor. It's neck and neck, we are evenly matched. I am barely ahead of him. He tries to crash into me and I go straight up to override him. I come to the ceiling (with fire protection sprinklers on it). He climbs up and tries to shoot me. I duck and dive and twist all around and then am the winner. He crashes. I go into a building where my supportive male friend waits. Now there's some kind of difficulty affecting the land. I must live in this one room place and wait. I then go to a grocery store, hoping I'm not too late and all the food I need or want is already gone. I do find what I need - milk, eggs, butter, meat for meatloaf. I go back to my room. The prince (my supportive male) is there. The grocery store man becomes the queen of the land. There is some question if another will usurp my prince's rightful place. Now we're at a reception and everyone dotes on us, giving expensive gifts. The leering, fat man touches the cleavage of my breasts and I say, "Stop that." My prince gets possessive and says, "Stop that." The fat man just grins and winks.
