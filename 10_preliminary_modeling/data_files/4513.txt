["Talking about Charla."] I am talking with a woman. She and I are friends. It is a pleasant talk. Then I am dressed in a short brown skirt and nylons. I am young and thin. I sit on the floor. I am talking with the woman and several men, like Chuck and a nice man are listening in. The nice man comes over and sits beside me. He is curled up comfortably very close to me. I like him and would love to cuddle with him, but I am aware that he is married. He asks me how old Charla is and I say 14 years old. Then he asks how is she doing. I explain that she has trouble because she has a chemical imbalance. He is sympathetic for her and for me. He then comes close and brushes something gently away from my eye. I at first think he is trying to kiss me. I lean into it, wanting it, then I pull back because it would be wrong. He looks at me, wondering what I'm doing. I smile apologetically. We continue talking in a friendly way about Charla.
