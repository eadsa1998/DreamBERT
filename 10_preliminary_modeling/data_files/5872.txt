Am walking down a street behind two boys and note that one on left has his hair rolled up on curlers at the bottom, below his cap. I think it strange for a boy to have such long hair. In striding past them, I glance quickly aside at his face and then note he is wearing a skirt and he is really a girl. Later I enter a house and two Scottish girls that I apparently know well are sitting in the kitchen at a table with their mother. They appear to be visiting and this is my house. A fourth woman is also in the kitchen and apparently she is my mother. They are all laughing. I ask if they are telling unclean stories. I then am glad as I shake hands with them, that I am wearing my favorite tartan tie. Then look down at it and note I don't have it on, but instead am wearing an orange turtle neck and no tie.
