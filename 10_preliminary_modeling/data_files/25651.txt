 I have a green pack of cigarettes. My friend has a pack too. There are 12 in a pack. I smoke one. I don't inhale at first, but then I do inhale. I decide to throw the rest of the pack away. It is hard to do: the cigarettes are addictive. I throw the pack away. My friend has through his pack away too.
