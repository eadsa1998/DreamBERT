 I'm at home with my old classmates Bud Slick, Kari Otis, and another woman. A storm is brewing outside. I see wind swirling and hear there is a tornado forming. We talk about which area of the house we should go to: the northwest corner. I quickly direct everyone downstairs to the basement. We huddle in the pit room full of its junk. Looking up, I see the tornado over our home. It's a massive, swirling brown wind. We must be without part of the roof because I can see up. The tornado has a devastating effect, causing lots of damage: mass destruction. The people I'm with are safe. We are going to take a shower. Kari is in a wheelchair. I go into the shower, which is a very large open tile room with many shower stalls. I walk around the corner, out of Kari's view, and shower naked. Bud helps Kari get into the shower in her wheelchair. He then goes around the corner where I can see him and showers with a pair of boxer shorts on. Later I talk with him about my back pain. He says I should exercise my back: do pull-ups.
