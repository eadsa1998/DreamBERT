I was at a rich person's house, at which there was a party. There was a gate out the front and I saw Andrew McCarthy, Molly Ringwald and James Spader walking up to it; they all looked how they did in Pretty in Pink. James Spader was wearing that light blue suit thing. I wasn't even paying attention to the other two. I decided I was dreaming. James Spader smiled and I was thinking for the gate to be gone as I reached for him and then it was. I grabbed him and started making out with him. James had his arms around me, while we were still making out and then we ran into the house. He was looking around for something and said "Where's that fuck-in?" I said "What's a fuck-in?" and I thought 'Oh my God, I just swore! Oh, doesn't matter it's only a dream'. He said "That thing that you fuck in," I said quietly "That thing you fuck in". Then I lost lucidity. Then we were some other guy and some other girl and the guy liked this other girl, but decided to have sex with that girl anyway. They ran off and were in this tent inside. This lady saw them and asked "What are you doing?" and he said "Yoga".
