Inez and Charles, Frank's mother and father, come to visit. Inez is able to sit up and eat and is very talkative. We have peach halves in jello, just as she used to make. She was at the time in a nursing home, 2 months before her death. Charles can walk and work and is his old self. At one point Charles is outside on the sidewalk, stemming a broken water main with a young boy's help. We talk about the family. Inez has a bed right by the table in the dining room. See Donna, my sponsor in the Greek Church. She comes over and asks: "How do you do it?" and she meets Inez. She sympathizes and we talk. Frank wants to go walking by the lake when food is served; so we sit down and eat again. Zena says: " I really was hungry." See lots of people, lots of activity.
