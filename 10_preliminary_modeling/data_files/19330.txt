I was running around my neighborhood and I was being chased by G.I. Joe guys. They were chasing me around and I ran into a G.I. guy and he was my friend. He said "what are you doling here?" I said, "Why are you guys chasing me?" Then I was in the middle of the jungle and I was a James Bond type guy. I ran around shooting guys, and I walked across a bridge, and on the other side a grenade blew up and that's all I remember.
