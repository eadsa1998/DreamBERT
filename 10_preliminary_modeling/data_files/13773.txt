We went to Seabird again. We got there and I realized I had forgotten some stuff -- my camera, iPod etc. Ezra and Dad were there. We were waiting in the car for a bit. Mom was coming up later to drop some stuff off, so I called her and she was on her way and she said that I "HAD" to come to a restaurant later with her and Darren. I told her to pick me up. Dad complained because I left early. The restaurant was this one where they would help you with a diet. Mom gave me a brochure for it and I chucked it into a fire. It was an expensive looking place.
