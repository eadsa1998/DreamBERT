Hunting for a dress in my closet, push aside three gaily-colored prints. I want one to wear when working. Where is that red and white seersucker? Would that green dress do? I say to my roommate, "I will put this box (small, round, blue and white) on the dresser. It had been bare but now there were several bottles and a couple of refrigerator dishes containing food on it. Now I am emptying a chest, lay out hangers and hang the dresses as I take them out but decide to leave the linen and other things in the chest.
