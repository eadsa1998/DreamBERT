I and Valerie are sitting in a chair together and my mother is seated in another chair. she tells a story about Jake when he was a baby. She relates that someone noticed his tail wrapped around her breast when he was nursing. I suddenly say, "Oh, what an incredible metaphor." She looks at me suspiciously, with huge eyes with enormous pupils, and says, "Is this going to be profound?" I sigh with frustration. She never understands. I try to explain, "When other people say 'space,' you hear that you are at fault." She does not understand and I am frustrated at her again.
