 I'm with a blind man. I ask him about the experiment I saw involving him, where a video camera focused on an image or object stimulated the movement of pins on his back to help him "see". We walk in his home. We go into a room, which may be my brother Wally's room. We stay in the room for a while. The man can drive. I drive a vehicle down 3rd Street in Oak Valley. He follows me. I turn to go home. He goes around back to the driveway, and I park in the front. The man is my high school basketball teammate Olie Kecker. Olie pulls into the driveway, only slightly brushing the lilac bushes by the garbage cans. I think that he has really memorized every detail of the route he just drove. He drives his red Chevrolet Cavalier.
