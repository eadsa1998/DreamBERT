Dylan helps me. I am confused. He walks me to Andrea's office. She shows me her pet, sort of like an alligator. I back away from it. Then I look for Dylan. He's fast asleep laying on top of the alligator! I think, "Oh, he must be so tired. I won't wake him," but I hope he wakes up. He does. A client comes in all confused. We deal with her. I talk to the C. dept. I want it to shape up. I walked barefooted. I remember being surprised that I can do it. No pain.
