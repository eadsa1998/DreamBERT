An entire family is traveling on a train. The parents are in one car, some of the children in other cars. I see their sleeping faces as though I'm outside the train looking at them through the windows. It is a tragedy. This entire family of nice people are going to die. I witness the wreck and then they are all dead. I feel sad.
