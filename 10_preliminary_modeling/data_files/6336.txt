I was in some type of warehouse, and I had a friend with me although I can't recall who it was. I remember his telling me that we had to get away and then we were running from these two guys. One was an Indian and the other was just mean-looking. We got caught and the Indian was sticking a needle right into my finger. This hurt, within the dream, and then I woke up.
