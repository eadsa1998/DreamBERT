I'm sitting with my father and  my wife, and I say that I'm so terribly afraid of death. I'm crying. Pappie comes over to me and is very kind. He agrees how important it is to realize my fear and to cry. In the presence of my wife--witness to my entire adult life until death do us part--feel deeply comforted as I'm being consoled by my dead father.
