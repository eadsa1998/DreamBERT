I was flying in Gordon Park over the beach. I had a hanky on my face so no one could recognize me. It was covered. When I stopped there, I looked at the sky and it was dark from black clouds like a storm coming. I met a small girl and she said her boyfriend was much older and bigger than she, but she let him intercourse her. She wanted me to give her advice if she should let her dad know about this. We walked thru Gordon Park, then came to a creek that had 2 planks tied together as a bridge. The girl stepped over the creek, so I stepped over across the creek. Then the girl went thru a window. I was going to go thru and a woman closed the window. As I walked by the side of the house, step across came to me. I was watching a tractor go in front of us. All at once it was converted into a big truck. I mean big about a forty-ton loader. Then I was driving up a hill and the big truck was pushing me up the hill. Then it turned out to be freight cars we were on. The engine ahead of us was also attached to our cars. He then uncoupled and then went up a side track. We moved up on a different side track and then he came down by us fast and close. I watched the track and it was so close to our track. I don't know how he got by without bumping us. We were living in the house on East 68th St. I thought again here, here we are again the same old home. I went out on the porch of the attic and I got hold of the banister railing and it was loose. I pulled it down on the porch because I didn't want it to fall down the floors on somebody. Then I laid on the floor afraid to move. The porch was old and weak and would break with me. I came into the attic and it was a big room. I saw a girl in the other end of the room. I was flying down to her and I was surprised when I got down to the other end there were other women there and it was a store. There were all kinds of pans and kettles hanging on the walls and ceiling of the attic. I looked in surprise at the stock.
