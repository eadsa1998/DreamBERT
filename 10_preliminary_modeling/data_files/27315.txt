I dreamed I was at a dinner party. The fellow I have been going steady with was there also and many others who I could not recognize. A girl came up to talk to me and accidently made a faux-pax by saying she had been on a date with G., my steady. G. heard her and made no explanation, but looked only hostile. Unseen, I left the dinner party and walked out the front door of Dr. Bacon's house at the P. Andy, a fellow I had dated came walking up the driveway smiling. Even though I knew he could help me, I walked around the house away from him.
