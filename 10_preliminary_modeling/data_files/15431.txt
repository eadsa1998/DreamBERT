I was driving and had to pull onto a fast road (110km/h). It was very busy. I got onto it, but then missed my turn off (which was on the right) and had to turn around at the end. It was a house. I went in and it was supposed to be the family from Christmas Vacation, but Chevy Chase was the only one I recognized. The wife was vacuuming the lounge and assumed I was there to help and told me what to do, so I followed along. There was a thing to wet the lounge with (like, soak it). Then I had to do the dishes and they had a tiny sink. Chevy came in and was like "Wow, you look hot" thinking I was his wife and she was embarrassed. I knew it was a dream, but in another dream and I was 'forcing' this dream [not a real lucid]. The wife left. I was in a hall and Chevy came and I kissed him. I told him it was a dream and then we had sex. We had an affair for a while. Then it showed the wife with a guy and she told him that she loved him and they were actually bad guys. I was thinking that was good because then she was out of the picture. Later, I was at a shop with Ezra, Emery and some of his other friends. They started playing 'my' music and a song by The Beach Boys came on and they covered their ears and I was like "Yeah, because this is REAL music, not noise!".
