I was at the old house with Mom and Ezra. I was sleeping out in the lounge for some reason. No-one would leave me alone. I turned off the TV and lights and then they left. Mom was suspicious I had taken a book of hers. She pulled out a book I had with me, but it was a different book and she apologized. I went to my room and I had been avoiding it because heaps of moths had died in there. I was then at a shop/university and Aliyah was there and said "oh hi!". She was doing history to get a pass for human biology. I said I was scared about university next year. This guy made us put something in the car and it was full in the back.
