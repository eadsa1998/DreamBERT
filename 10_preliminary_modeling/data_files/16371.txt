I was going on a date with Doug to a baseball game, and the thing was, Doug worked at a restaurant near the Dome, so he could just stay at the baseball game and watch. But I, with the sound things, and I was going to kind of show him what I did, but we ended up eating lunch at this restaurant there and it was like a walk-through buffet like pizzeria thing. And you would go through and you would get some pizza and you'd get some other finger foods, and then you'd go in this ____________ for your drink. Well, I think for a minute Doug turned into Dad and he got me this like sushi soup type of stuff, and I was "Yuk" when I had my eyes on some pizza or some chicken fingers or something like that, and I didn't even have time to get a drink. So then we walked down a ramp that led like right into the baseball field, and ___________ and somehow I finished my yuk soup. And then I drift into another scene and I'm walking along with Dad, and I'm up on the second floor where I do my DJ stuff at Gate One. And it's dark, and it's like in the middle of the night and there are only a few lights on in there. And there's a spotlight like from the ceiling shining down to the first _____ like right in front of where I would work. And the floor up on the balcony is like _____ in linoleum instead of carpet, and it was kind of strange. I was thinking, "Man, do I have to set up in this total darkness?" And it wasn't really a scary darkness, because darkness isn't scary; it's just a wide open like familiar space. I'm comfortable in the dark. And then I think all the offices were dark and locked up. And then there was -- I don't remember -- going somewhere out to the truck, and then I woke up.
