Swaining.  I was 'in' a green book.  The pages were red or orange, depending on where in the book they were.  Something mystical about it.  Two fat cats in a wagon turn into women, possibly witches; a tall house changes (rearranges/reorders) sporadically.  There is lots of blood.  It has arches and mirrored hallways.  It was erie, possibly evil.  My brother Stuart on the back computer.  Not Stuart; he was my brother, but it was my badminton teammate Ben.  He was playing a game with a top view perspective.  Somehow it was an interesting game, almost like Myst.  I had to change or 'swain' old women/cats back to their realms, somehow related to getting them through small holes in the wall, too.  "Swaining" was the term used by the book for mystical/psychical transformations.  It was important, for whatever purpose we were working towards -something with the order of the old book, and needing to follow it (including getting the women/cats home).
