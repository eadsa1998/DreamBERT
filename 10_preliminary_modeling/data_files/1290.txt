I am helping at a cafeteria style restaurant. I dish up the potatoes, mashed, the peas and the gravy. Some of the customers are impatient. They want the spare ribs and aren't interested in the side dishes. I tell them they have to get the side dishes first. After awhile, I run out of potatoes. It's time to clean up and leave. My man and I finish up and start to walk over to our quarters. We have our arms wrapped around each other tightly. It is affectionate togetherness. We walk in unison. Someone is thinking, "Aha! Love among co-workers. I didn't know they were a pair!" We go in to sit at a long table. My chair is broken. It has no seat and it's crowded up next to co-worker Jerome. I remove it to get another chair. Now it's bedtime. I go to my room. Now that I have a man, it is changed. A blue bedspread. The clothes are all picked up. The pink stand is on my side. I get into bed. He's already there. We cuddle.
