I was watching Doctor Who. The Doctor (David Tennant) landed right in front of some cops. Some girl's sister died and her other sister went loopy. The older one befriended The Doctor somehow. The cops were trying to map out the TARDIS, but they couldn't get in. Obviously, it was big. The Doctor and the girl were in a backyard and there were smokes on the windowsill, so The Doctor was having a smoke, and I was thinking he was hot. The mother of the girl turned up and he realized they were all bad and he shot the mother because she was going to shoot him. Darren woke me up to open his door. There were clothes that I was supposed to pick up. Quincy's phone was there.
