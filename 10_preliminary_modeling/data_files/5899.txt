Am in a rented car and stop in a city street and park. Walk past an open store and see piles of cartons containing junk apparently and I walk in and start rummaging thru. Find old clothes and papers and at the same time a woman is looking thru the same carton. We speak in Spanish. I then note at the other side of room a meeting of men from my office. This is a meeting which I had declined to attend, saying I was much too busy. They look at me and wonder what I am doing there with the cartons. I walk past them, saying nothing, and look at my watch as though I was late for something. It says 10 pm, almost, and I reach for a phone to call home. Find the phone, but the receiver is at the end of a long wire and hidden behind some other cartons. I go into another office and it apparently belongs to a church. There are women and children in the room waiting for a minister. I don't phone, but walk out to car which I find parked off the street and on an asphalted lot. I swing into traffic just as light changes, cutting off other cars and manage to get to my lane and speed off.
