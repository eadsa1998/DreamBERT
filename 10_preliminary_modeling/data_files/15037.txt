I had two ANS102 assignments. They both involved me doing a prac somewhere. Mom and I went to one and it was at the old house. The games room door was on the other side and I ran out and Ms Burton was there with some others at a table. I asked it was too late and she said that it was. I mentioned that I used to live here but my aunt did now. Rover and some other people were in the pool. Then I was at Nana's. Aunt Sally and her kids came over. One of them were given $25 in coins and chucked it in the bin and left. I took it out and put in my money box. I had a small shelf to keep stuff on. I was reorganizing it. I was then outside a shop. Stuff started chasing me and acting weird. I went into a building and Wilhemina (Ugly Betty) was in a room. I went past and I heard a snort. I was near Marc (Ugly Betty) and I called out "Willy?" and she replied "yeah" and I asked "are you alive?" and then she said "yes". She also took something from me and Dad and herself? There was something do with clothes. Then I was in a shop and stuff was chasing me down the aisles etc. At the end of it, people thought I was crazy because they hadn't seen any of it. Then I was this guy and he was singing a song in a strait jacket. The walls behind him had weird creatures on them and they were filming him. I could get reputation with some creatures (like in World of Warcraft).
