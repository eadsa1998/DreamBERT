["Anastasia in her tree house."] I climb up a tall ladder to visit Anastasia in her little tree house. She sort of lives there. She is writing her diary. She leaves for a few moments and I start to read it. At first I feel guilty because it is her private diary but then I notice it is printed in the newspaper, so it's public. It has things written about me. I am trying to understand what she says in the diary. She is describing a day and what we did and said. I look out and see an ocean liner on the sea. Someone is going on vacation. Anastasia is around near by suggesting people can have their diaries printed for free by doing some delivery service for the newspaper and then they will print your stuff. She thinks people should do that.
