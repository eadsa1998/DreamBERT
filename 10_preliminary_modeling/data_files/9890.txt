At Church, in an old Cathedral-type Church. In the middle of the liturgy there is a wild, Indian dance. I climb up to where the choir sings and I am singing on the left side, instead of the right side in reality. I carry a hammer. Much scenery is stored up in the loft. I think "Church is supposed to be like theater." Then we are standing around; a man wearing a gas mask remarks -- "I stood on the left side, but caption said on right side..." Confusion. Anyhow, we are having chicken and it tasted just delicious he said. Earlier I saw cars and later they looked small in relation to tall buildings. I say to myself, "Ahh, when you see things in relation to other things, then they appear in their true size."
