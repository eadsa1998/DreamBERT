There are six pieces of poster board and each one has pictures of six individual and different ceramic masks. I was scanning the pictures into the computer and then creating a separate graphic for each mask and naming them. I was naming them based on the poster board they came from. So, for example, there were six that I called Magic so I named them magic 1, magic 2, etc. This particular poster board was somehow related to the famous Australian crocodile hunter that died recently and has been in the news so much. His wife and his dad were talking about a good name for this poster board and they came up with the name magic because they said, quite simply, that is what he was. He was simply pure magic. I was quite moved by their admiration for him. I see that there are some actual masks sitting to my right and immediately realize that I already have pictures of them in my computer but I do need to rename each of the pictures.
