I was at Nana's and I was staying the night and sleeping in the lounge. I was trying to turn the TV off but it wouldn't turn off. They had this weird video camera thing plugged in, so I went to Nana's room to ask what I was supposed to do, but she and Poppa were both sleeping. So I just unplugged the camera and then it turned off.
