Here's an old dream that I remember from grad school. I was at the end of my first year of graduate psychology when I had this dream. I was walking down this hill on campus, one that I've walked on dozens of times, and suddenly I feel myself slip and fall into this like frozen whirlpool and I just keep spinning around and around until I eventually fly out. I figured out that dream to mean that I was being wishy-washy about deciding whether or not to stay in school and the flying out made me think of quitting. I quit shortly after the dream and felt good about the decision.
