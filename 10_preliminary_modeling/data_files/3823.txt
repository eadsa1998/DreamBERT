["Fords Have Gone Out of Business."] I hear an announcer saying that Fords have gone out of business. Their sales are down and maybe in a few years they will try again. I am surprised. I have a Ford and I need to do some errands. I walk to the barn it is in and notice my left knee hurts very badly. I am limping and crying. Howard seems unconcerned about my pain and does not offer to help me drive. I get into the driver's seat and notice that the ford van is now just a metal frame with a steering wheel and a seat. I try to drive forward with great painful effort but am blocked by piles of boxes. I back up, trying to avoid the children's toys scattered on the floor. I turn left to drive down a steep wooden ramp. I narrowly miss more children's toys and make it outside. I am crying with the pain.
