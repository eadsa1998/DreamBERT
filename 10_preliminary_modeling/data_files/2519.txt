I am swimming, holding a baby girl. She and I are flying just above the water because we swim so effortlessly. I get cocky and we're flying/swimming over a huge expanse of water. Suddenly "my little girl" is there too and we start floundering. She goes under and I have a terrible dilemma. Do I let go of the one to save the other and endanger myself as well? I dive for her and find her. Now I'm working hard to keep all of us afloat. I see a huge rubber life raft and we get in it, only it must have a leak in it because it's very limp and water is getting in. We fold up the limp parts and I ask the girls to bail. We manage to stay afloat. We float over to an opening in the wall and I see monsters, three ugly things. They capture me and put me in a cage with it hanging over some boiling oil or black sewage gunk. If I don't choose one of these uglies to marry, they'll dump me in the gunk. I don't know which fate is worse. I decide to choose one of the uglies. [BL]
