Will's parents owned a bookstore. It was a popular hangout spot. I watched a video about the Iran Contra affair. At the end, they took 142 leaders from different countries and hung them twenty at a time from gigantic steel gallows. I thought, and said, "Gee, that's dumb! They didn't hang anybody from the United States!!" My mom overheard this, and we got into another one of those stupid political debates.
