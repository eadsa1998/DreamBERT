I was a female hippo in a Disney cartoon movie, yet I was watching from a monitor.  Somehow I'd gotten stuck in a tiny hole underground.  There were two tunnels to the left that I could go through.  I chose the one on the left most, but was stopped by a badger.  So I went back to where I was sitting.  A long badger came out of one tunnel and went into the other.  Then another badger came.  I was somewhat dejected and not sure how I'd gotten there.  I said I was hungry.  One of the badgers came out with a very large pincer bug, and I was grateful and ate it.  Then I was conscious of cuddling with my boyfriend Jeremy and I kissed him a couple times.  There was music playing, a song called, "You" that sounded like it was by Paul Simon.  It was a very pretty song and I was enjoying it and the cuddle until Jeremy's alarm went off and woke me up.  I was irritated; I wanted to hear the rest of the song.
