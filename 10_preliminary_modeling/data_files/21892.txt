I was at our old home on East 68th St. I was in the attic and I saw a pheasant up there. It flew out. We had sleeping quarters there. One of the beds squeaked and when someone slept on it, it squeaked and kind of frightened them. Then I was by my mother's house and I looked out the window and Mary had a cross made of paper outside as a Christmas decoration. We had a photographer come over and he was going to take our pictures. My brother Steve was dressed for the occasion.
