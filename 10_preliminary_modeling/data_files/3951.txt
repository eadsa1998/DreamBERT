["Men Against the women. I fight."]  I am in the military. The men are very much against me and plan on making it so difficult I drop out, if I don't die first. I have a one room I live in and keep the door locked with a large brass colored key which is very slow in locking. When the men storm up to the door, I lock it, just barely getting it locked in time.  I am angry at them and determined not to let them win. During maneuvers, they put  me in danger and don't help me but I fight hard and aggressively. The officer in charge gets left behind in a mud pit and can't get out. He's up to his chest in it and stuck. I find him and help him out. Some of the men are relenting toward me now. I keep fighting.
