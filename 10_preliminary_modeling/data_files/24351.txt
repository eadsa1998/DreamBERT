There was a threat of a widespread world disaster; it would hit one time, and then we would see what would happen. Chances are, many would survive. It was not going to be the end of the world--so long as we were prepared.  I thought the threat was overblown. I was riding my bike up and down these very green streets; they reminded me of a cross between parts of a nearby city and the town where I went to high school. There was a lake from that town that I passed, but it seemed older and less maintained . The swan pens were nowhere to be seen. I knew I had ridden too far. I was going to the apartment of a friend who had a basement that would make a good bomb shelter. I turned around and pedaled back up the street. they were bumpy. made of brick; both Williamsburg and the downtown where I went to high school have that characteristic. I came upon the house, and went inside. It was very much like my own apartment. And there was a roommate there. Not my actual roommate, but Javier, a friend from work who was assigned to the same police station with me this week. He was trying to sleep in his own bed, but I was more interested in getting things ready, or at least cleaning up. The place was sort of a mess. There was a big plasma tv and it was tilted onto its side over the entertainment center.
