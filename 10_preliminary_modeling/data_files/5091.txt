A woman is the boss. She tells us what to do. We volunteer to help at a store. It's been a hard day and I'm starting to go home. I pass a beat-up car in the grass and think I've seen that image before. Why am I seeing it again? It must mean something. Maybe I dreamed it. Another woman and I walk past (I'm in my wheelchair) the candy section in the store. She pulls off a box and opens it. I remember we get things for free because we work there. I say, "Wait," and turn to look at the selections. I see the ice-cream section and wonder if there's any sugar-free ones. I see the cookie section. There's a machine. The boss woman put dough in it and huge, sticky rolls come out. They aren't quite done right, a bit doughy but still delicious. People are eating them. I try a bite, wondering if all that sugar will affect my irregular heart beat. The boss woman is crazy and goes off. I guess she dies. The other woman says to me, "At least I talked Sweet Liberty from walking." She felt proud of that. (Sweet liberty is a woman who is upset at the crazy boss woman and almost left.) I offer to help at the counter and the other woman says no, there's not much I can do, being disabled. All I could do would be the easy parts that everyone wants to do, like the cash register. I say, "Now don't be too hasty. Let's check it out. I might be more help to you than you think." [BL]
