I was standing on top of a cliff looking over some valleys and perhaps over the sea, and I was looking at water rising. And apparently some sort of catastrophe happened to the well or something like that in which the lowlands and valleys were flooded and the water was still steadily rising. Then the next episode I was completely identified with a young girl -- young in the sense of being about my age. This girl was living in an apt. which were on some cliffs. I think these were the same cliffs as in the last episode. And several other people were also staying there. The temp. was slowly getting warmer a well as the water level rising. The girl had an air conditioner in her apt. and she got into a fight or a verbal argument mainly with several of the other men who were living around in other apts. about what was going to happen to her air conditioner when she left or something like that because she told them  about some kinds of plans about going north in a couple of days, although she -- and I use "she" rather than "I," although I was completely identified with her -- was thinking that at the time of the dream that perhaps she was just lying to these men to put them off. She was afraid they might take her air conditioner. She also had some other kind of gadget which she was afraid they would take. This particular dream episode was very similar to science fiction stories which I read, one yesterday and one about four or five days ago.
