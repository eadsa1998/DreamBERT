We were looking down on some cartoons or comics of people doing different things. They were moving objects, like the last one was men singing. They came by with their mouth open, about three of them, and the last one had his mouth wide open about the size of a bowling ball. We were driving by the suburbs and at the end of the streets we saw big terraces or apartments. We saw some homes built up on stilts, four posts about 20 ft. off the ground and there were shady roofs with floors built away from the apartments for the tenants. They were built on big tree trunks about 5 ft. off the ground. I was flying around with some other fellows. Two of them were chasing one another. One had a gun and was trying to get a bead on the other one as they flew in a circle. Paul, the guard or watchman at Dill's, was selling something, as usual. We were working to 6 am that day.
