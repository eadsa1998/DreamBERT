The part of the dream about my former girlfriend Karen is remarkable. It was as if I knew her-- her voice, words, quirks and comments --they all seemed like her, or at least how I imagine her to be. We are in the front yard of a 70s-style coral stone house. The landscaping is lush, and the deep green grass in front is thick. She and I roll around in it, and we play fight. Just earlier, I had been locked in the bathroom of a local pharmacy, and inside was an examining room where the patient had just left.  I was accidentally locked inside. I pounded on the door without panic for someone to open it. I was more angry they could let such a hazard exist. There was a brown pair of old person's pants with the belt still attached in the examination chair. I then upped the ante, and kicked down the door after I saw the person outside wasn't responding-- a delivery guy in a blue short-sleeve button up, like a postman or mechanic. Once I got out and made it to the parking lot, Karen was there. She greeted me with a poster-board sized card, with a loving message written on it. Part of it was in regular writing, but the other part was in colorful marker or color pencil. I was so infatuated with her thoughtfulness and creativity. It was like a giant Facebook message, physically embodied. The word love was in there, but unclear in its meaning, like a "hey you". But back to the grass. We moved and played and laid there in the yard. And finally, I pinned her, and I looked down at her face. It was spry, playful, inviting, happy. We stood up, and we kissed. We kept on, and I hoped she enjoyed it. She kissed me back.
