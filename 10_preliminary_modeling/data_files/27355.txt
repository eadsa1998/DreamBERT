I was riding in a small airplane with my boyfriend (23). I was very much afraid because I was sure we were going to crash. Suddenly, the plane began to fall toward some trees. I screamed, and then my boyfriend changed into another friend of mine (M-28). Then we were out of the plane and walking around on the bottom of the ocean. It was very beautiful, and I felt quite happy. We were walking toward a large building which seemed to be a church. Then a soft sound of bells came from the church. The bells grew louder and louder--then I realized it was the alarm clock.
