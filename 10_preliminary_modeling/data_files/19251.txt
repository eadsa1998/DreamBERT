I play b-ball. My dream was like real life like. It didn't feel like a dream. It started that me and a friend (I forget which one) went to the grocery store. At the store we got a lot of liquor. We brought it back to school for some reason - to put in our b-ball lockers. It wasn't our real locker room, but in my dream it was. Our coach came in, saw the liquor, and had a lot of counseling with her. She was crying, I was crying. Very weird.
