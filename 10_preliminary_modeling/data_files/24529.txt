I'm in my 30s and dating Roberta, a woman known while an undergrad. She is bright, sincere, confident, though not good looking. We decide to go to a movie.  I ask about getting there by subway. She's says we have a little time.  Then we are waiting in line at an airport. I recognize the man in front of me.  He is Wally H., one of my best friends in college (who later became a movie star). He is young and strikingly handsome and without guile. But to greet him, first I have to straddle a banister. In doing so, I say, "If I don't do this right, I won't be walking for a while," or similar words. Then I say, "Wally, this is Roberta. Roberta, this is Wally." In fact, they had dated each other in college. Throughout the dream I feel good.
