Ginny walks up to me. She says, "Well, how about it? You and I have been this way for 41 years now. Are we going to admit it?" I shake my head no and then feel embarrassed for her, because she had brought up the sensitive issue of sexual feelings and I turned her down. I smile at her gently to convey that I still like her and I won't leave her because she has brought it up.
