I was parked at the office which looked similar, but was more cottage-like and in a different location. Someone parked there who wasn't meant to be there and I tried to convince them to leave. It was night and quite dark. I left, but then I think it was day. I was driving down this street a little fast and I was approaching a red light, and the left lane had a few cars in it so I changed to the right lane but I didn't quite realise it was red and went straight through and realising my mistake I instantly pulled over, and a cop car pulled up behind me with its lights and siren on. I told the policeman I had seen the green light ahead and gotten confused and didn't know what I was thinking. He seemed to consider letting me off, but then gave me a $200 fine. I was annoyed about the fine and also having a blemish on my record.
