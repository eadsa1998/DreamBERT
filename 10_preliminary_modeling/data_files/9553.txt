       Father Andrew is himself again. We are walking down a street that is brilliantly lit up, with balloons and many people. It is like an Easter parade! He is wearing white-yellow robes and he has an arm about me. As we walk, we talk about how to teach children: "I am deeply committed to the fact that children do not just learn visually." I almost shout; he smiles and I remove my arm, but he still holds me, almost upholds me. "That is why I am in the Church, because when they see you do this--give Communion--then they really learn!" He agrees and I snuggle in his arm as we walk in perfect joy and peace.
