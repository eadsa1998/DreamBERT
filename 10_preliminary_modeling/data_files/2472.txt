Mark and I have been enjoying a long night of sensual touching and are about to make love. My mother comes up from behind the couch and has a disapproving look on her face. It's nearly 5 am and I should not do this. I should go to bed and get some sleep. I am annoyed with her and I get up and walk her to her bedroom. I am very firm and say, "Look, you go to sleep and leave us alone! Don't come in there because we are going to make love, so if you don't want to be embarrassed, don't come in." I leave her and return to Mark.
