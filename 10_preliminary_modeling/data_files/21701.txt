Judy had some kind of clothes or material and she wanted everything dressed in it. So I dressed myself and her dolls in the material. I can't recall the color. It was one color. It was night. I looked up and saw a giant big plane fly by. It seemed that it carried at least 500 people. A policeman came by and said, "I would like to arrest a man today." He said, "That man that broke your window." I said, "Yes, that guy." I heard "Force Me." Marty and I went into a telephone booth. There was a light on and I could see my money and my figures. I paid him what I owe him.
