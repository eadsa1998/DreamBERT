In the jacuzzi whirlpool: playing around with a baby who is not yet toilet trained and pees in the water. I wash him off and play with him, but later lose him in the crowd. I get out of the pool, but I cannot find my locker; a woman gives me the key from her locker and I change clothes. Then I go out to find my car and cannot find it either. I end up eating some chocolate cake and then remember where I left the car.
