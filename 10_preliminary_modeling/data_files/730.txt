Lynn and Barry came visiting. I was making coffee. I couldn't do it correctly. The coffee was called "win" and were in "tea type bags." The water boiled. I put in the bag. It broke. I made very thick "candy." I made the second one OK. I watched the pure water being colored. I took the mistake and the cup to Lynn and Barry. They looked a little annoyed. I apologized. I went back. I made another cup of coffee, correctly.
