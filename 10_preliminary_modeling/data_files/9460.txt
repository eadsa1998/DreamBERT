Frank and I are in bed; someone asks: Are you married? "yes." "Did he give you a ring?" Yes." I show the ring; it has attachments for cigarettes, place for ashes, and a box that contains mirror, comb, powder and both salts and perfume. "How like Frank, even better and more complete than it looks." -- We ride along with Mother and Father. Frank gets along well with my father but my mother keeps saying "he's so handsome" and "You'll have to die your hair pretty soon."
