I'm at work (veterinary hospital) and a box arrives for me. Inside are seven or eight dog leashes. All different sizes and colors and many with price tags still on them. I'm wondering what's going on and I find a small note which says my dog has died -- she was hit by a car and Joan--the person who adopted my dog last month-- wants me to have all her leashes back. The leashes were bright and new and vivid. Friends are around me but I just feel empty and not surprised.
