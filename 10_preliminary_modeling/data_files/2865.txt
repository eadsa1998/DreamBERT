I am seated in a rocking chair in the middle of a hall. I get up and start walking back, perhaps toward the basement. Then I decide this takes a lot of energy and I would be better off if I turned around and continued my journey in a forward way, the way I was going originally. I see the rocking chair is in the middle of the hall and move it out of people's way to the right side of the hall, but it is next to and blocking the door of a woman's room. I peek in and see Peggy M standing there with a walking cane. She smiles at me. I imagine how noisy and awkward it would be to sit in the rocker and try to travel like it was my wheelchair. I decide to walk on.
