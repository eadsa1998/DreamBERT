Eugene and I were dating and had had sex. He was staying over. Ezra and Dad were making up some sleeping plan and it was messing up our plan to sleep in the same bed. I called some counseling place and they were talking to both of us. Then some kiddy van pulled up outside. This guy came out and was giving us stuff and informing us how babies were made, how to look after babies and Eugene and I were like 'what the hell?'.
