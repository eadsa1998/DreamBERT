I had a dream last night that I was in a hospital for some reason. I didn't feel like I was hurt or sick or anything, but for some reason I was in a hospital. And Melinda was in the hospital. I think she was either in the hospital or visiting me. But there were two rooms that we got to roam around, and one of them was my room and it was like all messed up with other people's junk. And I don't remember if it had one or not, but the other room had a radio that was kind of falling apart, and it was turned on and I couldn't figure out how to turn it off. It had a CD player top thing to it, but the lid came off. [laugh] And things were just all falling apart on it. And eventually I got it to shut off somehow. And then I was talking to her about what would we do if we ever had a fire drill in here, and then this message came over the intercom that they were going to have one. But here's the funny thing: the funny thing is that the fire alarm sound was going to be like frog's croaking, and that was how there were frogs croaking outside when I woke up.
