I was in my kitchen and my kitchen wasn't quite the same as it is in waking life. There were cabinets on both opposing walls. I was facing cabinets on the wall opposite the stove. I had sanded two of them down. I was getting ready to refinish them. And Niecy Nash, from the TV program Clean House, came in. They were there doing the show at someone else's house. Maybe someone close by? It was like she had taken a break from the show and had come in to see what I was doing. She said something about me refinishing the cabinets. I showed her how much nicer, how much prettier the wood looked after I had sanded them down. I just sanded down the doors on two of the cabinets. I was thinking about replacing the hardware as well. The ones I had sanded still had some spots that needed to be sanded. And on the one, the wood looked much prettier. First I showed her the one closest to the doorway. She saw the difference but wasn't all that impressed. Then I showed her the other one and she realized what I was talking about then how you could really see the wood grain and how pretty it was. So then she kind of agreed that it was a good idea. But it wasn't until then, after I had sanded two of them down, that I started thinking about the fact that it is a rented building and would the landlord mind me doing this? I didn't think they would because I would just be improving the property. Making it look nicer. But yet, I didn't ask them beforehand. And now I had already done two of them so I was kind of stuck.
