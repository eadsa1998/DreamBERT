We were at a beach and then giant waves started to come, and bit by bit the sea was coming out and we started to run. I was with people I didn't recognize. We ran up to some rocks to get away from the beach and in my flight I found a baby and I picked her up and ran with her. But when I was climbing the rocks, the water was already at my hips and pulled me. I shouted loudly and a young man who was in front of me picked up the baby and I was able to save myself. I have had this dream before.
