I dreamt I was in college and one night I was called to meet Bob, my boyfriend, at his aunt's house. So after class I walked to his aunt's house on a very cold day. As I reached her house, I looked in the window and he was amusing all the children in the house. I knocked on the door and he let me in. I also began playing games with the children, then the dream faded away.
