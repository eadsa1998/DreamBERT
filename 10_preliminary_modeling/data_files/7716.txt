I was at CIIS. Matthew Lauer and Ann Curry were there. There was some joke about a red bull. I was in a car with someone. They were driving. There was a life-size, cardboard, red bull in the driveway. I was telling Matthew and Ann C about it and said it sounds like something Julien would do. I went to sit down for breakfast. Julien D was there eating a bowl of cereal. They looked like colored cornball cereal. He looked at me and said, Vas is los? [German phrase I have no idea how to spell]. I said, wait a minute. Let me think. Then said, Noonagaboona. [Again, German, no idea how to spell.] I said wait a minute because I thought something else should be said first. I sat down next to Julien D and began eating cereal also.
