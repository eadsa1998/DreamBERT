First locality is the interior of a scantily furnished tent. The only things remembered are a cot, a canvas hammock, and a sack full or dust cloths. Next, I am in a kitchen with a cup and saucer in my hand. Fill cup with boiling water but I have my usual difficulty in carrying it without slipping -- in fact, it seems that the boiling water is about to be spilled on my legs, and to prevent this I throw cup and saucer into a corner behind a table. The cup rolls around on floor but does not break. I tell Mamma that no damage was done to the rug, though the waxed floor might be spotted if the water was allowed to remain. I wish to mop up the water if a cloth is available. Next, several of us are in the tent looking for mop cloths. Mamma and I find one about the same time, mine a piece of an old, thin, cotton sock, hers a nice, soft piece form a pair of underclothes. Mamma laughs a little and says that her cloth is more absorbent. I agree and pick it up.
