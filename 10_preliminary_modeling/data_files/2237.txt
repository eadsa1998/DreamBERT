I decide to do the dishes. There's just a few left to do. I start in and it feels nice to be cleaning up a job that's been sitting around for a while, and then I notice I'm going to be late! So I hurry away to change. I wear black and red. I see another woman next to me and realize with surprise that she and I are transfusing our blood to each other through tubes hooked into our legs. I hadn't felt them put in the needle. After that's all over, I get ready to go to a very fancy party, at a spiffy uptown address. At the last moment I pick up a red ribbon for my hair. It's very ornate, with black on one side, red on the other and becomes a mask for my face. All the fragile curly cues are attached to a center of plastic like a false fingernail that I glue to my nose. I look very beautiful. As I walk out people stop and stare at my beauty. A huge crowd is outside seated on benches. I see a line of women in maroon shirts and notice it clashes with my red. Then I see a young Clyde (my Granddad) seated. We smile at each other.
