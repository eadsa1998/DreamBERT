My first dream was that I was on a show like America's Next Top Model with all my girlfriends. We had to do different tasks or photo shoots before one of us was eliminated. I remember being worried because everyone else had really elaborate outfits, and I was only wearing a black t-shirt. One of the judges in the audience came up to me and asked if I was in another ethnic group. I told her I was in my ethnic group, but she still wrote down another ethnic group on my info sheet. Then Abigail and I were taking a break from the photo shoots and we went to the library, where we ate dried mangoes and peanut M&amp;Ms. The next morning we all had to take showers, and I had 3 sponges, but no soap, so I wasn't able to. In my next dream I was skiing with my family somewhere, but I still needed a new winter coat. My mother and I were going to go shopping. I think it was Christmas or Thanksgiving or something, because this old woman was there and she was supposed to be my grandmother, but she wasn't. My father was making apple pie shaped into funny faces. My brother was making chocolate butter cream frosting. I had two pieces of this incredible cake (it tasted so good in my dream) before I felt like a pig and was so glad I had only eaten that in my dream and not in real life. My mother and I left for the mall. The car was parked in the backyard instead of in our driveway, but anyway. I tried on lots of different coats, but they only had sizes 29 and 32, which I don't even think are real sizes in women's coats. I ended up not finding anything and left. When I got home I had to baby sit some random family I've never met before. I brought 101 Dalmatians coloring books and two boxes of crayons, because I guess I knew there was a little girl who would want to color. When the parents came home, they were congratulating me on being accepted to medical school. The kid's uncle had three heads, and I tried not to stare. Then I woke up.
