 I'm sitting with my mom and siblings at a table. My brother Wally talks about crystal meth and some other drugs. He says he is taking these drugs, just like that rock climber is, and he motions to his left where through a fishbowl lens I see a scene of a man climbing up a rock cliff. The table where I'm sitting with my family is near the cliff, at the height of the climber, who is about 50 feet from the top of the gray rock cliff. It's as if we are floating there viewing the climber. The climber swings along the cliff, pounding in stakes and pulling out other stakes. He takes a test by tugging on a rope and the rock that the stack was in crumbles. The climber hangs from a single stake, and lowers himself down slowly to get hold of the other stake. I'm afraid that he'll fall and die, because the one stake that is pounded in isn't in place securely. It seems that this stake may be attached to a single small shrub, which could pull out.
