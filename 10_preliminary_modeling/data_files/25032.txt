 I am going east on 1st St. to Carter school to open gym to see when I work. There are two breaks in the curb, where bicycles ride up and down. (In real life, there is only one break.) I go in the door, and see that Bronwen Knife and family have the gym. She says, "Hey, athlete!" I am surprised, since our interactions have never been particularly friendly, but say hi. I tell her I just have to see when I work. We walk in the lunchroom. Mr. Knife is there. He is speaking at a conference in the near future at Brimson. He pulls out a piece of paper with my name on it and the words "Honor Society". I recognize it from when I was the Honor Society President in high school. He's going to use it in his presentation. I tell them I'm just gong to call Mrs. Bevner to see when I work. Then I see Mrs. Bevner and ask her. She is socially cold, as usual. Mrs. Minikel, my third grade teacher, is there. I had a crush on her when I was younger. Mrs. Bevner sends her niece with me up to her office to see when I work. Her office is very neat. There is a huge catalog; a directory, on her desk, of all the topics that she needs to deal with. He niece pulls out a slip of paper and shows it to me. I don't work at all, but I already knew this. I have known it all along. It is as if finding out my work schedule was an excuse to be back at the school. We walk down the stairs. Someone farts. It sounds like it was me, but I know it wasn't.
