I was having kind of an odd dream last night, although it wasn't really all that odd, considering everything that's been going on in my life. I dreamt that I was in a hotel room and I was at an audio work station with a computer screen kind of far away, and there was a typing keyboard and there was a musical piano keyboard. And they were both on the same sliding tray. And I was blasting some kind of rock and roll music and playing along on the keyboard, and I had it the level of mix so that I could hear my playing even louder than the blasting music. And I was jamming out and playing the records and everything, and then I realized that there were two or three other girls in the same room that were hearing all of this, and it was really late at night. And I apologized to them because I was really probably keeping them up. And they said, "Oh no, that's okay." And somebody called up the stairs that Mom had come for me. Now I don't know how or why, but somehow Uncle Larry and Aunt Christine were involved here somewhere. And apparently I was staying somewhere until they could get me, and they came to get me. And I was trying to pack up a whole bunch of stuff in my bags because it was like suddenly I had to get up and go. And I was packing like computer speakers and like crayons and books and just a whole bunch of bulky stuff that people wouldn't normally take on a trip, I was packing in my bags. And I was thinking, "How am I ever going to carry all this stuff around?" And I can remember doing the scene kind of like typical, where there are these stairs and they're kind of steep, and you go up and it's a dead end and you get really claustrophobic or something. And it was one of those kind of scenes in Grammy's house, but I can't really why or what or anything. And then I was feeding chickens back here at the house. There were two of them. There was a red, a Rhode Island Red, and there was a B¬¬______ Ch______. I forget the official name of B_____ Ch_____ r_____, but I think you know what I mean. And it was another one of those dreams where we had them for a while and I had been forgetting to feed them and I felt so awful, and I didn't know how long they had been here and I had forgotten to feed them. And apparently they were doing okay because they scratched around and found bugs and stuff, but I was doling out cracked corn and bird seed to them, and the B____ Ch____ chicken was kind of half blind, and we had a Rhode Island red that was kind of half blind, but this chicken wasn't getting the idea that I had food for them, and I was trying to get her to eat some and she wouldn't. She kept running away. And she kept just kind of wandering around. And finally she went in the garage and was eating little bits of my hand. And then, as I was starting to wake up, I was having this other scene where the dream was the dream world was not really a place in the mind, but it was an actual other dimension place you could go to. And I was kind of thinking in my dream that if I carried Big Bird to the dream world, then other people in my dreams would see him and I would be kind of _______. And in this scene I was kind of walking around in a living room at a big party, and I was carrying him, and there were all these different people that were talking. And then I woke up.
