 I'm with a man. We walk through buildings, office type areas, looking for a place to study. The offices we go into seem to be vacant, but I'm not comfortable there. A conference or lecture is being held, and I think the rooms may be used again soon. One room has a radio in it. I see a "Psych" office building. I want to go there and look. There is a toy or costume Halloween-type store there.
