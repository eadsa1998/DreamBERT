There was a grudge or a misunderstanding between us and a gang of bums. Our leader said, "Wait, I'm going down here a while and then when I get back, I will give the order to fight." But instead of coming back, he started to run away. And when the boys saw that, they started the fight. I was going across the lake, but there was a woman there that wanted to stab me with a knife. She was near a big plank. I dove under water and swam under the plank and got by her. Then I looked at the other end of the lake and there was a lot of water between me and the bank. I went for the bank across and I made it. When I got on shore, I was nude and with my fellow workers from White's. Now I thought how I would get home and get some clothes. I saw a fellow get angry at another fellow who was promoted to boss over him, and he knew this fellow did a lot of damage to the company property, especially the pipe lines. But he was found out and he ran away from the company. I was at the track. I played Bearsee and I saw the race and Bearsee won. The next time he was going to run, I was going to play the favorite of the first race who was beat by Bearsee to win and Bearsee for 3rd, but as I was going to the track, I was planning to play him 2nd and was sure he would come in 2nd. I looked at the entries and I saw Bearsee first and a lot of other entries. A man broke or shot a hole through a door and pointed the gun at me.
