We had camp and I went to school. We were told to meet somewhere. I saw Evelyn and asked her where to go and she said her house. I went there and was looking for Eugene. I saw Calvin walk past a window and he saw me and was laughing. I reminded Mom that I probably wouldn't like camp and she'd have to pick me up.
