Macy F and I were on a business trip together with Vince P, Tim R from ITI, and a much younger male that I didn't know before this trip. Macy F, Vince P, Tim R, and I were sharing one large room. There was a partition, or a wall, that separated the men's beds from ours. The younger male had gotten a separate room for himself. We had been out somewhere and came back to the hotel. All five of us were in the larger room. All but the younger male were sitting on Vince P or Tim's bed talking. Macy F and I were sitting at the foot of the bed and they were sitting at the head of the bed. I was getting really tired and sleepy so I laid down, on my side, but tried to keep myself awake to continue to participate in the conversation. As we continued to talk, each of the others did the same thing. We were each stretched out. By alternating body positions, we all fit in the bed. Tim R had been drinking, quite a bit. He sat up and reached for another drink. Vince P was trying to stop him because he knew Tim R had already had too much. Tim R wouldn't give up the drink so Vince P got a glass of milk and was trying to get him to alternate between the alcohol and the milk. Apparently, this was a common occurrence with Tim R. When I realized that I wondered if that had anything to do with my feeling of discomfort with him since I met him. I hadn't been able to identify why he made me uncomfortable. Maybe it had something to do with this type of behavior. Macy F and I decided to go with the young man to his room to get away from Tim R. Just before we left the room Tim R went over to my bed and started vomiting all over my bed, over and over. Macy F left and went into the other man's room. Something sexual happened after going into his room.
