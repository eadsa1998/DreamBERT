There was a movie set in the olden days. There was some Legionnaires type of disease. This guy was told to set off a bomb near these train tracks which was near a forest and some mountains. He died. This father guy said that it was a black guy so that the females didn't look. His daughter said "I'd kiss a nigger if I could" I was like 'What the hell?'.
