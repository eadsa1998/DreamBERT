Rick A and Bill Cra were there. I was working at an ice cream shop or a fair, not sure which. A child came up and asked for an adult sundae. It was supposed to have vanilla and chocolate ice cream. I put the vanilla in and then started to put strawberry in it. I realized my mistake and scraped the strawberry out. I was being interviewed I was at a ball game or racetrack. Ruth M was there. It was a bright, sunny day. I was sitting in the grass, wearing a dark-colored short skirt. I pulled the skirt down as far as I could while sitting. It came just above my knees.
