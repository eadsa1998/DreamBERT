Walking past an athletic field where a game is being played on what looks like a football field. A high (about 8 feet) wire fence surrounds the field. There are 8 or 10 players on a side. A net, similar to a tennis net, stretches across the middle. The ball used is much like an indoor baseball, but a little smaller, and black in color. The side to the west kicks off, but the ball has a wide "in" curve, and goes out of bounds at about the 30 yard line, and rolls up against the fence. I wonder if the ball will roll under the fence, in which case I intend to throw it back; but the fence is "tight," right down to the ground, and the ball stays in the playing field.
