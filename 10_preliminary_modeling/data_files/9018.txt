I received one chapter of my dissertation back, I think chapter two. It was after I had completed Deven D's edits. He sent it back with no additional edits. I felt very good about that. It was very affirming. There was also a conversation with someone but I don't know who it was or what it was about. Then I also received one of the other chapters back from Deven D. I think that was chapter 6. It didn't have very many edits so I felt very good about that also. I felt encouraged and affirmed.
