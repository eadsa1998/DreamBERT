I am deeply in love with a priest (Gregory Peck). I cannot speak of my love to him because it is wrong. He loves me too. I go up to him (he's big and wearing ornamental robes). I lay my hands on his chest and say goodbye. I (I am Deborah Kerr) turn and walk away, feeling my grief intensely. Then I am standing under a tree. A man dressed in Robin hood-like clothes (ordinary clothes, not a priest's robe) comes under the tree with me. It is the man I love who has given up the priesthood. I stare at him, knowing on the unconscious level it is he. He moves tree branches like he's closing the curtains on a window for privacy. I wait, filled with love, wonderment and happiness and sadness. We are about to kiss.
