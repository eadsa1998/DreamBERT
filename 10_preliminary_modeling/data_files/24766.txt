There was an ant and a giant. First, the giant died and reincarnated, then the ant. They both really missed each other. (This is something that I remember in vivid detail.) The ant was on the bench trying to make a statue of the giant, and some animal comes over and tells the ant where he could see this giant. Then the animal shows the ant to a pile of bones. Setting: A bench, and some unknown places. Characters: Ant, giant, townsfolk. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared. It as really sad, and I've never had a dream like it before. I wonder what it could mean.
