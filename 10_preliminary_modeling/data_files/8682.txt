We were at some kind of outdoor picnic. I had spoken to Jody S a couple of times, noticing that she gotten her hair cut, even shorter than mine, but I didn't say anything. It looked really cute. I finally walked up behind her and put my hand on the back of her hair and told her how much I like it. Now she is standing in front of me. She is holding a paper plate with picnic food on it. I asked her if she cut her hair because of the wedding and she said, I'll teach her to try to tell me how to wear my hair.
