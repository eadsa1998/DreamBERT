I was trying to convince a group of technicians about the need to use mechanical means for making up the lots (of the Agrarian reform's land distribution). I was defending the interests of the peasants and my cousin B. was helping me. However, we were unable to do anything because they weren't interested in distributing the land. At the end I withdrew sadly, and coming out of the office I found my friend N. who was pregnant (I was so happy that I assume it was my child).
