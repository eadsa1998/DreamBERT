There was thing at school and we got paired up with people. I don't know who I got paired up with first, but this particular time I got paired with Eugene. He was on a computer playing Runescape and I said that I'd been playing for 3 years [in reality, almost 2 years, in the dream I was telling the truth though]. When he got off we were talking about it. He also played Sims 2. There was all this water around. We were in this canoe and it was broken. Someone threw bags out of a window (of a house that had cars in it) and onto another boat. Daryl was in Calvin's class. Ezra was in a line for the computers. The next time I got paired up with Samantha and I was angry about it. I was watching the episode of The Outer Limits with Colin Mochrie in it, but it wasn't him.
