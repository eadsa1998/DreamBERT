I was planning to go to Iraq with my class of some people from, I think, one of my humanities classes at Westport College, and not really for any serious negotiation, but just as tourists. They were going to show us how it is over there. And one of the main things that was important to know was that each little town square center thing had like this fountain thing with a telescope in the middle of it. And what you had to do when you were going to speak to people in the town square is about two or three feet away -- or maybe four feet -- stand up on this little stool and point an unloaded gun at the telescope thing so that they could see that you had no bullets in it. That was crazy! And so we had one of these little setups in our living room so that I could practice doing it, and I had a feeling like I wanted to get up on a stool thing and speak to those people, but I had no idea what the heck I wanted to say. And I guess this comes from when I hear about it on the news, I have no clue what it actually looks like over there. I can't really imagine. I've never really actually looked at the footage. I guess I should sometime. And in other parts of this dream I dreamt that Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town and we were in the car going somewhere, and we were stopping along the way at this church. And I don't know, there was just kind of stuff in there, and then I woke up.
