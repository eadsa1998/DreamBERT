I was riding a bus at night-in New York, I think.  At one stop I saw Steve Bender in an army uniform, walking beside the bus, toward a drugstore.  As he passed the back door, which was open, I said his name in a normal speaking voice (I wasn't absolutely sure it was him).  He didn't look, so I began to wonder, as the bus pulled away.  I pondered it for a while, wondering if I should get off and check.  Then I noticed that Carolyn Ackers was standing on the bus.  She was at least as tall as me, and wearing a uniform of some kind, with a dark skirt and white blouse.  She said she worked for some kind of karate club or something.  Apparently she wasn't married to Steve any longer, because she was with another man.  I asked her if that had been Steve that I saw, and she said yes.  I thought it would be fun to go back and visit with him a bit, but by that time we had gone several blocks and were in between two stops that were quite some distance apart.  When we got to the next stop, it turned out to be the end of the line.  I couldn't decide whether to say on the bus and ride it back, which would mean a wait before we got started, or to get off and walk back, which would also take some time-or whether to take another bus or a cab, which would mean paying an extra fare, with no assurance as to when one would come along.
