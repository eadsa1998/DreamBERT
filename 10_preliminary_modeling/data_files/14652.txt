I was at home. Mom and Ezra came and Nana and Poppa crashed into a pillar in the garage. There was a box of gnomes and Ezra said it was something to do with Sims 2. The newspaper said that Eric from True Blood had "just arrived in town" and I thought I might go. On IMDb, someone was saying that he was hot but 'George Clooney is hoter' and suggested some black woman or Reese Witherspoon as a replacement of Sookie (True Blood). We saw Transformers 3 at the cinema. The first 40 minutes were really good and only had Shia LaBeouf doing stuff (nothing to do with robots), then Megan Fox came along and I was like 'great now it will suck'. It was night in the movie and there were bits in the Earth, that were like a raised dome made of glass and all the robots were under the Earth and were planning to come back. There was a friendly one who was now under evil control. It was started stomping around and they were bigger than normal. In the cinema, most of us ended up upside down on the chair, hanging on to them. Then it stopped. It was really awesome and it was from like a strong air for effect. I went to the toilet and bought a ticket to some gay girl movie. I couldn't get back into our cinema because I had to get the ticket off Dad. When I got in the car, my hair was messy.
