I am on a trip to Italy with a lot of my friends and their families. I am thoroughly frustrated because most of the girls on the trip are my age and most of the boys are juniors and seniors. All the girls are acting slutty and fake and all the boys are buying it. I like Albert and he keeps being stolen away by a group of slutty girls. Everyone is ignoring me. So that night (in my dream), I just cried myself to sleep. I remember there being about 100 twin size beds just lined up against the walls. There was one room for the adults and one room for the kids. Everyone was talking loudly and having fun and no one noticed me crying. I am woken in the middle of the night (in my dream) to find Albert sitting on the edge of my bed. I remember seeing his deep blue eyes and they shone in the moonlight. I also remember looking around and seeing all the 100 beds completely empty. So then Albert leaned down and just kissed me really innocently and sweetly. But then there was a knock on the door so he pulled away and looked really afraid. He said, "I'll come back later" and left. Then I woke up because my mother really was knocking on my door to wake me up.
