I was at a library at a table with That's Life. I was facing away from the front and I was sitting at the back. This Native guy and a white guy came in and they were dodgy looking and I thought they were going to hold it up so I was going to leave but I didn't want to seem racist. But then they did hold it up. I put my phone in my pants so they couldn't get it. They sent me and this guy to lie on the floor. They shot the guy and I had the feeling he was with them. They let me go. I called Mom and there was a guy with a sniper near a tree just outside so I ran away and called her again when I was near Northtown. She was already there. I told her I was "near Dad's old work". She got me and we were driving down a road with lots of trees on either side. I saw tornado things in the distance and I freaked out and then saw more, but they were all going the other way.
