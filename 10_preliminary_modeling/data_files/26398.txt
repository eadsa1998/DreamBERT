 I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson. We seem to not have a canoe. There is a canoe with a long foam yoke in the water. We're going to use this canoe. It belongs to a man, and he will let us use it. It is an aluminum canoe with a dent, but it will work. The man takes a lot of photographs. The man seems to do some target shooting: there is a hole-filled target there. I am going to give him collateral for the canoe, so I look for my old Discover credit card that I've never used. I don't find it, but do find another credit card made of clear plastic. The man lives in Oak Valley, he says, and I tell him I'm also from there. He lives by MCI, which I know to be Roadside Company, down near the apartments next to the Dirty River. His last name is Aldger, and his middle name is Marshall. My middle name is Marshall too, I say. I consider not returning the canoe to him. There are chunks of ice on the water. Kevin and I are heavily packed. Kevin is trying to shovel snow with a plant holder. We're going to Oval Lake (which in real life is Fly Lake, I know).
