I was in a large room, perhaps a lab of some sort.  Something was wrong with my nose.  I let my old best friend Candy in, and started telling her about how odd it was to have a reunion when I just had a dream about classmates from first grade.  There was an Asian girl standing next to us as well, and I was trying hard to recognize her.  Candy called her Angelica, and I remembered; Argenta, the girl who couldn't decide what name she wanted to go by in first grade.  She was a lot taller that it seemed like she would ever be.
