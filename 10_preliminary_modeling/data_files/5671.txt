[1997-06-24] I dreamt that Sage's dog was at my house. I don't know what it was doing here, but I was petting this very silky soft, long-eared dog, bigger than my dog. He was licking me and was friendly and everything and when I woke up I realized Sage's dog, her dog that I was dreaming of, had been dead for a couple of years.
