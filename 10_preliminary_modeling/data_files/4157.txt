I am in a house. A man intends to kill everyone there. He is making his plans. It will be horrible. I must stop it. Somehow, I manage to either kill him or pressure him to kill himself. I saved myself and the family, but I feel terrible that I assisted in his death. His family mourns his loss, not knowing what he was going to do.
