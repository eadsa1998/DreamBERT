I was at some kind of athletic field with bleachers on two sides.  There was an informal game of some kind going on akin to volleyball, except with no net.  A ball was kept in the air all the time, both by those on the field and those in the stands.  I started out in the stands, then came on to the field.  It was amazing how long we could keep the ball in the air, even when it looked like it would hit the ground for sure.  After a while it did begin to hit the ground every once in a while.  The main performer on the field was a tall black woman with a red bandana on her head.  She looked like a Jamaican Aunt Jemima.  Finally I left there, worrying that I would be later than I had told my wife Bonita, and having to change clothes first, I think.
