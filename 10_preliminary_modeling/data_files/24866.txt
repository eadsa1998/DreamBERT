It was late at night and I was lying in bed in a plaid PJ top, and grey leggings, and my friend Shanna came in my room and told me to get out of bed and go back to my mom's room. My mom was lying in bed reading and told Shanna to sit down and tell her "if I was the one." I had no idea what they were talking about. Then Shanna got my robe and showed it to my mom, and said that this was the robe too. I had/have no idea what they were talking about. Setting: In my house, my mom's room and mine. Characters: Shanna, my friend at school, and my mom. Feelings and Thoughts: Confused. I feel strange about it because I have no clue what it means.
