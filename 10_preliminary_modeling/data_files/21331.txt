I was in Rivertown. I walked thru snow. I went into the snow up over my hips to my shoulders, then I turned around and was going to go back, but my friends from the shop helped me to get thru. I looked at a paper at the results, but can't recall the odd names of winners. Then it dawned on me to look again and remember them, but I couldn't find the result sheet. I looked, turned the pages and couldn't find them. I was walking down our street of my boyhood days at night.
