I am making love to a man like Billy Crystal. I am very sweet and tender, loving. He sobs, "I can't have sex with you because you make me feel so loved and cared for, I can't concentrate." I feel unhappy, because I'd like to go on, it feels good. Later, he is able to manage sexually and we have a pleasant orgasm.
