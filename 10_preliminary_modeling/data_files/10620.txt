Me and my family were going on vacation and my Mom was on an airplane. She was coming and we heard there was an airplane crash and she died. We were really sad and I started crying. Then I went to school and I told my friend Polly and this girl Karen and another friend Nancy. They didn't really seem to care. I started picking up coins on the floor. A man came up and told me about the crash and I started crying more.
