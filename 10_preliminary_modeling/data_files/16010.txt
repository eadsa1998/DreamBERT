I lived in an apartment thing at a train station. There were lots of underground stations and they all had huge apartment complexes. I was living with Frederick and Tristan and not sure if there was anyone else. We were still moving our stuff in. Some people were visiting. I went to my room and it was huge and my bed was near a window. The curtain was closed but was see through-ish. I didn't know if people could see in. I started humping a pillow, riding it quite hard and looked out the window to make sure no one could see. I was thinking about Frederick and having sex with him and I came, then I got up to do other things.
