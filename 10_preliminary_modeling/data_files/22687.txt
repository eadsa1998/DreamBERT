I had gone to Rio de Janeiro and I was very concerned with buying underwear which a girlfriend had asked me to get for her. I was running around a lot, and then I saw myself talking to a boyfriend whom I nicknamed "Rasputin" while I was there. We got in the water and we swam and swam, the water was icy and I didn't feel the cold. Afterwards, I felt exhausted and I called "Rasputin" to help me, but he did not come, and then when I saw him coming, it was no longer him but Richard, my boyfriend, and he offered me his hand, but I couldn't catch it, and I felt that I sank and reached the bottom and I felt I was dead.
