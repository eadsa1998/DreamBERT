Mom called me to say there was a job at some movie premier place to escort a B-grade actor called Scott Ferguson. I was like "What the hell?" and hung up. Then I was watching a movie. Scott Ferguson was actually Chuck Liddell, but was Patrick Dempsey. He was there with a "big name chick". He was there with James Marsden and I showed Dad. They were gay and together. There was something about Patrick Dempsey being stereotyped in the 80's to play gay characters. Judith Light had been playing lesbian characters. I then looked old and I looked in the mirror and complained. I looked really strange. Something exploded in the shower and I had to have a shower. Mom complained about my Beatles shirt. We went to Midvale shops. Mom was driving the car stupidly. Someone said "Smudgy". The back of the car got smashed and I yelled at Mom and Darren said something I don't remember.
