The TMM office was to be re-designed and the theme was 'planets'. Elissa was in charge of the placement of the planets in different sections of the office. Each executive had their own planet and their room became know as that planets room. The placement of the planets was finalized and it was so funny because Melody came over the loudspeaker and said "please send your sales reports to Uranus" which was Andrei's office. <br/
