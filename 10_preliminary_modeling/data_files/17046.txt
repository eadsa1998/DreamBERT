My mom and I walk down the stairs to some unknown house that's actually our house and look into the kitchen. My older brother is there and he has made a mess on the linoleum floor after my mother had just cleaned it, before she left. He first denied it, but it was obvious because the mud tracks matched his footprints and there were wax marks on the floor from his cross-country skis. My mom started complaining how we (my brothers and I) don't take care of the house when she puts so much effort into maintaining it. My brother appeased her by telling her there wasn't that high of a mess, meanwhile running a wet paper towel over the floor. My mom kept complaining with an upset undertone. Then my brother interjected that he came all the way home and he gets crapped on.
