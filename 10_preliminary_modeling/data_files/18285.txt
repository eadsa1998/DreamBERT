In another dream, I was with Janet Evans and we were discussing old times and what had happened to people we knew. Mary Lee was in an institution again, Jeanette had gotten divorced from Bill, married one of the Smith twins, and then married Bill again. Janet was unhappy, leading sort of a dull, childless existence. I thought I was very happy and very lucky in the circumstances that I had gotten away from all of this.
