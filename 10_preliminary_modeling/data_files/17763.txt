I had two apartments.  The second looked more run down.  The bed was against a window, and you could see the neighbor as the walls were windows.  I realized I would have to pay rent on both apartments, so it wasn't worth having one for only two days a week because the commute was better for those days.  I asked my boyfriend Jeremy which apartment he liked better.  For some reason he liked the second one, and I was disappointed.  I liked the other much better.
