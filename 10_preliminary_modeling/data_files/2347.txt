I insult my creative writing teacher by calling him Ron. He corrects me, his name is Rod. He leaves and I go outside to see huge boulders falling out of the sky. I run as best I can to the safety of the building, like a school. I go inside. These things are seed pods from outer space (aliens). They crash through windows and so on.
