I was visiting a woman in her house. I told her that I don't smoke. Later in my house my mother complained because I was in bed. Some of my teeth on the right side of my mouth began to crumble, and I went to the sink and spit out blood. There was a wheelbarrow nearby which my mother had brought in from the grounds. It was after dark, but I decided not to bring in the chain that was outside.
