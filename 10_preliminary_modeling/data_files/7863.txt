I was with the cast from friends. We found an old, abandoned boat, kind of like a cabin cruiser, and climbed on board and checked it out. I found all these compartments. It looked like solid wood blocks but sections would swing open and reveal compartments. They were all attached though. I don't know how to better describe that. Joey fixed the engine so it would run again. We started running it down this lake. We met some men that paid us to transport some things up and down the river for them. They stayed on board with us. Monica was the chef. She was baking different types of muffins. I ate one before I realized she didn't want us to. She said something about the vanilla ____ ones. That is the kind I was eating. It was chocolate on the bottom, vanilla on top and then some type of special icing. Some of realized that the men that we brought on board were drug dealers and they had us transporting drugs for them. Monica was the last one we told about this. We were trying to figure out what to do.
