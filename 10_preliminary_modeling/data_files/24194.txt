I was on a Halo map (a video game) against some other island people with alligator people on my team. Most didn't last very long. But Sue, a co-worker I was attracted to, took up a position on a cliff of the map, which consisted of a crashed covenant ship in the middle surrounded by tall cliffs with a long ledge and a valley. After some killing -- after I established by head-shot dominance by killing the people around her and communicating with her through the headset -- we went back to base and lay down. We were tired. Like a game of paintball, we took off our helmets and sat down. Drew (a co-worker on the college newspaper) was there. I proved I could snipe him if I wanted. We got into a fistfight. I punched him a couple times and he needed to go to the bathroom. My co-worker Sue came back. I sat down. Instead of sitting nearby, she lay across my lap. Mixed signals. She changed positions twice, each one more sexual -- straddling me front, then back. My pants were off, as I was cooling down. My underwear wouldn't stay up revealing glimpses. She didn't seem to mind.
