Some of the cast from friends. I was managing a store, maybe a drug store. One of the people I had working for me was royalty. Maybe the son of a king? One time I asked him if he could close up the store. There was also a part where some of the cast from the TV show friends, Chandler, Joey, and Ross, were each with a woman. One was Julia Roberts. One was Courtney Cox. I don't know who the other one was. There was some kind of a horse race involved. The king had switched pants with his son. The three Friends had gotten their pants switched somehow. When the king found out there was a third person involved he got really upset. He came storming into this room where these three couples were having this competition and saw them all so barely clad. He then threw another fit over that. I didn't seem to be involved at all. I was just watching it happen.
