Well, first of all, let me try to explain this. I dreamt that I was staying at this hotel because I was going to a place where I had to be by myself. But it was kind of a weird hotel in that I think the way it worked was you had to exchange your bags at just a certain time, and it was something scary like you had to do a math problem in order to get them back. And I remember being kind of lost, and it was really, really late. It was like after dark, and I was outside, and I was trying to get back to this hotel. And then once I got into the hotel, I didn't know where my room was. It was just kind of all mixed up jumble of mish-mash, I don't remember. But these scenes were totally incongruent. Next thing I knew I was with this girl, and Dad I think, and I had the bird and the bird wasn't just a live bird; he was part live and part mechanical. He had this mechanical thing in him where he would start saying crazy things, and I think there was something about, "new bells, cockle shells," but I don't remember where it came in. I just know that it came in somewhere. I know there was more, and I'm missing half the pieces, but lately I've been really bad about not remembering my dreams that well. Now obviously some of this came from the convention, and yeah, it was a big hotel and yeah, I had to be by myself, but I didn't feel alone at the convention because there were so many other people, period, and people I could feel like were friends, and people that were visually impaired and knowing that they were here for the first time too. And I wanted to learn from them how they were going to function, so I didn't feel alone. But in my dream I felt terribly alone. And the thing about exchanging our bags all over the place, I don't know exactly where that came in, but I do know there was this guy with us that liked "Mash," but I was never scared of losing my bags or scared of something taking them. And I don't know, it was a mish-mash.
