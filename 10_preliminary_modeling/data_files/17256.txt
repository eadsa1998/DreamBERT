I don't remember the first part of my dream, but I went into a room.  My roommate Chelsea had been there and there were still some condoms and such around.  My boyfriend Jeremy came in, and we decided to make use of one and have sex.  I was on top.  We stopped before anything happened, though.  I wondered then if he'd had the condom, and worried slightly.  But I heard him throw the condom away.  Later on Chelsea came back in and saw the condom in the trash and made some rude remark.
