["Beautiful eclipse."] I am in the old Mac house. I step outside to see the sky. It is mid afternoon but it is as dark as night. I see clouds, dark and black, then the night sky with many stars. I step off the porch and turn to see the eclipse. I remember that to look at one with the naked eye could be damaging to my eyesight. I see a round darkened sun with three or four sparkly lights where the moon is beginning to move from the edge revealing the sun. It is beautiful to see. I comment on its beauty to my mother who is standing on the porch. I see leaves and their shadows on the house front wall and for a moment think that is the eclipse.
