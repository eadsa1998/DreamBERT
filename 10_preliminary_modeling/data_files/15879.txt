I was a 'guy'. I was in my house with some other family members and my girlfriend, who was Sara Paxton, was in a bedroom and was sick. I knew she was infected with a zombie virus and would change soon. I was trying to gather up important stuff and leave. I went into my bedroom which was across from the bedroom she was in, and someone else went in there. He came out and I saw a bit of his ear was missing and I realised he'd been bitten and she was a zombie. I went into my room and closed the door, but he changed and they both tried to get in and I couldn't hold the door closed. Then it 'reset'. I tried once again to gather my stuff and leave. I packed up my laptop and went to put it in my car, as Paxton came out of the room as a zombie. I went outside and it was night, and the driver's door was open. I saw a lady grabbing something out of my car and I ran down to her yelling, as she ran off. I was close to catching her and I think she had my wallet.
