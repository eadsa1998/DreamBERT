I live in a future version of my home town. It seems flatter, wider and larger with more open space. My father has just bought a branch of pears for his wife. In the distance I can see a gigantic carnival effigy being constructed of a tubby male character (a bit like a Toby mug). It's enormous, lying on its side, half built. It must be about as high as a twenty story building. There's going to be a great celebration, but I don't know what about.
