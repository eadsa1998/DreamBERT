I see a bad guy crawling through my window. I pick up the phone and as I walk to the door, I dial 0 and ask for the police. I am afraid. He follows me. As I get outside, I yell for help. Uncle Lionel comes over to help me. I realize that the bad guy is Terence and hope Teri doesn't notice so he'll continue to help me.
