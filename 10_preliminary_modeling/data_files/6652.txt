Playing quoits with a woman, throwing into a 2 x 3 square pattern. O.M. comes along and says the pattern is wrong. It should be 3 x 3. O. has worked out another pattern and O.M. takes us to see it. We go up on the deck above and forward. I remark we ought to make many more scores on the longer pattern. O.M. disagrees and I explain why and he says, "Perhaps." We find a beautifully drawn pattern in black paint. I say "Let's play here", and we start back after the rings. I run down feeling very young and happy but come back upstairs more slowly and hand three rings to the other woman. See 4 steamers off starboard and think we must be coming to port. They say it is Kobe; but we don't stop there nor anywhere now. But I insist we must be at Yokohama. There are several passengers about  and I think we must hurry if we have a chance to play. Had remarked as much as we came up the stairs.
