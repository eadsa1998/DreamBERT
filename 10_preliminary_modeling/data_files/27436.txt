I dreamed I was on a bus which was full of musicians. I, myself, was carrying a miniature piano and I was practicing several tunes I had composed myself. While I was playing, I could hear the others laughing and joking; and I was so afraid that I could not meet their standards, that I started to cry. I wondered why they did not need any practice and why I required so much. In the midst of my playing and with tears streaming down my face, I realized that suddenly a hush had come over the room. I kept on playing with an intense vigor and soon, the rest of the musicians had taken up their instruments and were accompanying me. When I finished, they all applauded me and I soon joined the group with a great feeling of satisfaction and happiness.
