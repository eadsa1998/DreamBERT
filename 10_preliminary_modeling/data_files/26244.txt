 I see a man with keys go up to the door at Pike's Landing Restaurant in Oak Valley. He tried to unlock the door, but it is during business hours so the door is open, and by trying to do so he actually locks it. He then tries to open the door and realizes what he's done, so he unlocks the door and goes inside. I'm at the bar of the restaurant with my friend Niles Zelling. I tell him he has to call me when his is coming to the bar so I can came and spend time with him. The man who locked and unlocked the door is there.
