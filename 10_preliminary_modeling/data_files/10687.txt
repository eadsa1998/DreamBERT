I had a run-in with this guy I dated very briefly. I had a bad sexual experience with him a few months ago and was upset that I was seeing him again. But when I saw him, he was cuter. We talked about the relationship and decided to have sex again. The sex was a lot better the second time. He was bigger and lasted longer, knew how to move. I kept wondering why he was so much better. We had great sex. I wanted to see him again. After he left, I thought, "Even if I don't see him again, the sex was great."
