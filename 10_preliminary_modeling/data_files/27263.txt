I was in my high school gym watching a group of people roll dice. They were cartoon people - the kind in movie shorts - technicolor. There is an old man with an orange straw hat and a brown loafer jacket - also a colored boy with white teeth, purplish lips, a green turtle neck sweater, with a wool cap to match (orange tassle. Police, in uniform appear. The men pretend to be pitching horseshoes - but the police understand and catch the Negro. They put the orange horseshoes on him for handcuffs - and I realize that the horseshoes are really devises. We all go outside the gym and they do something to the Negro but I can't see what.
