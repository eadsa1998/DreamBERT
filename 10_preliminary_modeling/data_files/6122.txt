Tonight I dreamt that we were at a pool and all hanging around. I was leaning over to look in because it was dark and my pocketbook was sitting on a branch. I watched the bag fall into the water with every important item I owned in it. The pool was about 30 feet deep and it wasn't clean. I would have my friend dive in and get the bag but he didn't have any scuba gear with him. If he jumped in, he would have to hold his breath for a while and chances were he may not come back up. So we decided for him to go down. He went down finally but couldn't find it. If [illegible] any longer the bag would flow into the ocean. So my friend went to get his gear. He went in and tried again but never came up.
