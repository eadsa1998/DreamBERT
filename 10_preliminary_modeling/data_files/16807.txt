I was in a bar. I saw some people I used to party with sometimes, but I didn't go and talk with them. A pretty woman latched on to me and took me to her table where she was sitting with an ugly spaced-out man. She didn't seem too happy to be with him and I had the impression that they wanted to bring me home with them. There was a scared, freaked-out kitten crawling on the table. I picked up the kitten, petted it, and calmed it down.
