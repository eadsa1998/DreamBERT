I'm in a living room. There's a big storm outside. My three daughters are with me. I've been packing clothes. Dovre and I go into the kitchen to cook something. I heat up something like a tortilla on the stove burner and then show Dovre the beautiful design that got burned into the thing. It's a silhouette of a stately old-fashioned woman. Now there's something about pancakes. Then Paulina is cooking spaghetti stuff that will be dinner, but is also some kind of xmas ornament being made. The red globs of decoration are also a sauce for the spaghetti. We made a sail boat and a cathedral. Paulina puts the spaghetti on a plate. I say, "That's not enough protein." She plops on beans. I say, "We need meat."
