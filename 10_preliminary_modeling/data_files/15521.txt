Tanita was at an AC/DC concert and bought tickets to something where she'd be 'next to a running TV'. She had posted this on Facebook and no-one had commented on it and she was upset. She got them to stop the concert and call someone for her. Gunnar knew her. She had said she had cancer and Gunnar was annoyed at this. I was leaving this place at night, walking through the carpark. I got into my car and locked my doors and wound my window up. I was driving down the road, which was a dirt path, and there was a guy with a gun. I went another way, but there was another one and I had to keep driving around. Gunnar was there and helped me. I was really scared.
