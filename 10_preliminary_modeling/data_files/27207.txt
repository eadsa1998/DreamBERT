I dreamt that I was descending the stairs in an unfamiliar hallway. At the bottom a friend, (male, age 26) was waiting. I had something in my hand which caused me to be very embarrassed. At the foot of the stairs there was a small maple chest of drawers in the top drawer of which I deposited the article that was embarrassing me. (I don't know exactly what it was.) The man turned me around and kissed me. At first I felt rigid and then I felt as if I were melting and floating away on a cloud.
