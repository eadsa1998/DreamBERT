I see a boat on the ocean floor. Then I am getting on a boat just like it. I notice the plastic cover has holes in it. I think, "That's not good. How can I save myself with bad equipment I haven't kept in repair?" Then I'm on a boat. Nate (sort of Rock Hudson) swoons in my arms. He is very large and heavy and stiff. I try to drag him over to a sofa. I lie on him, hugging him. Milk is pouring down the hole to where the crew is below deck. One crewman looks out and sees they are near the dock.
