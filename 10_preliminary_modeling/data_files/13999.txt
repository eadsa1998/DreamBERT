I'm not sure where I was but I was in a room somewhere. Eugene was sitting on a chair. Something happened and I realized it was a dream. I saw Eugene in the corner and forgot what I wanted to do. I put my hand on his shoulder and said "Hey Eugene, what's up?" and he just looked me and then looked away. I ran my hand down his back and then through his hair, which felt rough and like dog fur, saying that I'd always wanted to do that. I told him it was a dream and to do a reality check. I did and breathed and my nose squeaked and then everything went white and I had a false awakening. I was at the end of Brookland Ave, at the lights. Jeremiah and Selena were there. I was going to wag, but there were lollipop ladies everywhere. I also thought I saw Ms Corbett. Darius and Jeremiah were walking and they said they were going to pick up Eugene and then go to school. I went with them and we walked slowly, but we got to school and Eugene was already there. I saw Alejandro around too. They were all wearing their leavers' jackets. The library had no books in there and had lots of lounges in there. I was telling Autumn that Nana had the same lounges (the recliners). Elijah was joking about it and said "a library with no books". We had an excursion and Elijah didn't want to go so he planted this stuff around to excite the teacher into searching for more stuff (like a treasure hunt), so she wouldn't go. Julianna was around and I was telling her how to do something.
