This started out very pleasant but turned ugly. I went to visit Ben D at his home but it was in RI. Matthew went along. Matthew's behavior was very atypical and embarrassing. Ben D was put-off, for lack of a better word, at his behavior. Matthew kept trying to rush me to go home because he wanted to see Ashley B and go out with his friends. At times some of Ben D's students were present, as was his mother. Our behavior was in check whenever these people were present. Whenever we were alone he was very loving and attentive, expressing his desire to make love with me. Ben D had my weekly dream group publicized in a campus newsletter. One week I had a dozen or more of his students arrive unannounced for the group. Part way into the group I noticed that Dan M, Lou S, and Mark M had left. Samuel K was also present as a special guest speaker. I was telling the group about the recent SAID conference in Boston and Samuel K's costume as a Safari Hunter, with a stuffed, pink, elephant pinned to the back of his shirt. As I was conducting the group I realized it is July and my Christmas tree is still up. I looked at Matthew and said, I just realized it is July and our Christmas tree is still up. I was debating whether or not to even take it down at this point or to just leave it until Christmas this year. Many of the students said they hoped to be back the next week. I asked if anyone had see Lou S, Dan M, and Mark leave and someone said they had. She said they hadn't made eye contact however. After group ended I was in a car with three other people who had been in attendance. One of them was Carlton W. We were discussing why Lou S, Dan M, and Mark might have gotten up and left. I followed up with one of them and they said they left because they weren't sure they were comfortable with so many new people joining us.
