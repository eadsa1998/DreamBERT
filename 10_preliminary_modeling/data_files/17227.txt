I dreamt a sort of graduation ceremony from the university, and taking pictures on bleachers with my friend Jenna and a bunch of others.  My mother and I were typing on the same computer and keyboard; I was writing "movie" and she 'stole' my letters so hers came out "Mommoo", (a nickname I sometimes call her).  I told her how afraid we as students were when we first came to the university after hearing of acceptance and we were supposed to get food from the dining hall.  We were all nervous.
