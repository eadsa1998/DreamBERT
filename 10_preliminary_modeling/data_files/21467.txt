I was working at Dills. I operated 7 machines. They were in a row, but seemed to be far apart. By the time I loaded one line and checked them, about 4 were running empty. I didn't like it. I kept working till a truck driver from White's called out, "John Evans you can take your lunch whenever you want now." So I took my lunch. A bad man was after me always teasing me and insulting. I was not afraid of him, but I just let him go on. One day he was coming and my fellow workers told me of him. I didn't get out of his way. He was surprised, but came at me. I stood my ground and I put my power mastery of mine at him. I stopped his horse, which he tried to run me over with. I did it with my mastery of commanding my power to stop him. Then I commanded him to back up and he came to the edge of the cut of the coke yard. I then made him back over the edge with his bad master, which he did and it was the end of him. I later made myself nude and there were nude men and women coming with me up a stairway. I saw a young female coming up. I gabbed her and hugged her and the first thing I knew, I had intimated her and she was pregnant. I asked her where she stayed, and she said she lived in a chicken coop. I said, "You will live in my quarters from now on. I saw Benny, the 2nd shift foreman, coming down the track with a rifle on his shoulder. He was guarding me when I was out in the wilds and I didn't know he was with me. I was varnishing a large building instead of painting the outside. I was on top of the building. I looked down on the side I had to varnish, and it was high. I wondered if I would be afraid to varnish at such a height.
