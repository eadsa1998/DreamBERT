I checked my bank account and I had all these dodgy transactions from the Philippines. The first one was that Paypal transaction I did that got emailed to me [happened in real life, and I wasn't sure if it was dodgy]. My password had been changed on a lot of sites and I had to change them all. I had to cancel the card but since it was less than 2 weeks until I was going to the Philippines I was worried I wouldn't get a new card in time and it cost $90 to get an express card.
