["The Rabbit Man."] I am in a bank. I want to deposit some money. I pull out the papers from my bag and see that it is very complex. I have to finish a needlepoint canvas they gave me before I can do the deposit. I am rushed for time and decide to wait for another day. We leave the bank, perhaps my daughters and me. They get ahead of me and I notice a man in a rabbit white face doing some street theatre. I slow down to watch. He comes up to me and kisses me. I then walk down the sidewalk and we talk. He thinks I am just a pretty girl but as I talk, he learns I am an actress, a writer, a videographer and so on. Now I turn down another street because I saw the green back of my van turn that way. I say goodbye to him. I walk a half a block and then see I was mistaken. It was some other vehicle and I return back where I was. I meet up with the Rabbit/man again. Now we are in his house in a warm room with beautiful woods used in the walls. We are taking a warm bath as there is water on the floor. We continue talking. He has a partner that joins us in conversation. I am building a big case for them using me as a professional performer and writer in their production.
