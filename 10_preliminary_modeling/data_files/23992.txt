I had a dream about my family that one time I was in my house all alone with my brother. The house started shaking and it happened that it was an earthquake. Later on the shaking stopped and then I looked out the window and on my front yard there was boxes opened with dead bodies in them. Me and my brother were yelling for help. Nobody heard us. It was dark. My brother opened the front door and the dead bodies were getting up, first thing we knew. All the people were dead. Me and my brother were the only survivors in the world. Everybody started chasing us. First thing I knew I lost my brother in the way we were running. He fell in a big hole. I yelled and I turned back and thousands of dead bodies were chasing me. Then I woke up.
