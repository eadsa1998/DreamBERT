This dream is to a certain extent a nightmare, especially considering that the characters are related to my family. In another report I had a dream that had the same people in it. It's about my being in a town to the south of Lima, called San Vicente de Canete. I was in the main square of that place when I suddenly saw my mother and that we were trying to meet my father, and suddenly my grandmother and my aunt appeared. We looked for a way to try to not meet each other face to face. But in order to do this, we went through all sorts of obstacles and adventures, until the dream ended.
