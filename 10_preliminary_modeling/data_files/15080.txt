I could take people into my dreams. Mom, Ezra, Darren and I were there. I chose a past dream that had been vivid and long. There was something in the water and I tried to save them and it was slippery because of soap. There were a bunch of Asians at a log and they gave us some to take. We did some other stuff and there was a bit from "my favourite episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?," I got in the car to leave and then said "I forgot my water bottle and my shoes, can I have the keys?" Mom was like 'whatever' but wouldn't give me the keys. Eventually she gave them to me. Then I was at home which was a new house. I locked up and left. It was dark. I went to the end of the driveway and people were driving over the sidewalk because the road was busy. Two guys went down to the house and there was a thing outside with money. He tried to take it and was like "we live here" and ignored us. One had a baseball bat, so I took it and hit him with it. Ezra got one too and we both kept hitting them, though our swings were slow. We got medals for stuff. We got a bronze (or third place) for 'raping' [as in, beating people up] 10 times; but it was actually getting 'raped' 10 times. I was like 'awww'. Then I was somewhere with Nana and she asked "How much weight have you gained?" and I said "I've lost .7kg" and she congratulated me.
