I was at school. There was a creepy fight game. Ramona visited the school and she kept looking at me weirdly and I kept saying all these The Young Ones quotes. Tiana was at school also. I met Nigel Planer and I found Neil's Book of the Dead in his bookshelf and he let me have it. It had strange photos of Neil and coconuts. When I told Dad he said "Of course he gave it to you" and I was listening to his album.
