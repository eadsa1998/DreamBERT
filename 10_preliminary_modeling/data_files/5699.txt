I am sitting in Sandra's kitchen. I know its a kitchen because it is very similar to my kitchen. The layout is exactly the same. I am eating some delicious sandwiches made out of crusty rye bread and ham and cheese. Big, thick sandwiches. In reality I have no idea who this Sandra is but in my dreams I appear to know her. She is a German woman with a high voice and a very pleasant accent, she's very friendly. I am enjoying these delicious sandwiches so much that I don't want to leave, but I have to catch a train. I know I have to catch a train, I keep telling Sandra that I have to catch a train but she keeps offering me more sandwiches and I keep staying to eat them even though I have to catch this train to where ever it is, I don't know where. It's not made clear in the dream. I remember the taste of the delicious ham and cheese and the rye bread, hearing Sandra's laughter and high pitched chatter, being aware of being in her kitchen, sitting at her table, touching the table with my fingertips, tapping my feet on the floor and this impending urgency to catch this train, although it wasn't so urgent, I really didn't want to leave because I was enjoying her company and the sandwiches so much.
