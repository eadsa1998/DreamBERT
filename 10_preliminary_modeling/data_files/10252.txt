WALLY has returned from a long trip; He has many paintings at an exhibit; he uses many abstract symbols; in one painting in green and silver we are not sure which way is "up." So many people come to see his exhibit, we should really find a bigger space, but we stay where we are. (I wake up feeling very proud that he is being recognized.)
