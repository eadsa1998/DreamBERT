This dream took place in P--, C--. My mother and I were in the public library together. I left her for a few moments and met an older man (who is about 40 years old, was the chaperon on a couple of geology trips I was on and who apparently took a great interest in me). He asked me to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks with him. We started walking toward the city hall and all at once the street and sidewalks were crowded with 'madly' rushing people shouting and screaming. We stopped and heard the sound of explosions, each one getting louder than the one before. Some one cried that the world was coming to an end. We started running back to the library and then stopped again as we saw a car sliding sidewards, going at a rapid speed, which hit another car. Here I seemed to realize that the people in cars were driving as fast as they could in order to escape the explosions and death. People were thrown out of one of the cars. Two people seemed to have been killed. Dream ended.
