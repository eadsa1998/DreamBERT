I'm involved in the preparations of a big art fair - probably a festival in my home town. However it seems to be outdoors in a field and it reminds me of allotments or an outdoor music festival. There are hundreds of stalls. My mother is buzzing about with her art friends. Next I'm involved in the preparations for some kind of event in the grounds of a mansion. It involves a game whereby huge cards are laid out on the floor in front of an audience which are to be turned over (it's a bit like matching pairs). There's also marquees with bands performing and a beer tent. I walk past some great sounds coming from one of the band tents. Not many people are in the tent yet - perhaps it's just the sound check. There's a scene where I'm chasing a woman and her child (it may be my partner and my eldest daughter) who are trying to get to an event and leave me behind. They are driving a motorbike and sidecar at top speed through the streets and I'm running to keep up with them. I have bionic legs and seem to be able to do it.
