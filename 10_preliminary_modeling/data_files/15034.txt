I was at a post office to hand in my passport application. A lady served me. It was in a cinema and Clash of the Titans was playing on the screen. She was like 'we can do this now and then watch the movie or we can go behind the counter'. I went with the latter option. I was like 'I hope I can get it this time'. One of the questions was about the average life expectancy of students at Westland University. I was telling Mom about this lady on the Internet who was a dobber - she would get people who failed to reference properly. I said that David Duchovny had played a joke on her. She was a taxi driver and he had her come out to this spooky forest. Then he did it again another time. There was a virus which turned off all computers. A fire started from the carpet at home. I ran to my room and it was everywhere. There was also some quest and I got sent a letter to eat a muffin to give me extra strength etc.
