Mom and I were riding the tandem down to the beach and we were taking this ice cream thing with us. And we got to the beach, we swam a little, and all of a sudden I was in the car and listening to the radio without the engine on. You know how you put the accessories on? Well, I was getting ready to shut off the ignition because it had been on for almost an hour, and I was feeling through all kinds of wires. There were so many wires, it was like spaghetti. And then all of a sudden I realized I was feeling behind the back seat instead of where the ignition switch is. So I climbed over the back seat and went in to where the ignition switch was. There were as many wires as they were like spaghetti. I was feeling through all the wires, I think I knocked a couple of them out of place, and I could not find the ignition switch.
