Trying to find someone in the woods with an infrared scope through the trees in a game like paintball. I had a partner and felt like I could win. I got one bad guy, and found another, but couldn't ID him because the campfire he started in front of him was obscuring my equipment. I couldn't recognize his heat signature.
