Calvin, Dad, Ezra and I (first it was Ezra, Mom and I but it kept changing) went to this restaurant. We went to this back room which had a TV. Calvin, some 'cool' dude, some other people and I were in there. Calvin had bought chocolates before so we were splitting them and he was going to give two to Ezra. The 'cool' guy was drawing on the TV. Calvin left and took a skateboard. There were two chocolates left and I turned around to go somewhere, but when I looked back the 'cool' guy was unwrapping the thing the chocolates were in so I took them off him. Calvin was in a line with a girl who said she was German.
