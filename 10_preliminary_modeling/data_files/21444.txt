We seemed to be living in the dark ancient ages. It seemed to be dark always. I saw a boat going down a narrow river. The boat was long and narrow and the occupants were dressed in white ancient armor suits. I was in school and went to the men's room where all the men were. I had a hard-on and missed the bowl. One friend said, "You work so and hold back, that's why you are that way." I disagreed with him. I saw one bridge built on a narrow street and another overhead covered bridge was being built. The women civic leaders were brought in front of me and introduced to me. I had a wire attached to some do-hickey and when I touched the two contact wires, there were sparks or contact of electricity.
