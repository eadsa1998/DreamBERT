First of all, there was this thing that you could record video and audio while you're sleeping, and it looked just like my mini disc recorder. And I asked Mom to show it to me and how it worked because I was curious. And, like I said, the main unit looks just like my mini disc recorder, and there's this magnet that connects to it, and you have to put the magnet on the front of your good foot. And you have to like put this little candle thing on your shoulder. And then you have to take this microphone thing and wrap it around in a coil sixteen times, and let it sit on the bed next to you. And I said, "Well, isn't this going to be obvious to whoever you're sleeping with?" And she was like, "Well, the whole purpose of it is to catch somebody who's not sleeping with you, like ____ and his girl coming walking into the bedroom, you could record them. And how about strange! And I dreamt that I was all mixed up on the calendar, like yesterday was the day before Christmas Eve, and really in my dream I thought it was the day before Christmas Eve, but it was really like a week before. And that's all.
