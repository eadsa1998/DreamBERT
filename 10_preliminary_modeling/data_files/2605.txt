I am walking up a gravel road. I turn and look. The view is breathtaking, huge and beautiful. I am surrounded by mountains, rugged and covered with trees. A strong-colored sunset colors the entire scene of thick clouds and mountains in shades of purples, pinks and so on. The clouds cover the mountain peak. I think about going back to the hotel and getting my camera, but I know that I won't get a good picture; more the pity, because 1) the clouds obscure the peak, and 2) it would take too long and the beauty would be gone by the time I got back. So I stand there, looking intently all around. A huge, noisy jet plane is flying to the right. I can't see it because it's above the clouds, or rather in the clouds. It disturbs the beauty. I see a Bic lighter on the ground: litter.
