[1997-05-30] An interesting dream where I was back in high school and we were pushing around kids on scooters. My whole class was there and we were pushing each other around on scooters in the gym. We kept smashing into the wall and into this big door, I'm not sure why and then the gym transformed itself into my parents' house and the house was divided into two parts. The first part was mine, and it was my parents' house so that was a little unusual, then there was another part connected by the stairs, the downstairs, you had to go down through the basement and up some other stairs to get to the other part of the house, it wasn't connected? Don't ask, I don't know.
