This dream was very confused. It seems I was trying to trick some men (or boy) into admitting whether or not he was a communist. After trying to catch him on several questions, I finally fooled him and he confessed he was a member of the communist party. Here I was a little frightened. Who the man or boy was, what was the setting, or what was the person to me, I do not know.
