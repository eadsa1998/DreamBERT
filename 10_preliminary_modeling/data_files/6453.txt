First of all, I'm in a bookstore, and I see that Tim Eagan has brought out a new collection of Subconscious Stuff. Or so it seems. I look again and see that it's actually a four-volume set -- two diaries, a sketchbook, and a little book of his philosophy. Since I like his comics I buy these books. We're going to a brunch with my family. I need to use the bathroom, so I tell my parents this, and I use their bathroom to take a crap. I read the first entry -- it's a very serious entry all about a 'new direction' in his life. However, he ends the entry with: "Oh well. I'm not as excited as when I first brought these notebooks into the can." The books are hardbound, but they're printed on newsprint. At the beginning is a "picture of Tim Eagan". He looks like an evangelist. A fat laughing guy in a tacky dark-colored suit is next to him in the photo. In the sketchbook, in the very beginning, there is a strange drawing entitled 'me'. This, I supposed, was his cartoon self-portrait. While I'm cleaning up, I hear my mother complaining to my father: "I wish you'd throw them away. I just don't like it when Nick has access to all these pictures of naked women! You never did outgrow dirty pictures..." Sarcastically I mutter something about mothers and I leave the bathroom. I ask if everyone's ready. "David," he says. "the brunch isn't until 1:30 or so." "Wow," says I. "that's a long time." I go into the living room. My dad follows. On the machine are several angry phone calls from Sonja. She calls again and I hear my dad's side of the conversation. She's coming soon, I gather. Eventually she arrives. She looks haggard and disheveled. "I haven't slept for 25 hours," she says. <br/
