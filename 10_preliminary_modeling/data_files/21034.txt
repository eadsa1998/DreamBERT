Margie got married to Frankie. They left on a honeymoon. Grandma, Grandpa, Mary, Ann and Audrey and Barbara were dressed to meet her. One of the boys were backing my car up to park it and he bumped into a dog house. A big dog jumped on the side of my car and I was afraid he was going to bite me. I was going to pack my car and it turned out to be a chair in my hand, so I took it along with myself. I was in a colored neighborhood. Audrey and Barbara were examined by the colored doctor. He was nude when he was examining.
