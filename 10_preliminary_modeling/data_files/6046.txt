I was shopping in Osco Drug with my brother. I picked up what I wanted. (I don't remember what it was.) I was then looking at typing paper trying to figure out what bond I should have used for resume in English last year. I remember seeing Mead's recycled typing paper, but I figured that would probably be a gray color. I then walked down the make-up aisle. I was looking for a deep facial cleanser. I couldn't find one. Then I saw a make-up case. It was big, and it was covered with a pretty carpet. I remember thinking it was like the bag Mary Poppins carries in the movie. Then I saw Rob from school (Suffolk). I thought this was strange, because he lived far away from me. He was standing at a counter writing something. A classmate from my high school walked up to him. She started saying to him, "So, did you hear the news about Type A personalities? (I had this feeling they were studying to be doctors.) I awoke from this dream to realize my radio was on, and they were talking about how Type A personality people have a Vitamin E deficiency or something.
