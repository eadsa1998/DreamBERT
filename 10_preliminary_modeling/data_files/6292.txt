[This dream took some time before I filled the questionnaire of the psychology survey.] I dreamt of this kind of a building which I have difficulty describing: [drawing]. The house has a tall musclelike structure above the rest of the house. The dream began with an eerie feeling that I was at Harvard University. Somewhere near the top of the muscle structure there was a nest for a white bird. The view of the house in my dream moved from top (bird nest) to the bottom of the house. The whole house was in view. The transition from top to bottom was accompanied by a U2 music. I don't listen to U2 music but I did once see a video of U2 of one of their songs. There were some people in my dreams on the ground who were supposedly making a movie. I think the director was U2 lead singer himself. He was at the same time the music player. I don't know from where. That was it. Strange, isn't it?
