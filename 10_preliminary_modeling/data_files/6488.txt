I was a delivery driver in Green City. Here there were a special kind of spiders which would help you find your way: they laid their eggs around a light and made it glow. Then I was in a fancy Indian Southwestern hotel which was like a movie theater. There were a lot of porn stars, and an orgy. A lot of dead rich people. They left me and Laura stuff.
