Lots of images: driving, brothers, race. Dancing, but as I got closer to the drummer/musicians, I noticed he was off beat. I had to concentrate to keep up. Exercise. Throwing semi-deflated balls around. Nobody cooperating. Several out of shape flabby men had heart attacks and were laying around feeling shaky and miserable. I thought to myself, "I know what they feel like."
