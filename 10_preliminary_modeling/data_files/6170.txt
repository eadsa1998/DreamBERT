I had a dream that I was getting on to an elevator. As soon as I started to walk in and turn around the shape of it changed. It was like a garage door started to come down. I tried to get out but it closed. There were other people on the elevator and then the elevator started to go out, faster and faster. Then (we?) realized that it was passing all the floors and we were going to go out of the building. I was really scared and I went into the corner by myself. Then the elevator flew out of the building and then I woke up.
