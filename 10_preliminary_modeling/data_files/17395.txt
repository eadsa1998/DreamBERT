I was in a place like the old dorm on at the observatory.  In room 362, cowering.  My boyfriend Jeremy was coming after me as if to attack me.  I managed to slip out and into 364, and screamed when he followed me, instead of going into 362 like I expected.  I think I jumped out the window to get away from him.  Yet later, he was driving me somewhere.
