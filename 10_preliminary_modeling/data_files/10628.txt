I lost my shoes. I came out from this underpass and saw a party going on in a gray two-story house. There were all these crusty punk rockers drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon and Budweiser and the music was blaring onto the street. The balcony looked like it was going to fall because it was so packed. Some dude leaned over the balcony and puked onto the street.
