The doorbell rang (!) and I looked outside on the steps. There was a package there. "Ooo!" I think. "My Stephen Hawking book!" I pick the package up and bring it inside to the kitchen. I remember some aria from Il Trovatore was playing. Laura's working next to me in the kitchen. I open the package: inside are four stacks of County Transit bus schedules. Along with three maps: one of a nearby city, one of San Francisco, and a geological/topographical map of the world. "Odd," I said. "I only sent away for one schedule."
