We had a test in science except it wasn't. The teacher was going through my book and I was supposed to be giving a talk and everyone was annoyed. She realized that I was doing well and gave me a level 7 instead of a level 2. I got tomato sauce on my new shirt. I sat next to Calvin with the seating plan given for the test.
