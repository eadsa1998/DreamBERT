I was with some school friends and we went to classes that were very weird. There was a religious class, a musical singing class and two others I can't remember. We were in the religious class even though one of my friends is Jewish and another is Catholic, and we were being rowdy and the nun sent us out of the class and we ran amok. Setting: At the lower school, but it was mixed in with the middle school. Characters: All of my schoolmates in the 7th grade. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, awkward. I thought that we would get in trouble but we didn't so we ran wild.
