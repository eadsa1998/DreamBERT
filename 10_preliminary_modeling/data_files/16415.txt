First thing that I can remember is that I was walking down the street with Astrid, kind of early in the morning, and down at the end of 24th Avenue there's 4th Street, and down there at 4th Street there's a bus compound. I mean, there's not really, but there was in my dream. And I could see the buses leaving from the bus compound, and there was a school bus that was coming to the house for me, and so I had to, Astrid and I just ran back to the house to try and beat them, but we didn't make it.
