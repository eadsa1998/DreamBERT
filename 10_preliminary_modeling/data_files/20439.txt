Two beds were arranged at right angles. I was in one of them, and a patient about 17 was in the other one. The head of his bed was at the foot of mine. He was friendly with me at first. Then he left me and he went to the bed of a patient on the ward whom I know in real life. (He is mundane and cynically masculine, lacking any artistic sense.) When the young patient left me, I felt rejected.
