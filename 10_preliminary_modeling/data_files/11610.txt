I dreamt that one of my friends and I were walking down a strange street at night. We walked for a while and then went into a bar. We had a few beers and then started to flirt with two blonds. Then I was playing softball in an empty lot near my home. I batted a long drive into left field and was dismayed when the fielder caught the ball.
