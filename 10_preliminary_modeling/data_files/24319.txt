Attending a graduation ceremony. It's an extra one, like the one my university alma mater asked me to attend and sit on stage, but that I couldn't make. I was in the city where the newspaper I now work for is located and had to fly down and take that Thursday off. Supposedly someone told me I wouldn't miss work, but really, I would. And since I didn't book a return ticket, I was worried that I'd need to get back on to airline web site and book a flight and because it was the day before I needed to be back, it would be expensive. I felt bad for my parents. They didn't have the money to pay for a flight, but they gave it to me anyway because they wanted me to come down for graduation. So I did. The graduates all rode to the site together in this open-top double-decker bus. We were supposed to jump up and cheer when we passed the parents. Did it again when we passed the faculty. Along the side of the road there were people getting drunk who had just graduated. They graduated us in cohorts. They cheered us along as we went along the road, which was lined with trees. We arrived and got out. It was like a parking area in a certain restaurant. My bike was there. I'd left it, apparently. It didn't have the tire on the rim. I rode it and stopped behind a white station wagon. I thought it was my parents. No, they didn't ride in that anymore. I looked and found the green van. I left my bike there and asked them to bring it home.
