Last night I dreamed that I was getting all my things ready for a trip to Huancayo, and everything was in a mess around here. The surroundings of the dream were in my bedroom. I was packing my suitcase, my mother was giving me errands to run there. I was with some people around me, but I don't remember their faces. I know they were women of about 30 or 40 years. My dream was a happy one, but just as in the previous ones, everything happens in the dark, and now the people were wearing dark colors.
