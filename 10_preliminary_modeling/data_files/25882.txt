 It is morning before I go to work at Fishing Haven. I'm in bed. Outside our cabin is a deck-like wooden walkway. There are other cabins in view of the deck. I see someone who looks exactly alike me walking by my apartment on the deck carrying a crate of leeches. He is smiling. He is I! I watch myself. I am very curious, surprised, and confused. My roommate Sean leaves for work. I hear a vehicle come back towards our cabin. I think he must have forgotten something, but I see it is a golf cart. I see my boss Phoebe Mills walking and smiling, and I see my boss Mike Hollow at a desk. I ask myself, "Am I dreaming?" I slide off my bed and try to fly, but I can't fly. I've got an erection, probably from REM. I want to masturbate and put something in my butt. I break apart a section of a wooden chair and go to the bathroom, which is the bathroom at home in Oak Valley. I have a pimple on the lower left side of my chin, which I see in the mirror.
