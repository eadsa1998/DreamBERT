Very early in morning (still dark) in Washington, D.C. Faye comes home, and goes out on to screened porch which is provided with shades (like window shades). Faye turns on a powerful lamp at north end of porch. Wishing to know whether Faye is on porch, I go out front door, leaving it wide open so it will be unlikely to blow shut and lock me out, this because I suspect Faye may not have a key. The light from porch shines out on lawn, but Faye isn't on the porch. About this time it gets considerably lighter and I plainly see a man with light trousers, white shirt, bare-headed, walk toward me -- in fact, we lightly collide. His face is somewhat familiar, and I am rather attracted to him, though I do not know who he is. He asks for the loan of a screwdriver, and explains that a woman gave Carter a lot of books and that he is going down to Salvation Army headquarters to get them. The front door of Carter's house is open, and a bright light is burning in one of the rooms which, through the open doorway, is seen to have bright green wall-paper.
