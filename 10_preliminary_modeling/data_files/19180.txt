I dreamed we were eating breakfast in a cafeteria. We had breakfast and then we went outside. I was standing outside with this girl Phyllis. We were just standing out there waiting for, I'm not sure what we were waiting for. Across the way we were standing next to this brick wall and not too far away was this girl standing there by herself. She was holding some school books or something. She was waiting for a school bus. We went out there, and I nodded to her like in good morning. Then we were ready to leave, so I said goodbye to this chick that was standing there a little ways away from us. She didn't respond, so I walked over to where she was and I said goodbye. She didn't say anything, but that's all I wanted to say, so I left. I don't know where we were going. Day residue: Phyllis is a girl in my lab group.
