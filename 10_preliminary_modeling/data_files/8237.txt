Jan F was at my house. We were talking about cooking. She and Jo V love to cook and I don't. She was talking about taking various frozen meals that come in a bag and mixing them together and fixing them at one time and then having meals that can be heated quickly and having a number of them. I said I didn't think I would want to do that because I would get tired of eating the same thing over and over. I said that I do occasionally fix one of those for myself and have leftovers for a day or two after. She suggested mixing a half of each one for a different variety. I said that might not be a bad idea because then you would get three varieties instead of two or instead of just one. I was cleaning up the kitchen while we were talking. I put an empty can inside of what I thought was an empty pineapple can. But when I did I realized that there was still a layer of pineapple in the can. I pulled the other can back out and said something to Jan F. I asked her if she did that on my behalf and she laughed and said yes. I don't know why. I took the pineapple out of the can and then I was asking here when school was going to be out for the summer and if she would be spending a lot of time in Chicago during summer break. She said that she would be spending a lot of time in Chicago.
