I was outside at this place, which looked a little bit like a hedge maze. I was walking along a path and I saw Eugene and Darius coming down the other way. I was looking at Eugene. I was then in a house. Each house (or room) could only have a certain amount of people in it. It was raining. We had to go inside if it was raining or if it was hot (or we would die). The rain was dangerous for some reason. We had to lock each door to make sure no-one else snuck in. I had trouble locking a door. Then it was hot. Someone was trying to come in because someone inside owed them money. Then Dad and Ezra were outside and knocked on the front door and they said "It's ok now". We lived in a desert, because everywhere was now a desert.
