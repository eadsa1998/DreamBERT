Bill C had requested that I come into the office to take some team photographs. They needed some to represent who the team was when I was still there. It was important to him that I be in it. I was very uncomfortable with the request but I agreed to go anyway. I arrived at the office. I didn't see Bryan N. Bill C said just a few words to me. Jennifer C didn't say anything. I went into my old office. I had brought some things to read and work on in case I had to wait, which I did. Bill C came in and talked a little bit more. He said they had some art supplies they were going to get rid of and if I wanted any of them I could take them with me. Jennifer C came in. She didn't say much at all but took me to the back to show me what they were getting rid of. She pulled out something that looked like regular pens to me. I told her I wasn't interested in them. Then she pulled out something that looked like regular highlighters. Again, I said I wasn't interested. At this point, I'm wondering why Bill C called these art supplies and why they were getting rid of them. They could at least use the regular pens. Then she pulled out something that looked like a special kind of pen and one that I really liked and knew I would use. Just as I finished saying I would take those, Bryan N walked up and asks what was going on. Jennifer C told him. He said he liked those. I just said, Fine. Let him have them. I turned and walked away.
