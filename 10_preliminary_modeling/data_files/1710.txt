Someone is making 200 copies of a story or newsletter. They are in a hurry because they are moving. They put the copies at the end of our sidewalk in a cubby hole. I walk the long sidewalk because I see the mailman coming. A woman in a white jacket walks by and asks if we need any house numbers. I see we already have our numbers, "995." She goes on asking each person if they need numbers. The mailman goes by and doesn't leave any mail. I ask him if we get any. He says no.
