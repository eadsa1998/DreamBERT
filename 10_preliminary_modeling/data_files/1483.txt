Someone asks me if we have a hay compressor. At first I say no and then I remember we do have one. I ask some questions about what she means. Then I say we have one. She can ask my father or grandpa Clyde if she can use it. She is shy and doesn't want to ask them. I shrug my shoulders thinking, "Too bad, she's going to miss out."
