I had a deep cut in my neck. I found a doctor and he gave me a mask to wear. I was too embarrassed to wear it on the street. I'd walked home, and in the house, I'd put the mask on, I decided. Then I met a lady about 35. She was dignified in manner. We said a few words and then I walked toward home. Later I tried to start the engine of a train. I put on a hot valve, then just in time I turned on the cold one. But the engine stopped. The foreman gave me a different engine.
