I was receiving my test score for math. I just remembered the instant I was looking at my test. Then I asked a person next to me how he did. The setting was completely the same as my math class. The person who sat next to me was my friend. It's a pleasant dream because I dreamed that I got full points on the test. It was a really short dream, but I kept thinking about it since then.
