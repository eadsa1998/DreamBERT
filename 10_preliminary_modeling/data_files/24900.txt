I was a dog and I was running around in someone's backyard for a while. Then this guy came out (I was with my two other dog friends) and started chasing us. My two friends ran out the door in the fence, but he closed it and I snuck out under the fence. Then the whole dream started over again and I didn't get out, but my friends did and I got mad. I had to go scrub walls as a punishment. Setting: In a backyard I've never seen before. Characters: The two other dogs were my friends, except I got mad at them when they got away and I didn't. I know the two friends represented my friends Julia and Erin. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried. I got mad at my friends when they got out and I didn't.
