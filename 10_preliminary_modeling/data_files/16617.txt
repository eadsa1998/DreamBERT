We were going up to see Sandra and Uncle Larry and Levi. I don't remember if we flew or drove, but they were in another state, I think. And at the time they were living in an apartment and ________________ the other kids. And we were going to stay with them, but they just seemed like they weren't ready to have us stay with them. They wanted to have us stay in a hotel. And so we got a hotel room and we kind of set ourselves up. But then for some reason the family just kind of got busy and wasn't really ready to have us do anything, and we were supposed to go to the beach, we're supposed to do different things and they just sort of didn't seem ready, didn't seem to want to do any of that. So Mom and Dad would leave me in the hotel room and go over to their house or to their apartment and help them with a few things around there. I don't exactly what, some things that they needed. And I was there by myself, and I was a little disappointed about not seeing Sandra and the kids, and I was disappointed about not being able to relax and have fun with them. But I was kind of relieved of, you know, Mom and Dad actually ended up sleeping over at their apartment. ____ that's kind of neat that I could sleep by myself, and in this dream I was, you know, going down to the restaurant part of the hotel, and they had a piano. And I sat down and I started playing. And there were a bunch of people there that seemed to sort of like it. And different things were happening, different people coming over and talking to me. And I intended to play some more, but I didn't get to because so many people were talking to me. And then I woke up.
