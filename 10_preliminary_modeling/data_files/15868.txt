I went to this shop and it was weird and like a circle but only had one entrance. There were drunk people everywhere and I had to talk through this group and a guy told me to 'lick and wipe my chin' and I instinctively wiped it, but then they said it was because a guy was turned on by that. I just kept walking. It was kind of dusk outside, and I went to my car and got in and locked the door. I felt uneasy. I left but I was followed by two other cars, with people whooping and driving crazy. I had to drive crazy to get away and then it was like a game and I was smashing into things and doing spins and so forth. I can't remember what else happened.
