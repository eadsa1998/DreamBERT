I had just returned from a vacation or somewhere to my classes at Cleveland Heights High. I was taking over my first gym class as a student leader or gym cadet as they are called. I did not know any of the other cadets because I had been gone so long. They were all strangers and regarded me with great curiosity because I was so much older than they. I did not know the gym teacher either and they seemed unwilling to allow me to conduct a class. When they finally consented, I had great difficulty in leading the girls because they did not respect my authority. I left the class as soon as I could and went to the dressing room feeling very depressed.
