I am in the north woods. I seen ten men working on an old log house--preparing it for national preservation--like a museum so people see how it was done earlier in history. They are taking off a layer on every surface. The logs are square so the surface can be cleaned as an old floor is sanded. It was a house of the "Longworth" family--the father and sons built it as a wedding present for their daughter. The house is purple with other colors like gold and silver sheen on its surface--like sap dyes in fresh oak wood. The windows are like Eisenglass colored more gold than purple--so much that I could not see furniture in the front room through it.
