I was watching the first episode of Big Brother UK. Some of the contestants went into a backyard and were kidnapped. They were let out when they stood up to the kidnappers. Lea Michele was one of them and introduced herself as Rachel Berry and shook the kidnapper's hands. Then Mom and I were at a newsagency. They used calculators. A song called 1756 was playing. The guy accidentally gave us a $100 note which had been meant for the people behind us. It was yellow. We left without realizing though. We were walking away and we realized they were following us. We went through the Northtown McDonald's carpark (different) and down the road and this path up ahead was forest-like. We walked through the park and there were these big black plastic forks and I grabbed one. We ended up also walking through a school. We got to an office and David Bowie was behind the desk and he had calculator like mine. Ezra tasted it and it was actually cream. We gave the money back to the Natives (the people following us) and it was now just a guy and a boy.
