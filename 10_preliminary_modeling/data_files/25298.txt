 Aliens are coming to earth. I'm in the army of the united rebel forces. We are waiting, and need sleeping bags. I go to get them. I slide on the floor. It is an exciting time, of anticipation. I go through Carter School. The closets are like those at Brimson College. A leader with a gun kills some aliens.
