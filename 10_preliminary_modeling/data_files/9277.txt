I am living in a cabin with three female friends out in the country. A war breaks out around us and we are stranded in one room of this cabin, trying to avoid being injured by gunfire. A soldier moves into this one room with us. He is shooting through our window. One of my roommates pulls out a gun that looks like a machine gun. None of the rest of knew she even had this gun. She is also now at the window shooting as the opposing army gets closer and closer to us. We are surrounded by this battle going on. There are so many soldiers all around us. We see all of the fighting and people dying, explosions, fires. At one point, they_____ [problem with my audio tape]. The war is finally over. Our side has won. Everyone outside and we stand inside.

Someone from the opposing army throws a grenade or something like it into our midst. It lands near the highest-ranking officer that is with us.
