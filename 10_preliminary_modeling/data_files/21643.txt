I saw a dustmate as winner or heard it or was repeating it. I was by my mother's home. I was slicing potatoes that were cooked. My sister Ann came over and took a piece to eat. I gathered a bunch of socks and took them into the kitchen and asked my sister Mary where she wanted them and she told me on the table. I looked outside in the front street and I saw a big derrick come on the street between Grandma's house and Harry's house, then it went back. I went outside and it backed up thru his yard and across the other lots on 74th St. I looked and this was a new street cut thru. It looked like it was right thru to 79th St. I was by Grandma's home again. I was lying in bed with Mary and was having intercourse with her. I came outside in the morning. The sun was just rising above the horizon. My mother and some of the neighbors were in their yards up with the sunrise. Someone dropped something into the toilet and broke part of the wall and the piece lay closing the drain hole. I saw Jimmy Evans running around on all fours and he just had his shirt on. I could see his sex organs. I looked at two smoke stacks. They were leaning over and there were men around the bottom. Then one stack started to fall. It shook the ground as it hit the earth and crumbled. Then the other stack went down and did the same thing. They were destroyed. Then I saw a man come by all excited. He said he thought the owner's daughter was in the way of one of the stacks. I was drinking out of bottles. It was liquor and it seemed I also drank hair tonic.
