All I can recall is that it seemed to have something to do with the experimental situation. At one point it seemed as if I were more aware of some activity going on, which I think were eye movements. I'm not sure whether it was that something had caused the eye movements or whether it was to be that the eye movements were the cause of something else. At one time there was an impression of looking at a piece of paper and in a sense there were four parts underlined. These were in the lower part of the paper and there was a small one to the left and right and then a larger something to the bottom left and right. The small things were more or less centered over the large things so that the four underlinings had a symmetrical appearance (although they were definitely at the bottom of this paper or page). It seems like they were words, which were underlined, but I can't make them out. It seems as if the group of smaller words were underlined. Then the groups of larger words were underlined as if that was to be the sequence of direction, as if the small one were to be in each case followed by the large one.
