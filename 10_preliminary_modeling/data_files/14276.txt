I had thought that our leaver's jackets looked like some Year 10 jackets we had gotten at Whitehall High, although I was thinking that I didn't do Year 10 there. I was looking at some photos on my computer from that time and they were wearing the same jackets, except theirs were a lighter blue. I remembered that Liesl had been on the leaver's jacket committee at both schools and realized she just recycled the idea. I told Mom about it. I went to school for something. We were standing next to the PAC, facing the gym, which was a lot of bigger. They made us all gather somewhere and Autumn bumped into me, and I thought she was going to say "Hello Sunshine" but she ignored me. Ms Solomon asked us questions about Bella's 'sadness' in the Twilight movie. All the girls began talking excitedly about it. Then we were in a computer room. I was at a computer in a smaller part of the room, next to Elijah who was sitting to my left. He was typing, but at the same time pressing backspace so nothing would show up. I hit '69' and it showed up. He thought it was funny and asked why I pressed 69 and I said it was the easiest number to hit, so he hit '55' to show that was easier. Eugene was in the bigger part of the room and was to the left of me. He looked tired and grumpy and kept ruffling his hair and putting his head on the desk. He was also really pale. We were then outside and there was a parade going down this street. There was a car on the island in the middle of the two lanes and we hid on the side away from the parade. People were looking for us. People poured out of this building across the road and then some of them would come to the front and sing. Eugene came out with some other guy and he looked kind of chubby. I was with Calvin and I thought he was going to say something about Eugene but he didn't.
