 I am out to eat with my friend Melanie McDyss. She is tutoring another little boy besides the one we both tutor now, whose name is Nick. I want to ask Melanie for her phone number, and I do. My sister Ramona and I are taking care of two kids. One is two or three years old, and the other is an infant. We are near a hay field and a cornfield. I play with the infant in the cornfield after crawling through the hay field. We play peek-a-boo. I have a small snake. It slides around my finger and on the ground. There is a gravel road there. Ramona, I, and the infant are sitting on the road. A truck comes down the road. I move. Ramona doesn't. I yell at her for not moving. The truck goes by. <br/
