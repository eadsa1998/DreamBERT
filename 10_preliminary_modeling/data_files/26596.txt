 I'm in a large room with several people, including my friend Kim. Kim holds a chain saw. A white movie screen falls over and the saw cuts through it. Rita Fosters, an acquaintance, is there. There has been some kind of gathering. Others and I are sweeping and cleaning up. I see that a woman has my pocket notebook and is reading it. I confront and physically restrain her, taking my notebook. She is a shorter woman. To me, her having my notebook is completely unacceptable and I feel 100% justified in using force to take it. She says she has my wallet too. I restrain her physically, until I realize my wallet is in my back pocket. Women are mad at me because I used physical force towards this woman. I argue that it was justified. My voice cracks as I talk. My friend Jill Clayton is there. We argue. I yell at her, "I don't have to do anything, which is where your problem is!" We yell and argue about the Dean of Students.
