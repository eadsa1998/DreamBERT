I am with a group of people. I see the ocean. I am near a jungle. I am a leader, like Katherine Hepburn. My daughter (young teen) is stolen by a gorilla. We are searching for her. I take lots of large hair pins out of my long blonde hair and drop them in a pool of water. They go "plop, plop." Some nice man is watching me in the dream. I then go to a banquet. There lots of long tables. One man wearing a red shirt sits at a table. I am interested in him and vice versa. I walk past him and sit at the foot of the next table. Another man (possibly Howard), comes over to sit next to me. I firmly place my arms across the place setting on either side of me. He says, "Oh, can I sit here?," (new to me). I say, "No." Then he says, "How about here?," and chooses a chair next to the place next to me. I shrug and say, "O.K." He then chooses one more chair removed from me and sits. I feel good. I flirt with the man in a red shirt.
