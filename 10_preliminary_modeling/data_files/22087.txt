I was in the country and in an old barn that I don't know. I and several others, who never appeared distinctly, had two brothers, aged 20 and 22, with their hands tied on their backs. It is daytime. I get the idea that in order for them not to escape, we should also tie them by their feet to a pipe which goes from the ceiling to the floor and which is very tall. When I am about to do this, a person comes into the barn (I cannot remember who it was) and reproaches me for what I am about to do. I obey and stop doing it. Immediately afterwards, we were outside the barn (I have never been in a barn), but it was a moment at which what has gone previously had not yet occurred. We were bringing the two brothers, handcuffed, when their mother and another brother came before us and asked us to free them. Someone, I don't know who, said no, because at war everything is allowed and they had done the same thing before. An old man said that this was nothing, and that worse things could happen. I, however, casually approached the mother and told her not to worry because he was just trying to scare them.
