Ezra, Mom and I went to this place for bowling. First it was Dad in the car and I forgot my shoes and he was complaining. There was a pool outside the place. I saw Darius and I was like "Oh my God! Evelyn's man!". I was thinking "I have to tell Calvin this!". I tripped over and was like "Flip! Bollocks!". Darius followed us. Inside, it was museum like and I recognized it. We'd been there before and I was thinking that I'd dreamt about it before. There was an art exhibition and then it was excursion. Eugene was there. We were getting put into groups. On this piece of paper it had Simba, me, Thuy, Elijah and Eugene in a group. Me and Eugene's details were mixed up -- his address was my address etc. We went off in our group. Eugene and Thuy were hanging together. Eugene had a lemon and he spat it out. I dropped a knife and Elijah laughed at me. Someone asked me if there was anyone in the room that I hadn't talked about. There wasn't. There was a book with lots of drawings.
