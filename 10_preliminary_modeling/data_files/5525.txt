I dreamed about my younger daughter, C. In the dream she was a small child again and I was leaning out an upstairs window of an apartment where we lived apparently, and she was crossing a very busy street and I shouted down to her "C watch what you're doing!" Because she wasn't watching where she was going and the traffic was very heavy and she just said "yeah" and she bent over and picked up a banana peal and once again I shouted "don't pick up other people's garbage!" and she flaunted the banana peal, waved it around.
