Coming to an old poverty-struck town to teach. We find the address and no one's there. So I go to the door and call, "I'm here. It's time." Little munchkin type critters come in. My associate (Mike Douglas) looks out at all of these "disabled" critters and looks at me. I smile at his discomfort. He asks if they need high school or grade school instruction. They say grade school. He says, "Well, that's me." I then take over as I'm more at ease and tell them I have arthritis and my vocal cords are deformed and I can't talk over them. They cooperate and I thank them for showing me respect.
