Ezra and I were playing this game on the computer. It looked like World of Warcraft. We were randomly assigned roles. The first two games that we played I got the same thing and it was the easiest role. The setting was like outside a castle and this big door/gate would open and all these flying things like gargoyles would come in. We were at desks. The third time I got a different role where I had to fly and I also had to choose the appearance of our flag and my character's appearance. I picked this guy with a black handlebar moustache and black hair etc. I got this thing that was like a stake and had to stab these blog things on the left side. Some guy complained when I did it. Then we had a teacher who was Jack Black and he started singing a song about R2-D2 and someone said that he was made of aluminium.
