 I'm with Niles Zelling. We're playing a game that is like Stratego. My classmate Dolly Storms calls to ask me a question about homework. I remember I have calculus to do, which is due tomorrow. I tell her I have to go. There are a few problems I need to do about standard deviation and stuff. I don't do them.
