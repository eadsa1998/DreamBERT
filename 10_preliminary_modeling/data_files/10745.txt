I was joining a sorority. I saw a large room in which we met. The name of the sorority was Phi Beta. It was a high school group. I don't know why I picked on that sorority to dream about since I never went around with these girls in high school. I had something very important to say, but I wasn't called. I got very angry and left the room. Later I asked someone why I wasn't called on. They said it was because I was Jewish. The group of girls in the sorority were all Jewish. When I left the room, I went to the lavatories. When I returned, a dance was going on. I saw some boys I had dated - can't remember names.
