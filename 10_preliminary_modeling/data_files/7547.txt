I am in a play, or in some business venture, in which I must have an association with this woman. I don't know whether it's a play in which I must kiss her in some love scenes, or whether it's a business deal in which I must negotiate with her. At any rate, friends advise me to break it off because certain people (and they name them) will gossip to Mary about this and convince her that I'm having an affair with this other woman. I think this is ridiculous. I am not having an affair, and Mary trusts me and knows I wouldn't cheat on her. Next I'm taking a shower and it seems to me someone has come into the house. I feel a draft and get out of the shower and find the bathroom door open. I step out of the bathroom and look around. I see no one. I call out, "Mary, is that you?" There is no answer. I go back into the bathroom. There, on a table, is an empty wine glass (or cocktail glass?). When I see this, I know Mary is home. I dry myself, then search through the house, looking for her. After looking through several rooms, I find her lying on the sofa, her back toward me. I am delighted to find her, go over to the sofa, kneel down, and try to embrace her. She yells out angrily at me, "Leave me alone! Don't touch me! You're having an affair with..." (she names the woman, but I have no recollection of the name as I record this). My first reaction is to laugh and tell her this is a lot of nonsense. As I do so, I remember what my friends told me, that a certain person would gossip and plant seeds of doubt in Mary's mind about my relationship with that woman. I am in the process of trying to explain the true nature of the situation to Mary when the dream ends.
