My sorority sister, a girl about 20 years of age, was living in a dormitory. I went to see her on sorority business and found her lying on the top of a double-deck bed. She was fully clothed in a nun's robes, and she was reading. Her room was pink and white, and the curtains, bedspreads etc. had large pink ruffles on them. It was very feminine looking. I was surprised that a nun should have such a frilly room, but I wasn't surprised that she was a nun.
