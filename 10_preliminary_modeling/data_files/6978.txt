I go to call knock on door. K.W. comes and tells me they're coming to cut off a room from the living room (as in sketch). I ask how doors will be set. Think it will not leave enough space for a new room. The house is our old home in C.R. At first I had thought the plan good as it would make an apartment to rent.
