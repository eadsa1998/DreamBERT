Together with friend (my age, male, no identity) we watch a plane -- small two place type -- "spin out" close to the ground, recover only to spin out again (it repeated this process about 3 times). The plane crashed on the last time. My "friend" said it was half his plane (partnership). We rode over on my motorcycle and found the crashed plane. My "friend's" partner said he crashed it because it was his birthday. An argument ensued and I fought with the partner who crashed the plane and beat him by wrestling. However, I felt incapable of winning by boxing. He was my age or perhaps younger. Bizarre elements: vivid, plausible, no definite time, felt helpless when I tried to box with him, outside -- no place I have seen.
