I was at 'school'. I asked Mr Stevenson if I could go to the toilet. I got my hair straightener and Josephine went with me. The toilets were like ashtrays and there were no doors, so I went back. The lady said "Are you finished in the 30's?". She said that I had diabetes according to some blood test thing. My score was 26.12. She said "three shots of insulin a day". I said "No". Eugene was there. I was thinking that Ezra must definitely have diabetes.
