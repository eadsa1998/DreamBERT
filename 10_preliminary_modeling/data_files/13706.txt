I was at home and it was before school. I was playing a game on the computer. I lost track of time and Dad was like "We're leaving now". I had to get dressed and straighten my hair still. I said "Look, just get Mom to drop me off". It was already 9.30am. Ezra was there. They were like "Oh, you'll just wag". But, I wasn't going to.
