I am in the Penney store of my old hometown with one other woman. Someone gives me round, white vitamins and says I should take them for asthma. I take them and later throw them and other medications down an elevator shaft. Later I realize I need them but I can't get them back. I know I am dreaming. I can't breathe. I wake up very out of breath.
