A big party at our house with good friends from the Retreat Center and mountains of food, esp. whipped cream and chocolate. We dance and play games; happy. Then I take a bus, but it proves to be the wrong bus; the bus driver preaches about Jesus; I get off at the wrong street and wonder if I will find bus #6 to take me home. I wonder if the party is still going on?
