 I'm in the upstairs bathroom at my Redding grandparents farmhouse with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We are engaging in sexual activity. I touch her vagina and give her cunnilingus. The family that lives on the corner of 1st Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley is moving. I grab two garbage cans of stuff and put them away, and then I run back upstairs to the bathroom. We don't have much time. We have sex. I try to make her have an orgasm. We are rushed. We hear voices outside the door, which is locked. I didn't want to have genital sex with her because I come to climax quickly without her reaching orgasm, but since we are running out of time we have sex. She doesn't have an orgasm: there is not enough time or stimulation.
