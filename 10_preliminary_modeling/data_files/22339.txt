Last night I had a party to which my ex-girlfriend was also invited. One thing spoiled my evening and it was that at one point when I looked at her, she was also looking at me. I can say that this was our only communication last night. The dream was about her. I was sitting in front of her on a wooden table which was completely empty. I looked at her and talked with her; I don't remember exactly what we talked about, but it was about us. After a while I put my left hand on her right hand which was on the table, and the beautiful thing was that she squeezed it! I wish it were more than a dream.
