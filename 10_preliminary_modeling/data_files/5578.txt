[1997-05-25] I am at the Guiding Dogs, where people get dogs, and I don't need a dog, but I see people I know there who are there to get dogs. But things have changed and many are not out there walking, they're not on a training trip, they're sitting around making calls, talking to their social workers and counselors and doing weird things and I am saying: "you know, things aren't the same here, you should be out with your dog learning, you can't get to know your dog by sitting in a room, you should be out there practicing, that's the only way you're going to learn, by doing it. Why have you changed your training style because its not going to be as effective?" I was very disappointed.
