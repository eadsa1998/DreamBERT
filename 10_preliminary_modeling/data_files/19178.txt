We were in systemic physiology lab--Martha, Jeff and I were doing an experiment on skeletal muscle. We used a frog's gastronemius muscle attached to a strain gage and a "grass" polygraph. This was calibrated so that deflection of the polygraph so many centimeters equaled so much force of muscle contraction. We were recording effects with a tetanizing current (maximal 10 volt voltage @30 cycles/sec). We were arguing over the explanation of the staircase of "Treppe" effect. Jeff and I were arguing. I knew I was right (although when I tried to recall the exact explanations, I could not do so). Martha agreed with me. Day residue: The entire scene and theme was day residue taken from this last week. We have been studying muscle contraction using frog gastronemius. I have had Martha as a lab partner and Jeff as a lab partner, but not both of them on the same experiment. Jeff and I both have trouble understanding the Treppe effect.
