My wife Anita and I are going somewhere by car to visit friends.  She is driving, and we are going up a steep hill.  Apparently we are at a stop sign or stoplight, because she puts her feet up on the dash.  I tell her to keep her foot on the brake, else we will roll down the hill.  She refuses to do so, and we begin creeping backwards-very slowly at first, and then gathering speed.  I am angry that she still stubbornly refuses to follow my advice.  At the bottom of the hill are some other cars.  I warn her that we will hit them and suffer damage to our new car, and this can be avoided.  She still does nothing, and I prepare myself for the crash, glad in a way that I will be vindicated.  But the crash doesn't come.  Maybe I wake up, since this is the last thing I remember.
