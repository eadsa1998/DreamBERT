I'm in a long line of girls in gym suits--we're standing in front of a door, &amp; the girls all go thru. I'm at the end of the line, &amp; when I get to the door, Miss A_____ says to me - "Sorry, Y_____, you can't graduate. " And the whole line of girls turns thin--I can see thru them; they go on thru a long walk - they seem to go on for ever, while I stand there looking on.
