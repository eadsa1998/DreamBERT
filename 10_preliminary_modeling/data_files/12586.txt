There was some Urban Legend type of thing happening. People were dying the same way as some others years before. Whitney (Smallville) was in a group. There was a hot guy and I thought he was the killer, but he got stabbed. The killer was Lana (Smallville). Then she went and listened to Celine Dion in a room.
