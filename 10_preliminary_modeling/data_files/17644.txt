I was on campus, talking to my old friend Neil Block. Not sure what he was doing there or what we were talking about. Went to some place on campus to get some lemon noodles. The campus seemed more like my friend's, larger and more spread out and flatter than my university. It might have supposedly been a grad school.  I saw some people I recognized from campus. I recall something to do with my kindergarten teacher Mrs. Moore as well. Anyway I seemed to be wandering around the campus pretty aimlessly, until I collapsed somewhere and messed with the elastic on my thongs. A girl came up to me with a clear shoebox.  She reminded me very much of a girl I knew from fourth grade. She had tiny odd shaped Tupperware containers and flecks. Things like popcorn and Grape Nuts and confetti that she was gluing onto the Tupperware, so they ended up looking like little parade floats decorated with flowers. And I just sat there and cried.  My boyfriend Jeremy was in my life, but I had been on campus for quite some time and could not make friends.
