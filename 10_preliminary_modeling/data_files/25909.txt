 There is a woman at a portage on the Big Resort Area who has had a seizure. My boss Mike Hollow goes out in a boat with my friend Stephen Ramos. When they are out at the portage, Stephen hits his head on a rock and goes into a coma, I am told. Stephen's father Franco is then going out in a boat with Mike. They go backwards in the boat. The area is not Eagle Lake: it is a different lake. I am on shore. Mike and Franco need a double-bladed paddle. I get their attention and drive out in a wide fishing boat to give it to them. On the way back I drive across grassy lawns and cement sidewalks in the boat. It seems I am over near Riverside School in Wilmerton. I get down to the end of the lawns and do a baseball slide onto my high school classmate Tanya Simmons' front lawn. She is inside the house cooking: I see her through a window, and feel like I'm disturbing them. I go into my friend Tiny Comb's house, which is then there. Tiny, his brother Matt, and their mother are there. They warn me about scraping up other people's lawns. They say people will be mad at me. I say I understand. <br/
