I thought I had gone to the top of a dome of great height. It corresponded closely with the New York "World" Building, which I visited a month ago. No railing surrounds us and the sensation caused by the iron roof rounding away from our feet was unpleasant from the first. It became more so as other men kept arriving, and I was crowded farther and farther from the centre. I was soon compelled to sit down. I dug my heels into a slight groove and rested partly on my palms, while I watched apprehensively two fellows--Hopkins students--who were in front of me and consequently on a steeper surface. The pressure behind forced me forward and the inevitable happened. The two men could no longer sustain themselves. Without a cry they began slipping with increasing speed until they shot over the cornice at the base of the dome and dropped into the depths, their dwindling forms revolving slowly as they fell. My horror was intense, and I saw no escape from a like fate. My heels were grating over the rusty iron plates when, happy thought! I said to myself: "I'm running this dream, and I'll run it to suit myself." Immediately I was descending comfortably in an elevator.
