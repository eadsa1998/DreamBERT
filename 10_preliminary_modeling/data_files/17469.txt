I dreamt of finding some people and taking them through the house as prospective housemates.  The house was turned.  My housemate/landlord Andre had shifted it.  The bathroom was now by his room, instead of the kitchen, and one wall was not attached; there was a fiberglass overhang covering part of it.  His room and the kitchen were far away and grass and barbed wire had to be crossed to get there.  It didn't seem practical.
