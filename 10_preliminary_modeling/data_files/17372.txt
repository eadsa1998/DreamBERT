My mother and I were taking the Volvo home after repairs.  I was leading, but the off-ramp/flyover we were supposed to take was abruptly cut off and missing.  I headed for the other direction.  I found out only too late that that one was unfinished, too.  I started to slam on the brakes but realized I wouldn't make it, and would probably just cause more damage.  I didn't know any other ways out anyhow, so I accelerated.  I flew off and landed hard, but everything seemed okay.  My mother had been able to stop in time.  I threw a tirade at the mechanic when my car wouldn't start.  I talked to them on the phone.  It wouldn't be fixed until Monday.  Would they do it for free since it was their fault?  Busy signal.
