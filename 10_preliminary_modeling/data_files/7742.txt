I had called Kate D because I thought she should have a list of the phone numbers. I worked with her. Her son answered the phone and said she had them. I asked him to read them to me. There were quite a few. When he read them, there were two digits, the seven-digit phone number, and then two more digits. The first two and last two were always the same and the sequence was in the tens and twenties. When Kate D found out Jonathan D had given me this information she became very upset with him because he gave this information out and he didn't know who he gave it to. She said he should never have done that. Later when I was with Kate D, we were sitting on the floor talking, with our backs leaned up against the wall. I said that it is very hard for me to remember that I am no longer in control there. My eyes started to tear a bit and I wiped them dry. I realized that I needed to tell her it was me that called Jonathan. I didn't want her to think less of me or be mad at me, so I was trying to figure out what to tell her about why I had called and why I had asked for that information. I decided to tell her that truth. that I called because I thought she should have the information and when Jonathan said she did I asked him to read it to me to verify it.
