[1997-07-01] I was at Girls Scout camp in a row boat, on the lake. I could feel the boat rocking on the lake, I had the oars in my hands, they were made of wood, I could feel the wood against my fingers and I was making the rowing motion with my hand. I could hear the oars going through the water as they made a splashing sound. There was another person in the boat with me telling me which way to go and she said "turn right," but she meant left and we crashed into another boat.
