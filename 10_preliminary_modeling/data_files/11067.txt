I was looking for a person in Crile Hospital. Not knowing who I was looking for, my search was quite exasperating and frustrating. Crile Hospital in my dream was as far from reality as can be explained. The patients were in skeleton casts and caves and all looked undernourished. I couldn't find who I was looking for and so just walked around in a daze. The time just dragged and by the time I left the hospital, I was all tired out.
