I was at this place which had grass and lots of grassy plants. This girl said that she'd found a pretty little lake. We had a look but couldn't find anything. I followed a thin dark patch of grass and found it. I called Mom over and she said she couldn't see it. It was fish shaped and I realized that it was an illusion.
