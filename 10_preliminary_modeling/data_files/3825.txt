["Begging Ellie to stop."] Ellie is going from man to man in this building asking each one if he will travel with her so she can go to this place she wants to go. She is sexy and flirty trying to get what she wants. I am very upset and follow her around. I had tried to stop her and convince her she was putting herself in danger. She would not listen. I am very sad. She is turned down by this one young man (I think they are all military men) many times. I beg her to stop. She is making a fool of herself. She is determined and ignores me. She goes to another man and this time he says yes. He obviously sees this as an opportunity for some free sex, just as I had worried they would. I walk up to them. I say, passionately, I will be blunt. My daughter is young. I have warned her about getting pregnant and getting sexual diseases, but she won't listen to me. Please don't get her pregnant. I cry. He looks at me sympathetically and promises he will not harm her. I turn and walk down the ramp to the outside. I walk down a path as I cry.
