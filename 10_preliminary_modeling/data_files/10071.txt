It is LENT at Church: we try to raise money for poor people; I stand on a busy street and see ourselves reflected in a shop window; I sign up for volunteer service; Driving home I see Father Andrew driving a big school bus with people from Church; "He certainly does a lot of things" I say admiringly.
