I had taken Mary to the hospital one or two days ago. She is very sick and dying of cancer. But since her admission, I haven't visited her or phoned the hospital to find out about her condition. I didn't want to know and am pretending that there is no point in contacting the hospital. But Maria asked me if I had phoned the hospital to find out about Mary, and suddenly all my guild comes out. I enter a telephone booth and frantically start looking in the Telephone Directory for the hospital's phone number. I am having difficulty find it. For some strange reason I am searching for the name "FISHMAN" when I know perfectly well that isn't the name of the hospital. I don't know whether she's in Sunnybrook, or Bayview, or where. I am searching anxiously through several phone books. I'm angry at people for not stacking these phone books neatly on the cupboard shelf inside the phone booth. Then I wake up.
