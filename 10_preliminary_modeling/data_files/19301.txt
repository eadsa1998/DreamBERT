The setting seemed familiar at the time, but I guess I didn't really know where I was. I was with my boyfriend who is also 17 and a few other males, all similar in age. I am pretty sure I was the only girl in the dream. I remember my boyfriend was sitting on the floor, and another boy, who was black, was sitting on the couch. I went to sit down and he put his hand palm upon the cushion I was going to sit down on. I could feel his hand on my ass. I felt really uncomfortable because I didn't like him like that and my boyfriend was there. When we left, my boyfriend was driving and he was also drunk and he ran into a parked car, put his car into reverse, and rammed into it again. The last thing I remember is getting into the driver's seat to finish the ride home.
