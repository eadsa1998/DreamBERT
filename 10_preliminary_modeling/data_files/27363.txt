This dream seemed to be especially long, and especially realistic. After I awoke I realized how absurd it really was. It began on a boat where someone had been murdered (a male). The murderer had wrapped a snake around the victim's neck. I was suspicious of a tall, dark, young man, who was not good looking but had a beautiful build. As I recall, his name was Wade. However, after I got to know him we fell very much in love, and combined our efforts to find the murderer. The next thing I recall is that we were walking down a road to a farmhouse. Someone there told us to follow a road to find the murderer. We walked down the road, and soon Wade was far ahead of me. The road divided and it seemed to be very misty. I couldn't find Wade. There were millions of people walking down the road and I passed a young fellow who had been on the boat. I asked him about Wade and he said he had just been killed. I came to a hurst with two policemen in it. There were curtains drawn all the way around it, and the policeman peeked through and said Wade was dead. I cried through the rest of the dream! I then came to in an airplane filled with tunnels and people. I overheard the pilot telling the murderer he would conceal the murderer in the wing. I then realized the murderer was the young man who had told me Wade was killed. My father then advised and I told him where the murderer was. This is the last I recall.
