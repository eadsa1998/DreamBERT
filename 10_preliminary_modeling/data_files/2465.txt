I'm in a huge Victorian house. A bunch of babies/small children like Mateo are there. I'm taking care of them (day care). They are helping Ginny and me to paint the house. (Interior) white paint is everywhere. It's sticky, sloppy, etc. It looks pretty good though. Ginny says, "Now it looks like French provincial, not that dark, brooding Victorian brown you had painted them before." I agree that it looks nice. The window frames are huge and spacious, mirrors are large and wall-sized. I look in a spacious room with a wall mirror and say, "Look, this can be a dance room," and I practice a few ballet arm moves and watch my moves in the mirror.
