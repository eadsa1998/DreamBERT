 I'm in a room working on a dream with someone I know. I grade school classmate Jerry Kasper enters the room and sits down, which doesn't seem to affect our work. I'm with others in a field playing softball. There are two soccer players there, with a soccer ball. One of them may be my classmate Jim Suds. I ask them if they want to play softball, since we're going to take up the whole field. They say no, and leave somewhat angrily. I'm near the corner of Home Avenue and Main Street in Oak Valley. I get a mixed drink from a field that is staying there, but I leave to go do some kind of sports activity. I'm at home relaxing. A crowd of familiar people arrives. They inform me that my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer got into an ambulance, and they interrogate me accusingly as to what I said to him to affect his condition. I react strongly, saying that I said and did nothing to him. I'm appalled to be suspect in this incident, and I tell this very firmly to everyone.
