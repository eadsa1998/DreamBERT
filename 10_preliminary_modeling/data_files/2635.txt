I am in front of the Bon Marche store and suddenly women quickly gather and rush in. I go in and ask what's going on. It's a big sale. So I go around looking at things. I see a harmonica, different than a blues harp, and I try it. I can easily play music, and check the price. It's on sale for $42.00, marked down from $55.00. That's a lot of money, but it's so easy to play. I buy it. Now I'm walking upstairs and wondering if there's an elevator and if I'll make it far without my wheelchair. On the 2nd floor it's rough going. A circular cloth covers the whole area and the only place to walk is at the edge where the cloth snaps into the wall. I hang on and nearly slip and fall, but manage to make it. Now I'm outside and see Mary Allgier. I show her my harp and explain it won't bend notes but I still have my blues harp to do that. Then I do some blues riffs saying words like "train, chuga chuga" into the harp. and blowing train whistle notes. I'm impressed and so is Mary [more about talking with a man].
