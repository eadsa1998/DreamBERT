I was a famous songwriter. I had stayed up to about 12 reading (in real life) and had fallen asleep. I dreamed that I had written a one-hit wonder, and everyone was kissing up to me. The song was about blackberry kisses, and the radio company played it all the time. Then after Jerry kissed me, I woke up. Setting: Alta. Characters: Jerry: nice, sweet, blonde hair, blue eyes. Kids at school: combined from school, camp and classes. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, grand. Good dream!
