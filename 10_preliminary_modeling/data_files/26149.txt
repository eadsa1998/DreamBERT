 Bambi survives the winter. Bambi then sees other fawns grow, or grows himself. He goes down a path in the forest, downhill. The secret to the path is stealth: one has to see others before they see you. Bambi is on a rock cliff above a lake with a dock. I'm on the cliff. I am Bambi. There is a timber wolf on the dock. I howl, to see if the wolf will howl back. The wolf howls, and other wolves howl in the distance. I loose my footing and slip on the wood, and then climb back up. There are two Japanese tourists there. There are ducks there, and they may howl. I point emphatically to the tourists to photograph the wolf! The wolf jumps off the dock into the water and grabs a loon in its mouth. There are three or four other loons swimming there. There is a diver/cameraman, who may be the Japanese tourists. He clicks photographs of the wolf and the loon, one after another, without stopping. I wonder if there will be enough photographs to make a film: if the frames were all shot in a close enough time span. But this probably isn't the case. I think he took 24 photographs.
