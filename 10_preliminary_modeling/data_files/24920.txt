I went to a toystore with my dad and my friend Sandy. We were buying some strange doll shower, but it looked like a mini flying saucer. We brought it back home, and I attached (it) to my living room ceiling. I jumped in the air and grabbed onto the doll shower. When I let go, I was flying and floating in the air. Setting: Toystore &amp; my house. Characters: My dad and my best friend, Sandy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. It was a very thrilling experience to fly.
