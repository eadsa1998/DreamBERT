There were 3 deep sea fishing boats. The boats were different. One huge, huge boat, as big as an aircraft carrier. They were fishing for different kinds of fish, but big fish. Big strong fish that could pull the boat. Barracuda and other fast fish. my father was fishing for sword fish. That's what I wanted to fish for. It was pulling the boat. There was a man overboard. Flailing his arms and screaming. my father jumped in and swam to save him. We were printing in the darkroom late at night. Corrine wanted to print some secret words. She didn't have a negative. I told her it was possible to cut the words out with a razor blade. I had done it before. Some bigger letters. Some very small and intricate. She loved it and wanted to silk screened them yellow. Industrial yellow. She could cut her letters out and silk screen the photograph yellow. I handed her some razor blades--single-edge with cardboard covers (over the blade) in her hand. f u m t it. g d o. and this was a poem about the girls mother and it was so funny we read it twice.
