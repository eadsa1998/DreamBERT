I am trying on the old-fashioned clothes of a "grandmother." My "grandfather" who loved her very much is sharing her with me. It's a very meaningful moment for me. I put on her "lawyer" dress. She wore it when she worked as a lawyer. It was lovely: white ruffles, a bustle, lavender silk. I tried on another dress. It was obvious I'm too plump. The swimsuit is very sexy.
