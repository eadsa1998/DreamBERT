 I'm riding in a car in Wilmerton that my sister Ramona is driving down 3rd Street going east. I look near Track Avenue to see if I happen to get a glimpse of my old classmates, the Allures. We drive near the reformatory. There are many prisoners outside lifting weights and doing other activities. We pull up to an apartment building that is right next to the reformatory, to pick up one of Ramona's friends. I go back to the car after ringing some doorbells and get in, along with my high school classmates Carolyn and Julie Heplin. Ramona is drunk, so I drive. I'm not as drunk as she. I give the Heplin's a ride home. I'm in their house, eating something. Ramona has gone out to our car. The Heplin sisters and a man are there. I feel out of place because this is the "cool" crowd and I'm less "cool", having less social status, less money, etc. We talk a bit, and I leave. I feel pressure to leave. I go out to our car.
