 I'm playing guitar while sitting on a chair that swivels around. I feel like I am at Washington University. My high school English teacher, Mike Mohs, and a professor I had at Brimson, Jerry Rice, are there. I go to the student union building, where my friend Melanie McDyss is. I think I have left my keys somewhere, so I won't be able to get back in the building I was in.
