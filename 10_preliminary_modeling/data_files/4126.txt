I am driving a VW bus and pull into a gas station, but there is no one around. I wait and look around. Nobody is there. I drive away. Now I am with Jeb. He and I are trying to go through some piles of things. Clothes and so on, and get them moved to where they are supposed to be. Jeb works hard but we don't seem to get anything moved. Jeb has hay straws on his back. I tenderly brush them away, feeling sympathy for him. We sigh and continue trying. Now another man who likes me is helping. He is a very kind and nice man but I consider him a bit slow mentally. After we got some things moved, he gently kisses me. I like his kiss, and then I pull back. We won't suit. I am more intelligent and quick witted than he is.
