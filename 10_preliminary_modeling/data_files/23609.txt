I was attending a meeting of some sort. The meeting was at a hotel on the beach, and I was spinning the water in a goldfish bowl around in one direction (clockwise). This would make the frog almost fly out of the bowl, but just as he was ready, I would stop and change directions of the water (counter-clockwise).
