We went to Aunt Joe's and nobody was home. So I went to the side yard, to look at the old junk car parked up on blocks there. While looking at the car I noticed a baby chick playing on the ground near my feet. Next we were at a hotel. 2 very annoying college girls were there. Their mothers were just as annoying but not as loud. The girls were laying on the bed face down, with feet crossed and knees bent. One girl was on her side. Dora came in and said, "I believe you girls were going to leave." She knew they were driving me mad. ???. My clothes were scattered all over the floor, hanging out of drawers and sticking out of closets. The college girls ???. "You girls have a schedule to adhere to," Dora said, meaning: Check out time is 11:00 and Merri needs some time ALONE. In the hotel bathroom the baby chick was standing in the warm spot of light, until I missed the toilet and tinkled all over the floor by accident. It smelled bad and the chick ran away. A guy came out and was screaming. Someone had stolen his car. (It was) a blue early 60's model. He needed his car. This place is in the city, not the country. He was showing us the history of baseball, (showing us) the origins of baseball by driving across a dotted ball field. I said, "This is the most boring thing I've ever done. It's no man's land." Instead of studying the origins of baseball I was looking at the spider. One fake (plastic inflatable spider was) hanging from the ceiling. One was real. I had left the hotel, traveled hundreds of miles to the next hotel the next day; and realized I had left a huge mess in the first hotel. I had not packed anything. NOT one thing.
