I was back at Westport High School and I was in the Media Center where there's three stories. And to get to from one to two wasn't hard, it was normal. But from two to get to three, I guess two was like extra tall and three was like up near the ceiling. You had to climb this monumental amount of stairs. And when we would ride the elevator to get to one, to two wouldn't be too bad; that would be normal. But to get to three, it would take forever and a day, and sometimes it wouldn't even go up to three or wouldn't work right. And we'd be nervous about getting stuck. So I would just prefer to climb the monumental amount of stairs and work up there slowly but surely, dragging my book bag and everything. I remember doing that once, and then going kind of down an incline to get to the main building, and then I think there was a cat walk between that building and somewhere else. And I had to go down to get something. I had to talk to Ms. Garland or somebody, so I took the elevator down and then came back up. But then I dreamt that we were at this like little park thing that you could go out and be in. There were swans and ducks and pigs and things, and it was like a manmade park, but these birds just lived in there. And we would feed them and stuff. And they did these like shows, but I never got to see any of them. And I don't remember anything more. Oh, and I remember the swans were real aggressive. They would come down and lick people, and then I don't remember any more.
