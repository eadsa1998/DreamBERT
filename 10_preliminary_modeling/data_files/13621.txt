I was at school and in Accounting. Autumn was there too and I fell asleep. When I woke up, it was lunch time and Eugene was outside (and he had been there before). I went to the bench but it was in a different spot and we had another bench that we were using. Evelyn was on the old bench. I had to give Darius something of mine and it had my middle name on it. I was thinking that I wanted Eugene's. In English, Ms Madsen said we had an assignment due.
