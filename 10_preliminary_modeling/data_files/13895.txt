Dad and I tried out for Big Brother. We got in but first we had to meet in groups of four and get acquainted. We were with another girl and a guy. The guy was next to me and looked like David (BB06) and was kind of hot. They told us stuff about themselves. Dad said his last name was spelled "Goatse" or something, but I thought he meant like David Bowie. I said "My name is Izzy Conell, I'm 17 and in year 12 doing IB and next year I want to do forensics". The guy got something out of my hair. There was some guy with no legs and he was dancing around and singing. He got rejected from the show. Then I was at school and in the middle of a class. Terrence was there. I didn't know if it was him at first but it was. Then we were on the computers and I signed in on Runescape and he looked me up on the high scores but kept misspelling my name. He added me. He said he hadn't seen me "since that time at Mom's". I remembered back and we were in bed and we were kissing and he was touching me and I was thinking 'why the hell did I do that?'. This teacher lady told me to get Biology homework and I said I'd give it to her tomorrow. Calvin and I were in some water on Runescape (though we were in it). I didn't want to go on the main land because it was in the wilderness. Ezra got a new GTA, but was in Al Kharid and it was all desert like and you couldn't use prayer in the wilderness part and Ezra was annoyed about it. We were then at Mom's and the computer was laggy. There was a warning siren, signaling a nuclear war. Mom got me back inside. I was trying to say that I just started watching Threads yesterday.
