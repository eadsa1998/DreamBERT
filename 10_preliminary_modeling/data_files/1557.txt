I am in the kitchen of Aunt Elaine's house. I am moving in and so is Diane R. I am putting food stuff away. Cookies, candies, etc. I comment to Diane that I will need lower shelves so I can reach things. Two workmen come and do something out in the barn. Now I go from room to room to decide where to put my bedroom and office. I walk through two bedrooms, the front one had a small room off it. It had a small cat and a wild and ugly turkey bird in it. I say, "Ugh! How did you get in?" He follows me. I wonder if Elaine used this room when she wanted to sleep alone. I go to the dining room. Diane is putting away her dishes in the pretty glass cabinet in the wall. I say, "Wait. I have some pretty things I want to display too. We should share this equally." She smiles and says "Or 60, 90." Now we are in the living room and I say "I have a TV, stereo, and a VCR." Diane says, "I have a VCR and a clock-radio." Her voice is soft and I ask her to speak up as I can't hear her well. I suggest we use my couch. She says, "I've seen your couch. I'd rather use mine." I say, "Where is it?" She points. It is rickety, ugly, yellow and low to the ground. I say, "I can't sit on this because it's too low." We negotiate. Diane asks me 3 times, but I can't hear her. She's embarrassed. Finally I understand that she's on welfare and I need to write a statement that I haven't given her money. Then Ginny comes in and sits down. I'm eating a sweet sticky chocolate. She mumbles and I ask her to speak up. She's concerned that the 2 workmen will try to cheat me and warns me not to pay them. They took a covered glass dish and didn't pay for it. both ways.
