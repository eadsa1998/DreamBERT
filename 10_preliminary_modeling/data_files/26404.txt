 I'm in a mall-like area where there are some theatres of some kind. My high school classmate Paul Miller talks to me briefly, and then goes into a theatre. I go into a theatre with my friend Niles Zelling. It's a television show/movie/musical type theatre that has commercials. I have a deer antler. Niles and I sit down. A man behind me grabs the antler out of my hand. I turn around and grab his free hand and bend his fingers back, almost breaking them, to make him give me the antler back. He doesn't give it back. I stop behind his fingers. I'll kick his ass after the show. It's dark, and the usher comes down the aisle behind us. He says, "Niles!" in a loud voice, and I know that the usher has come because Niles' girlfriend Jessica or her mother has come for Niles. I don't have a good time at the show. There are a few distinct young teenagers that strike me as being less-than-bright.
