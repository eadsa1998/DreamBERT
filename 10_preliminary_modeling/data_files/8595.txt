I was working on a computer project. It seems to be some kind of Excel spreadsheet. But it is something for family and there is a sheet for each member of the family. I think it may have just been for one or two of my siblings families, but I'm not sure now. It felt like I woke up several times but each time I thought to myself that I wanted to finish up these sheets before I got up.
