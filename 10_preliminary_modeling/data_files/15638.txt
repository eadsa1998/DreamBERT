I was at Red Dwarf live and I was sitting at seat C9. It was at a bar place. My seat was on the side and in the first row. I thought we could get to the back of the set, but a girl and I went outside to do something and could barely see anything. Cat came on and sat in a chair and said "We're dirt poor" and he kept going on about it and he said he was going to write a note to remind him how he felt. He put the note in his chair, then sighed and took it back out. Then someone in the audience said "this sucks". A kid coughed and there was hardly anyone in the audience. It started filling up after a few minutes and people were still coming in throughout the show. Rimmer came out with no shirt on but he didn't have the same voice. Him and Lister did something weird and then were running and dancing with sparkles. There was a bin on fire and I was confused. I took some photos with my phone. Rimmer went to the row behind me and took this girl's brownie and took a bite and she giggled. A bit later he ran back out and we followed. He needed a phone and everyone chucked their phones at him. I took my phone out and took a photo. I tried to lock it and put it away but I accidently called someone and I had trouble hanging up. Then he asked me for my phone so I gave it to him and I was excited.
