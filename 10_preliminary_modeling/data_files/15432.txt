We were out the back of the old house. For Ezra's birthday, Mom bought him a $350 chair, $135 pair of 'remote control' shoes and 'dream boots'. The dream boots were like a soft pair of thongs which also massaged his feet. He seemed to like it, then let me try them. He tried the remote control shoes. Mom controlled them and then he just stomped out the front. I yelled at Mom saying 'why the hell did you spend all that money on him and you just give me $150?!". I followed him out and he had thrown bits of the shoes around. I picked it all up and there was a small square bit of cardboard that flew off. It flew up over the roof, so I ran out the back and asked "You can't take it back without that?" and she couldn't, so I walked around to find it. There was a big park behind the house. I walked to the other side of it and I saw it stuck between two bushes. I went back and said "you better be able to take it back".
