There were vampires or zombies or something. I was hiding under a blanket peeking out the window. Granma and Uncle Gabriel were coming up an escalator. Granma was a vampire and Uncle Gabriel was a werewolf. Uncle Gabriel turned into a werewolf and then I did. We both climbed up this pole and he scratched me. I realized it was a dream and tried to get away. Then I was somewhere else. I wished for Eugene, but nothing happened. I went to a shop and I knew it was a dream, but I couldn't control it.
