I had a dream that a friend and I were in a local Stop and Shop. The store was giving away all the products in refrigeration section free. The store's refrigeration units were not functioning properly. I remember smelling everything I took to make sure it had not spoiled. I took lots of dairy products such as milk, yogurt, cream cheese and ice cream. The store was extremely crowded but my friend and I took what we wanted. Then I woke up.
