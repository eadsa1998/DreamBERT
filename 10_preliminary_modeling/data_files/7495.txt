Mary dies while I am out of town on a weekend. On my return, I am told of her death, but given no other information. I don't even know who tells me of her death. I don't know to which hospital she was taken, nor am I told the cause of death. I start frantically looking for my office because I want to make phone calls to find out to which hospital she had been taken. I am angry that the hospital hadn't called me to give me information about her so that I can start making funeral arrangements. I am searching for my office. I am hurriedly walking along a street, not sure of the location of my office. I am desperate to find a telephone. I think I'd been back in town for a day or so, waiting to hear from the hospital. I become desperate only after I've had no word about her death. I wake up while I am searching for the building in which I work. For a split second after awakening, I feel angry that I'd not heard from the hospital.
