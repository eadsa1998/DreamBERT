When I awoke, I heard (I know what you gave her, a full house). I was working at Dill's. I had my shoes off and my feet were dirty. I was in the basement. I made a meal in a dirty can and it didn't taste very good, so I was going upstairs to cook it in a kettle. I was dreaming of people turning a funny color and dying.
