I am walking in a street I Paris. It is about 6 o'clock. Nobody is out. Everything looks quaint and deserted. All the stores are closed and the blinds are down. I really feel all alone in the sleeping town, although it is too early for the people to be asleep. And then a car arrives and stops and my parents and my brother (he is 4 years older than me) are in it. They ask me why I am walking by myself and scold me a little bit. I go in the car with them and we ride through the deserted streets until we arrive home. But I don't recognize it at all. It seems to be somebody else's place. I am very much upset because the others seem to feel at home there, and not notice the difference. They act very natural, don't feel lost in this unknown house. I can just stand next to an unfamiliar table with a lamp on it and watch them, coming and going, and talking, feeling a stranger.
