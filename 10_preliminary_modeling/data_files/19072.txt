This is a dream I remembered when I woke up. I remember being with a lot of people. It seems as though it was some sort of a picnic or something, like a company picnic. They were all playing volleyball and swimming and everything. It wasn't at a park though. It seemed like it was between a couple houses, and I remember they were playing volleyball in the back yard of one house. Next door there was a swimming pool and there were people swimming. I remember I got the volleyball and I kicked it. It went real high and I remember that it came down a couple houses away. It didn't seem to disturb the volleyball game though. They just went right on. I remember saying that I made a field goal when I went and retrieved the ball ___________. The last thing I remember was that I was swimming and then seemed to be racing with someone, a girl. I don't know who she was, but I remember that I was ahead of her and that she beat me just at the end. I stopped or slowed down or something and she passed me up. As far as colors, I remember the color, the water color. I remember the color of all the people, the skin color. That's the whole dream. [As far as relating this dream to my experiences, I can't relate it to anything. Nothing was familiar in the dream or anything that happened to me recently. I didn't recognize any persons, and I don't get any meaning out of the dream.]
