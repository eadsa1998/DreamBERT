I went back to high school to visit my teachers.  I went to my French teacher Mrs. Barnes' room, and then I was in the cafeteria wondering why the tables were not all the same.  Then I heard some karagaraa.  Where was it coming from?  I was jealous of whoever could do it so well.  My boyfriend Jeremy was next to me.  I was at my junior high school, where supposedly my online friend Morris went too.  I saw him across the room with a friend and a microphone.  They started everyone lamely singing, and someone was playing the guitar.  I saw my longtime classmate Ralph.  From there I was competing with my brother Stuart on a waffle iron.  He had waffles, I had crepes.  I had 'couches' for safety so the spot with a couch could not be stolen.  He had one trick of his own- whoever cooked all of theirs first, won.  I lifted the hot iron to get the couch, burning my ring finger.  Then I was driving.  I was sort of lost.  I turned right onto a narrow street.  'Christian Country'.  It was a dead end.  I turned around with surprising ease.  But then I was no longer in the car, and there were snakes.  One was sticking up in the air, very stiff.  I thought it was dead.  When I got closer, I learned it wasn't.  I guess I had it on the end of a stick or something.  Somehow I managed to get it into the back yard and yelled for my mother to bring a knife.
