At party. A woman friend sits at long table. My wife is there. She looks gray and old. My friend tells me that she hasn't told me the whole story. She has already filed papers for divorce. Then she sits at other table. I get up alone and go home and watch a silly erotic flick. The kids are home and will watch a film in living room that a young girl has brought. I am bored.
