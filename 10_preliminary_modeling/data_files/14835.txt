I was watching Mork and Mindy. Mindy was with Mork. He went into a spaceship and accidentally took off. She cried and it showed him saying like 'when you show total sadness'. She fell asleep. When she woke up she was on the ship. Then it was me. It was futuristic looking and I walked down a hall. I had been separated from my boyfriend/guy I liked. I found some people and they were all girls. They said I was there 'God' and I was supposed to tell them where they came from, etc. There was an island called 'The Eye' and I had been there before in a submarine? The hall had pictures on both sides. One side had pictures from this old magazine. The comics started off 'gross' and violent and as they went on, they got cleaner and 'nicer'. The other side had another magazine which had started out clean, and had gotten more violent. Later I was telling Mom and I said that I didn't want to be stuck with girls and I was angry and upset about it.
