Walking alone through lonely landscape: begging: enter a house: offer to wash all her dishes for chance to eat? make friends with this woman: lots of people (party); we walk to Church: I show them Church, but come in at the wrong end: see Archbishop and Patriarch celebrating liturgy: I feel ashamed; I slink out; - later I make a confession by writing all my sins in the snow: later see Father Andrew with watering can, watering the writing, so that it will be erased!!
