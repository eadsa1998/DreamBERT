I was standing outside somewhere with Matthew waiting for Shirley J because we were going to help her move. There was a little grassy slope next to the pavement. In one part of the grassy area there was a small pile of sand, about a foot in diameter. Matthew was pretty much just standing in one place but I kept moving around. First I was standing in the grass. Then I moved to the sand pile and was playing with the sand with my right foot. Then I moved onto the pavement. When I walked onto the pavement I noticed a penny. When I bent down to pick it up I noticed another one in a small hole in the pavement. The hole was just barely bigger than the penny and I wondered if I would be able to get it out. That penny was very shiny. There was water in the hole. I was able to get the penny out. Then I found three more, each lying in separate spots. I told Matthew it was a good day when I find a penny, and an especially good one because I found five of them. Darren and Annie H show up to help. They have Kay H with them. I'm thinking about the fact that Kay H is there to help. Then I think that of course she would be. I'm standing facing the car that they arrived in. She gets out of the front seat passenger side and walks toward me.
