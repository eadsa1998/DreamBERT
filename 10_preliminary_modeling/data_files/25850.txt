 I'm driving with several other people. We see a moose that hangs out around Fishing Haven, that we have affectionately named Morris the Moose. He has larger antlers than before. I want to take a photograph of him. I click the button on the camera as we move past, kind of in a hurry to get to a good shot of him, but also to stay on the path. The camera didn't focus, I realize. The camera breaks. Something happens to the camera and it rewinds the film. There is a large button to push, like on the toy camera of a child.
