It was the day of my wedding and I was very nervous becauxe I had to go to the church and the dress had not arrived yet. I didn't get to see the dress because it got to be so late that I just put on a red pantsuit and went to the church like that. The church was empty, there was nobody, except him who was waiting at the altar, but I couldn't see his face or if I did see it, I don't know, it was an unknown man. It was horrible. I could feel that the knees of my pants were dirty and each time I wanted to take a step, I couldn't, my legs wouldn't respond, and I had to make a terrific effort. I felt that everything went around and that I was falling off, and I didn't get to the altar.
