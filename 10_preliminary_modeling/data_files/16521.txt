My Creative Writing class was writing a story in Spanish and gave a copy to everybody, and everybody had to make an ending for it. The story was something along the line that there were these two brothers and I think they were friends, and they were like criminals. And they were taking a road trip up to this museum, and I don't think that they were going to steal anything, but they were going to confront somebody. I don't remember anything really about how the story went, but my ending that I was going to add was something like there was a third person that comes out of the woodwork that is the first person's brother and he doesn't know it. And those two were going to conspire to get the person and everything they had, and this guy was going to put butter all over his steering wheel and all over the handle of his gun so that anybody that, any cops that tried to take his car or anything wouldn't be able to keep a hold of the steering wheel. And that was really stupid! That's all I can remember.
