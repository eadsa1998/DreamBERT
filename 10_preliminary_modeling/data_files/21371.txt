It seemed we found a diamond strike and there were a lot of hunters and they were all fighting over the diamonds. It was a continuous fight. There were a couple of small ants or bugs on the table. I hit them with my closed fist and they seemed to just keep on moving. I finally got one sunk into the table by pounding him so, but his feet kept on moving and loosening him from the embeddedness in the wood.
