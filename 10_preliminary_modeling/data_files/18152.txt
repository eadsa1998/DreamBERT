I'm taking this course in drama and it seems I was reading this play, sort of a combination between Ipsen and Strenberg and it was supposed to be sort of a grim play about this man who died and his young daughter about 7 who worshipped him, and how he said all sorts of cruel things before he died, and she's all upset and disillusioned and ruined for life. And about her mother--something sort of strange about her. This is the type of thing that happens fairly often in my dreams. While I knew I was sort of reading this play and actually I was reading a page every so often, I was sort of watching it from this superior position and I was also taking part in it. It seems I was more involved with the mother and this daughter than anybody else. It was strange and hard to remember anyway. It seems the girl was about 17 and she was a very good pianist and she wanted to date these boys that were around the house. It seems strange that even though her father died all these years ago, he was still there. He was dictating should and shouldn't do, telling her she wasn't going to date these boys. But the mother was saying, "I think she should be allowed to date every once in a while." He was being real mean about it. These 3 characters shifted around until they were very like my mother and my father and my sister. I don't know what happened. I think she finally got to date who she wanted to.
