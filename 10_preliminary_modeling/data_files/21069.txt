I was driving at night and we came to a dead end and my car backed into the water. We waded it and Audrey went under water, but I got hold of her and Bob and held them up. Jack Lasko and I ran across the street to beat the oncoming traffic and a cop came after us. Jack started to run, but I didn't because I knew we would get caught for jaywalking. Jack stopped and the cop said $3 apiece, but let us go free after I told him our story. We surrendered to the cop.
