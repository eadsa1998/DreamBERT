A young man and I are running upstairs to our new apartments which are side by side. I am now alone and I see the door to his apartment open. It's #624. I peek around the corner and happily call out to him because I know he's there and I really want to see the apartment. He says, "Come in," and I walk around the corner. I see two rooms separated by a yellow lace curtain hanging on dark beautiful wood round hoops. I see pictures on the wall and furniture in place. The place has a warm lived-in feeling. Very pretty. I think, "How did he do that so fast?" My place is a mess with boxes stacked and nothing unpacked yet.
