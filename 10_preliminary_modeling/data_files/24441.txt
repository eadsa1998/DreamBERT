The dream takes place in Ivy Park. I am in the Army and we are soon to go on patrol. Since it is getting dark I go out to collect some wood for the fire. David B. and I are lying prone in what appears to be a lake. Actually the water is only a few inches deep. He has some sort of explosive charges but no matches with which to light them. I become serious and tell him to keep his voice down and find the matches. At the same time I am aware that something is out of place. The water is not deep. Suddenly we are charged from our right flank. A group of ten or fifteen men with fixed bayonets sallies towards us. They appear to be Oriental, though at the last moment I see that it is all a sham. These are our own men. I have been the object of a great joke. Rolling on the ground, David and I howl with laughter. We begin to sing a popular song. Our harmony and rhythm are surprisingly good.
