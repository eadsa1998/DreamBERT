I was in a place with park benches that had kneeling extensions like church pews. The place was like a park. Some man wanted to buy one of the benches from me. I told him there was one without the kneeling extension in another area. We went to get it. We were in the country of Italy. The buildings were several stories. They were apartments. The outside walls were stucco and painted. We walked through some hallways in some old and dirty apartment buildings. We were on the third floor and came to a window where I usually had to climb to a ledge on a roof to get to the place where we were going. But I discovered that we were at the wrong window. The ledge on the roof was too narrow at this window for us to walk on. So we walked back, and the man said he was going to tell others how poorly the people lived there. I felt indignant, and I had the urge to tell him that not all of the people here live like that.
