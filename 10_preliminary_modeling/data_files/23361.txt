I thought that Mrs. W. (a neighbor not without attractiveness) attempted to kiss me on leaving here after a call. I drew away hastily, which might have been expected to give some offense, but had a different result. With much compassion she asked: "Oh, are your lungs affected?"--to which I guardedly replied, "I have a slight cough." She then expressed great sympathy with me as a prospective victim of tuberculosis.
