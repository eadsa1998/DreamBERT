I was in a crowded store, like a Target or Wal-Mart, in a checkout line. I was a police officer. There were other police officers there as well. Suzanne B was there also, as a police officer. We were all in checkout lines. There was a criminal of some sort loose in the store. I was the first to spot him coming towards us from the right rear. I yelled, there he is and pointed to him. I was talking mostly to Suzanne B because I thought she had a clear shot of him. He was wearing a tan suit, white shirt and a tie. He was a tall man with brown, balding hair and mustache. After I shouted to Suzanne B, everyone dropped to the floor and I tried to crawl under the register counter. I had just gotten under it when the gunman appeared on the floor right next to me. He handed me his gun and told me to keep it on the crowd. As soon as I had the chance, I began taking shots at the criminal. I took a couple of shots and didn't kill him. I then got very scared. As soon as he turned his back, I shot him a couple more times until I was sure he was dead. It felt awful. I was really shaken up by it. Suzanne B and I were at the police department I think yet it also seemed that we were still somehow at the store. We were at our lockers getting changed and talking about what happened. As we were walking out, I was trying to apply lipstick and tried three times before I actually got it to stay on. We ran into the police chief. He wanted to talk to me primarily about the shooting, at least partially to make sure I was okay. I was dressed in a nice dress and high heels and had fixed my hair. He said something about whenever I walk into a room I get men's attention. He said he observes and always sees at least ten heads turn. I'm not sure what this has to do with anything. The last thing I remember is Suzanne B and I walking out of the store.
