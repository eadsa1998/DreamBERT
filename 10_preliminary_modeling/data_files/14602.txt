I was outside a shop. There was a grassy area, but I don't remember a carpark. There was a lady a bit in front of me. There was also a tank or something. It was aiming at her and we both ran and I wondered if it was actually aiming at me or her, but then we realized it was me and she ran off. I was trying to run away from it and it started beeping along with a timer. Then it exploded. Then it was like a second me? It had something to do with Jude Law who was suspected of being involved with this Italian pizza place. This cop went and was asking them questions. I snuck in and heard Jude Law talking to this guy about 'getting it taking care of'. It was then a TV show and the cop was Tony Hale and his character's name was Hale or something. My character was called Izzy, but I was trying to think of a cool last name. For some reason I wanted it starting with a 'T', though I thought of Pritchard, and thought 'no, because it's obviously from Eugene' and Winter. I thought Travers, but I thought it was from a Sims 2 legacy I read and that it was kind of gay.
