There were sets of tables and chairs for the cast of Game of Thrones, then there was a gap and then tables for other people. I was dating Kit Harington so we walked in together and we were at the back with this interviewer guy. Dad had sat down too and tapped Emilia Clarke on the shoulder, saying 'Daenerys' asking her to move. They asked us to move further back because more important people came.
