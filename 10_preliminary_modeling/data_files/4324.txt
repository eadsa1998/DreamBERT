["Gold in them thar hills."] I go outside. A huge mountain erupts up out of a flat field. I go to it and search for gold. I find veins of gold. Lots of it. Then I open the bottom part of the mountain like I would open a cabinet sliding door. There are frozen packets of gold as well as packets of rocks and crystals. I grab up bunches of the ones with gold and rush back to the house to share my great discovery with the family. I lay the packages on the table as they are gathered there for a meal. I smile and wait. Finally someone perhaps mom sees the packages and realizes it is gold. The family is pleased and excited with my find.
