I am driving my bicycle down a country road which is on the way to work, moving very fast as if the bicycle were an automobile instead.  I am not driving too carefully because I am tired, and I think to myself that I should really be going back home instead of to work. Suddenly a small deer -- a fawn -- walks out into the middle of the road as I race past. Then another small deer does the same, and this time I almost hit it. I keep going on and I next see a few more deer which are fully grown standing in the middle of the road. Finally a truly large, obese deer blocks much of the road and I stop. I walk my bicycle onto the sidewalk in order to catch my breath. There is a man standing nearby who admonishes, "Don't ride your bicycle on the sidewalk!" I walk my bike back onto the street, and as I mount it I answer him, "Look, I'm NOT riding on the sidewalk."
