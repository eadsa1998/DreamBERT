I'm by a bay with a cove with rocks to break the big waves of the ocean. I am with Emma's daughter from her first marriage. Then my Bantam hen from when I was 15 years old walks between us and goes into the water. The hen is not brown and tan, but white like a gull. It starts laying eggs--they come out in the tube like the birth sac of dogs and other mammals. A "big" bantam egg comes out. Each after is smaller until the last one is the size of sparrow or hummingbird egg. Emma's daughter disappears and I'm back at home and wonder what to do. I decide to put the largest eggs in box of fluff and an electric light and keep temperature at 110 with a thermometer.
