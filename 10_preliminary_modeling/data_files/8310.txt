I was in the office working with Bill C. We were talking about something very personal. We are now employees at a hospital. He has a discussion with someone about how easy it is for him to access someone else's sperm. So he was going to make sure I got pregnant by someone else's sperm. I had called and was having a fun conversation with him on the phone. He didn't know it was me and was getting a little upset. I finally said, I'm teasing you. It's me. Right after that he tells me that he loves me and that he is perfectly okay with that. I tell him that I love him too. He is in an accident or something and ends up as a patient in the hospital. I was frantically trying to find Bill C. I did find him and he was being treated. He had a tube down his throat, a neck brace, and all kinds of other paraphernalia on and around him. I got as close as I could to his face and spoke to him. He looked at me but couldn't speak because of the tubes and things. Now it seems that instead of Bill C and me it is David Letterman and someone else. There are some other people now and they are conspiring against the woman that David is involved with. David is wearing something that looks like coveralls and lying on a loft type bed. He is lying there with someone else - a woman. Someone has placed them both there as part of a conspiracy. They get into an argument and fall off the bed. They just fall maybe ten feet to another loft bed. The same thing happens again. Now there is a third person lying on the loft bed below them. Now all three of them fall. I think as the top two fall they knock the lower one off. That person falls a far distance and gets seriously hurt. Maybe more than one of them. I'm not sure it is David or not. I'm also somewhat confused, but don't know why, as to whether it is David or if it is Bill C. Next I am with Diane S. I'm trying to make or keep her OK or feel better. We're staying at an event and we know a lot of people at this event.
