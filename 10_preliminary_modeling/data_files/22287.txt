I dreamed that I was going through sad times, that life was sad. I wanted to shout and laugh. I saw myself being chased by someone or something which didn't let me be happy. I never did see monstrous images or apparitions. It was like souls or ghosts which can't be seen or touched, but which one feels are there. It tormented me to think about it, to try to know what it was, what was torturing me, but I didn't find out.
