The fellows were picking on me. They said I was old and they would have an easy time to fight me. I was thinking, "Why should I fight and get beat up?" One heavyset guy was ribbing me so that I started to fight with him and I punched him in the stomach and in the body. He was curling up and didn't have a chance to hit me. He gave up. I was the winner. Ed and Tom Lasko were thinking of me as an old has-been. I told them all I needed was a little practice and I would be fairly good at baseball. I was working at White's on the washer job. It went around and up on a conveyor. I was by Charley C's home. One of his hot water tanks was blocked and getting up pressure in steam. He released the pressure by opening up the valve and letting out the steam and hot water. Some bullets were on a bonfire, and they were exploding. Fisher and I got a card to get a different job. We went by and I wore a cap. I took it off and showed it to Fisher. When we got there, I looked for my transfer or paper for the job and I pulled out money bills out of my pocket and I forgot my card in my other jacket and I also forgot my lunch. There were hillbillies waiting and some of the girls were lying on the floor. I told the man I forgot my card and he said he couldn't give me the job. I asked him if it was alright if I went down and got another card and he wouldn't answer. Then he turned out to be a lady. I was riding a bicycle on the St. Claire sidewalks. It was dark. I parked it and went in to see the Jew who was at the head of the working gang. I asked him how much the pay was and he said it depends on what you are doing, what kind of job. When I came out, my bicycle was a wagon and a horse. Dogs were barking at my horse and he was backing up. I got on the wagon and released the brake. It went back, then I applied it and it didn't hold very good. But I put it on and off.
