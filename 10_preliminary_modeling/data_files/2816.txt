Arvonne is my roommate, assistant and we are preparing for a presentation I will be making, a sort of seminar I am putting on. I look into a shallow fish tank and see a fat little black fish trying desperately to jump out of the tank. I laugh, because he looks so silly and intense. Then I see there is no more water in the tank and furthermore a Siamese cat from the neighborhood is in the tank playing with the fish, getting ready to eat him, when the fun is over. I see the fish's cute face and see the sadness it feels and I feel empathy for it. I get a hose and spray water at the cat to make it get out of the tank, and then, of course, fill up the tank with water, saving the fish. Meanwhile, in my preparations, I feel some anxiety about being properly prepared. I am washing my feet and scrubbing the crud off the sides and toes when co-worker Juliet comes early; I wasn't expecting her. I am pleased and surprised when I see her hairdo, a 1950's bouffant style.
