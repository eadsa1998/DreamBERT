I was at the CAS office. It didn't look the same as it does in waking life. I was near the kitchenette area. There were two jars sitting there. They were clear glass with no labels and with lids. I tried to loosen the lids on each one and couldn't though I didn't try very hard. Bill C walked up just as I began to try so I just asked him to open them. He opened them very easily. I said that I don't usually have difficulty opening jars. Then I wondered why I said that and why it was important and why I didn't try very hard. One jar had lemon drops in it and another jar had hickory nut halves. I took one lemon drop and one hickory nut half and put them both in my mouth at the same time. Bill C walked away while one of us was saying something to the other. In a very short time I put two more lemon drops in my mouth. I was thinking something about him seeing me eat these lemon drops and what he might be thinking about that when I had been doing so good on my weight loss plan last year. It made me uncomfortable for him to see me eating these lemon drops.
