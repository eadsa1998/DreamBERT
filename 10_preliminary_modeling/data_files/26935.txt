 I'm in a Brimson environment. I go to an empty office, with no furniture. It's hot inside, and later it may be cold inside. I'm wearing only a towel around my lower body. I see my advisor Mary Monroe changing her underwear. My professor Everett Klanter is there as well. I may sleep on the floor of this office. Two people make sexual comments. There is a man on a computer. He owes a person money, and is threatened by that man. I'm the person who owes money. I'm near two restaurants: a Pizza hut and a ____. I think of robbing these restaurants to get money. I don't know how much cash I'd get, or if all the customers would be paying with checks or credit cards. I talk to the man that I owe money to on the telephone. He asks me about he money. I don't have the money, but I don't tell him this flat out. I hint at this, and indicate when I may get the money.
