Father Andrew and I are walking in a garden; he is wearing regular clothes and a white trench coat. I say: "Father, how could you stand me in those days, I was so silly!!" He says gently, taking me by the arm, "You were rather cute, and I like you." Walk in garden, arm in arm. Happy! Talk some more about past and faith; then go shopping together; and overcome difficult situations together: at one point: I ski downhill with my shoes only; then go to an art store: I want a particular design -- up high. Father Andrew reaches for it and gives it to me as present: I say "Thank you - I love it." He pays for it and leaves and I go home.
