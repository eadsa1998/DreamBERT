I was at exclusive resort of rich, elegantly-dressed, healthy, handsome people. It was near the sea, I think, but its hedges and cut-grass lawns extended inland for about 5 blocks. It was like a labyrinth. I walked to the far side and found no fence or solid hedge; it was open to ordinary city-dwellers and farms. At this far side was an asylum for the insane. They were mostly very ugly with blank white and pink faces and Mongoloid features--like sharpness of eyes, nose, and cheekbones rubbed out with artgum, like a paperwad or chewed gum--featureless and stupid. But not all. At this far side, normal rich people and insane mingled together in the labyrinthine lawns between 8-foot hedges. I couldn't tell smart from stupid in all cases. But most intelligent and most healthy were obvious and most stupid were obvious. I felt I was among obviously handsome and intelligent ones.
