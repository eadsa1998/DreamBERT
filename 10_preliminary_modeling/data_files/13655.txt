For some reason, Ezra and I were staying at Eugene's. Jeremiah, Eugene and I had been hanging out earlier and had been watching music on TV. They had realized that I liked 'different' music and they suddenly liked me. So, we were staying at Eugene's and his brother Rodney and his father Abraham were there. It was time for bed and I was looking around the house at the photos. I was looking at one of Eugene and I turned around and he was behind me. I said "You're a ninja!" and he laughed. Someone was getting some paint thing. The people doing it accidentally gave them a pool. They were like "What do you think all these colours were for?".
