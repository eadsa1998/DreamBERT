Dad was friends with a gay guy. They worked together. Then Dad was me, and Ezra saw this guy playing poker by himself so Ezra wanted to play with him. He lived next to Mom's. Ezra saw them building a room on the roof and said if they'd got that house, he'd still have the better room. Someone came over to the gay guy's house. He was a gardener. We were outside for quite a while. I was playing Runescape and was killing something and this guy died and when his stuff appeared I tried to take it but I only got this cape, and it wouldn't let me get the rest. I walked away from the area and people were running back for the stuff. I was in this cave which was muddy. These kids were running down steps.
