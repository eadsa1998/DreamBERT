A friend of the family was an accountant. He was caught and charged with tax evasion. But what was bothering was he was sentenced to the electric chair. I found this to be outrageous, and I fought hard to stop him from dying for his crime. I remember there were some people in the dream who believed he shoud be punished harshly for his crime. I thought they were crazy and spoke my mind to them. The outcome was the friend received the death penalty.
