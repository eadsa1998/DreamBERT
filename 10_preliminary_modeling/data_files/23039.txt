I was supposed to leave a party where I was and pick up Daddy at the bus station where he was supposed to arrive from MixJunction at 9:25 p.m.  For one reason or another, though, I couldn't get away as early as I wanted to, and it ended up being 9:15.  My car was parked some distance from the party, so I got a ride with my wife Bonita in a VW bus.  I remember parking on the opposite side (from the party) of a school, but she let me out on the near side, which meant I would have to run all the way to the other side, so I asked her if she would drive me around there.  It plainly irritated her, and by the time she let me out on the other side, we were hardly on speaking terms at all.  I looked up and down the street for a red VW convertible (my sister Nancy's car), but to my frustration all I could see were red Fiats, and a few other cars.  <p
