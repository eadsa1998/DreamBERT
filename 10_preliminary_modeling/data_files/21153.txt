We were at war with the Japanese and I was a soldier. The Japanese were close to our home. I went on guard near the front in a building and you couldn't tell a Japanese from an ordinary man. I stuck up a man with a broom, which was to be my gun. He pulled out a pistol. I looked out the back window and there I saw the Japanese soldiers. I ran out the back way and got home at night. I was in a beer garden. It was loaded with Japanese. I waited by the bar and the Japanese bartender was talking to the Japanese and then I walked out. I saw Kucera out near the door. I motioned for him to come outside. I was going to tell him about the Japanese. We were captured by the Japanese and were going to be executed. They were going to let a baby go, but we two and a white woman were to get executed, but before the Japanese could do that we were rescued and freed by the Americans.
