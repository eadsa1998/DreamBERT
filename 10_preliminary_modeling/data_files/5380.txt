I first dreamed that I was watching an outdoor movie and Ezra was there, lying right next to me. I rested my head on his shoulder, and next thing I know, he is kissing me all over! Then Mrs. Glove walked near us and we went to the athletic center to get away from her. Then I was in a huge house with everyone from school. We were watching a movie and I told one of the freshman boys to sit next to me. I slipped off my seat, and everyone started making fun of me for having big boobs. Then all the girls went to shower, but for some reason, Ben was outside the bathroom, so they couldn't. Cecily couldn't work on yearbook, so she asked me too. Then the Nazis were chasing us and it was horrible. Everyone went on a cycling trip without me, and I was left behind with all the Nazis. Thank god I woke up.
