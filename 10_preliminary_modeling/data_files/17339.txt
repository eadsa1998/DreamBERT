Dreamt of a small area.  Creatures.  In a hole I pulled out a stuffed critter, about the size of a Puffkin.  Black and white face, dark brown body.  Hamster.  I showed my mother on the other side of the little mountain with them, trying to show her how cute it was.  I searched in the hole for the live embodiment.
