It seems I was in some small office. I know I was working there but I don't know exactly what were my duties. I know that there were several other people in the office. After a while we all got tired of working and the boss decided we go out for some coffee. There were enough men in the office for the girls and all of the girls went out of the office with a boy. I know that this place was either in France or in an export house in the U.S. where they spoke French because I was aware that they were speaking French. The other people in the office were the same age as I.
