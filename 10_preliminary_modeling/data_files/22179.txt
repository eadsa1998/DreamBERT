Last night I dreamed I was at a party. I couldn't say where it was because I was there all at once. There wasn't a band, but there was lots of music coming out of everyplace. There were also lots of people. I tried to escape from that crowd and suddenly all the people disappeared, and I found myself dancing with a girl. I hadn't recognized the people who were there, but I did recognize the girl. She studies in my class at the university and is very pretty and has a good figure. I have only a passing acquaintance with her. I would like to know her better, but haven't had the chance to speak with her yet. I danced with her all night and didn't speak one word, and neither did she. We understood each other with our eyes, while the slow and romantic music enveloped us. Suddenly the alarm clock rang and I was sorry to be up.
