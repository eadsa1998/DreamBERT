I was playing Runescape but the effects were really good. They were still stingy, but good for Runescape. It kept changing from real to not real. I was in a new area which was called Garden of something I don't remember. I was doing a quest. There was a video shop and I had to fight this queen. I teleported away and she kept coming after me. At one point I was in Mom's bathroom. The queen and her assistant were fighting me in the hallway. Ezra was there. I needed buckets of flour. I had three, but I needed seven altogether. There was a fridge and a cupboard in this building. I had to stock it and take stuff out. Then I was outside in this park looking place. There were trees and a body of water nearby. There was also a path. There were people there and most of them had been converted to work for the queen. I found these nerds, two of which were Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson. They didn't like the queen and were on my side. The queen took Rachel. People wore gloves to convert. They also weren't allowed to shower or they got killed. I ended up in this lab, which I had the key for and got into another fight with the queen. Teacher-M-04 was around and I was trying to reconvert him. He kept moving away from this table.
