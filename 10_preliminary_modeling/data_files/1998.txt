The house is a mess. If my mother, Lydia and I work together, we could get it all cleaned up. Then I go outside along the road and pick up papers. I throw away toilet paper and gunk. I keep some small bottles and things I think are pretty. I'm going to school. I have my schedule of classes and I look to see what my next class is. It's Hollywood at ll:30. Then it changes to Spectra or something sciency. Now an old man in a car picks me up. He drives us into a building. He has a key that unlocks the door and the elevator. He tells me to pull the key out of the box for him. I think we're in a big Cadillac.
