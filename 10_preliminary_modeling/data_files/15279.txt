I was out the back of the old house with Mom, Ezra and some others. I think Eric (True Blood) was there too. I went to the patio and felt weird and I said to the others I was feeling weird. They came over and someone at the back door was lifted up in the air by an invisible creature. It picked me up too and covered my mouth and nose. Somehow I got inside and locked the door. I was talking to the others and when I went back one of the doors was unlocked. I locked it again. The creature could attach itself to stuff and kept going onto the key and getting side and poking me on the head. I threw the key outside. Mom asked where Cuddles and Gizmo were and they were near the pool. It morphed into a cat and became visible. I went out and threw something at it and it started to disappear, so I grabbed it and put it in the pool. I ran to Cuddles and Gizmo and threw them inside. The creature got on the key again and I got rid of it. Then it was a movie and they brought the key to this house and summoned it and burnt it. They had to choose something and shot at it twice. Someone said not to touch something or you'd get stuck with it again and become 'homeless'. I was then there and accidentally touched it and it showed up again and burnt the house down. A guy stole some secret thing and Anna Torv was undercover laying bricks inside a house. The guy got off to talk on the phone and she stole it. We ran. She unlocked the car for me and I pointed to the guy when she got in. We drove off. There was a Russian lady and she tried to get in the car but I locked it. We drove slowly because we couldn't get the car running properly. Then the lady was actually a good guy and was with a kid, but the kid had died and she was actually a ghost.
