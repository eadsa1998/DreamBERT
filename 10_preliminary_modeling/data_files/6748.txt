Start to walk a piece home up Punohous Hill with Mrs. Bick. (Day before we had been co-hostesses at a tea.) We are stopped at a hotel by a woman. I say that I'll go on further but then Mrs. Bick disappears. The lady is very small and looks if she had been ill. Mrs. A.C.M. comes along, greets her warmly, saying how much better she looks.
