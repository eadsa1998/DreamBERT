I was on a computer and Eugene was next to me. We were all signing up with this site. Bradley finished and I was looking at his profile. I had put my birthday as 1986 and I was thinking that Bradley was fifteen years older. Then I realized my mistake. I first thought that I was 12 and he was 17. Eugene was watching me. There was a quote section and Bradley's had "Izzy!" and there were lots about me. I was thinking 'Great, they have a stupid nickname to diss me with'.
