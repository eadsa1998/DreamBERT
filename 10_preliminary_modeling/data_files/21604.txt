I was working on an acem with Charly Pryhaska. We were turning out big brass pieces. I put some stock away on the public square and went to look for it. I came to a plum tree and ate some plums. I was posing with a girl I didn't like. I had my cheek against hers and the fellow was taking the picture. I was doing some detective work for a woman who wanted to get her husband back home who left. We finally got him home with jealousy. He almost shot the detective. I took the gun away from him and aimed it to be sure to miss his face and fired it to the wall. The white woman turned out to be a colored woman. We were getting her husband back. The colored woman came while I was lying on the bed playing with Judy.
