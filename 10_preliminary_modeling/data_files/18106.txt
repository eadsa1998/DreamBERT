I had a dream last night that I was, it was the first day of middle school and I didn't have my schedule and I didn't know anything and I got lost everywhere. And I skipped a lot of classes because I didn't know where I was going. And so I just followed Rebecca -- she was one of my friends -- and I just followed her everywhere to some of the classes. And I guess no one really cared because I didn't get in any trouble. And it was sort of like also a night school too, and I went to school at night, and there was a movie theater in our school. And it was still middle school, and I still got lost everywhere. And then there was this evil scum with this green thing that was taking over our school, so me, and my friends Ron, Rebecca, Paul, and Yvonne and Marita and Morris -- we all had to go and destroy it. And it was really weird because there was like a deck at our school, and it was storming outside, it was lightning and stuff. And we were, and we killed the evil scum and then it was like sleep-away school kind of because then I went to sleep in a bed, in a really nice bed. It was kind of like a hotel room. And then I sat down in a chair. That's pretty much it.
