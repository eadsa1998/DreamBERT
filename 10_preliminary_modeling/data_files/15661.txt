I was watching Detention 2. It was like a 'choose your own adventure' story. There was a guy that Riley (Detention) liked and a chubby guy that she kind of liked who also liked her. Sometimes Riley was me. I was in a restaurant and I sat down at a dirty table and said that my Dad worked here and organised stuff, and the waitress looked at me impatiently so I just gave her my order. Two guys sat down with me. At some point there was something chasing me somewhere. Every time it ate something or moved, it mutated (sometimes only slightly, other times a massive change). It was huge. It would jump and try to land on me. I had a bow and arrow to attack it with. I ended up at this place which was maybe a school and now Cinderhella was chasing me. I went outside and everything was covered with snow and it was freezing. The cold hit me hard. I was wearing shorts and a shirt and had no shoes on. I found 3 taxis and got into the second one. I was now Riley again and it took her to the guy she liked and he asked her to prom. Then it was 5 months later and Cinderhella attacked her again. Then it went back to the taxis -- the first one would take her to the guy who liked her too and the third had a taxi driver whose family was being taken hostage by Cinderhella and he had to take her to them. Then it was me again and I jumped out and run back to pick another one.
