I was watching a movie. This girl was on her laptop, on the internet, talking to a guy who was going to give her a code for something off a computer. She was a spy and he was as well I guess. He said that it crashed and it showed him with the computer, which had stuffed up. Then it showed a split screen of the girl and the other was a guy at his laptop and they both said "Damn it!" at the same time. What had actually been happening was they were both trying to get the code off each other and the spy guy we saw was just her imagining what was going on. He said to her that he was going to try and get the code back, trying to think what the code could be. He went into his kitchen and this person came in and said "bananas" and then mentioned what they were having for dinner and said "excellent choice" and left. I thought 'maybe that's the code'. Later his mother mentioned it and said "excellent choice" again. He went outside and got in the car and his father was in the back and said "excellent choice" again and then he thought maybe it was the code and went back. Then I was watching Sleepless in Seattle [haven't it seen it yet]. Meg Ryan was crying at a guy (the love interest) and told him to get lost and he said "I'll annoy you with something we both hate", or something which was a friendly joke.
