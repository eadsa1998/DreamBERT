I was supposed to be a cow. I was with another cow and a bull came up and tried to attack us, but we seemed to get away. We watched a dog act. He picked up a dagger and rode on a boy's back. He came at Bob and me and attacked us. I fought with him, got the dagger from him. I was so angry at the dog that I had him down and was going to stab him with the dagger and kill him, then I let him go. Bob and I had a few small cuts on our faces and hands. We went over to see the owner of the dog and let him know. He said, "Why didn't you call the police?" I was at the track. Met Joe G. and a few other boys there. They asked me to look at a race and see which one I would like. Heard Joe say a name he liked to one of the boys. I liked the same one and named it. It seemed to be a long name, but I can't recall it now.
