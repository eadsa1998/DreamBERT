 I go to turn my lamp on. There is a bunch of stuff cluttered around it. I turn the knob, and the power strip that is on my desk crackles. I turn the knob again and the strip bursts into flames. I run out the door, but I can't move fast. I want to get the fir extinguisher. I realize, somewhat, that I am dreaming.
