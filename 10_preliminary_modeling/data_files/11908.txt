I was at this place with a giant Egyptian thing. I've had this dream before with some variations. A guy was looking in this tunnel and said it was going to blow and then I realized I had had this dream before. I said "No, the next piece of paper says it". It did. We all ran into the Sphinx thing and ended up in a creepy cinema. There was a big BANG! No-one in the cinema was moving. I was also in a room with The Ring playing.
