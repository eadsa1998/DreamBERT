I had received the grades for my courses at the university. I was very happy because I had passed all my courses, some with rather low marks. I felt sad to see that my best girlfriend had flunked mathematics. I left the university and went to have lunch at a coffee shop where I stayed until night. Then I walked through unknown streets and wondered about my future.
