I started out shopping in New York City. I met an old friend and we shopped around together. After we were done shopping it seemed as if we were then engaged in a game of pool. He was betting me money left and right over some shots and I was cleaning up. A crowd started to gather as I was making shot after shot. My friend then dropped from the game because he was losing too much money or he quit for other reasons. Then it seems that I was entering the crowd that had gathered to play me. The room was filled with cigar smoke, money was always on the table and I kept on winning. When I finally stopped playing my friend told me that I was playing against some of the roughest boys engaged in the art.
