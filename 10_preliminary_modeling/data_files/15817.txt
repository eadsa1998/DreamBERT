We lived somewhere else, in this apartment building type of thing. A light/mixed Native guy followed me up the stairs. He said he'd show me how to pick the lock of our door. I said to Mom, who was standing nearby, 'he's trying to break in'. He got the first one opened, but nothing with the second. He pulled it off and showed us that the mechanism had broken and wasn't working. He followed me in and kept following me around. Later, there was some kind of family reunion thing happening in another country. Dad, Ezra and I were there. This guy around my age and I were friends since childhood or something and were both very intelligent. He was a scientist-mind. We were in this big warehouse kind of thing and were having some kind of battle (based on what some mysterious person said or something that one of us had to die). We were drinking this potions and growing bigger. Then another potion did something else and made us turn blue. Then he mixed part of a potion with another potion and went red and had fire breath. Then somehow we could just say what we wanted to change and I was like 'bigger' and we slowly got bigger until we went through the ceiling. Then he had claws and all these things, so I just started listing off heaps of stuff while trying to escape his attacks. Then I could think my changes. I ended up going invisible and being able to fly, but because I had so many changes I was heavy and it was difficult to stay up. He went invisible as well, but I made it so I could see him. I got close enough to him to 'switch off' the changes and he turned into a kid again. I said this was stupid and we should stop and he seemed grateful and told me to switch back too, so I went back to a kid as well. And we left laughing that we almost caused a war. Also at some point, Ezra was aged back to a baby? Or was cloned into a baby? He liked giving high-fives, so I was high-fiving him.
