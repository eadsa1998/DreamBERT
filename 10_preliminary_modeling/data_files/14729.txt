I was at the shops and it was night. Mom went in and this guy was being dodgy and we locked the doors. He went to the back and tried to open the door. He waited and then got in when Mom came. He told us to do stuff for him. Then it was True Blood. Bill and Sookie, though not at first, went somewhere. She didn't know he was a vampire and he was old. She worked it out though. I was then there and I was looking for a room and I found one without a bed. Jeffrey Donovan's Twitter was talking about Burn Notice and something about having a lifetime of a "sucky career".
