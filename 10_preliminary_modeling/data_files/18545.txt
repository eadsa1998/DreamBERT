I was working at McDonalds. It was raining and I had to go in at 3 p.m. At 6 p.m. we got a break for 1/2 hour. I was going to run during my bread with the only person I liked at McDonalds. He was an old black fellow. I had skated down the interstate to see where the rain started. On the way I saw a roadside exhibition for the dethroned emperor of China. He had 2 ponytails on top of his head and he was calm. China had killed him. Coming back across the way, I gripped the rocks with my toes. There was squash and corn in the field. The cow was loose and she was nibbling. She preferred the nearly rotted vegetables. I saw the kids on the rocks. They were very happy. I wanted to remember their places. When Maria was unsure what to do, she asked her toy turkey what to do. She laid an egg and Maria cracked it open and it told her what was best. During my 1/2 hour break from McDonalds other workers asked me to go to KFC for them but, no, I was going to run.
