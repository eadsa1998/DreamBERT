My dream took place at the university, where a show was being put on. I arrived, because I wanted to see my boyfriend who was going to sing and play with a group of boys and girls from the class. His ex-girlfriend also sang with the group and when she saw me, she kept looking at me with anger and observing how he (Emile, age 20) greeted me. He greeted me lovingly. I also met my classmates and we went to the auditorium. While he was waiting to go on, Emile came to my side and hugged me, while she (Alice) kept looking at us out of the corner of her eye. She went to sit next to the sister of a classmate whom I had met for the first time and who was looking at me; she asked Alice who I was and was told that I had taken away her boyfriend. She came over to tell me, and he defended me and told her that he had never loved her, and that she was just chasing him. And he said that he was going to marry me and told her not to bother us because he didn't want to argue with me on account of her. I don't remember any more.
