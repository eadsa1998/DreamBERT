All I remember is a fragment - I was looking on at myself - that is, I knew I was dreaming a dream in which I was participant. The scene was a bare hospital ward--my younger brother was lying on a high wheeled hospital cot under an oxygen tent--terribly thin &amp; with his face all eyes and shadows, &amp; trying to smile while I read to him.
