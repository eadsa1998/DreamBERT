I dreamed of strings of light bulbs - Christmas tree bulbs of multi colors - all following one another about in the darkness. The lights circled wildly in the air - and since the confusion of colors annoyed me - the strings obligingly similar - all one green string and all one yellow, etc. I loved watching. Sometimes they seemed to be on a merry-go-round - and you couldn't see the ponies, but just the lights going around. Other time9 the light9 were on a Christmas tree and the strings proceeded (gaily ?) up and do~n the branches.
