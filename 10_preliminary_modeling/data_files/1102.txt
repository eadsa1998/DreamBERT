American has purchased reclaimed land from the sea. It ranges from Alaska to the tip of South America on the Pacific Ocean side. It's called "Tilla Lilly." I see a picture of it. It's bigger than Texas and Alaska combined! Much bigger! I am impressed. Then I say, "But oh, now the shape of the U.S. is changed to a square, I mean an oblong. How sad."
