I was in my hometown just opposite the college. I had the job of picking up trash in small van and driving over mountain path. Woman and two daughters to go with me--sex hinted at in dream at least in "infatuated air" of my brain. She didn't show up and I didn't want to go with two daughters alone. So I took off fast and headed for mountain path, afraid vehicle would turn over or hit a tree or big rock.
