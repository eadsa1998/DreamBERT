Someone is trying to kill me. I was in my house and it actually looked like my house did about 7or 8 years ago. In the dream I wake up, realized there were people trying to break into my house. I ran around locking all the doors and windows. It was morning, I was alone. Suddenly I remember a door I had forgotten to lock, but as I went to lock it, the 'bad' guys were already coming in. They were male, ages 25-35, about 3 or 4 of them, dressed all in black with burglar masks on. I knew immediately that they were there to kill me, in particular, not to rob the house. I ran into my parents' room and locked the door, then tried to climb out the window, but there was a man standing guard outside, he didn't see me (it's on the 2nd story), so I edged along the trim of the house, jumped down around the corner from the ground and ran to my neighbors' house. I pounded on the door, they let me in, I told them to lock the door and call the police, but as the door was closing, the murderers burst in and started chasing me. I hid in a pile of clothes. They almost found me, but in the end didn't.
