 I get a ride to Grocery Getto with my neighbors Wilma and Glen Stein. I go into the store quickly to do my business and come out for them to pick me up. I walk down towards the north end of the store but don't see their car. There may be an entrance/exit on the north side of the store. I notice their car down near the gas station, and I walk there. I may be pushing two grocery carts, one inside the other. The Stein's are driving a big white car with a red felt interior. I park the carts and climb in the back seat on the passenger side. The front passenger seat is pushed all the way back. I don't have much legroom. The car is a Cadillac. The interior is very smooth. As we drive home Wilma says that my brother Wally and I will have to pay attention to the dog that is begin let out now, when we drive through the alley. We drive up the alley from the south and talk about driving on the different ends of the alley. Gary says his car bottoms-out when he goes down the hill at the north end. I say that usually ____ (my dad?) takes the flat, south stretch of the alley. We get near their house. We're driving really close to the house, not in the alley. I don't think Gary will be able to pull his car into the space in his driveway between two other cars that are parked there, but he does. I comment on their car: it must ride nice on the highway going 80 miles per hour. Gary talks about how he is glad he got the car because of his involvement in the gulf war. I get out of the car and notice the Wilma has lost a good amount of weight. We walk towards the alley and she tells me that it is the red house that has the dog to let out now, and it is a black lab puppy that weights 80 pounds.
