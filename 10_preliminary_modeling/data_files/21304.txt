I went to the cemetery to see where my unseen son was buried. He was supposed to be a horrid monster when he was born, so the doctor took care of him. I saw his grave only and he inscription on the stone was a monster. I performed a bold act with a tiger. I commanded him to do my bidding and he did it and I passed the test. There were three tiger cubs that we worked with to pass the test.
