Calvin, Mariah, Genevieve and others were doing a project for media. They had fully done up this place to be the setting. I asked if it was a big project and told them it was a waste of time if it was only a small one. Darren was there too. I was then at this house and Ramona was there. We went out the back and I was talking to her. Dad was there.
