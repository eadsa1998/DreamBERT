I dreamt that I was with Susan, a friend of mine, and two more girls, in Susan's house getting ready for a trip. But Susan's house was not her real house but rather an unknown one, an apartment. We were packing. In the bathroom of Susie's supposed house there was a little window that led to a skylight and through there I had thrown a palate (false) that I wear to fix my teeth. I was waiting for Susie's mother, who was going to bring us some shoes, rather old ones, that she was asking somebody to give to us, so that we could take them on the trip and not ruin our good shoes. Susie's mother, in the dream, was the complete opposite to what she really is. She was fat, tall, and dark, and Susie's mother is thin, like all Chinese, and therefore she couldn't be dark. In the bathroom, where I was putting make-up on, somebody handed me the palate I had thrown through the skylight, and threw it out again through the same skylight, and after a while, they gave it back to me and so it went on.
