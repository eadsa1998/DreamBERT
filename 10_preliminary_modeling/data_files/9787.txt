Wally and Charlie (his friend) are learning tumbling stunts: Wally falls from a high place - is dead. He looks like a doll 6' long; arm limp. I run to Father Andrew, and kneel before him; "He is dead, and I loved him so...." Father Andrew gently puts his hand on my head and says, "What if you hadn't dedicated him"... referring to recent ceremony of dedication; feel happier.
