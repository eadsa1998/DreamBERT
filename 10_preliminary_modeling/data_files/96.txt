I'm in a strange sort of car with a guy (can't place him) - I'm not aware of either of us driving but we are moving. It's begun to rain cats and dogs, and I think how clever it would be to wash the car now. I guess we go under things from time to time, and I try to get the soap on the car (by hoisting meself partly through the back window) before we come back out into the rain. Doesn't work, but it's fun.
