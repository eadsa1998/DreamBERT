I am at the farm with Dad, my oldest sister, and my middle sister.  We are walking up the hill that goes to the shed.  My middle sister is behind Dad, and I am in front, but I am looking behind me, watching them.  It is dark out, late night.  I see my middle sister pick up a folding chair, raise it up over her head, as if to hit Dad.  I am not sure what she is doing, so I hesitate.  Then it becomes clearer she is moving to hit Dad with the chair, and then she actually does pretend to hit Dad with it, swinging it by his head.  I think she even made some sound effects or a face in her pretend hit.  I lunge for the chair in defense.  I say to her, "that was a really stupid thing to do.  If someone thought you were serious, they'd hurt you back."  Also earlier this night I dreamed I needed a place to live, looking for a house.  I see a room in a house - it has no windows, none.  I am reminded of Tony C's room in Moab.  It would be like a prison cell in that room, but, after much stewing and hesitation, I decide to live there in that room.  It is not even a whole house.
