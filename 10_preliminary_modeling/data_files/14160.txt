I was at school. I was naked except I was wearing undies. My hair wasn't straight but was tied back. Elijah was following me around. I called Calvin and he turned up with Dmitri. I was trying to get out. I ended up in Northtown but it was different. I called Mom to get me. It was night. I got to a cheesecake shop and they gave me the uniform of "Big Jimmy" to wear. I was driving a car and the police drove past and then saw them behind me. I got out of the car and ran but they didn't do anything. Big Jimmy and his father were walking on the street. I gave them the uniform. He had been in love with Sookie (True Blood) and had a picture of her with vampire bites which had upset him. He had a torn up teddy bear that said "first love" on it.
