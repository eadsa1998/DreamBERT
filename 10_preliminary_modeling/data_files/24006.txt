I was on vacation with my parents and I met this guy. He was with a male friend who was always just kind of there. I think they were about my age, like 14 or 15. I fell in love with this guy. We kissed and stuff. I just couldn't stand being away from him. Then at the end, I just remember him and his friend leaving in a van. I ran to say goodbye to him, and he yelled to me that he loved me. Then I was overcome with sadness because he left, but I had a feeling I would see him again.
