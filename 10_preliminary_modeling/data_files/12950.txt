I was at school. I was talking to Madelyn about me having a test. Autumn came past and I asked her "what test?". She said we had a Physics test. Her two front teeth were missing and I was like 'what the hell?'. Later, I was at the bench with Calvin and Evelyn. Then I was in a classroom. Eugene and Darius were playing this game. First they put pillows everywhere. Eugene came close to me so I put my foot near his to see what shoe size he was. I was trying to hide my sock from him. I wanted to text Mom to pick me up but I didn't have any credit.
