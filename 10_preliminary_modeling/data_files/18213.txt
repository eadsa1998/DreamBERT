My husband, my daughter, and I were going on a trip somewhere, and I was with my daughter alone in some strange part of the country, perhaps somewhere in the mountains, on this little dirt road and it was late in the afternoon, getting close to night and my husband wasn't there yet. He had the car, and he was supposed to be there. So I left my daughter beside this road. There were a few houses on it, and there was a big sort of swampy place off to one side, and started walking off down the road toward the highway which was at some distance and I kept meeting cars and people along the way. Finally got down to the highway and it was practically night by this time and saw him in a car which wasn't ours. Apparently we had just bought this new car and it was big and sort of goldy brown and sort of ostentatious and there he was sitting beside the car. I asked him why he hadn't called us. Why he hadn't come. He said because he was very sick with something. I got mad about it because every time we got some place he gets sick and I said, "Come on, let's go back to our daughter because I just left her beside the road there." He got real upset at this and I got upset because I thought what in the world did I just leave her there for and I said we'll go. I'll take you to the hospital because he had some kind of spots all over his face, like some sort of contagious disease and so we hurried back down the road calling our daughter, getting more and more upset all the time. Finally I saw something beside the road and I told my husband to stop and I got out and it was our daughter and she had been run over and she was dead. I started calling. There were houses all around. They had their porch lights on and I started calling for somebody to help us, and there was nobody around. It was a real terrible dream, and I couldn't understand why I would have gone away and just left my daughter there, but I had.
