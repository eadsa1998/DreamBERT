I am in this small family resource library and researching and getting some information about creativity and dreams and I was going through the books and I found that a great many of them were my own handwritten dream books. And papers I had given them and so on of my own material. which I left on the shelf and pretty soon I looked and saw I had a pretty long pile of interesting books I wanted to look at. But now there used to be a whole bunch of books left on these shelves and now there's practically none and I know I hadn't taken away that many and I couldn't figure out what happened to the books. Meanwhile, I noticed that the shelves were on an old fold up bed and it was in terrible shape and patches of maggots and rotten material and a box of old clothes I had donated thinking so homeless people could use them, but they are just sitting there, pretty ugly and smelly. I decide to clean this stuiff up and I find a broom and a garbage can and I am scooping up masses of steamy smelly maggots and carrying these things over to the garbage can and so on and I'm trying to get things cleaned up and finally I get some other people interested and we decide we are going to throw away the old bed and the old clothes and get things cleaned up and dusted up and make it more useful.
