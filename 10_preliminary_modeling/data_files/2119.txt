Nate is trying to kiss me and I push him away because Dovre is around and I don't want her to know of our relationship. I look out the window and see Dovre/Lydia driving an 8-wheeler truck. She has permitted the small children and Charla to sit on the back fender. I an very concerned. Charla will let go and fall. I worry and try to wave to Dovre not to let this happen. The truck starts, and sure enough Charla doesn't pay attention to her danger and lets go and is bounced off. I run to her and pick her up, relieved to see she is alive, but hurting to see the huge bump and cut on the back of her head. I hold her and soothe her as she cries. Then Nate runs up and tries to kiss me. My mother is there and frowning. I say to her, "Ah, he is the video repair man." To Nate I say, "See you tomorrow when you come to fix the video." He leaves. My father tells me I owe him $232.00 he lent me to fix the video. I feel downhearted because I remember I also owe someone $152. Too much debt. I see a package Nate left and open it. There are miniature rifles in it. I choose a pen to write up my list of debts. It's a calligraphy pen that occasionally writes in red.
