I dreamed about two old friends- actually one of them was Rhonda when I thought she was Kim. She was at my house. I don't remember if I asked her to come over, or if she was just there. We went up to my bedroom, and were looking out the window. I asked her if she wanted to go for a walk, and she said "sure". Then I asked her if I should ask Gail to come- Kim's friend, but the one I really had a crush on. She said she'd rather I didn't call her, so I decided to just go along with Rhonda (aka Kim).
