Eating in a back hallway - Jimmy comes along and orders big meal - when it comes on huge tray, waiter knocks off something of mine and one of J's plates slides off. As I pick mine up it sticks in cheese and nearly pulls J's steak onto floor - it barely goes on again. Get everything right and J's asking if he can get new steak - several little tables involved with drop leaves and no shelves.
