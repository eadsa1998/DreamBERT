I was at school. We had an excursion but Autumn and I had finished the work so we got sent next door to this church place which was a big class. I sat next to Autumn who sat in a row with Darius and Jeremiah. Bradley was in the row behind and Eugene was on the side of the class doing private study. The class was all to do with puzzles and stuff. Then it got confusing and Theodore was in a movie called Elijah. The teacher was talking about something and they paired me and Eugene together for a question and everyone thought it was funny. Then it was in a movie and Eugene was going to kiss this other girl so that people would stop saying stuff about us but then he was Theodore again and he kissed some girl. Then Darius was annoying me. I complained and said to someone that they "should advise them that I'll kill them". We were then in a little class and we had to sign our names and the teacher said it looked like something. The class was sport but Darius never did it and I didn't either. Then I was at some place with Indians and they were doing a dance or something. I took photos. Then it was lunch and I was late to the common room because my leg was hurting. I asked Evelyn if it looked odd.
