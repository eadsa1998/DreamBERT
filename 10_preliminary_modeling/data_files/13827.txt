I went to school, which was different, for an exam. I also tried to get my leavers jacket. I went to Mr Billings and he said something that meant I couldn't get it yet. I was sitting at a desk with Autumn, who was next to Alyssa. Autumn was talking about the Grand Exchange on Runescape and I said that I liked it. The exam was in a big room with steps and everyone sat along the steps and it was packed. Elijah was at the exam. I thought it was Accounting so I text Mom to bring my chemistry notes. She got there but then I realized it was the chemistry exam and tried to get rid of her, but she insisted upon giving me the notes. Finally, the exam started, but they had given me and Autumn a year 7 exam, so they took it and gave us the proper one. But we had to get these tube things and they only had munted ones left. I said "what do we even need these for?" and the guy said to get everyone out of the building and told this kid to blow this horn thing and everyone ran out silently. This lady said we didn't have to do the exam.
