We were at some theme park like Disneyland or Six Flags, but I couldn't figure out which. And for some reason we were with Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce. And Dad was showing me this ride that was like a race car and he said that if it was going to go on a roller coaster, it had to have three seat belts for the same passenger, one that goes on top of another. And they had to wrap around the front seat and go in the back seat so that they could be for two passengers. And all of this looked really scary, and I noticed that this car had something in it that most race cars don't have, which is in the audio system. And then we were looking around at some other different rides and seeing how wild they were, and we figured, "Hey, let's go on this conveyor belt through this place." And it was like a building with a couple of different things in it. And we went, we jumped on the conveyor belt and we saw this monster just running across it. I started running too and I couldn't figure out why we were running. And then we were at this show watching the Little Mermaid swim around this fish aquarium tank. It was supposed to be like she was singing a song, but we all know she wasn't singing in the water.
