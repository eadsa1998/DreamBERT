On a long trip back to M. City from Maine; we have to WAIT for the train; I see an engine and 2 box cars; there is much switching back and forth and we finally get on a coach that has open windows and folding chairs like at church dinners; it is very crowded; we sit at a long table facing each other; Frank starts flirting with a woman with dark hair; and I bop him on the head with my duffel bag.
