I dreamt I was at the university with everybody and that they were going to give a party for me and I felt happy. Freddie (my ex-boyfriend) was looking for my friendship, but I didn't want to and Charlie (a friend) was telling me that I should accept him, and I threw him a notebook and with that, I awoke.
