Mother and Daddy were building a new home. The house was an L-shape. The bottom of the L was to the right of the house it came out to the front and that's where the garage was. It had double garage doors, on the left side of the L. You had to pull across the front of the house to pull into the garage. Very odd. I was inside the new part of the house with Brian F, I think. It was framed. I think they were starting to work on the kitchen. I was talking about when they were going to move in. It seems that the new house was on the same property as the current house so they were going to move in one room at a time. As one room was finished they were going to move in to it. So they were moving into the kitchen first. They were using some of the kitchen cabinets from the current house in the new house. Brian F was talking about being excited about moving in. I made the comment that I had no intention of moving in this new house. He was put off by this and didn't understand. I'm not sure why I was so adamant about not moving in this new house.
