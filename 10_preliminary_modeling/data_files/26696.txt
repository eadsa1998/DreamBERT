 I'm at Armstrong High School standing in line for a school lunch, in the hamburger/pizza line. When I am next to be served the lunch lady begins to serve people in line after me: she serves several Asian students and then a mentally retarded student. I wait, trying to be patient and pleasant, saying nothing. The lunch lady then serves me a rectangular slice of greasy pizza, with crumbled beef in it. I also get a slice of white bread. I take my yellow tray to the line. I stop to take a blue carton of skim milk from the large white cooler. As I do this I see my grade school classmate Tim Nimen. He is tall, with longer, brown straight hair. He says, "Hey!..." I say, "Hi Tim", in a very reserved manner, and continue on. My lunch is rather small, I think, but I'll eat it. I walk out to the cashier. There is some chaos near the cashier: several people are there just standing around. The cashier is attending to something else. I stand there a bit. Since there's no one to pay, I think of punching my own lunch ticket. I don't have a token. I turn and face the commons to go eat. Immediately many people surround me, talking to me, and shouting out. They make a big deal that I'm back. I recognize many faces: My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles, a guy named Brice or Brady, and many others. I sit down and others join me. Sonya is on my left. She comments on something to do with her breasts: how she will never do that again, implying changing her breasts. While she says this she lightly pounds her chest, one breast with each fist. I understand her to be saying that she's content with small breasts. She takes the middle of my piece of bread sneakily. When I see this I quickly eat the rest of my lunch, because it's small. I wiggle my front lower right tooth. I think I should drink a few more cartons of chocolate milk, for the calcium. The milk I had with my lunch was chocolate, though it was skim when I took it.
