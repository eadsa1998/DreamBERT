In a hotel room with Lori and a woman she's recently met - Lori is wanting to work with her on something, but she's rather suspicious that she may not be what she seems. The woman is (or seems) larger and more powerful than us, and while she seems nice enough, there's a definite detachment there. I've just come to tell Lori I think this woman is dealing drugs and is going to get her involved with it. [I don't remember now how I found this out.] I arrive, we all chat for a bit, and I'm impatient because I'm sure she's going to find me out soon [someone else is coming? or a phone call?] and she may be hostile if she finds out. Shortly she has an errand outside, like taking out the trash or something, and I seize the opportunity. I tell Lori what I know, and while there is still some doubt in the matter it seems most prudent to get out now. We have to grab Lori's things fast (she's been staying here for a while - I don't know if it was meant to be permanent) and duck out the front door to the elevator. It's slow, and we get anxious, but it comes and we hustle into it, still clutching all this stuff with sleeves and things sticking out. Now we're inside we can pack it up a bit better. This elevator is actually a little room - there are tables and chairs and lamps, and a window to the outside (it's night, and you can see a bit of the city - we must be on the 10th floor or so), and there are other people in here - it's a bit like a waiting room. I wave Lori to a seat and I take another.
