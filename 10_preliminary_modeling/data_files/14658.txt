I was watching a movie with Robert Downey Jr in it. First, we had gone to some restaurant thing. I was wearing my normal clothes which usually wouldn't be allowed in because they were too casual, but I was let in anyway. Mom and I were at the shop later, where the restaurant was. I couldn't get into it without at least jeans. I needed to get shoes too. Only one shop was open and it only sold girls clothes. We grabbed a pair of black sneakers and we had a look at jeans and Mom said they were gay. We tried to get into a bigger shop. Then it was the movie again. I can't remember it properly, but Robert Downey Jr had been taken by this woman. He had escaped. Then I was talking in a stairwell and I remembered them mentioning an echo and I found them. I told Mom about him going for dinner with his "wife and son", who were both different and his son was like 3 years old.
