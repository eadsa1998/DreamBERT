It's hard to recall now. I was with a friend, and we were walking around an unknown city. People kept asking me "what I was wearing," and Charla walked up to me and asked where I had gotten my CDs. One was Fugees. My friend and I kept passing this movie theater, and I knew it was a dream because I couldn't read anything. A bunch of people walked out because the animated characters moved throughout the building. I saw this incredibly good-looking guy with a silver, a gold and a blue lip stud. He went inside, but my friend said he'd meet me behind the gold curtain. When I went there, there were naked people changing. The guy at the counter said I had a phone call, but we got disconnected. Setting: A strange city, and mostly in and around a movie theater. Characters: I think the friend was Leah, one of my classmates. Carla is my music/drama/dance teacher. I don't know the cute guy, but he was older, 15 or 16. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad, popular and confident. The curtains were the same colors as the studs. Last night, I was online and someone sent me a message saying they lived in Foster City and were interested in me, but we got disconnected. My friend and I talked about lip pierces yesterday. Also, both in the dream and yesterday, my friend was pressuring me to tell this guy I really like him.
