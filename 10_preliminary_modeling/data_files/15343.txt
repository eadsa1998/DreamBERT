It was Winter Veil on World of Warcraft, but it was different. I was in this white area was covered with snow. There were lots of quests and for the one that I was doing I had to get five out of five different things. There was a mini quest where I needed four of each. There were polar bears to loot. There was something with black eyes and I ran off. Some lady had been attacked by something. Mom and Darren were at home and I was worried they were going around to houses to attack people.
