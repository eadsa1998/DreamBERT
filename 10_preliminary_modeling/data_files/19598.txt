On the diner of a train the porter asks a lady whether she has heard the joke about the lady who didn't want any coffee because she was going to have tea. Apparently this same joke, though in the form of a conundrum, was asked me by Chester. Anderson immediately saw the point, but I didn't, and I decided it was one of those absolutely pointless jokes; and I asked Chester to keep such witless things to himself.
