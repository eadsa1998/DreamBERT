Another dream leaving me sad.  I was watching someone's pet bird.  In front of my parent's house, somehow I lost it.  I went into the house distressed for a while.  Finally while talking to my mother I saw a bird in front of the house perching on a cane somehow standing up in the walkway and remembered what it was I was so upset about.  I went out and held out my hand, and the bird landed on it.  I guess nobody around knew what had gone on because I figured they were all surprised of the bird landing on my hand.  I still woke up sad, though.
