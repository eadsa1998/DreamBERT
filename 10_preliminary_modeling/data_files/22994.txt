I was shaving absentmindedly with an electric razor.  I started just under my left sideburn and had shaved away part of my beard before I realized what I was doing.  So I sculptured it into some original shape, and then for some reason I cut my hair very short on top -- almost shaved -- but left it long on the sides and in back, and it was much longer than in real life.  I also tried on several long-haired wigs, some of which I liked.
