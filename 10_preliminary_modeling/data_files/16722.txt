The first thing I remember is being on another school trip, bringing about 3 or 4 bags of luggage, and forgetting it in the hotel. I also lost my CD's. I thought someone took them and threw them somewhere because they didn't like the bands that I listened to. There were a lot of CD's lying around, but none of them were mine. Then, I realized all my CD's were in the case in my pocket.
