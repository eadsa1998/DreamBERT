I arrive in Vienna by train; I am very careful to hold onto my photos--slight confusion--remember walking the length of the train! --Home: we live on top floor of the house: very carefully store food and things; then go a floor below and hear the wind roar: see things smashed, hear roar of wind and see potatoes and fences and things thrown down smashed... scared.
