I was at someone's home. They were having a party. I think it might have been a relative. I wasn't invited but it didn't bother me at all. I went upstairs, but had to step around food sitting on the steps. I thought I should go offer to help with the party prep. That it would be the right thing to do. People were beginning to arrive. They were talking about Suzie G's meringue. It was in a huge, trash-bag-size pastry bag. Later I went into the kitchen and Suzie was there. Something had happened to her meringue. It was out of the bag, in the sink, and piled high above the top of the sink. I told her I had eggs for her to make more.
