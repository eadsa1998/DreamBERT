At a church dinner, very formal; Then I go to baby sit for a friend, but her baby is messy and pees on my hand when I change its diaper. I am exasperated. Frank comes home late and does not explain. I am worried he had an accident, but he wont talk. I get angry at him and say: "Some day you are going to be found out and judged." With Father Andrew and Marissa; he is writing and drawing a beautiful boat; she smiles contentedly. We both say: "How beautiful" the drawing is.
