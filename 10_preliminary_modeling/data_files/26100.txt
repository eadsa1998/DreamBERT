 I see my ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter. She says to me, "Hey, weren't you chasing after me for a week at the beginning of last year?" Something may be said or implied regarding the letter I wrote to her ending our relationship, how it was broken off, and something may be said or implied about my roommate Stephen Ramos. I'm taken back when she says this, and feel that I need to clarify or assert that yes, I did pursue her last year (it was actually the end not the beginning of the school year), but I am not going to this year. She says this with a bit of cunningness and manipulation, as if it is a blackmail or threat to get me to change my ways.
