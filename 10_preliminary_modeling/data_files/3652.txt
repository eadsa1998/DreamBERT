Sharon L is teaching me to play a saxophone. At first I am terrible, with squeaks and noises, but with constant practice, I become very good. I am a man and on a stage. The audience is sparse and not too interested, but as I practice, the audience gets bigger and more interested. I decide to do a comedy act with the sax. The stage is very high. I see a paper with an article about 5th and 6th grade students and how as an audience they are disdainful and rude. They wander around and ignore and make noises talking among themselves. By now I am quite good and the audience is thick and attentive but very far away, and the stage is so very high. Now I have an orchestra of sorts with maybe five violins. I decide to expand and play the blues fiddle as well. I see Curtis Salgodo in the crowd and ask him to join me onstage playing the cello. We improvise. The music is very good. I'm thinking of learning the blues harp as well. Now the audience is also on the stage in raised seating behind me. I have only a narrow strip of stage to work on. I nearly fall off the front of the stage and get a dizzy sense of vertigo whenever I get close to the edge of the stage. I'm playing well and the audience is attentive, but distant.
