I was on the net and had a message from a guy about a post I'd made on the Red Dwarf forum about my desk, which was written rather oddly, and my preferring movies over TV shows. He said he knew a guy called Doug who knew where to find Top 250 movies. On Red Dwarf, some guy liked to sleep in Lister's bed at night. Lister found him and was like 'what the hell are you doing?!'
