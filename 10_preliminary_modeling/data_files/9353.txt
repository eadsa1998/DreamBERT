There are two actresses. One resembles Marlena Dietrich. She is haughty and will not stay in a room near the stage. She wants best hotel in town. The other actress, like Simone Signoret, is willing to stay anywhere we want to put her. I look in Dickens novels for a room and realize I cannot find it there and we laugh at my error.
