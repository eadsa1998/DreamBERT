 I'm fishing with my coworkers Sean Williams and Tom and my boss Mike Hollow. Sean catches a nice walleye: about two pounds. I'm trying to hook up my lindy rig but I keep making mistakes. I have a huge white jig on, which is five or six inches long. The jig is like a Mister Twister, and my line from the barrel swivel is only four inches long. I see and point out a cow moose with triplet calves. Sean back trolls with the boat so we can all see them, even though Mike thinks we are close enough. The moose blend in very well with the forest: they are tan and white colored. We're near a narrow channel that looks good for fishing. Tom hooks a fish, and it nearly pulls him in the water twice! His tackle box falls in the water. He lands a huge walleye, one of four on his stringer! He lifts the stringer out of the water. I'm still not ready to fish, rigging up my line.
