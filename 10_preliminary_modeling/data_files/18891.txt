I remember that I was riding a bicycle, an English racer with thin tires. It was black. I remember that the back tire was out of air and I wanted to get it fixed. Then my mother drove up in a car and I got into the back and hauled my bike in with me. I told her to drop me off at a place where I could get it fixed, because I had to be someplace at a certain time (I can't recall where now), but she didn't drop me off. She went grocery shopping and I had to stay with her because the bike had a flat. I remember waiting in the car while she shopped. I was very angry because she didn't drop me off to get my bike fixed, and I thought that I was going to be late to where I was going. Finally she dropped me off at what looked like a large, open parking lot with grass on it. It reminded me of the parking lot at Miami Stadium. That is the last I recall.
