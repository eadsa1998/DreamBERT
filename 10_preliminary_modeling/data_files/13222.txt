I wrote a story which was Naked Lunch 2. Mom took me to Dad and I asked him to type it up for me. It was only 133 words (but not really). I was talking to David Lynch later, and I was going to tell him about it, but then remembered that it was David Cronenberg that did Naked Lunch. I almost tripped downstairs. I was thinking that it was my NaNoWriMo novel, but then I remembered that I was doing Battle Royale and it wasn't November.
