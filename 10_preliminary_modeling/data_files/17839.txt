My boyfriend Jeremy and I were in a large house.  I was upstairs in the bathroom. As I sat on the toilet, a computer screen to the left of me appeared to 'crash' (but was an illusion, did not actually).  I came down the stairs.  The carpet was blue.  Jeremy and I were alone, so I jokingly offered him sex.  I made some comment about having to wait 30 days, while he only had to wait 20.  He said something to the effect of, "okay, we'll break up then."  He was sort of joking and nonchalant.  I said okay, unaffected.  Then Michael Jordan arrived with two small terrier-like dogs.  One had some sort of plastic muzzle shaped like an anteater snout.  I was squatting and leaning against a wall.  Michael said something about his Asian wife having trouble losing a psych job because the company was racist.  I related to him my experience at the detox facility.  I reached to pet one of his dogs and he warned me not to, that they would bite.  His wife showed up and he left.  Then my mother brought in two new dishes from a coworker(?).  Cannolis and a taro dish.  They were delicious.  There was going to be a party.  Someone helped me pretty up- put on makeup and a necklace.  I wore a sparkly blue dress.  I was happy about the way I looked, and excited about the potential to meet someone at the party since Jeremy and I had broken up.  I was ready and descended two flights of stairs, only to have to ascend another flight to go to the women's room (even though it was a house(?)).  I complained it was unfair in high heels.  I went back to get another cannoli.  There were tiny spiders on it.  I tried to smash them, and I pinned a larger one in the process.  It started talking to me.  I was disgusted.  Somehow could not press hard enough to kill it.  My thumb hurt, I was weak.  I woke up with an itchy pain in my right heel.
