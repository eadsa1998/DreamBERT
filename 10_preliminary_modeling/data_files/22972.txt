I was taking a test in Miss Sherilley's English class.  It was in a big, dark study, with a long table in the middle.  Lori Payneter was taking the test too, but she finished sometime before I did.  I had been working on it for a long time, and was despairing of ever finishing.  The first two questions were more or less factual, but the other two were of the type, "Entertain me by relating...."  I was frustrated because I knew I could not use the colorful language, metaphors, etc., that she wanted-my narrative would be dull and factual.  This anxiety was reinforced when Miss Sherilley read me part of one of Lori's answers which used the phrase "wooden tomatoes."  It was just the kind of original phrase that I wanted to be able to come up with.  I'm not sure that I knew what it meant, but it seemed catchy and interesting, and that was the important thing.
