I dreamed that I was watching some sort of group dancing on a large green lawn. The girls wore old-fashioned, brightly colored costumes and appeared to dance in pin-wheel formation. The day was very warm and sunny, and toward the end the dancers seemed to be slightly fatigued--their formations were not as precise and they became more jolly and boisterous. There seemed to be a large group of spectators in a grandstand watching the performance; I was watching also, but I was along the side somewhere.
