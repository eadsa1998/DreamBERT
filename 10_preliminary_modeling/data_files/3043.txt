I am given the job of working a "board" sort of like at Ellie's radio station, or like a switch board. I don't get much training and I'm trying to remember the sequences. A small red light comes on and it is labeled star. I know this is a "star" message and it is important to hear it. I push some buttons hoping that would work, but it doesn't. I keep trying different sequences and objects. I remember I first have to pick up a bottle labeled "star" and put some of that substance in something. I look for the bottle. I find lots of different ones but not the right one. Red Buttons walks in and I want to talk with him. I enjoy his company but I must first finish what I'm doing. I say to him, "I'm sorry, but I'm new at this job and I have to find the star." He says "OK, but it looks like they didn't give you much training." I say, "No, only a few hours before I took over." He says, "You shouldn't have accepted that." I feel annoyed and say, "Just a minute." I climb up a bookcase-like thing to look on the top shelf. I find different bottles all just out of reach and knock a few over in my search. Some are like onion powder bottles. They are almost it, but not quite. I feel frustrated.
