Mom and I drove to university (today). We stopped in the middle of the freeway (which was different) close to university and it was nearly time for my class to start. She had found some diet thing on the internet that Timmy was a part of and she met him and he was with some girl. I realised that I forgot my lab coat and books and I told Mom and we went home and I got my stuff and grabbed a jumper too (I had complained it was cold and she was wearing a jacket and said a book said to make the sleeves shorter. As I got ready to leave, there was some weird stuff and I turned around and Mom was in the passenger seat of Timmy's car and I was confused and she just looked at me. He got in the driver's seat and I went to the car and realised Mom was paralysed and couldn't speak. He started driving off and I opened the car and dragged Mom out. Then I was at the old house. I called the cops and he came and he was like 'how do you know she isn't faking it?'. She kept vomiting. I said I needed him to write me a letter excusing me from university today. Dad was there. I opened a cupboard and found Nice biscuits and 4 square Vegemite things. Dad and the cop talked in the games room and said 'child gets 1.5% of whatever' like in a will, and I was like 'is she dead?!' and they looked at me sympathetically and I went through the kitchen to the lounge room and she was lying next to the long lounge on the floor. She had a cigarette in one hand and it dropped on her and I grabbed it and shook her and she woke up like 'what's going on' and I said 'you almost set yourself on fire, you idiot'.
