["Starting over again with my dream program."] I am in a room. I have a desk cluttered with strange objects. A woman comes in. She is there to assist me to work better with my job, which is to get my dream program up and being useful at this company. I've been working on it for a long time. Apparently, I haven't been working on it much lately. I feel the need to begin again. But I am confused what these objects are. Some are organized, some are just laying around. I try and explain to the woman. Someone hands me a broken video cassette. I see it was smashed, maybe run over like by a wheelchair. Maybe mine. The round rolls of tape are out of the cassette. It can't be fixed. I sigh in frustration. I return to my computer area. I realize I will have to start over again to recall what I was doing with my dream program. Now I'm in another room. Some babies are lying on a couch. Tiny newborns. I see one black baby all naked. His color is a sort of grey blue shade of black. It doesn't look healthy. I realize it is very cold and can get sick. These babies are sort of like toys for Charla to play with. I pick up an outfit to clothe the baby with. It is damp. That will only make things worse. So I pick up another outfit. I can't get it on the baby. Someone else finishes the task. Now I am seated and Charla is talking with me. Visitors come to the door. A boy with bleached blonde hair, all cool, comes to ask Charla out. She laughs in embarrassment because she had chocolate or dirt smudged on her many double chins. I then see she looks like Ellie. And Ellie has the same mud or stuff on her face and neck. Apparently they were playing make up or something. Then I see the boy has it too. I offer a couple of different colors of lipstick for Charla to try. Then she and about four teens go out the door. One young female teen has a huge bouffant bee hive hair do. Then all of them are wearing scarves like Muslim women as they walk out the door.
