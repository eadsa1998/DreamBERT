I went to the cinema to see Iron Man 2, but I didn't go. I was in some army training thing. A guy was out of breath and this guy came up to him and said that his brother did and he pushed himself too hard and he wasn't going to. The guy was a former boxer. He took him through the place, explaining all the obstacles (it was like a huge indoor obstacle course thing). For one of them, you climbed down a ladder and attack the enemy. He failed the first time, tried again later and failed again, but was finally able to do it. A few other people passed through and were put into the same group. The guy overseeing it was the principal guy from The Inbetweeners. Some guy and I got into a fight with someone. Another One Bites the Dust was playing over the loudspeakers. Then I left and Mom and Ezra were in the car. I said I didn't see the movie because I'd already seen it and I didn't want to waste time rewatching movies. I said I had a fight influenced by a song called Iron Man 2. There was a scene where Tony Stark was in a boxing ring with someone and stabbed them and yelled about his father. He also said "it's me" (admitting he was Iron Man). People complained about it and said it was Justin Theroux's fault. Then I had a lecture and it was as Youtube video about a principal guy and a leprechaun but it didn't work. He was well-known and he had been found out to have down leprechaun porn.
