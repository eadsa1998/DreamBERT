I am standing on a square metal box, a large one. Six foot tall maybe. My volunteer job is to help a retarded young man in some activities. I am having trouble getting down off the box. Someone is telling me to hurry. I tell them I can't hurry. I need to be safe. The young man can wait. He does wait. I finally get down and go to him. He is very happy to see me. I devise a game. I put different sized balls down on the floor in a long hall. He laughs with joy. Now time is up. So I say Let's go pick up the balls now. I find 2 flat boxes to put them in. He comes with me and occasionally picks up a ball but I do most of the work. Lots of puzzle pieces too. I remind myself not to use so many small pieces next time. I am aware of how long this is taking. But it is important to complete the task.
