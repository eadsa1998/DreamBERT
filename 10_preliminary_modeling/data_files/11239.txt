My parents and I went to morning services at Church. Because of crowded conditions we weren't able to sit together. This fact made up the text of the dream because my father got into an argument with a woman because she wouldn't move down in the seat in order to let him sit down. Their voices became very loud, and soon everyone in the congregation was watching them. However, there seemed to be a short time of quietness, and then the services were over. When everyone was leaving the church they were all watching my father and this woman. And my mother and I were ashamed, so we didn't walk with or talk to my father.
