It is RAINING: see many foreign people and am waiting to give Wendy an address; I was writing it on a check in red ink but can't remember it all. I ask Frank, but he too can't remember it; I am angry at him because he has such a good memory.... shift: see an acquaintance from the Jung Society being wheeled into the room in a wheelchair after an operation; she wants me to comfort her. I see a blue chandelier being screwed into the ceiling. --It is still raining and we are in a city that looks like PRAGUE. Frank goes to mail a letter and then we catch a streetcar in the rain.
