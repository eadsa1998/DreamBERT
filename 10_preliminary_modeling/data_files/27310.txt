I dreamed I was with a crowd of school girls getting in a bus. Just then a very tall man came up in back of me and tried to pick me up. I got on the bus just in time before he could catch me, although I don't remember him chasing me. All at once, we were driving down Lake Avenue in front of my house and I felt if I could just get off here at my house I would be safe.
