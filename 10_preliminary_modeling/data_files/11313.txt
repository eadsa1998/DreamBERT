I recall taking an examination. It seems the examination is to be very long and the time allowed short. I remember talking to a girl sitting next to me in the examination and telling her that it is no use to try and answer all the questions since everyone will fail no matter how much they complete. However, I myself am trying to complete as much as I can. The room is apparently filled with other students but they are not clear and it seems that the only people I can clearly make out are the girl sitting next to me and a man instructor standing in the front of class.
