We were going to the library. I was excited to look at the poem books about rabbits. The girl rabbits had names but there were so many. I pulled out the stack of CD's and poems about rabbits. Maybe a Scenic overlook. One was a diamond and 2 were in pretty bad shape. The Wofford Sales guy was still trying to sell options in Monday, Wednesday, Higher. I was not interested in the bricks or options so on ???. I was riding on the back of a horse with my father. I accidentally referred to the horse as Smokey and I felt like a heel. I said, "Smoke," I knew I was wrong. my father said, "Scooter," very somberly. We rode up a steep hill. I was looking, asking where there might "They are there to KILL AND MAIM." There was a hoodlum living in the Pisgah National Forest. She was hiding behind rocks. She claimed dolphins were walking with her, upright on their tails. She kept talking, leering. Pending doom. my father said, "Merri, better get some sticks." My father threw a stick at her and she ran like a scared dog. Her posture changed. I went to Wofford looking for a piano and they were working on the roof and a guy was explaining Monday, Wednesday, Friday; lights inside, and buildings lit up on days of the week. We were waiting for the lady ??? the aluminum on the steps ???. Men condemned. The Simpsons had come on. I made an omelet for Dora. I turned on the Simpsons and the omelet stuck to the pan. The Simpsons were funny. Shirley Davis found the 5 rings she had lost on the (floor).
