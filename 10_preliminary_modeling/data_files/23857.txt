I was in a group setting, a dorm or crew or extended seminar, big dorm-like building.  I was working on my computer, and I didn't want to stop.  I was enjoying myself.  Later - Bill M was there [another lawyer at work, not a love interest]  I thought I saw him with another girl.  We'd been together earlier in the dream.  But no, he wasn't.  Us being together was kind of a secret.  I went up a hill to a main area to do something quick, I didn't want to eat dinner yet like everyone else was, it was crowded, and I wanted my computer.  I went back down, then I was jumping going downhill, jumping up high, using my body, I did a flip, and a roll, playful and talented.  I was remembering meals, like with the fire crew.  I wanted to get back to my computer.  I went all the way down the hill, to a basement, like that was the way back to my room.  It was very dark, I could barely see.  I knew there was a sliding glass door, I put my hands out in front of me to feel it coming up since I couldn't see it.  It was so dark, but not scary.  I found it and went in, up some stairs.  It felt like that Lynn-feeling, Thompson, Utah, the empty house he wanted to buy, that he took me to in Grand Junction.
