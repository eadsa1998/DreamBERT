I'm staying the night in an unknown town in an unknown apartment. Perhaps it belongs to a friend. In any case, I don't know this friend well. The apartment is one main large rectangular room - a living-room/bedroom/kitchen with couches, a couple of mattresses, a couple of cupboards and hobs on the back wall. I don't recall there being any windows with views out, but perhaps indirect light enters from high up windows. It was night and I could hear the buzz of a town of city outside. I get the impression the town is going to  party all night. It's about 1am and I'm intent on trying to get to sleep despite the noise. I'm not alone - there's a couple of other people trying to sleep here too. Perhaps they are friends of the owner (who is absent). We don't know each other. There's a slightly awkward atmosphere. One of them is an attractive german girl with long dark blonde hair.
