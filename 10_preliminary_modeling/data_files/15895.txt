I had a boyfriend and we were out driving one night. It was quite late and I was a bit tired, but we decided to have sex in the car, somewhere. We went to the carpark of a hospital and parked up. We climbed into the back seat and he put a condom on, but people kept walking past the car and we would just pretend to be sleeping. There were too many people and I said we should try somewhere else. I suggested Meadowbrook or Uptown carpark. So we went to somewhere like that and got back into the back. He had his shirt off and I was kissing his chest and getting lower and was slowly grinding him as well.
