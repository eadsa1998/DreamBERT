I was flying. A boy was monkeying around, so I got hold of him and flew him off the ground. I was in a forest. I looked into the forest and say some of the hills are barren where trees were taken out. I looked at a sign for a trail to where x-ray outfit was. A fellow was told he changed. Was his wife happy because he worked steady for a change? His pal tried to get him to play hooky and go to a ball game, but he walked away and I looked and he was doing a wash on a washboard. The other fellow laughed, but I said, "He's in love with his wife, but that will wear off in a while." I was taking a stroll with Ann and some other woman. Ann acted funny, wasn't satisfied that I didn't take her some other place of amusement instead.
