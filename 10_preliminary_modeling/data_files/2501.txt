I choose to wear a lovely dark blue and white polka dot dress and matching hat. It's a bit transparent. I wear a slip under it and look very pretty and sexy. I go into a room and a man, slightly overweight, husky build, is very attracted to me. (He's Katrina's brother.) I am shy. He gently pursues me. I am interested, but things keep interrupting. Paulina is there and I try to turn up the thermostat in the room. He tenderly follows me, waiting. I say, "I'm not ignoring you really." Then we are going to kiss and Paulina walks through and wants to know if I'm leaving with her at 4:30 am. I say, "No, go on ahead, I'll leave later." Then I get honest and say, "And maybe I won't go." She catches on, smiles and leaves. We go into a bedroom to kiss and make love. Now the scene changes and I have quite an obstacle course to go through. I must hop from one cement post to another with huge alligators leaping and snapping at my heels (spelled it "heals"). Then I move hand to hand across the wall full of drawers by the handles. Some are open and I peek in, nothing too interesting, some smelly gym clothes. Then we get to a room and scary people are in the closets and so on and if only he and I ignore all this and love each other anyway, then it will all go away.
