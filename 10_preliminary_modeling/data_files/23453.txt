My son Charlie and I are at a school-type building. My fiancee Ken is there but my son and I aren't with him. I'm using a bathroom that is in a type of downstairs or basement level area. I'm aware that Ken is using another bathroom a few feet away and I get the idea that I'll sneak past him and go outside. As I approach the stairs to go outside, I realize there are curtains up on the entryway. At that moment Charlie is poking his head in and I tell him we have to hurry up and go outside so we can surprise Ken. Outside there is a parking lot and a grassy area and Charllie and I start making our way to a bench (or something like it) at the far end of it. I have a hard time making it to the bench and keep falling asleep on the way. I have a hard time opening my eyes and I'm half-conscious that I'm dreaming then and then I'm disturbed and wake up.
