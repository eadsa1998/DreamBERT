In the first one I was with my girlfriend and herparents. We were at the beach, some beach it's unclear were exactly. No particular place, at night in the evening and my girlfriend was in the water swimming and her mother and father were on the beach with me. I was talking to her father. He was showing me a notebook. The notebook was filled with the names of certain male, only male relatives he pointed out of my girlfriend, cousins and uncles and so on. There were about 25 names in the book, and he pointed out to me that the ones that had x's over their names, that had made x marks after they had signed their names and addresses in the book, were the ones that didn't believe in God. Oh, and I think I remember that almost all of the names were Lesnik, that was their last name, different first names, but their last names were all or nearly all Lesnik. About 5 or 6 of the 25 didn't believe in God, and I remember being at the time very surprised that this didn't shock the father. He wasn't upset by it at all. So I remember thinking at the time that he didn't believe in God either. Then the only other part of the dream I remember was somehow I, though I hadn't been in the water, was wet and rather chilly. My girlfriend came over and brought me a towel. I recall the dream I think average or perhaps well and it's fairly vivid. The dream seemed at the time very plausible. It took place at some indefinite time, but obviously the present, that is to say the people and events were from the present time. It wasn't a particularly emotional dream at all, except the surprise. It was black and white. The dream took about 10 minutes.
