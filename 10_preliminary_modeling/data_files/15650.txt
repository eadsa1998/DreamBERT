I went to McDonald's for a job interview. It looked weird inside and the desks were cirlces and looked like sushi. I said I was there for an interview, and I felt confident and was smiling and speaking well etc. This guy took me to a table and was asking me questions. It seemed to be going well, then he said something about people pretending to be friendly and confident etc. I pretended not to notice. Then he asked me about poetry and I said that I hated it, laughing. He said that someone in the back loved it. Then he scrunched up his face and said '10'. Then he just got up and left and I saw a clock behind me and I realised that the interview had to go for ten minutes. I was shocked and a bit embarrassed and just left.
