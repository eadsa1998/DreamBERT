I was driving down a street near home when one of my fraternity brothers, 20, hailed me and asked me if I were going to the Beta picnic. When I asked him where it was being held he said in Florida and that he wasn't going since it was so far. I said I thought I would drive down since I wanted to break in my new Ford convertible that I was driving. I told him I was going to get three other guys and drive down. The picnic was to be the very next day. I drove home and was looking the car over in the backyard when my dad, 54, appeared. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was going to drive down to Mentor. I then corrected myself and said I mean Florida. I told him I wanted to see how the car performed and I would find out what kind of mileage I was getting. My dad told me that if I wasn't getting good mileage, I should stop in any garage and they would put on a new carburetor free since they were guaranteed for good mileage.
