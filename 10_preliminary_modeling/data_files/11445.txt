I was in a movie house watching a film. Somehow or other I became a participant in the movie itself. In the one scene of the movie I recall, I was standing behind a man who was exchanging shots with another man who kept ducking behind a ledge. All of a sudden, the man behind the ledge made an appearance. The man to whom I was apparently allied fired his weapon upon my yelling now. Then I returned to the audience and was no longer an actor in the film. As I left the theater I met some female acquaintances. I remember debating in the dream whether or not I should greet these people or try to avoid them.
