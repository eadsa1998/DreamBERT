There was a girl called 'Repeat Paddy' and she got in trouble at school. I had to talk to her. Then I killed some guy? A guy friend said "who can you trust?" and I told her first. Another lady sat next to me and we later asked her to leave. I'd also made a movie about breaking into prison. It had something to do with her and I had to get her to sign some stuff saying there was no resemblance between her and the person in the film. I went to some guy's house. Outside there was a row of movies and they were all IMDb Top 250 movies and were marked off if they'd been sen. They hadn't seen The Great Escape and I said "they've never seen The Great Escape". Ezra and Dad were there. Dad parked Ezra's car right on the edge of this 'cliff'. Ezra bragged about his car to the guy.
