I'm traveling with a group. I think we're in Alaska, looking at the wilderness, walking a track. People watch me to see if I can handle it. Stairs are steep. People are sitting on the stairs and I have to walk over them carefully. Now we are at a meeting and a friend gets voted in to a special office of importance. I get voted in to a new office. They've been waiting for someone with the proper skills to show up. A writer. I get to be historian, or scrap book person. I'm not too thrilled. Then Rita and I walk to the beach down a steep path. I look out across the ocean and I see huge waves and a heavy, threatening sky. A bad storm is coming. We are concerned about some of our group who are out on boats. Will they get back safely? I pick up some of Rita's vials and eye drop things (German Rita who is visually impaired). I don't get them all. I go back to the huge dorm-like house. The group meets. Ellie and Paulina are in swimsuits and want to go down to a little swim. I say, "No. It's too dangerous." They are hard to convince, but they return with us. The male leader says, "It's confirmed. It's SAM (the name of the hurricane.) They're even breaking out the canoes in New England. It's a big one. So get inside. Be prepared. We'll survive it. I ask if we have enough food to last. There is. [BL]
