I dreamed I was invited to a party which was being held in a bowling alley. In order to get into the party, I had to roll a strike, then climb through the space where the pins had been standing. When I had rolled the stroke and climbed through, my girlfriend (Connie) was waiting on the other side. She seemed very disturbed that I was able to get in and we began fighting. I left the party with some strange boy and while we were walking away, a group of people came by. We could hear them making fun and shouting harsh words to a policeman standing nearby. I called to them then and asked why there were being so nasty. (I can't remember any more.)
