We are at a dinner party at Father Andrew and Marissa's many people and kids; I help set the table and push two tables together; I am very hungry, but we must WAIT--First we must collect the money--it is $2 per person, so I give them $4--for Frank and myself. Finally everything is ready. I remember wearing my "Dirndl dress" (an Austrian costume) and we dance. I see a woman come over wearing the exact same pattern on her pinafore as I have on my Dirndl dress. IT is a pattern of roses.
