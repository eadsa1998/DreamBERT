I'm in a house. There are lots of rooms. I keep going from one to the other looking for what, I do not know. Howard's things are in a dresser (see illustration in original dream book). I can't find my writing. There are lots of beds, single beds; no place to really sleep. The little girl is upset. I take her hand. Someone knocks on the living room door. We go into the hall and into the living room. Several people have sick little people/animals. One "dog" is a tiny, naked man. He's also like a baby. Someone (woman) pulls out a worm from his nose. It grows and looks like a crawly white scorpion thing and I say, "Don't do that." They take out another one and I realize these things will grow and crawl around and get past them. "At least kill them if you are going to let them out," I say. A woman cuts them with a scissors. I feel they are being irresponsible and endangering me and the little girl. I look closely at the objects on the three pianos and realize they are just like the ones in my parents' house. I am agitated and take the girl and go back to find Howard. Down the hall I go. We pass a room where I see the little girl's exact duplicate, and am amazed. I go to my writing room, but it's crowded with things. I go back to the room where the duplicate girl is and hesitantly enter. A bed with a man in it is on the right. He looks at me and I apologize for going into his place. He smiles and welcomes me. "Dad," he calls and a man comes in from a door. He's very tall. I explain that I saw the duplicate girl and I don't know what to do because my house is full of things that aren't mine. The men are very sympathetic and smile because they had come here in just such an upset state with their little boy. They can help.
