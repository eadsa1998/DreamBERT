I was talking to my cousin Albert (age 16) when he was called inside the house (country house in Huancaho, where I lived until I was 12). A special detail was that the patio where I was had wood on the floor (it isn't really like that). I realized that I had spilled some water and was trying to clean it up. I took a broom and started to sweep the water, which had somehow increased in volume immensely. In this fashion I kept throwing it in the ditch, which was on the corner. The patio has four walls. On two of them there are balconies which belong to the second floor of the house. A girlfriend (age 20) came out through there and made fun at what I was doing. As I swept, a thick coat of mud came off the floor (which was waxed and apparently very clean) and went into the ditch. I remember that at the end I felt nervous because I thought that when the floor dried, there would be spots of dry dirt on it and it wouldn't be shining as it was before.
