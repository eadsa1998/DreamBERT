I dreamt I was out by the barn at home, by the big barn doors. I heard a noise and looked down at the ground and there a little duck was trying to come up out of the ground. It was sort of buried and was trying to get out. When it did get out, I saw that it had a membrane or piece of skin attached to it, that it was not quite normal. I was wondering what to do to make it healthier when all of a sudden the duck seemed to have turned into a cake and I was cutting the cake. I was going to taste the cake and quite eagerly cut into it, when I saw right in the middle of the cake a horrible black worm with two feelers or type of sense organ-like whiskers twitching up and down. It was so horrible I could hardly look and dreamt I felt ill. Then I woke up.
