I was at the Technical College and it was today, but they said the 'downstairs' studio was free and we'd all be going down there and could shoot. The 'upstairs' studio (the 'main' one) was bigger than the real-life one and had these big light boxes which could change colour and do disco type lights. This was where we were going to shoot. The downstairs one was smaller and didn't have any fancy stuff. We'd only booked a camera as we were only going to be rehearsing and we weren't allowed to add any more equipment as they'd need to bring in a lawyer. We just went along with rehearsing. Cecelia looked like she'd dyed half her hair blue (top front half, and a few inches of side), but it was just a cloth. We set up lights (which we somehow had now) and Cecelia did the first bit of the song (guitar intro), then we stopped the music and went to this outside area. Tristan and Juniper were also there, but I don't remember seeing the others. We spent so much time doing nothing and then it was time for lunch and Tristan left. Juniper's Facebook 'About Me' bit said something about how she didn't like when people compared the living conditions in third world countries to living in Midvale (regarding trash).
