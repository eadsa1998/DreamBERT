 I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. We seem to be near the Middle Mall in Wilmerton. Our initial meeting is friendly and causal. We touch, I hold her. She starts to tell me what she's feeling at the time: essentially a "state of affairs" for her so I know where she's at, and where we are. We're interrupted. It's later, I've come home from a school-like bus. There is a door on the side of the bus midway, or towards the rear. I sit with my mom and Annie's uncle. We seem to be parked and sitting outside a Dairy Queen. My mom encourages me to give the relationship with Annie a chance: to try to make that familiar relationship work before going off and finding something totally new. I see my mom's point: she just wants me to ease into life back in the United States. Being in a relationship in which I'm comfortable would ease that transition. I tell my mom and Annie's uncle that if things work out between Annie and I that's great. If not, if she desires a relationship of something isn't right, that's fine too. I try to keep an open mind, to play it by ear without prejudging.
