Dress designer friend of my old, close friend Annie shows beautiful dresses on a streetcar show. They're gorgeous. She isn't the least bit interested in me. I was pissing out dreadful animals. I am standing in a shower with beautiful wood. We are in Melbourne. First it looks like mucus. Then I see that there is a worm in it that looks like a fresh, sweet shrimp (amaebi sashimi). Then there is an insect with wings, long legs, and antennae with the slimy consistency of a snail covered in gelatin. White. Then there are many of them. I see that my penis has torn at the head to let them pass. My wife comes in with her father. They say that nothing is the matter. I have to go to the hospital. Her father says he hopes I will share a room with an uncle who died of a stroke (but now he was still alive). There is one single bed.
