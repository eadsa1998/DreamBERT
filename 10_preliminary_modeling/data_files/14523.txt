I was getting in the car and two people we didn't like were there. The Winchesters (Supernatural) had a little sister. I didn't like her. She was with us, in the backseat between Ezra and I. Dad was driving and Dean (Supernatural) was in the passenger seat. Up ahead, at the lights, there were people washing car windows. There was a scantily clad woman with big boobs. Dean and Dad both commented, Dean said "She has a nice... pencil". She came to the window and she and Dad flirted. She said that not many good-looking, funny, single guys around. There was a pause and then Dad asked for her number and she gave it to him. Then we were at Nana's. She was there. The inside was different. There was a warehouse and they had copies of my chair there, but they went back more and were recliners. Poppa was in there. I left the warehouse and it was near where the water tank was, at the top of the path next to the fish pond. There was a duck on the bridge. It followed my movements, so I ran, screaming, up and closed the gate. Nana got it and I ran inside.
