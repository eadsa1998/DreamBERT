Painful dream about Pedro (my swimming partner and friend) and Kevin: I am with them at Breakfast and also with some of my friends. Pedro and Kevin tell my friends that they cannot stay because they filled out a questionnaire with homophobic answers. I AM VERY UPSET. I cry and say "I am so sorry." I will not eat, but then a child who is with K. brings out a waffle for us. I feel better and then go with Pedro to where he parked his car, way off in a parking lot near some mountains. He has a green car and we drive to a movie studio where we are going to view some videos for Pedro's talk. The secretary gives us careful instructions as to how to use the machine. I feel well again and included in their plans.
