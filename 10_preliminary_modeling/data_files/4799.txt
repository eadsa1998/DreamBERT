I am working somewhere. The boss is cool and I don't enjoy being there. I am now crawling through drifts of snow. It is soft and dry. I touch it with my hands. I am surprised it is warm to the touch. Then the big boss, the owner, comes by. I am back in the office. He doesn't understand why things aren't working out well at work. I say give me $100,000 and I'll tell you. He agrees. I say they don't like the work they have to do. They are unhappy. I say give me $250,000 and I'll tell you more. He agrees. I say that one, my boss, lives on Long Island and the commute is long. He has a family with children and has hardly any time to be with them. I point to another worker. He needs a different kind of work that he understands and can do well. I continue explaining to the owner what he needs to do to make it better for his employees.
