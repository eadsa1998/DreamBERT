A group of us are watching TV. Five of them cuddle up in a group and I'm seated in a chair perpendicular to them. I say, "Hey, now I can't see the TV," because they moved it. So I move over with them. I'm right next to them but not "in the group." A policeman is on TV. They are talking about his history. He's Indian and was once a chief. (They show him in his headdress.) Now he just passes for white. A man comes in to fix the thermostat. I say, "But will it get too cold now?" He assures me it won't. The child is being stubborn and difficult. She wants things to go her way. I try to comply, but get tired. As the mother, I follow her. She goes through a box and comes out in another room. I follow. I see a man with a gun. I hide in the closet and the child has a gun and shoots the man. She looks for me for reassurance, but I'm hiding.
