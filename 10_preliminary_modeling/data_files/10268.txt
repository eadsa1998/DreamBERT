I am in a HOSPITAL setting and see two women about to give birth: I see one woman start to pass a lot of dark red BLOOD; the other woman is in the last stage of labor and starts to push and I see the head crowing. A midwife arrives and helps the baby out; it is a boy. I see a nurse suctioning the baby's nose to get the phlegm out and diapering it in an elevator; I go out and tell others what I saw... very vivid images.
