I am seated on a couch and Leroy, my cousin, comes over and sits near me to kiss me goodbye. He and his wife are going home. I love him and I feel he loves me. We lightly hug, as his wife is standing there watching, almost in slow motion, I lean up and our lips are close together. We steal a soft, loving kiss in a way that the wife can't see. Now he goes home. I find some reason to go there. The wife is very suspicious of us and we are very careful, but we are indeed in love and take every stolen moment we can to brush up against each other or look into each other's eyes. This is a difficult life we are moving toward, a suspicious wife, we don't want to hurt her. They have been in a good relationship for years, but our feelings are too strong and we can't resist. Apparently I was in a play, because Leroy says to his friend, "Tell her you liked the play." He comes over and says, "Yes, Grandmother, I loved your play." He was very polite. He and I talk about how special and alive one feels on stage. Even if you are not alive and ordinary off stage, you can always go back on stage and recapture that special alive feeling.
