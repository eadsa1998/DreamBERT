I dreamed that three other girls and myself were being held in this large building by a gangster. He had much equipment for his gang, guns, lens, etc., and we kept destroying them. He became very angry, but did not kill us. He could not let us go because we knew so much. I managed to find a way to escape and the four of us looked for a place to hide. We came to Clarence Brown's furniture store. I thought this would be an excellent place since one of the girls last names is Brown. They were having a large party at the store and we had to tell just whom we came to see. I told the girl at the desk I wanted to see Clarence Brown and she replied he's been dead since 1863. She immediately knew we did not belong at the party and the gang leader's men--all over the party began to chase us down the street. We found an old house where we stayed for a while. One of the girls became engaged. We were very happy for her, but it seemed to mean that we could stay there no longer, so the other three of us set off again to look for a place to stay.
