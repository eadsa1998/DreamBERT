On Pennsylvania Ave. between 13th and 14th, on south side. A small black sedan stands at the curb. The doors are unlocked and the windows down. Either on the running board or on a shelf about height of door handles, lies a thin volume, gray covers, about same size page as in Ency. Britannica, but no more than 1/4 as thick. It is a book on Lepidoptera. The author's name "Hickhamsham" (or something close to that) is prominently displayed on cover. This name seems to me to be just the same as (or perhaps 1 letter different from) the name of the Curator of Insects at National Museum -- i.e., Chester. As I am looking at this book (didn't pick it up) the owner of car appears. He is perhaps 38 or 40 years of age and clean shaven, healthy ruddiness in cheeks. He asks me if I have ever driven a car to (names some town in Pennsylvania). I say no, and ask him whether he customarily leaves his car unlocked.
