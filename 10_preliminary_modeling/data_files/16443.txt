One other note about this dream -- first of all, it kind of scares me to think that I came in at the top of the building and I went down. If that's going to be how my career's going to go, that's a "Pppppppt!" But anyway, the path and elevation is that I came in at the top and I went down and around, and I helped somebody while I was down. Then I went back up and I felt really claustrophobic and tight. And one thing about that little attic space that was supposed to be a recording booth, there was nothing in it except a toy teddy bear and a party hat. Now tell me what that's about! [laugh] But anyway, there was no sound board or anything; it was just a toy teddy bear and a party hat. And then I went down, and I went outside, and then everything seemed to be going good outside. So I don't know what all that's about. Also I didn't taste any of the little desserts and things that were laying out, but I looked at them, so I think all this could be pieced together in that maybe when I get to the very top of my career, somebody's going to act really immature and keep me in a very tight, confined, pretty conservative little area, not physically, but mentally. And then when I get a little more space and I'm a little more established, I'll be outside feeling good and bold to do anything I want. And understand that all of this is what my mind is seeing, it's not necessarily, I don't believe, that these dreams are saying psychic things about this is what's going to happen to you in the future. It's what my inner eye sees, or thinks is going to happen to me. It's nothing guaranteed, so that's my take on that.
