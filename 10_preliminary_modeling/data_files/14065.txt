I was in my car, which was big and different and I was going to be living in it. I had an apartment at Westland University too. I was setting it up. It was like a game and you had to have a dispenser on the wall, either tampons or condoms. My hair felt gross so I put it under a tap. I called Mom to fix my car. It had stopped working and then it was a bike. I called Dad to bring some stuff. I brushed my hair.
