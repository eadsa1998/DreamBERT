I was in a parking lot.  There was some sort of outdoor shopping spree.  The first people to buy $200 worth of clothes would get them for $100.  There was another guy (one of my online friends?) who I felt particular competition with.  I went and picked out some clothes to try on, though I didn't know exactly why, since I didn't need new clothes or have extra money to spend.  Then I was on a top floor of a building.  The room was tan.  I found two bills sitting in the corner- a $125 bill and a $150 bill.  I was surprised and happy.  Then a guy approached me- it was his money.  I gave it back to him.  I was sad to be left empty-handed.  The guy said he was Peterson- I recognized him as my online friend Marilyn's love interest.  I mentioned my disappointment and financial need, but he seemed not to care.  I found another few pieces of paper on the floor and picked them up.  Most of them were fake bills but there were two real ones in it, so I found about 6 dollars.  I ended up in the elevator with him.  Somehow he realized who I was, a friend of Marilyn's.  He apologized for his curt behavior and told me his first name was Alan.<p
