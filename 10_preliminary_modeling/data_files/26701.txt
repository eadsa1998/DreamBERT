 I'm at home in Oak Valley having a party with my brother Wally. My cousin Archie Weber and friends Stephen Ramos, Barb Flanders, and Jill Banks are there. I say I may not drink much alcohol: I don't feel like drinking. I have a caramel-flavored shot that tastes good. I talk with Stephen. There are between 20 and 40 people here. It's a very relaxed party, with people talking, some outside. It is darker, in the evening. Two phones in the house ring. Wally answers. It is the neighbors calling to complain and threaten us. While he talks I walk out into the yard to have the guests come inside. While I'm doing this, two police officers come and say there are complaints of noise. I go talk to the police. They say the complaints were on public access! One of them asks for a house plan. I'm sober, and confident that we were doing nothing wrong, so I quickly tell him I live here and I'll show him around the house. I show him around, beginning upstairs. He is very terse: rude and belligerent, egotistical. I'm annoyed with the neighbors. Earlier I asked Stephen for a joint of marijuana. He didn't have one. Now I think that it was good he didn't have one, since the police came.
