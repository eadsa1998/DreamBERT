 I'm at my mom's house in Oak Valley. It is winter, and is early in the morning. Two minivans pull up in front of the house. I walk out to the vans with no shirt on. A girl gets out of the first van. I walk over to the second van. The girl's parents say that she isn't going to deliver the paper this morning because something is wrong with her; she's sick. I ask the parents if they know the route so I can call them if I have trouble delivering the papers. I go back inside and eat turkey and bread. I say that this shouldn't happen to my mom, who is their piano teacher.
