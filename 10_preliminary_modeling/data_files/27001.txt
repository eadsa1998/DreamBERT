When the dream began I was busy packing my clothes in the car to come home from College. I was solving the problem by carrying the whole dresser into the back seat of the car and then putting in the drawers which were packed with all my things. Later I went off to class, my last one in that school. It was on a second floor of what appeared to be a gym. One wall had large windows in it which were covered by newspapers. A young boy was busy stripping the papers off the windows and when gone we could see into the gym itself. Class was soon over and several of my very close friends and I went downstairs to have a cigarette and discuss the events to follow. It seemed that we were electing a queen for some affair and no one knew who it was. Several minutes later we ran up to the gym for the procession was to start. Elaine, a friend of mine and I were standing in good view of everything, right at the end of the aisle for the procession. The trumpets blew and I stood there eager]y trying to see who was the queen when a chorus of voices shouted my name. I was to have the honor because I was leaving for another school and they were showing me in this way what they thought of me. My surprise was immeasurable to say the least and I almost cried. The dream ended with Elaine walking me down the aisle to lead the procession.
