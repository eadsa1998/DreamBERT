I dreamt that I was just about to buy a pair of suede shoes, but I did not trust the quality because I have the impression that with water and dirt they get ugly and are ruined. However, in the dream it turned out that somebody (I don't know if it was my sister Martha or my grandmother) had a pair of brown suede moccasins which were already a little worn, but due to time only because their quality was so good that you could wash them with soap and water and they would be like new. I remember that I was very enthusiastic and I asked her where she had bought them. (The surrounding of this dream was home, but I am not sure of whether it took place in the patio which is between our bedrooms.) At the end of the dream I felt great relief at having at last found a good pair of suede shoes.
