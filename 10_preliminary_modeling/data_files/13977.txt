This girl and guy had been sleeping together for a while, but they were keeping it a secret. Her actual boyfriend, who looked like a young Hugh Laurie, decided to sleep with some other girl. She was outside this motel looking place and he was in one of the rooms. She saw him having sex with her and she was calling him a retard. Then it was me. I went to this other room and a young James Spader was naked on the bed, but was covered up with a blanket. I sat on the bed with him. We were hugging and my legs were on his legs (which were hairy). He was stroking my legs, which were also hairy and I said "I couldn't be bothered [shaving]". He then had grey shorts on and I was wondering how he got them on. I think he could go to the past sometimes. He had this radio from the past. I got McDonald's breakfast and dropped it off to these people, but I had forgotten some. I was going to give it to them tomorrow. Later, Ezra and Dad had been in a small accident, they came back in the back of a small Ute. The doctors had thought Ezra might be pregnant. Mom was hanging up my underwear on a line outside the building, she said "there might be sperm in one of them" and I said "ew". I was at school and Mr Reilly had done a family tree of me, he was pointing out "Tommy Conell". Alejandro said something about an "arch of life". There was a photo of my room when it was clean and Jemma said "What's that on the roof?" and I said "That's my floor". She thought my room was messy. Mittens and Tigger were in a photo. Eugene was in the class. I was going through my phone and Ms Quintana was in my contacts. I was telling Calvin later as I didn't know how she got on there.
