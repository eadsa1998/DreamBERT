I dreamed I was walking the dog. It was spring and I was so absorbed in my own thoughts I didn't notice when the dog disappeared. Finally, I realized it-was dark. I could see no lights. It was absolute blackness. I felt my way along the street. My home had one tiny light in the window. When I reached the house I saw that the dog was sitting on the porch. She recognized my footsteps and barked joyously and wagged her tail. I was furious with the dog for having run away. I let her into the house. Then I beat the dog for having run away. I let her into the house. Then I beat her. She squealed and finally bit my hand. I began to cry and threw myself on the couch holding my bitten hand and crying. I was sorry I'd lost my temper and beaten the dog.
