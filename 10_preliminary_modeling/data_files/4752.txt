["Gardens in the hall."] I am walking down a long hall in an apartment building. The hall area in front of every apartment door is decorated like an indoor garden, each one uniquely different. I see the pretty waterfalls and hanging plants. And statuary. They are very lovely. The apartment I am being shown is at the very end of the hall. I go in and it looks very nice, a red brocade couch. I need to go talk to the landlord and make arrangements. The man showing me the apartment gives me a special outfit I must wear for this interview. It is a formal pink gown with a ruffly stole that goes around my face and shoulders, up to my eyes. We go up to the top floor and I go to the door. I see odd letters that I think are dutch words but they look more Arabic or Chinese. This is the list of roommates that live in this apartment. I timidly knock on the wall near the door. Then I knock louder on the door. I wait.
