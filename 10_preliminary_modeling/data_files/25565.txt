 I'm in a house other than my own, with my friend Holly Lapson. There are others there who seem to be a little bit like Holly's family. I kiss Holly and immediately start to unbutton her shirt. Her shirt is a white button down shirt with the two top buttons already undone. She stops me from unbuttoning her shirt and tells me to wait until her period is done.
