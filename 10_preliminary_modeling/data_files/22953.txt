I was on a plane which was coming in too fast (at too steep an angle) for a landing.  I was sitting somewhere where I could see the runway directly in front of me, rushing up at us.  We pulled up in time, flew over the runway, went into a steep climb and a sharp bank to come around and try it again.  I guess we made it the second time; I don't remember it, but I remember being at the airport and waiting for some transportation.  There were some other people with me, and others on the way.  Those of us who were there decided not to wait any long for the others, and we all (or as many of us as it would hold) piled into the back of a truck or van carrying hay or something fairly soft like that.  We were really packed in on top of each other.
