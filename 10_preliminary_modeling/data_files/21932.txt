I robbed someplace with two fellows. I looked at Fairchance, PA and the people were running away from town. They were running on the main road towards us. We were puzzled why they were leaving town. It was at the foot of a mountain. Then I looked into the sky and the moon had an odd shape. It was square like then like a triangle and it was tan color. Then we saw a tree and a bird hopping around the tree looking for some insects to eat.
