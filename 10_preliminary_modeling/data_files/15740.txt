We were at home, though it sometimes wasn't. Layla said she needed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (book) for something for school. Granma gave her Alice in Wonderland and she was like wtf and I took it and gave her my copy of Cuckoo's Nest. Then she said the thing she was doing was about courage or something and I gave her the Alice in Wonderland book for her friend. Later, I think we were at Nana's. Mom and Dad were both there. Nana gave me some McDonald's and said 'hopefully it's still warm' and I said 'when did you get it' and she said 'yesterday' [she had heated it up]. There was a 'graduation' for the year 12's of my year going on in one room but I didn't want to join them.
