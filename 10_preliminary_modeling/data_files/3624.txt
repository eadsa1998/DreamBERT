I apparently now live in a very large house, but only use a couple of the rooms. My cousin says to me, "Perhaps you will take in Deirdre. She could live with you." I feel the woman's need to better the situation of her child. I look into the bright green eyes of the child (perhaps middle school or early high school age). I say, smiling, "I'd love to have a child with green eyes and green hair." It is really blonde hair but she has a huge green hair ribbon on. Those eyes are an illuminous bright green, a very unusual color for eyes. She is happy. I tell her she has to fit into the routine and get up at this hour and do this and that and then we'll all get along well. I think it will be more work, with the baby I already have, but it will be OK. I wonder if she will go to W. High School. Now the scene shifts and I am talking to the principal, a tall, large man. I am investigating what seems to be a racial discrimination situation. I am a journalist in attitude. At first the principal is hostile and defensive. I guess he thinks I am accusing him. I keep interviewing people and the focus shifts bigger and bigger until the principal says, "Ah, I see. You are now looking at Universal Peace, not just a discrimination thing for one person." He relaxes and is helpful.
