I go upstairs to my bedroom and see the room in a shambles, the bed turned and in the opposite side of the room. I say, "What happened here?" Aunt Naomi says, "Basketball," meaning the teen boys must have been playing basketball in my room. I say, "How am I going to get this back the way it was?" She says, "We'll get Lionel to help us." I start to go downstairs but she says, "No, let's do it the easy way, and put the phone on hold and dial 86, the extension." She does so and we wait. I see Lionel walk past the door across the hall and don't call out to him. We wait some more. Naomi calls again, number 85. She goes out. I start to move the bed myself. It was pretty easy. I almost get it in the right position but now I wait some more. [BL]
