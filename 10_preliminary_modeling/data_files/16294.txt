I was taking this final exam for this art class, and what I had to do is, they took a picture of us and they cut it in half and they laid one-half of it down on the paper. And we had to draw in the other half and make it look exactly like the picture. And that was our final exam. Well, I tried that, but I kind of game up and I started drawing all kinds of doodley things. I drew this housewife figure who was running around doing stuff. I drew this really kooky figure of myself and I drew a couple of other doodles. And I had this whole big set of markers and stuff out all over my desk, and they were like rolling off and falling off, and then it was kind of time for me to go. Mom was there to pick me up. And then I had the realization that it wasn't really a serious final exam; it was just sort of a doodley fun thing, and so I took all my doodles with me and I was putting all these markers away, and some of them went into my little art kit and some of them went back to the teacher. It was kind of a guy like Mr. Kitchen, kind of like. Oh, I remember drawing this angel in a plaid jacket, and saying that she was an audio angel, like she did something, and her stuff was like inside of her. And what you had to do is you had to like unsnap her jacket and there would be her sound controls on the front so you wouldn't have to go through all kinds of other stuff trying to get to them. That was just kind of goofy! [laugh] And I can't remember anything more.
