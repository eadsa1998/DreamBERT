I was watching a movie. This detective was asking Mary Warren (The Crucible, book) where someone was. Then it was me. She told him she didn't know. But then she said it was an accident. He was dead upstairs. We were in a barn and we went upstairs. He got up and it was Steven Weber and he was naked. She asked if he was gay and he said no and she said "yes you are" and he said ok, whatever (he was actually bisexual). She asked me if I thought that was hot and I said yes.
