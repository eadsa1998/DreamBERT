I'm painting a room, green. Some people interrupt me. They have information about the guilt of someone. They were witnesses to the burning of a Isuzu car. I leave my work to listen to them. I finally convince them to tell their story to the authorities. They won't go there in public, so I take them through a private corridor. It goes through a series of non-peopled spare bedrooms. "The first one," I tell them, "is where I go when I want privacy or quiet." After we go through a lot of them, I point out that this used to be a mansion. We get to the door. I instruct them to put on a oxygen mask, which is clear plastic and covers both the nose and mouth. I tell them not to be afraid. This is pure oxygen. We go into a chamber. The door closes. Water fills it up. Then the door on the other side opens into a under water world. I am immediately called to finish my hostessing chores before I can bring my witnesses to the authorities' notice. I swim out to take drinks to people, etc. The witnesses are seated at a table to eat. There is some confusion about how they can eat with their masks on so they won't drown. They work it out.
