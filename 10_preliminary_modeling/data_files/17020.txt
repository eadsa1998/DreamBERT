There's a bizarre tournament taking place in a very high-ceilinged hall, which is about as long and wide as the dining room in a country house. The room is ornamented - it is perhaps victorian or older. The room is divided up around the walls into desk-sized compartments, which are raised on plinths about four or five feet off the ground. There are high stools facing each desk area. The room is room is full of people sitting at these 'desks' - there's about 20 people around the room. As well as the desk-compartments against the walls, there may be an island of compartments in the centre of the room, thus filling all the available space in the room with people sitting at desks. Placed in front of each person (on the desks) is a shallow tank of clear water. At the bottom of the water in each tank (which is about two inches deep) is a waterproof piece of paper. The game is played by one person hitting a ping pong ball around the room with a table tennis bat. When the ball arrives near another player, they have to hit it up and away to keep the game going. When the ball is elsewhere in the room, players have to draw on the paper under the water. There's also the notion that you have to attempt to hit the ball so hard that it passes through the two inches of water in someone's tank, and bounces off the bottom, and back up through the water. This is of course impossible.
