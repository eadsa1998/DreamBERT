I dreamed I was in my mother-in-law's house. I was getting ready to go to school. My mother-in-law was saying she couldn't take care of my son David who is sick. He had a temperature and she said she couldn't hold him because he would crawl away from her. There was some conflict. I said I had to go to school, and it was pressing that I went to school. My mother-in-law said he had a temperature of 104, and that she couldn't take care of him and I should stay home and take care of him. I said little boys have high temperatures often and that there was nothing else apparently wrong with him. But I didn't leave to go to school. When I woke up, it was still unresolved. Hall: The child he refers to in the dream is David his 19 month old son.
