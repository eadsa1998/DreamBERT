I'm at a beach and trying to take photos. I can't get the right composition. It would look good and then change. I see statues dancing. I try to take a photo with mountains in the background, but they shift. I go back to my friends on the beach. A nice man, the boyfriend of my friend, is very supportive. I like him but he belongs to the other lady. He's smiling at me and I turn and see Howard standing there and my smile just disappears. He wants to be interested in my photography too, but I walk away. I don't want anything to do with him.
