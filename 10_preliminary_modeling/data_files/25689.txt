 I'm in a lot of snow. The side of the road I am on was not plowed. The snow is deep. I struggle to move. I am not upset, this is kind of fun. I get stuck. I'm on Home Avenue in Oak Valley. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. I'm afraid of being hit by a car. A police car comes and throws me a rope so I can get towed out.
