Charla and I are going down the street. I see that Bill Domhoff and his male grad students are having a garage sale. I don't see anything to buy. A student gestures to go around the block. I do so. I go in a room. I see jewelry and clothes. I hold them up to Charla. Nothing much of interest there for me. Bill comes in and greets me. Says let him know if I find anything I want.
