I was editing and updating CAS web pages, text pages, registration pages, and thank you pages. This is similar to what I do before the e-news goes out, yet it didn't seem to be related to that. I kept going back and forth between the different pages. Like making a change on one page would remind of a change that needed to be made on another.
