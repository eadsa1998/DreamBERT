I am at a zoo. At a booth, they have lots of fuzzy little animals. I hold a small, sweet kitten in my arms. I walk away down the path, with the kitten. Someone comments. I know I have to take it back, but feel regret and sadness, but I have two cats already. I walk back up the path, having to go against the traffic and bars like in the library block the way and I have to go around them. I take the kitten back.
