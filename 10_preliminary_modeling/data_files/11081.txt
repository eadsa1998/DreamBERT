I was at home in Rye, N.Y. The man who lives down the street from me is a tall sort of Angy Gump type character. He has very long lets. In this dream it was night time and I was walking in the parking lot which runs adjacent to our high school. Suddenly I saw this man chasing me. His height increased greatly and his features exaggerated. I tried to run but my feet were stuck to the ground. As I woke, he was coming closer and closer to me.
