I dreamed first that I was in this huge mansion and I had to help deliver all these babies. All the women having the babies had to go up all these stairs though. Then I had to help them down the stairs to the delivery room. So then I was a slave in some huge landowner's house and I was running away with a baby in my little green Oshkosh overalls from when I was a baby. So we stole this food and other things we would need and put them in Bloomingdales bags. As soon as we left the house, the woman came after as, so we hid under a bench. I prayed she wouldn't see us or hear us breathing. The next dream I had --I was in the library trying to steal something heavily guarded by giant squids. It was impossible and I was really frustrated. The library was like a planetarium, so I lay down and looked up at all the stars in the ceiling. Then I had to go to Spanish class. Then I woke up.
