[1997-06-25] I had made an appointment with my hairdresser to get a permanent. I went there and the hairdresser said that there were some changes. I sat down in the chair and she pushed a button somewhere and these scissors came out of the wall I think, and began to cut my hair. They were automatic. They would cut for so long and then they would stop. I could hear this noise, this motor, I guess they were going back into the wall or wherever they came from. She said "that's fine, this won't hurt you, sit down in this chair." I did and all these rollers came out and went where they should go automatically. Then she said I would have to go under the dryer and I said there wasn't one. She said "Oh no, you have to stand up under the dryer." I did and the dryer was there and she pushed a button and the dryer came on and dried my hair off. Of course she had shampooed it first and put all that gunk in it. She had this little machine which was on for 20 minutes or so, this dryer thing. Then she said "I've got to put on the neutralizer, the stuff you have to put on your hair to make the permanent perm. Then she said come over to this part of the room and I went and she brought me over to another machine and she said "put your head back." There was no sink there or anything like there usually is. Then this lotion came out from this place in the wall I guess. When it was over, she said that she wanted to give me a blow cut so I had to go back to the dryer again. In real life my hairdresser does all these things herself but in the dream it was all done automatically. I don't know if she had robots or what. I remember her telling me that the equipment had just come and she wanted to try it out and so I guess I was playing her guinea pig.
