Last night I had a dream about Aaron and Britta again. It was similar to the last dream I had about them, in that Aaron wanted me to be friends with Britta, and he didn't try to hide her or anything to spare my feelings. He just outright showed affection for her and everything. And again, I just felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to make myself feel better or change the situation, because I wanted to be with Aaron, but I also wanted to stay friends with him, so I had to be friends with Britta. The dream was odd though because Britta wasn't a pretty blonde girl, but rather a tiny Vietnamese girl. And I liked her. And even though she was the Britta, Aaron's Britta, there was some part of her that secretly wasn't. It was weird, but I knew this to be true. Anyway, this is all so stupid because it shows that I am just anxious about seeing Aaron again and worried that he will have gotten back with Britta.
