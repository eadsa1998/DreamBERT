 It is the night before a trip. I'm at home sleeping. There are two small kids there. My sister Ramona is sleeping in her room. My cousin Melvin Redding comes into my room. It is very early in the morning. He is about two years old. I am awake. One of the kids has wet their bed. I am downstairs. It feels like I am taking care of something, maybe the wet bed. My brother Wally asks me if Ramona is okay. He says she has seen a white wolf. I run upstairs to check on her. When I turn to go up the stairs I look out a window. In the back yard where we set the garbage is a snow fort, like an igloo. A light is being shined upon this structure. I run upstairs, into Ramona's room. My old roommate Jens Nils is sleeping in Ramona's bed. He was what she was scared of. His girlfriend Natasha Lens is sleeping in the bed too. I leave. They laugh at me for thinking it was a wolf that scared Ramona. I take a plastic bag, but bring it back because it has Jens' stuff in it. I have no respect for Jens. The family is now up. They are packing for this trip at 5:30 or 6:00 am. I think it is too early: we should go back to bed. There are apple muffins made that aren't good.
