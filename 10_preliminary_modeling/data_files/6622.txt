My hand was hurt. I was trying to bandage it. I am 10 years old. Had trouble pinning it. A man reclining on a cave-like upper verandah offered his assistance. He pinned the bandage and asked J. if he had ever seen a stone couch such as the one he reclined and offered to show it to him. J. went up and I turned sadly away because I knew they wouldn't want me as I was a girl.
