I went to the Iron Kettle to bowl. When I got there, I was surprised to see a big lake come up to it. People were throwing rings into the water and the young ones were diving and jumping into the water for the rings. There were waves capping in also. There was a colored nurse who was Maleta. I was helping a doctor or assistant to him. The colored nurse winked at the doctor to make him, but he shook his head negative. Then she winked at me and I said no. So she didn't feel disgusted, but smiled and said she would keep trying till she made someone.
