A man was looking for something on the floor o the theater. He was on his hands and knees looking between the girls' legs on the floor. Some pulled down their skirts and pulled their legs together, and some pulled up their skirts and spread their legs a little so he could look. My sister Ann and I went into a big restaurant. We went to each window in the back. There were about four or five. I pushed the curtains apart and looked thru each window to see if someone was out there whom I was looking for. I met Rose Lasko and John Andreas (deceased). I was waiting to see Judy and Ann was coming in. Mother and I were lying on the bed with Judy. I let my hard-on come out of my pants and I said, "Look what I have." Then it dawned on me we were not on terms of very intimate terms. I filled a whiskey bottle of my own from a different bottle and put it away on a shelf. I tried to put it so it would not show too much.
