I was in a class being conducted in a damp, marshy wood. The professor was lecturing in front of this little cabin, but my seat was behind it, so I asked him if he minded my sitting in front so I could see, and he said that he did and said to me something about not enough seats, these all being taken and kids took the seats that I had thought I would take one of. Then I looked about for a place to sit and debated sitting on some wooden planks over some watery part, but decided it was to damp. Meanwhile, someone started to talk, seemed like gibberish or maybe she sang. The professor beckoned to me and I realized that he had made me a flat seat to sit on and had I sat down with it where I was, speaker and the prof. sat down on the grass. The seat he had made me was quite wide, so I moved over and invited him to sit next to me. Meanwhile the speaker went on. I was a little worried that the class might think I was brown-nosing, sitting next to the teacher, but I wasn't embarrassed. The dream ended.
