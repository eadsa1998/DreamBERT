I was at Nana's. I was going to watch some TV. There were two guys outside who I hadn't seen before and I told Ezra about them. Nana said they were cool. Some time later we realized there were some dodgy people out there. I locked the doors and hid inside, but we weren't fully closed off (blinds were open etc). I hid in the spare room. I ended up having to leave later and went to Nana's room. Two guys attacked me and it looked like they had yellow eyes (sorta zombie like), but it was disguised. I realized one was in the bathroom. There was something involving the door handle. He had something fake and it went and told his master? I was then in a room with some machine with poles. I held on and it went to a different universe. There was a guy there in some water and I told him to stay.
