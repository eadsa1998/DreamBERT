I am busy organizing things when a cat falls into a river and gets its baby bunting suit wet. I get it out of the water and am preparing to change its clothes. I call out to this guy to fix lunch and tell him what I meant. I turn to shut the door and two small calico kitties are trying to sneak in. I push them back through with my foot and try to slide the door shut. They keep finding ways to poke their heads in. Finally I shut them out and turn to see that the man made a more complicated lunch than I had requested. I am annoyed that he didn't do it like I said and tell him so.
