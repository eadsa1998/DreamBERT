At a resort town: Father Andrew is preaching to us from the stands: then comes over, we talk. Very friendly. Marissa is not there. The second time he preaches, I stay with him, alone; afterwards I tell him: I love you. Then I hear him say he will pay $1,000 for an apartment. I go up and kiss him; I want to live with him. But don't know how to ask him. <br/
