Samantha, Calvin, Evelyn and I were trying to get a photo for Attack of the Clouds. We were told to look worried. There was a picnic blanket and Fang was there, standing to the side. Evelyn said "Ewan", but she meant Obi Wan. These guys were teasing her. Melodie was there. There was a game with these houses and you had to get a fishing rod off some dude to pull the curtain up. There were other people you had to meet. Spaceman was around hanging with me. Mom was there too. Samantha went to a shop. There was a diary and Melodie and someone were crying because they thought that Samantha had done something. Samantha was setting up stuff for filming of Arrested Development. Some guy was upset.
