I dreamed that my parents had gone on a trip and they left me in charge of the house. I dreamed that at night ghosts came. I think it was a nightmare; it was horrible. I saw that everything around my bed was misshapen. My shirt looked like a ghost, the radio like a skull. Since everything was horrible, I suddenly jumped up and awoke, screaming, and turned the light on and I couldn't fall asleep again. It was around 3:40 a.m.
