Cecila Lippert came to work with her baby girl. I tried to make the baby smile, but it wouldn't. It was puny and looked old. She sat on the steps to wait for Bob. A fellow came over and stepped on her foot, then squeezed her knee, which hurt her knee. She complained. Bob sat above her and stuck his foot at the guy's hand and pressed it away. Then he got up and to work. I quit ahead of time, stopped by the railroad track and was making out my time. I picked a couple of apples off an apple tree. The boys at the shop told me some kind of Hill sun or Baron or Barameter was running and was hot.
