I went to visit Chris C. He lived here in Indy. At first, it was just he and I. We didn't talk much. It was as if we didn't know what to talk about. There was food everywhere, almost as if it was on display just for people to take and eat. Lots of sweets especially. At some point Mother, Bev, and Rachel S were there too. We were mostly playing with Rachel S. Bev had a clip-on ponytail for her that Rachel S wouldn't let us put on her. However, it was very cute. She also had this little pair of eyeglasses, which she also wouldn't keep on. Chris C sold insurance. Once we got to his house, he sat in a wheelchair to make it easier to get around. Even though we didn't talk much, I suggested we get together more often. I was trying to be nice because I felt he was very lonely. He seemed to be appreciative of the offer to get together more often. I told him we had one staircase and then wondered what I was thinking and said we could get by without using it. Again, he seemed happy for the offer. I asked him what kind of insurance he sells so I could refer people to him. He said all kinds. At some point Brian F showed up. He couldn't believe all the food. He wanted some but didn't take any. I very much wanted a cream filled donut, but didn't take one. I did take a snickerdoodle. I didn't want Chris C to see that I had it even though he had told us to help ourselves. When we were getting ready to go, he loaded up this big basket/cart full of food for Bev. The items I remember were three boxes of tea, larger than VCR's. I also asked about his apartment Community to see if it was adults. I told him I was thinking about a new apartment where it would be adults only. As we were leaving in the car I realized I had looked at them once before and didn't care for them. They were brown and had brown wood front porches with railings. They were all attached to each other.
