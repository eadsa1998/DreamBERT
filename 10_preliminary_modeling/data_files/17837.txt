My best friend Emma came to visit.  After a while someone came and picked her up, and later in the bathroom I found her purse.  We found she left something else, too.  I was going to call her but before I could she and her ride stopped by to pick it up.  Then Deborah, my old babysitter came for a visit.  I was very surprised to find she had a child with her- she was a mother!
