Greta H. is visiting us while Don (married friends) is away; she and Frank spend much time alone; I am jealous. Then when it is time to say good-bye, I come back and they are naked.... I am furious. I slap his erected penis and call her all sorts of names, even touch her vagina, say it is not fair. She then explains how lonely she is; how she and Don just don't have enough time together any more and how wonderful it used to be. She resents the children and we joke about my spending time with Don and she with Frank, but in reality we would rather be alone with our own spouses! I understand Greta for the first time, and she accepts to stay longer with us. Frank is gratified and we are friends.
