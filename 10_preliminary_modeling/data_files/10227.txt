Father Andrew is at the Retreat Center, but dressed informally, like Retreat Center people. He stands by the folding door to the dining hall here at the Retreat Center; "I had a strong dream, what do you make of it? I know you don't think much of dreams, but anyhow..." He doesn't answer; "What can I get you? Tea? Coffee? Coke?" He asks for coffee and I get him a cup. -- shift: I fill small glass flasks with spices as a present for someone and say: "The Lord provides!"
