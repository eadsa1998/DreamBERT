A game of street baseball is being played, and it is my turn to bat. Among the fielders are two brothers, and I hear someone remark that it is nice to see them together again after a recent reconciliation. The older brother is in his mid-50's with just a few gray hairs, but is in very good physical shape and is quite strong. The younger brother appears to be about 40, has black hair and a moustache, and is easy-going in nature. The brothers are black. The older brother pitches, while the younger one plays the field somewhere near first or second base. The first pitch whizzes by me with incredible speed, stopped behind me by a solid wall of some sort. Unsure of my grip on the bat, I swing wildly, missing the ball by a large margin. "He plays hardball", I say, referring to the pitcher. "He used to be in the majors", someone informs me. A second fastball goes past me just as quickly as the first; I miss again, but this time my swing is a little better. This happens a few more times, each time my swing improving while still missing the ball. The older brother then brusquely announces, "0 for 6, time for the next batter." The younger brother takes offense at this and urges giving me another chance by saying, "He's just getting the hang of it." A brief argument ensues between the two over whether I should continue batting. Each is disgusted with his brother's position, and they turn their backs toward each other and will not speak. Someone says, "This is just like their last argument, and they didn't speak to each other for a long time after that." Attempting the role of peacemaker, I say to both brothers, "C'mon. You have to look for what you have in common."
