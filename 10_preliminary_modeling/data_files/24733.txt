I know I switched characters a couple of times. I remember landing on a planet. I was watching out for this little brother and sister. When I located them, I became the sister, but the brother got older too. Well, anyway, the place I was in was full of people with earrings, nose rings, lip rings, etc. I was the odd one, I was wearing cords and a white shirt. Then this guy came over and made me go to the dance floor. He said that this girl wanted to dance with the guy but wanted to see how he danced. I was the tester. The guy took my hands and flung me way up to the ceiling then he swung me back up to the other corner. After this had continued for a while, I decided to stop when the ride was over. Also, the music stopped. Then I was sitting by this big water tunnel thing and an alarm went off. Somehow the water was leaking. I looked next to me and saw that a bag had broken and was spilling out water. I told them that. Then I held the bag closed. Somebody said that people were already going through the escape tunnel, so I went over and put my foot in the way so the next person couldn't go. Then I explained why. That's all I remember except that I think that the brother and sister traveled through space and time at random. Setting: Another planet, on an island, in a restaurant. Characters: I only knew one person, and that was possibly my brother, who in the dream was a boy I know at My school. Everyone else I didn't know. Oh! The guy that led me over to the guy was from my camp. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried, confused. I was happy most of the time, but when the alarm went off I was worried and confused.
