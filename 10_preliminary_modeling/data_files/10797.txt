I dreamed I was in the smoking room of my dorm talking to the girls, and I started to complain of the piano playing of one of our dorm mates. The girls all gave each other funny looks. And one went out of the room and came back with the girl of whom I had been complaining. When I stopped talking in embarrassment, the girls said for me to continue. They wanted M to hear me.
