I seemed to be in a drawing class sitting around a long table. The class was instructed to draw a duck. Another girl was sitting at my table but I can't remember who she was. We were asked to come to the front of the room to hear a story. All of the girls sit down on small chairs. I sit down and then change my seat. Our teacher is a young woman (in her twenties, unfamiliar to me). Everyone had a white sheet in front of them with a pencil. I had no pencil, but tell myself that I will be able to remember. One of the girls reads a story about ducks. All of the girls laugh. We then go back to our seats. It's getting dark. Another class comes up from the basement ready to go home. This class consists of all small children, mostly dressed in snowsuits. I get angry because we have not been told to go home. Then teacher says we can go home and wishes us a happy Easter. Someone turns the lights off and I cannot find my crayons. I look in my box (resembling my evening bag) and see only two crayons. I look on the table and see a bunch of little stubs of crayons and some large ones, but can't determine their color in the dark. Someone (a man) tries to find the light but cannot. I become very angry. A girl (about 21, in my E-- class) comes up to me and shows me her hand, palm up. I see a ring. I turn my hand up and she says "Oh, you've got one, too!" I ask her if she just got hers. She says "no." Her ring is smaller than mine and she says she couldn't wear my size. I tell her that my hand is proportionately larger.
