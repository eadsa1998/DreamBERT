Calvin was staying over. We were sharing a mattress in the lounge room. There were lots of pillows on it. Dad and other people were saying that we got along really well. We were playing Animal Crossing and I was playing some old weird Pokemon game. There were Diglett's and Bullet-o-Bill's (Super Mario). Animal Crossing looked like Pokemon and you could go into mushrooms and then the mushrooms would be bigger than you. The Breakfast Club was on TV and I was making a soup. I was going to watch it, but then decided that I watched some yesterday and couldn't be bothered. Calvin threw pillows at me and then chairs and they were all on top of me. I was then putting the pillows back. This girl came and got him and they went somewhere. I went later and some girl and guy were getting implants. The guy was James Spader's brother -- they had the same chin. Nana came and was like "I hope you're not going to take your clothes off! There are kids here". Everyone was like "What the hell?". I was watching some movie and aliens accidentally shot a missile at their own planet, it made a noise and I was like "What the flip? You wouldn't hear that!". Ezra asked why and I said there isn't any noise in space.
