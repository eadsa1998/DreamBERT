["Angry Archie and the Kiss"]  Lucy and Archie are seated side by side. At a table. We are indoors but no architectural details. Archie is telling Lucy something that I get angry about. Perhaps he is belittling her. I tell him I don't like the way he is treating her. He is instantly furious with me and rails at me for a long time. I have no business interfering, and so on. I start to walk away, but he comes to me and steps in front of me. He then kisses me very lovingly. I respond to the sweet kiss with pleasure but I am confused about what all this means.
