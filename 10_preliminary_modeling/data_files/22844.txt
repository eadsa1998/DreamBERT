I was riding across the Muddy River bridge in my hometown with someone in a car-I think it was Kate Booth.  The river was a very strange color of blue, sort of like blue Faultless Starch-a solid blue.  When we got across and looked back, there was a huge fir tree, higher than the bridge.  It could hardly be distinguished as a tree, because it was so covered in this blue stuff, like blue snow.
