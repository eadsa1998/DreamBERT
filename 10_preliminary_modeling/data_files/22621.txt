I remember that I first dreamt about the institution at which I work (a clinic) and about a 12-year-old patient with whom I now play. I was thinking about how bored and lonely she must feel among so many grownups. In the dream there was also a nurse who must be around 40 years old or more, who also works at the institution. we were in the dining room having lunch, and the girl did not want to eat. She was misbehaving and making a nuisance at all times. Later she ate my own food as well as hers.
