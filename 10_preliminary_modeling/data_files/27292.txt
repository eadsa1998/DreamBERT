There was a young girl, whom I judged to be about seven years old and whom I felt was a playmate of my sister (although my sister is now sixteen), visiting our house. She was a very ragged, dirty and unkempt child, which bothered me considerably. I took her to her home, which was the lower half of a double house on a street not far from ours, and found the place in a deplorable messy condition. We went through several rooms, all of which seemed to be furnished in living-room style, to the kitchen in the back. The kitchen too, was in an abhorrable state; dishes of food from several previous meals was lying around, which rather nauseated me. Just inside the door of the dining room was the refrigerator ("x"). [There is a diagram in the original dream report.] I peered into it, and the heat from the inside hit me in the face. It was revolting, I thought, to have butter and milk and eggs kept in a warm icebox! The little girl, meanwhile, had been unobtrusively following me around. I thought a splendid thing to do would be to clean the whole place thoroughly, and I had the feeling that by doing so I would greatly impress someone whom I wanted to make a good impression upon.
