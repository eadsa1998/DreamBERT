I dreamed that I was dreaming that a train arrived at a beautiful place. I was on the train and was scared because I didn't know where I was going. I was nervous, until I saw a very beautiful house. I got off and went there and knocked on the door. A girl in a bikini opened the door and I went in and saw a pool and asked her if I could swim in it, and she said alright. Then I put on my swimming trunks and went swimming. After swimming, we started to talk and she started to lead me on in a way which couldn't happen in real life. Well, she took off her bikini and I my trunks, and we went to bed and had sex. The girl was pretty and I didn't know her. Suddenly I heard knocking on the door and in my dream I awoke and heard a voice and then really woke up.
