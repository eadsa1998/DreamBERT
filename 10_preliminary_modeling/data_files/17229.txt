Some of my dorm mates and I had gone in some place.  I had a sarsaparilla but was being heckled because one of the servers accused me of underage drinking two weeks ago.  I yelled and explained how ridiculous her accusation was, angered, although she obviously didn't have any proof.  The group of us left.  Went to an orgy, I guess.  They somehow talked me into going down on a girl, and she wanted to give me oral sex as well.  I was apprehensive.  My boyfriend Jeremy was sitting in the group behind me.  First I took one taste of her, then some more.  Someone was holding my legs.  Then she started humping me, despite my legs being held away.  I stopped her and went to Jeremy.  He wasn't happy, and I felt guilt. I apologized.  He said something, but was mumbling.
