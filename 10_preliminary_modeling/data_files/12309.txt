This girl and I were at home. People from House of 1000 Corpses were coming to take us. She wandered off and I saw her getting taken into Ezra's bookcase. I went to save her and got taken too. Everyone was at this place. I found Calvin and saw these people who looked like Chinese peasants and they had those pointy hats. I started doing stuff at this hospital. There was a time machine and I gave files to the boss' wife. He came and said that 'E' was missing and she came with all the files. He was angry.
