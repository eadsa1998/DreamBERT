Ezra's hair was long. He brushed it and it looked gay and we laughed. He was then playing a game and always got stuck at the same point. His character went into this mirror maze thing, which had a slippery floor. He slowed down and then we were both there. It was hard to walk. We went into this room which had two doors on each side of one wall and one in the middle. I went to the one on the right and there was a scream, some footsteps and an evil laugh, which scared me. I went through the middle door. Ezra now had a double or something. I told them to try to climb this thing. I went into a hall and I went into this room with a bed and a small set of drawers. I found socks with rubber bits on the bottom. One pair was black with pink rubber bits. I put them on and I was already wearing socks. I went through the drawer but it was all useless stuff. There was an old mobile phone and I was scrolling through this text which explained how to climb. I went out and gave a pair of socks to Ezra and said I forgot about the other guy, but went back and got him a pair. I looked down the hall and it led to some kids rooms. It was dark and spooky down there and I didn't want to go down there by myself so I went to wait for Ezra.
