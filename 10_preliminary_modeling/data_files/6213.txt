My friends and I were supposed to go to Boston one night, around 6 or 7 pm. The train was the last one that night, even though the last one is usually at 11:00. For some reason, the train was leaving from my old high school bus stop. Everyone was meeting at my house, which is about a two-minute ride from the stop. They were at my house, but I was really late. This is very unusual, because I'm always early. They were in my kitchen and kept telling me to hurry, as I was. We decided that they'd leave and I'd meet them at the bus/train stop. Now, there's only a couple of minutes 'til the train's departure. I raced out of my house, down the stairs and across the lawn, but I forgot my pants. I ran back, put them on, and ran out again, but forgot my asthma medicine. To make a long story short, I forgot my wallet and my coat, and ran back and forth every time for each item. Eventually, I got to the street, knowing there was no way I could make the train. Then my friend's car drove over the hill to meet me. The car was red, even though I don't know anyone with a red car. They stopped next to me, and they looked disappointed. Then I woke up.
