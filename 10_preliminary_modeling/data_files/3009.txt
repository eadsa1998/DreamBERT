I have a little table top desk thing that I use to paint and so on and it is wobbly. I ask this British man if he could fix it. He happily says he can. He fixes it as I ask him questions like where in England did he live. He said he lived in boarding schools. I say, "I'm sorry. That must have been hard for you, lonely." He smiles and agrees. Now that it's fixed, I decide to paint a picture. I wonder what picture to do. He smiles and says, "Why not a picture of me in a wedding, my wedding?" I laugh derisively and say, "HAA! Never. But I'll do one of you in a wedding." He wants it to be a picture of the two of us at our wedding. He likes me. He says his name is Ringo and I think that rhymes with Bingo, my name.
