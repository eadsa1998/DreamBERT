I was at a bowling alley. I was going to bowl. I noticed I was dressed, but I was barefooted and had not my ball and bowling shoes. I went to the toilet, which was outside, and it was full of paper to the seat top. I pushed it aside with some other paper and the seat was wet. I looked at some holy statues and I said, "Is someone going to win his race today?" but the statues just still no nod of the head or anything. I looked down on a picture or a movie and I saw a lady and two men on horseback riding out to see someone the lady wanted to see They were going the right way because I seemed to be up high and I could see where the house was. I was walking thru some thorns and bushes. I was pricked. I was eating and a dog jumped on the table and started to eat the food.
