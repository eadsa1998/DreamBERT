 I'm at Armstrong High School walking in the parking lot. I'm going towards the east parking lot where the athletes park. Students walk out of the school towards the parking lot. My high school teammates Olie Kecker and Ron Lind walk by. We greet each other saying, "What's up?" The students all get to something like a roller coaster, not on rails, but on the blacktop, and some other object. They begin to crowd around it. I leave: this is not where I want to be. I get over the road dividing the east and central parking lots. My classmate Virginia Green is there, and I say hi to her. She doesn't seem too happy to see me. My high school classmate Lynn Escher is there smoking a cigarette. It seems that my friend Sarah Reed is there, maybe in Lynn. Lynn asks me why I am always smiling so big in photographs but walk around with a stern face in real life. I know this is true, and I shrug my shoulders, and say I don't know why. My high school classmate Stacy Brill's parents are there. They seem to know who I am. They look familiar to me. I say hi, but don't know who they are until someone says so. I meet others who seem to know me, but I don't know who they are.
