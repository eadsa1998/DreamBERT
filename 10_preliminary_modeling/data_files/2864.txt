I am walking and a Native American man with bright colors painted on his face calls me over and tells me I should take his class. I need it, he says. I choose to sit on the other side of a flat platform, away from the other students, I think because of my wheelchair, but I'm not sure why. He is an excellent teacher, coming up to me and challenging me to think differently. He calls himself a soul dancer, and he says I can learn from him, even if he is a brown man (meaning a black man). I feel a bit of shock that I feel some slight prejudice. After experiencing his one class, I agree to return. It is good for me. I go on home now.
