There was a large crowd of us coming through a field returning from a swimming party. A woods was in the background near a winding river. There were only girls and strangely, none of us had on any clothing. We were walking along nonchalantly when we saw a group of boys leaning on a fence. They were near some cars in a parking lot and were watching us approach. Showing no marked concern, some of us turned around and walked back a short distance to dress, while others merely stopped and dressed standing where they were. I was one of the first ones going across the field and just as I turned, I saw one of the two girls I recognized, both freshmen on campus, hold out a pair of red pants and put them on. At this point I woke.
