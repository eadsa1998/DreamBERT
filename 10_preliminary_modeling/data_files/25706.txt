 There are two wolves that are clenching their jaws around two tanned wolf hides. I am with my friend Jack Thigpen, who is a moose. I have a small shoe gun. It's a foot long with a widening barrel. I'm walking with the moose down a road. The moose can speak. I realize that it's silly for me to control the moose, which I am threatening, because in a second the moose could easily stomp on me. The moose and I find a haunted house. We go in and look for a skeleton. I'm with Jack. The skeleton man is supposed to be here. I have a flashlight that I shine on the skeleton. The skeleton is quick: it will be in the light, and then move to another place quickly. I try to grab it, but can't. It escapes down a tunnel. The person with me dives down the tunnel after it. I go down the tunnel too, but it takes me longer to go. I hear their voices at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel ends in a clean and neat room. Someone is getting married. My cousin Henry King is there, and is cleanly shaven. Another man is there. They are both wearing tuxedos: white shirts and black pants. My roommate Stephen Ramos has dust and dirt between his toes. People there laugh at me because they know that I know the transition of how I got here.
