I dreamt I was in a car with three of my ex-friends that I don't speak with anymore. We were driving in one of my ex-friend's boyfriend's car. I was sitting in front and felt very insecure, like I shouldn't be there. Then the driver pulled over and started screaming for me to get out of the car. My three ex-friends started yelling at me and kicked me out of the car. I remember feeling like I was going to cry. I was stranded in the middle of some street that I had no idea where I was.
