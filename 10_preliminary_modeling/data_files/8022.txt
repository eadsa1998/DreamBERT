I believe I was with Susan J throughout this entire dream. I think we were at her house. Susan J was having a LRJ party in her home. She had not done the elaborate display that I used to do for those parties. I was telling her that I should have done mine that way, as it would have been so much simpler and less expensive than creating all of the elaborate displays that I used to create. I don't remember whom she had invited. She showed me around her house. I said, I finally get to see your home. We talked some about our children. I can't recall the age of hers in relation to mine, either a few years older or a few years younger.
