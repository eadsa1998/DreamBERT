I hear or read a story about a group of adventurous women writers who lived in Alaska in the 1800's. One man and four women writers had dog sledded to a conference and were returning on the big ice pack, but the narration says that sometimes the ice pack breaks up in the big thaw and creates dangerous situations and people can slip right in and drown or disappear. I see them sledding and see cracks in the ice, and then I see that they are right on the big crack and some of the sleds are slipping into the water and they are struggling to get back on the ice. They are colorfully dressed, spritely and sweet, lively. One is named Love something, maybe melody or maybe day. I write down what I can of the incident.
