Today I dreamt that I was running around at Bancroft Middle School with some kids, and it was like after hours and we were kind of like playing hide and seek in a dark room and running around through different doors and stuff. And I remember Mom and I wanted to get out of there soon, but I think she was talking to somebody while we were running around. And then when we finally did get out of there, we went to these people's wedding, and I was so mad because we didn't get there to catch the beginning of the wedding. We got there like after the ceremony was over. And I can't even remember who it was, but I had the notion that I was one of the bridesmaids for some odd reason. Then were at Westport High School and I was asking Melinda how I went with Mrs. Dougherty because she had talked to her the day before, and she just said that she wanted Melinda to help her collect notebooks and things. And that's that.
