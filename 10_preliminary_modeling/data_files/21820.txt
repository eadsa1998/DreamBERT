I bought some raffle tickets. They were $10 tickets and I seemed to have $10 attached to each ticket. The tickets were tearing in the wrong place as I wanted to separate the stubs. J. Weatrak said, "I see you are getting a bump on your nose like me." I said, "That's from the goggles I wear in the shop." Judy was small. She was barefooted and she was jumping up about eight inches on the floor continuously. We were watching her. Ann started to heat a pan of baloney. I took some out and ate it. Then I noticed ants crawling over the baloney and it was hot. One got out of the pan and landed on the floor. He started to run, them jump about three inches high. I watched him as he did that from getting a hot foot from the pan. That I knew an ant couldn't do. I went thru a stop sign. As I did, I saw a policeman with radar and I heard it click as I went by. I violated a traffic law. I saw a policeman waiting for me, so I slowed down to stop by him.
