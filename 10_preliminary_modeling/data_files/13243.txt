I was in a car with Silas. We went to this shop. People from West Whitehall Primary School and stuff were there. Kaia and Tiana and some others from Whitehall High School were there. Kaia was saying about me "Oh my God, you're so cute!" and telling Tiana she shouldn't have ditched me. I screamed and was trying to close my door. I saw Daryl around and I hadn't seen him in a year. There was a photo of him with dreadlocks. I saw this guy and I thought he was Gavin, but he was Co-Worker-M-02 or Acquaintance-M-06. This other guy looked like Terrence. I went to the movies with Mom and Ezra. Ezra sat with Mom in this big comfy chair. I had to look around for ages to find somewhere to sit and I sat next to some woman. She put her bag on my seat. Some girl sat next to me.
