I was with Ezra and someone. We were in a car and Mom was driving. I was in the front. I was doing some project where we had to ask people for stories and determine the theme. We knew Michael Fassbender somehow. We pulled up at a house and Ezra asked him for a story and he started telling one but it sounded weird and Mom picked up that it was a joke or film or something. I was then like 'oh no, it has to be about balance'. They all went back to the car and I was still inside with Fassbender. He asked me a few things about the project. My question was to either write about a western or a Yoshida film (it wasn't the actual Yoshida, though I went on Skype later and was like 'guess who I have to write about?'). I walked back to the car and went around to the passenger side and Fassbender went to the other side and I asked if he wanted to sit in the front and Ezra said 'yeah' and I said 'I'm not talking to you', but Fassbender was fine being in the back.
