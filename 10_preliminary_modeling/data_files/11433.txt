I was with two other friends both male and we were all coming out of Gruber's Bar when I saw a red Jaguar parked by the road. I informed my friends that I could start it so why didn't we take it. So we did but not with malice, but more as a thrill. I then became aware of the fact that there was only room for four to sit in the car. (A real Jaguar only has room for two but this had a rumble seat.) This then meant to me that if we picked up some girls there would not be enough romo in the car. The next thing I recall is that there were only two of us in the car, the driver and myself.
