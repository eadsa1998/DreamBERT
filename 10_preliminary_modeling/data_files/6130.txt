I had a dream that I was walking down the street and I had flagged a cab down. While driving in the cab I had had a baby. I started having contractions and my stomach was big. My sister who is pregnant walked by me and said, "Oh, thanks for having my baby for me. I couldn't do it." So I started having her baby for her. When the baby was delivered (in the cab) we picked her up and went about with our business.
