I was backing a new Ford out of a driveway. The car was loaded with people, none of whom I could recognize. There was a lot of snow on the ground, and I couldn't steer the car. I thought that the blue color of the car looked nice against the white snow. After I got it into the street, there were streetcar tracks which the car traveled on, so that I didn't have to steer it. A group of little children were throwing snowballs that kept breaking on the windshield.
