I went to a large movie theater with my wife. She went ahead of me down the aisle. It was so dark that I lost sight of her. I saw a figure entering one of the rows of seats and thinking it was she I followed her. Upon reaching the seats I discovered that my wife was in reality sitting in the row behind me. The girl I followed to the seat turned out to be a former schoolmate of whom I have neither heard nor thought of for at least five years. We both thought the situation very funny and laughed and laughed.
