I am standing in a field and have my hand pressed over my pounding heart. Not too far away I see Mary standing in this field. I tell her that I am worried/ concerned about my pounding heart and ask her to feel it and to tell me if it is really pounding as "abnormally" as I think it is. She is smiling and agrees to check it out. I don't know whether I cross the field to get to her, or whether she comes to me, but we do meet and she places her hand on my chest, over my heart.
