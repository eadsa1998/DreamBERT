I was in professor Teimes' classroom in Corp. Finance. The room was larger than usual. We had several women in the class, which is not as it is. The professor was asking the class questions on our work. Being unprepared, I feared the time when I would be asked a question. Finally I was asked a question, which evidently I answered all right, since there were none of the repercussions I had feared due to my unpreparedness.
