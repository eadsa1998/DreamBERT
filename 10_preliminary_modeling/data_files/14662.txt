I was at Nana's and she told me that she was going to Granma's for lunch "tomorrow". I said I wasn't and said that she didn't remember what food I didn't eat, as examples I used pumpkin and the salty gravy she made. I had a pedometer that said something I can't read. 24 was on the TV, then it was Heroes and there were lots of episodes on in a row up to episode 30. Robert Downey Jr was in the last few episodes. He was also in a music video with some girls. There was an Iron Man 2 thing and I said "oh, I've managed to not think about it for like 5 hours!". Also, I was watching a movie with Dad and Ezra and they asked for a big screen. There was something about Sin City 2. I was in a building where they got everything ready for the movie (Iron Man 2). I pressed a button and then it was part of the movie and I was disguised as Robert Downey Jr. This lady came and she talked to me and gave me an ID to use. The name was 'Rupert Sphincter' and there was information about 'him' too and he had a wife. This bad guy took it before I could read it all and asked me what my full name was. A friend of mine took it back. We went for a walk and I saw a cat. I was about to squeal "Gizmo!" but realized that would give it away and just said "a cat" instead and I gave it a pat. I was then at Nana's again and we watched this gay game show. Then it was Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Anya, character I didn't like and Willow were talking. Someone complained about cushions and Willow kept saying "Oh I hate cushions" and everyone else was like 'they're cool'.
