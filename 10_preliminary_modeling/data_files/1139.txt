I'm in Vietnam. 2 others and myself are defending ourselves. We form a triangle; we lay pieces of sugarless gum out to guard us. Hordes of soldiers come at us. We fire. I shoot down many helicopters. I get skilled at where I'm to aim in order to shoot off their propellers. A sense of danger and trusting the other 2 to do their share and protect my back, as I'm protecting theirs. Then I have a bag of diamonds and a bag of gold. I change my clothes from beautiful to plain so no one will know I have these riches. I am sneaking off with them.
