Blake stands facing me. There are paper clips and lights on strings between us. As Blake moves, a force pushes the metal things. I must run. I get into a black race car and drive rapidly away. I am running from Blake. He's following. I'm on a freeway that spirals and turns this way and that. I keep choosing roads that curve to the left because that takes me away from Blake. I get out into the country and find a special retreat of mine, a friend's house. I drive my car in and hide the car in a basement hall. I run up stairs to check the doors to see that they are locked. Safety pins are the locks. The house appears deserted. Old fashioned furniture, very few pieces and old lace curtains. Fallen leaves are all over the yard. I go back downstairs and check the doors and windows. A black out curtain is over the windows. I feel Blake outside. I sit very quietly. 2 other young women are there. One makes some noise that draws Blake's attention. I try to stop her. I explain that he's dangerous.
