I am attending a conference and have gone out to get lunch.  Walking back, along a city sidewalk, it is a long way to where I am going, and at one point I encounter a steep rise-like a wall, really, and can't go around it; I have to get over it, and I don't have the strength to do so.  A mother and her child climb it, though, and at the top is a bed.  I struggle and struggle, getting almost to the top but not having enough strength to pull myself the last few inches needed to get my leg over the top and onto the bed.  Finally I make it, but I am exhausted.
