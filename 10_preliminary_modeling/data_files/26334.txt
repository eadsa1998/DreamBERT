 My sister Ramona is in my mom's closet. She is a psychology major. She is sitting on the top shelf in the attic, above the racks for clothes. She has our family photograph with her. Something is wrong with her. She may have had a bad dream, or may want to commit suicide. I climb up to the top of the closet, and the wood shelves break.
