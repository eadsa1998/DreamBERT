We were in OHS class and Mr Jennings told Tristan that he would be failing him for being slack and talking too much in class. Tristan left and was really depressed. I tried to convince Mr Jennings that it was unfair and that he'd worked hard on the music video and did all his homework. Later I was collecting those Monopoly stickers from McDonald's cups I found around the place.
