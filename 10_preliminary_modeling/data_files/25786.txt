 There is another class trip to Australia. Different people are going. The flight and meeting times have changed because an heir to one of the professors is going with. My classmate Jim Barry is going again as a helper. A man who makes a living as a clown is going. I see some of the face of the people who are going. People are on two school buses. One is a short bus, and the other a long bus. I'm on the long bus. The driver is a black man with curly short frizzed out hair. He is listening to some oldies music. He seems laid back, and I like him. A car and the two buses are being chased. They are cornered in an alley by a strong gate that the buses can't break through. It seems like the downtown Wilmerton Post Office area, behind the building. One cowboy-like man runs at the gate, as if to knock it down, but it is then open, and when he jumps to kick it, he falls on his back. There is not a chase anymore. We are trying to get the gate opened. (197 words)
