Two nuclear subs are fighting and are going to blow. I start running away so I can escape radiation fallout. I run toward the coast range, up and up and up. Then I'm running up a narrow stairs to an attic. Something scary is after me. I lock the two doors on the stairwell and hide under debris in the attic near a window where I can look out and see the danger.
