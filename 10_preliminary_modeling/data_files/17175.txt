I saw my (deceased) maternal Grandpa Gerald again.  It didn't seem as though he fully welcomed my hug.  The strange thing was that he told me several Bible references.  Romans 1.1, 1.4, possibly 1.7 or "sevens".  I remembered thinking this was important, so I wrote them down in my dream so I could look them up later and find out what they were.
