I was the owner of a store. I think it was a hardware store or some kind of dry goods. I remember I was being in the process of being robbed at the time, and the robber was in there and he was shooting, not at me, but between myself and one of my customers. They were having a gun fight. I wasn't very involved in the whole thing. I was there, but not very involved until the end, until after they had been fighting long enough. I finally got a gun and I started shooting, myself, but I still don't know if I hit them or not. This was an all-male cast.
