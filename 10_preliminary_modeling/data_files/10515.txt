I am visiting in N. Town and as I say goodbye I talk to a tall, dark-haired woman, looks like Eleanor from my alma mater (ca. 1942). She asks me if I could come down on Sunday to relieve her - she is in charge of very busy physicians who come in to ask advice or help with library books. I ask: "Where would I stay ?" "At the L. Hotel." We shake hands firmly.
