I could hardly forget this dream as it involved the young lady I was extremely interested in at the time. The dream was merely this. I apparently was standing on the street, and she approached me. Very passively she walked up to me, and without any greeting she said that she would like me to see her engagement ring -- extending her arm as she spoke. As I looked at the ring, I couldn't even feel involved by sentiment. In the dream I was at that time concerned by the fact that I was not overcome by emotion nor was I angry.
