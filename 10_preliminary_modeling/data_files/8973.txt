I am at a family gathering with my mother's side of the family. It was at someone's home, though I'm not sure whose it was. It doesn't seem to be the annual reunion but I don't know why the gathering is being held. I'm inside talking to someone about some clay flowerpots and saucers. There is one that is about 7 or 8 inches in diameter. Someone is telling me that they got the flowerpot and the saucer for 1 cent each. I went through a door from the house into the garage. Just inside the garage to my right there was a set of shelves that was about 3 and a half feet high. There were some old, dirty clay flowerpots and saucers sitting on the top shelf. One or more of them are broken. There is a step leading from the house down into the garage. I am standing on that step when Larry K and Sue K arrive. We talk briefly about flowerpots. They say something about a good deal they found on some they recently bought, then Sue K goes inside. I point to one sitting on the top shelf and tell Larry he won't believe the deal I just got. I tell him that I just got one about that size for a penny. Maybe I said I got it for one cent because the person who actually did that had gotten it for me. I tell him that the one I got was a bit larger than the one I'm pointing to, and obviously not broken.
