There were zombies. I was in a shop with others and we were living there (it was just a food store). There was this cereal with blue cockroaches in it. Then I time traveled and Mom and Dad were there and they were young. I had to make them meet each other. Then I was back with the zombies and we had to leave. This guy and ran toward this forest. There wasn't much space between the trees when you got down far in the forest. The zombies were fast, but if you touched them they would pretty much crumble. We ran into the forest and hit them with branches. It started getting harder running between the spaces. There were heaps of zombies in there and we killed them all. Some wandered over to us and let us try to kill them but I couldn't stab through them. We eventually got them though. We had gamer-tags (like on X-Box 360) and one guy was called Erik-Sto (Erik Stolhanske) and he would get dares. Someone dared him to go back to this original tag and he said he was actually Michael Jackson. Then I found this community and I was staying with them. Jared Padalecki and Genevieve Cortese were getting married and everyone was outside the 'borders' and they spoke quickly, kissed and then everyone went back in. He broke down and cried and said "it's not happening" and she asked "us?" and cried and she said "no" and she cried out "forever?!" and he said he was dying and probably had about 6 months to live. One day it was really hot and the curtain was open and bright light was shining in.
