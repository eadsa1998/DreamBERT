I am in a room, trying to quickly pack my most essential belongings. The Nazis are coming to take me away and I must try and trick them so I will still have what I need. I am most concerned I have my cortisone pills. I try to gather them up off the bed. And hide them in two small purses. I figure if there are two purses they might find one and I'd still have the other one. There are large books, like dictionaries and reference books I decide to pile them onto the other books and papers in the bookshelf, hoping that the people who own the house will keep them there for me in case I survive and return. A woman comes in and she sees what I did. She understands. She is warning me the Nazi's are here. She is scared for me and I am scared also.
