 I'm near my neighbor Anna Gates' house with my sister Heather. Anna is living next door to where she does in real life. I knock on the door. Heather and I have garden hoses. Heather's water spray is spread out like a sprinkler. My spray is in a straight stream: I have adjusted the nozzle. Anna comes to the door. Heather and I spray our family, who run in the alley in their swimsuits. My sister Ramona, brother Wally, and my parents are there. I don't remember seeing Wally. I spray the family. I time the spray so I spray just a bit of water, and it is aimed ahead of the person. I hit my mom with a nice shot, and laugh. My dad is young, and has a dark beard. The whole family is younger. We decide where to eat. I think of Subway, but we decide the Grease Pit. We get nine burgers. I order two. We get one or no orders of French fries. It costs $90.99. My mom is going to write a check. I object to this outrageous price! My friend Matt Yams is working and he checks the price. It is 14 dollars and change. It is their mistake. Matt tells us he keeps a journal in the bathroom in which he writes bad things about some of his employees. He says he called the other day to see how I was doing. He is planning to go to Boundary Town for the fishing opener. He says he's fishing for himself this year. I am about to tell him about my job in the Big Resort Area.
