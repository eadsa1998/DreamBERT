I remember my dad was mowing the lawn and my mom went outside with him because my little sister couldn't be outside because she is really young. I hadn't gone outside yet because I had to put my shoes on. While I was inside, I saw my mom walk out of her bedroom, but I remembered that my mom had gone outside, so I looked out the window and I saw another one of my mom. So that meant that there was two of my mom, so I screamed.
