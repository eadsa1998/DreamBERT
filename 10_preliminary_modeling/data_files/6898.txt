At a lecture. Had left green umbrella but some one brought it to me and I laid it on the next seat, but when I got up, a lady picked it up and walked off with it. Hurrying after her in a crowd, I managed to retrieve it. I told my friend she may have taken it on purpose but probably in error for her own.
