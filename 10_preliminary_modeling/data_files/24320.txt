I walked toward campus along university avenue and went into a bar. It looked like one of those dive places with poorly painted walls where hipsters hang out. It was crowded. I sat at the bar and ordered a burger. Just give me your regular burger. The bartender gave me a shot of something pink to boot. There was no barstool. I was balancing on the ledge of something under the bar. The girls next to me were drunk and stacking the chairs. The person to my right was passing out and I kept nudging him away. The bar phone rang. It was Nick, my old college roommate. Hey man, you're there and not visiting us? I was hungry. I left and there was this Kaplan (LSAT prep) guy talking. I asked how many points our score would increase. He had a beard. "I took the test f-five times. And let's say I scored... quite high." he said.
