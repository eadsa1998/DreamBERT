I picked some horses and I was surprised they didn't win. I noticed one out. I thought it was a sure winner, but it didn't win. I can't recall the others now. I sneaked up and stole some cheese in big slices and some grapes and put them beside Frank Zupanik. I was like in the army. We had a lady cornered in her room with a machine gun. She was against us. I sneaked into her room and hid behind the davenport and gave my friends the high sign when the woman arrived from being out. The boys opened fire on her and we captured her. I was watching two armies come close to each other and one didn't know of the other being there. One had nude women with the men. The American men would see one of the women put a bayonet against her back and make her go down underground and pull the cover over her. They seemed to have holes in the ground. Bob was diving thru the air and another big kid ran in front of him and they both went down. I ran over and thought Bob was hurt, but he was stunned, but not hurt. I bawled out the kid for what he did. I picked about 11 horses on paper and when I was going to bed, I asked myself subconsciously which horse would be a sure winner and Outrank seemed to come to me and come to me, that I was repeating it over and over. This was in waking stage, not asleep. It was after midnight and it was the 28th.
