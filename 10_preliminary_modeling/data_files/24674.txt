I was buying makeup and I was choosing all these different colors and the lady (at the counter, who wasn't nice) kept saying all my choices were bad or they didn't have any more. Setting: Makeup store. Characters: The lady at the counter, who wasn't nice and I don't know her, and myself. Feelings and Thoughts: Annoyed. Like slapping her. I really don't know.
