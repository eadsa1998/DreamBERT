I was looking at a detailed map of the city. It had the last names of the people who lived on each street printed on it where their house would be on the street. I was looking for my name at the end of Lakeland Dr. I was going to be moving back into the house that I used to own there. Connie B was living in the house next door, just as she did in waking life when I sold that house. I was talking to her, I think by phone. She was telling me how much free time she has these days and how much she would like us to get back to having coffee together frequently. She told me to come over most any time. It was a Saturday morning. I was thinking about the conversation I had previously with Connie, and considering walking over to her house to see if she was busy. I debated if I should call first, though we never used to do that.
