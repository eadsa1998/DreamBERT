I was at CIIS. Michael T was looking for someone to marry. He wanted a marriage of convenience. I think he wanted an older woman that he could learn from. He asked me and I told him I would need to give it some thought. All of our classmates wanted me to say yes. Perhaps it was the next day that he and I were walking some of the trails discussing it. I had my arm linked through his. The feelings both ways were very warm. I told him that he is an amazing man, but asked him if he loved me and he said no. I told him that is why I can't marry him. Because when I do marry the next time, it will be for love.
