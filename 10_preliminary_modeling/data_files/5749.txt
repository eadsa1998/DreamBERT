[1997-06-04] I was sitting on the porch with my wife and son and my wife said "This is going to be my last smoke, I am not going to smoke anymore after this. I'm quitting after this one." Then we were talking about cancer and why smoking is bad for you. Then she lit up another one and said "This one is going to be my last one." Then the scene switched, and we were inside some kind of church and somebody, a young girl perhaps, was up front talking about "since God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son" and was trying to explain something about John 3:16. But I was trying to explain something totally different to my son, just sitting there talking right out loud, thinking I should really be quiet because we're disrupting the service, but we went right on with our conversation anyway.
