Frank swims across lake with a small duck: then he floats through drain pipe, but emerges O.K. Then he swims on and gets flushed down an open vent I fear him drowned. I look for an official, find him, very worried; also lose a Kotex with blood on it. Then I find Frank emerging wet and smiling. Meet at his parents' home at other side of the lake.
