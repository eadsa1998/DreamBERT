I can't remember properly, but it was like the movie 'They Live'. This lady with short black hair was on TV and her name was Anita Noo. They were taking aliens everywhere. Her voice kept going alien like. She was saying stuff like 'pretend', 'don't answer to your home (?)' and something about the number 31076. They said they were coming tomorrow and insisting that we couldn't live without them.
