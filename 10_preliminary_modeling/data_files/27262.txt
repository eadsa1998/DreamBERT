I was in a large ballroom with many couples. We were all sitting around talking when N., my boyfriend who is 20 years old, said some nasty remarks. I was very surprised and I felt hurt all evening. The next thing I remembered I was in my house talking to L., N.'s friend, trying to inquire if N. meant what he said. He said he didn't know. The next thing I dreamed we were broken up. I went around asking everyone who I saw, "Is it true?"
