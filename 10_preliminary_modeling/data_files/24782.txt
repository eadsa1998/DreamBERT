I was walking down the street when a door appeared in front of me. I opened it and walked into a sky with clouds to walk on. Then there was a glowing as this beautiful necklace appeared. I put it on and it granted me wishes (like a kitten, and meeting some celebrities). Setting: On the sidewalk, then the sky, then back on earth. Characters: I was in my dream of course, and a kitten I wished for and some celebrities I wished to meet. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, curious. I was happy all the way through, curious when I opened the door, and happy about the wishes.
