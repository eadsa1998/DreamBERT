Some guy named Miles is in his mother's sleazy bar. I come in. Miles' eyes are ugly, burnt brown, whites, ridges where it should be smooth, pale, watery, no teeth. He's an alcoholic. I feel repulsed but feel sorry for him. I agree to marry him, knowing I don't want to. I keep trying to see him as handsome. After a struggle, he has teeth, healthier hair, and his eyes are normal. We leave for our honeymoon. I see a lake, green, smooth, calm, with living trees under the water. It's a complete forest. Several people are fishing at the edge. "No beach," says I. We go on.
