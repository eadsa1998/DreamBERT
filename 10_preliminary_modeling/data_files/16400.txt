I was, I got like a, it was not like a mini disc machine, but it was sort of like that, and it came with five or six packs of like little mini CD R's and it was like a mini disc, except the medium was CD's instead of they're like mini CD's. And I don't remember actually, but I remember thinking how good it was that I had five or six packages of these things. And I don't remember too much except I think Dad wanted me to wrap it up and take it down to like the beach or something so that we could have a party out there and I could like open it for my birthday or something. And then suddenly the scene shifted, and I was in the downstairs bedroom listening to a couple CD's, and I dreamt there was a CD changer in there, which there really isn't, and it was like 6:00 o'clock in the morning when I was doing this. And Mom comes in and all of a sudden I was trying to turn it down because I'm a little embarrassed that I'm like just here. And she said, "It's alright, it's alright," and something like that. She told me something else that she's going to do. She's like going to do something in the kitchen or something. So she goes in the kitchen and all of a sudden the kitchen radio in there, I had the notion that it's a CD changer also, and all of a sudden the CD that I was listening to jumps over there to her and she has to listen to it, and it was kind of a dumb one. And I can't remember anything more. I think I woke up after that. There was something else I remember about this dream now. For some reason, after Mom and I had talked, I was laying there on the bed thinking up a story.
