This guy was in jail and was going to escape [started watching Prison Break last night]. I was then at Mom's and was going to have a bath. As I was undressing Mom asked "Are you ready for your things?" and I said "I dunno". I had died, I think and it was a documentary of me. I was talking to Ezra later. I was then outside this building. Ms Solomon was there and it was a game or something. She left and these people made jokes about her name. The jail guy had developed a habit of enjoying vomiting. His son or something ended up in there too. They would do something wrong so they would go to jail. At the end of the movie, his daughter also liked vomiting (it was a 'twist') and she stole something in a cop station and the cops came. I took a bite of this food thing and it was disgusting and I looked inside and it was all black and moldy like. I almost threw up. I was then at home and people from school were there, including Eugene. There were photos of everyone on the floor and I found Eugene's and it was a really nice photo. The teacher was using a photo as an example and picked up Genevieve', which was a really bad photo and it had gotten ruined and she couldn't use it. There was some guy dressed as a character, which was dressed in a soldier's uniform. I was thinking I would go as Rick (The Young Ones).
