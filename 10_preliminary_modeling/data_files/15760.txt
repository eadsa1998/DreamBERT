I had this pet lion and flew to Malaysia with it for some reason. Aunt Sally and co also had something to do with it. I was with the boys, but I only remember Nathaniel specifically, and she was coming on another flight. I had to give the lion up to a zoo or something and I can't remember what happened, but it was then a film and at the end it showed the main character and a 'baby lion' (which was actually a fluffy Labrador) on a lounge.
