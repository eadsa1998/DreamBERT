I put some water in a dish and the rice turned into worms and crawled around. I saw a small bug on the wall. I tried to squash it, but couldn't. I came to the stove to shake off the clothes from bugs and the ants that ran around on the floor. I was running. I built a fire in a fireplace I had, then I put coal up it so the fire would last to do some cooking. I had a hose and I put the water on and did it squirt far.
