I was flying over a field. I tried to go thru a window. Ann and I were visiting by Barsa. Mr. Barsa was very talkative. She was kidding Ann. We had drinks at the house. I drove thru a place that was partly blocked and a policeman was shaking his head at me for going thru. I yelled at him. I was behind the truck and couldn't see the blockade till I was almost going thru it, then it was too late to turn back. Mrs. Barsa knocked on the bedroom door and Ann went in to talk to Mr. Barsa.
