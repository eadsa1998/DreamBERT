Bobbie and I were walking at the park and saw a lake. So then I look at Bobbie and then jump in the water. I swim to the other side and I'm in the desert. I jump onto a camel and ride on and on. Then I meet a new friend, and a man tries to kidnap us, so we run and I meet a really cute boy named Joe, and we get married. Then I woke up. Setting: First at a park, then in the desert. Characters: Bobbie was walking with me in the park and also kinda shy. Joe was a cute, sexy (embarrassing) man. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, weird. When I jumped in the water it felt weird, and when that man tried to kidnap me I was scared. When I got married I was worried.
