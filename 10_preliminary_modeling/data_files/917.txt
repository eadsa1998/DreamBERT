I'm in the back seat of a car. Terence (my cousin) gets in with me. He wants to neck. He starts kissing me and so forth. I accept it but feel not too good about it. He's my cousin and there are other people in the car. It starts to feel good sexually so I think, "Eh, what the heck." Then he says, "You turn and change position." He had been touching my breast. Now he wants me to touch his penis. I sit up and move away. I think, "No, that's going to far. I don't want to." I start talking to other people in the car (my parents in front, and my brother Dwight next to us). We're driving country roads. My father stops the car by a mailbox to look at a shallow stream. There might be good rock hounding material there. My mother is embarrassed because someone is getting their mail and might wonder why we stopped by their mail box. My father is annoyed with my mother and vice versa. We then drive on. We come to Ka-ne-ta, an Indian Resort. There are lots of people. My father points one out. He calls him a special name. He's a Chief or something. I decide to knit. I open a package, a kit. Part of the knitting has been done. It's a delicate lacy pattern, pink, baby sweater-like.
