I'm a "soda jerk." Lots of people are crowded in. They are all singing because the boss, a good-looking young man is. I mouth the words because he is watching, and then I just stop. I don't want to sing, even if I lose my job. A plump man comes to my left and asks me to please tell him what the 4th of July is like. He looks at me like, "Don't laugh, I'm serious." I feel like laughing, after all, everyone knows what 4th of July is like. Then I think, "Maybe he's a foreigner or something." I glance over at my boss who's watching and take the time from my job to explain to him. "It's when families get together and go off to parks or camping. Some fish, some hike, and some hunt. Then I remember, "Oh, lots of food and other families go to the city park and watch fireworks." I realize that I should have told him that first because that's the more American traditional way. My boss stands by me and indicates I should be working.
