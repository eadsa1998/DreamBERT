I was walking out of a tavern with a glass of beer in my hand when a bull came up to me from behind and bumped me. The jolt knocked the beer out of my hand. This angered me. I turned around and faced the bull and grabbed his horns. I started wrestling the bull like they wrestle calves in rodeos. Luckily the bull wasn't big, but his horns were. I was on my back on the ground holding on to his horns, trying to bring him down. [annoyance, neither pleasant or unpleasant, no color]
