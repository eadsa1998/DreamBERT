I am in a car with my friend Mark. Mark is totally blind and so am I. The interesting thing about this is that I am driving the car. I am driving the car from somewhere to my house. I don't know how I seem to know where to go, but I seem to know. I told him that I am going to drive us home and I'm doing it. I always wished that I could drive although this is the first dream I have ever had where I'm doing it. The main senses I used in this were hearing because I could listen to him and hear what he was saying, I could hear the other traffic around me. And feeling. I could feel the upholstery around me in the car, the steering wheel. I was driving the car, that's all there is to that dream.
