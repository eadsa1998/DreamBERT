My teeth were falling out and I ended up with like 3 (they had fallen out like this before). I went to the doctor. I had to get a ticket like when you get meat from a shop. I grabbed two and later this girl got there and I gave it to her -- the tickets were in the 50's, but it was now up to the 130's. I don't know what happened there but I was then at a shop. Mom had a raffle on. There were 10 slices of cake to win. She won a piece and she let me pull out some of the winners. I closed my eyes and it said "Scratched" and I was like 'who the hell is that?' but it was Santiago. He came and got cake.
