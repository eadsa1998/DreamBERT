I was watching One Tree Hill. Jamie, now that he was older, wanted to get more involved with exciting storylines. He asked Haley if he was going to be in 15 episodes and she said he was only in 11. He fell or was going to fall and I thought Nathan would catch him. There was a flashback in the next episode with Keith.
