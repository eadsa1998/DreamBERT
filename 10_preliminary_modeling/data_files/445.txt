This second dream is a continuance of the first dream. After I left the beach, I was inside of a house that I didn't recognize with two ex-housemates of mine. One of them is male and the other a female, and they were dating at the time I was living with them. I was in a large room, a spacious main room, when a big buff biker man drove into the house in a car and made a big mess. I had a feeling that he was my boyfriend, but I had never seen him before. Then I saw the car being destroyed and the room along with it. I noticed a hubcap turn into a blade on a circular saw and go crashing into the left side of the wall. From where I was standing in the room I was facing the car and the destruction. Half of the blade was stuck inside of the wall and half was sticking out. Then I seemed to replay the dream again; it was the same as before, but went a little further, like a movie. The crash happened like before, but this time the blade went flying through the air. It barely missed hitting my friend, the girl who I used to live with. Then her boyfriend and the guy I used to live with said to me in a calm voice as he was cleaning up the mess the blade left in the wall, "You have to have a talk with your boyfriend. It's not good for us to keep cleaning up after he crashes his car in our house." I agreed with him and then turned around and the biker guy was there and went up to the guy I lived with and said he was sorry that he crashed into our house and wouldn't do it again. Then the biker guy helped fix the damage done to the wall. When the biker guy and my ex-male roommate were plastering up the wall, it started to have an unusual look to me. It looked like they were putting puzzle pieces back onto the wall.
