Ezra did something at Westland University too. His teachers were the ones I had last year. I was in math and it was weird? I took the same train and bus but I didn't get off. He looked behind and said he would try and look closer? This part is hard to read but it looks like it says that I (?) said "you'll remember the truck (?) all by yourself?" Then something that looks like 'moochy l'. I was looking for a desk at this place. But, wherever the desk was the space had to come with it, so I was trying to find one with a good amount of space. I found one and I pressed a button to try it, there was a huge computer and an old mouse, but it said physical contact was needed. I went to this room to touch the guy and he said to stop and then put his hands up. My hands were sweaty and he was 40-60? He took my hand and said "ooh, that'll do". I thought that was kind of creepy, but ignored it. We went back to the computer and he said clothes came with it. He gave them to me and he went to lock the door. I put the shirt on over my shirt but it fit well. He said "these are the sleeves" and they looked strait-jacket like and I decided to leave. There was a door behind me leading outside. Then it was a movie or something. This person was saying that they should let him rape them. Mr Garrison (South Park) had died instead? Someone said "But Lisa wasn't so lucky" and they were talking about The Simpsons. Whoever it was climbed up this wooden frame, and at the top was the guy's room. There was a singer guy and he was at a concert on stage. He ripped his clothes off and a fake penis fell off. I can't remember who I thought it was but it said Dancing in the Dark, but it was Cover Me and I realized it was Bruce Springsteen. Jeremiah was also over earlier and said something that I can't read.
