[I stepped on a scorpion in my house a few nights earlier. It did not sting me, but I killed it when I stepped on it, and I felt really bad about that.]  Dream:  I was shown the scorpion I stepped on, up closer.  I could see exactly where I had stepped on it, it's body, where the poison came out, more detail  There was more explanation about how it died.  I was with some people.  Something about the place reminded me of the Escalante River Canyons and Mondo.  We were showing each other things.  One person had a large shirt on, and on the back was stuff about Ed Abbey, maybe even his actual signature.  Some slight feeling about selling these shirts at Mondo.
