I am in a tall building where I have an apartment. A friend, who is a therapist, lives there. she has a bee hive. Something happens that she has to move the hive and heater across the room. The heater looks like a plastic gallon milk bottle and it is behind her head on the wall, like a pillow. My son becomes sensitive to bees, although he has not been stung. I tell the therapist if she needs hot water she can get it from me. I dream I am getting cramps in my lower leg.
