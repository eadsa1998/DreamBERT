I was in a classroom and there was a fire drill-except that it was for real.  There were sirens and flashing lights outside, and a female voice came over the PA system telling us what steps to follow, which belongings to pick up first, etc.  It was exciting, and I was a little scared, since there was a real danger.  When we left, by the front door, there was at least one black, maybe more, outside, and I was nervous for my safety.  I went as quickly as possible without seeming panicky to a low, sloping retaining wall at the left of the school, climbed that, and headed for home (the townhouse in the previous dream).  There were big shrubs on either side, and it was night-and I saw to my surprise that there was a light on inside.  When I started to put my key in the lock, it began to turn from the inside.  I stepped back, and the door opened, and there was a man in the doorway. I woke up at this point, moaning loudly.
