I was watching something with Quentin Tarantino and he said "We slide up next to each other and try to make it half way" and he was talking about some guy called Quentin, who was a writer. We were at Midvale shops and Quentin Tarantino was there. He was coming over to the car and Dad quickly left and he said it was because they knew each other and he was always trying to give Poppa jobs.
