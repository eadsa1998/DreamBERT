I was a patient in a hospital. I had to urinate and I went to a place where a wall the height of my waist hid my lower body from view. My trousers were down and my underwear was open in the back. A man saw me urinate and he commented to another man that I have a strong flow of urine. Later a patient was getting discharged and I shook hands with him. Then I went into the dormitory and lay in my bed. A man came by who resembled a classmate of mine in grammar school named Robert Effan. Two patients had an argument and went to the officer with their grievances. Robert Effan lay in the bed next to me, and my buttocks was facing him. I was nude. He fondled my buttocks. Later I went with the other patients to the shops where we worked. We passed a railroad siding. The man guiding the patients was dignified like a clergyman. Later I was near an old elevator. I was in bed in a strange dormitory. I hoped the patient in the next bed was friendly. In the morning the patients were talking about the dormitory. I felt very lonely.
