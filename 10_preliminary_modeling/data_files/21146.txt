I was in the army at war. We were mopping up the enemy without any interference at our main post. I saw a sign with a direction pointer. It said, "To France." I was walking thru the brush. I saw a wild animal like a cat or tiger. I stopped and picked up a stick. The animal started to walk away slowly. I gave out a loud roar and the animal disappeared. A fellow in the other direction heard my roar and got scared and ran near a store or building and told a man what he heard. The man got an air rifle and shot in my direction. He hit my shoe, so I yelled at him and walked towards him. When I got there, a couple of men said, "There are a couple hot babes there." I looked and I saw two old women with men's working gloves on. I walked up steps and a fellow playfully jumped on my back. Then I saw another one jump for me. I ducked and grabbed him by the arm as he missed my back and landed on the steps. I was wanted downstairs, so I started down and I ducked again and a fellow went over my head down the steps. I slid or glided down the steps. I beat a lion with a baseball bat.
