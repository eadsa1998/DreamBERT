I saw a boy running across a street to catch a bus. He had to run to the other side of the street in order to get to the bus stop. The boy was so close to the bus, and he kept running and didn't seem to be getting anywhere. The bus kept moving ahead and the driver was sitting up so high that he couldn't see the boy running across in front of the bus and very close to it. I woke up and never did know whether the boy got to the other side of the street or not.
