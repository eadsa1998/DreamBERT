 Stephen and I are at our college, Brimson, but it's different. There is a sloping hill and a Tom Thumb store. We are throwing or shooting firecrackers. We throw one at a kid. He tosses it inside a nearby building, through a little hole. It blows up, breaking down the wall of the building. Stephen and I go into a small door. The room we go into is large and bare. It's painted completely blue with rust patches all over. The room is then the top of a mushroom cloud water tower. Gino Teavor is there. There is a door on the other side of the room, straight across from the door we entered. I go to the far door and carefully peer out. It is a long way to the ground. I lay down and put my head out the doorway. There is another building with an old blue rusted top. I look out the other door. There is a police car below with its lights on. I look below my feet. There is a grate with rung steps going down the center of the water tower. Outside there is a rope going down the side of the tower. If I go outside the police might shoot me. So I take the grate off and start climbing down, going as fast as I can. I don't know if Stephen or Gino follow. When I get to the bottom of the tower, I fight with a fat police officer. I think the other officer is hurt. Stephen and Gino aren't there, or they are bystanders. I throw a hollow metal tube about 6 feet long at this officer. I miss. He throws it back, and I dodge it. He jumps up as I swing, and it goes under his feet.
