Am in a department store or supermarket and look at a list of prices and realize they are very high. Approaching an escalator, I see a woman getting on and I rush over to pull her off, shouting, "She's a Russian!" Later am talking to the store manager, who wears a white jacket, and I tell him I saw a Russian. He then replies calmly, "I also am Russian." I look at him in utter astonishment and am embarrassed.
