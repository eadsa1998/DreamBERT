["Making fancy beaded dresses."] I make a fancy dress with ruffles, chiffon materials and bead work on them. I take one to the store to have them sell it. Then I realize it's not ready yet. I withdraw it and go home to make them better. I have made four and am on the fifth one. I am ironing the frail chiffon bodice with interesting tucked patterns. I have an ironing board set up like a professional work station so I can be more efficient.
