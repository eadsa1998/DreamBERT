Mom, Ezra and I were at someone's house. Austin was there and he was doing something with tobacco. I was picking at the food and Mom thought I was trying to 'look cool'. I felt dizzy. Ezra was asleep. I was outside and my laptop was in the car, because it downloaded faster. Ezra, Dad and I were at some place, with The Simpsons playing on a huge screen. Pokemon and Invader Zim also appeared somewhere.
