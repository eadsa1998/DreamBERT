Discussing with someone what "tsau-loh" meant. A woman had asked if it was good Chinese and what it meant. Cousin Mer.'s answer was not clear. I spoke up and said, "It means done, finished, doesn't it? Like when you've finished your sewing." I smiled at her indicating her work. Then I said that I used to think Shanghai, Ningpol and Soochow dialects very different but many words are the same in all and I understood the Soochow right off.
