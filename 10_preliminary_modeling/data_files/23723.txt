In a car with people (women) from jail.  They are rough people.  talk rough, tough, we're off to do something.  I see my camera slip out the window and see it on the street, see the car run over it.  I get a little hysterical about going back to get it.  We do, some of the women cursing about it.  Notes 2/92:  This reminds me of that vivid memory from first grade - when my drawing flew out the window of the Maverick while Mom was driving the Montessori carpool of kids home.  I flipped, made Mom go back and get it - I couldn't lose that manifestation of my creativity.  Always thought the lesson there was giving up materiality, holding on too much to the past and material things instead of relying on my continued creativity.
