I was in my apartment. It was raining hard. People and strangers were all hanging around, waiting for some tremendous event, like a hurricane, to happen. We flitted around the restaurants nearby. I returned to wait. To play Halo, the video game, or rather, to consider playing it as I tried to get work done with the usual noise happening all around. I walked outside to the porch, reminded me of the porch in a house I once lived in, only it was the front parking lot of the apartment I lived in while a junior in college. I was just chilling--it was really late--so late, it was almost early. The college student newspaper I had worked for had gotten out. And then co-worker I was attracted to, Sue, appeared through the sliding glass door. She was wearing a blue nightgown, with a deep v between her breasts, which seemed much bigger than normal. She looked amazing. I told her that. She really was the most amazing thing I had ever seen, with her golden locks flowing down over her shoulders. She was trying to get reception on her Cingular phone. She had a booster. I told her there used to be a receiver or something on the roof.
