I am in an elevator, and realize it is broken and falling downward fast.  It goes past so many floors.  It is lit up inside.  I have time on the downfall to realize it will hit the bottom and I will die.  I am okay with this.  Partly it's knowing ahead of time, no surprises, that makes it okay with me.  Partly I am just okay with it, I've had enough life.  I am wondering when it will hit, it should be pretty soon.  I think about that kind of death, I'll get pretty smushed, but dead, so who cares.  Then I feel warmth, hot at the bottom and lower sides of the elevator.  It is a fire outside the box, the friction of the fall caused the fire, and I realize I will die by fire.  That is even better, it is humorous to me, after all the fires I was in while firefighting, to die by fire.  I like that better.  I am sort of waiting for death, the fire, to take me.  Then the elevator is pulled back up, or out.  I am saved, and not too happy about it.  I wait for whoever pulled it up to get me out, the elevator is glass or see-through now, they are taking so long, I see a girl through the glass and tell her please hurry, I'm getting claustrophobic in here.  And I am, the walls are right against me like a coffin, I feel like I am in a coffin standing upright, I am getting panicky feeling those walls around me, feel a need to get out quick.
