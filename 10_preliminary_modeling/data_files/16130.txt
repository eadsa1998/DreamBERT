Melinda and I were at school and we were supposed to meet Mrs. Talmadge during fourth period for some reason. And fifth period we were going to go and see "Little Thing" or something, and in sixth period we wanted to leave, but she wanted to call Mrs. Dougherty and find out what we were doing that day. But I knew I, we got to fourth period where we got to see Mrs. Talmadge and I was really nervous and all, and we got there and we just talked like normal people do, and before I knew it, we were in a gift shop together looking at things and talking like normal people. And she bought me this sheep pin. I think that this dream occurred because when I was listening to the tape with Grammy on it, she kind of, sort of, remotely sounded similar to Mrs. Talmadge.
