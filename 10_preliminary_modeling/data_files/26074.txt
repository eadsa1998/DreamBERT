 I'm dancing with my friend Bill Hanson, his girlfriend Ingrid Dorth, and our classmate Erin. There is a sheet or blanket around us as we dance very close to each other, partially wrapped up in the blanket. I seem to be having sex. I know I am dreaming and I want to see if I can ejaculate just from the rhythmic movement of my body, which is in rhythm with a fan. It's like touch less masturbation. I give myself fellatio.
