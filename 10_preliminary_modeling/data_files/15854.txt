I was outside with some people and there were some dark clouds looming, and I suggested we get into this plane, which we did but this guy started flying it and I was like 'I didn't mean to fly it' and then he said something like one of the guys in the group had to die, so he parked it in this water but it was shallow so we walked out. Then everyone picked a Pokemon toy, and they had Cyndaquil, Psyduck, Mewtwo and this pink one that wasn't a real Pokemon and I chose that one.
