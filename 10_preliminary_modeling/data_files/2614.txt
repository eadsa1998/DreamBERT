A man who is stupid (mr?) or behaves stupid, lives in a rich mansion. I am there and feel sure that somewhere in this man is intelligence. I am convinced that he'd been treated badly as a boy and that's why he behaves like he doesn't know anything. I look out a window and see a huge bay or backwater. A man is wading, looking for the spot where treasure is. He thinks he finds it in a corner near the land by the house. His pants are up to his thighs and the water up to his knees. He doesn't find the treasure. The water isn't as deep as I thought it would be. Instead he swoops down and picks up a pair of thick black-framed sunglasses with rhinestones on the side pieces. He goes off with it. I yell out, "Hey, don't you take that; it's mine." He runs off. I go back in the house, concerned and intrigued by the man. The key word to his problems is, "boy." I see his father, an older, balding man, and speak with him. I confront him and say it was his bad treatment that made the man stupid. The father is arrogant and emotionally flippant. I tell him I want to investigate the man/boy's past. He agrees and seems quite willing in a negligent way to supply all the stored things remaining of the past. He brings me, one box at a time, three boxes, big flat ones. I open them and find a leather cowboy chaps/pants the boy wore. I find a yellow heavy plastic playsuit. It's cute and in excellent condition. I find some grade reports, a teacher's note in the 1st grade music book. I can pinpoint the problem to the 1st or 2nd grade, but nothing conclusive. I begin to suspect the father knows that and that's why he's cooperating. I go to visit his teacher. She says the boy always had problems.
