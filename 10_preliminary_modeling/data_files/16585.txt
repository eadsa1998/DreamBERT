I was back in Westport again and that we were walking with Sandra. She had come to town. And apparently it was one of those things where she got home from the airport and she rented a car to get to our place. And she didn't do that much unpacking; she just put her bags down and we went for a walk. And she had some shoes that she couldn't walk in very well, and we didn't get too far. Then I had the notion that Mom and Dad were having some kind of a tiff and were trying to hide it from Sandra, as usual. And apparently Sandra kind of thought she wanted to go to a nice _____ shop, but she realized she wasn't going to get that far in those shoes of hers, so we turned around and I'm trying to think, there was something else to this whole thing. I can't remember what it was though. And then it seemed that I flipped to this other scene where I was in the living room there in Westport and my computer was set up on the roll top desk. And I needed to download some Norton updates and I wanted Mom to sit next to me while I did it, so she would get used to what that looked like and realize that none of the operation like that is a big ordeal or a bad thing. And so she pulled up the other chair -- actually in this dream I got up and she moved the big round chair in, and I kind of sat on her lap and I kind of did the navigating because she wanted me to, and she sat with her arm around my shoulder and kind of watched. And I think towards the end something might have screwed up. I think that the updates required me to restart and I couldn't restart for some reason. Something was still running or something got screwed or something. And Mom was like, "Oh yeah, that always happens," because it seems like for her nothing ever goes right. And then I woke up.
