I'm at work, sort of - haven't started yet, and I'm gonna go around to the cafeteria and get some coffee (this is a very big place - the cafeteria has a full staff and everything). There isn't any made, but the guy behind the counter gives me some orange juice. I taste it but don't want it, I'll make some coffee. I'm still a little groggy, though - I pour the coffee grounds into my orange juice. O dear. I look around nonchalantly to see if anybody's looking, and walk casually out. Nobody notices. I decide to go to the doctor that I heard about from some patrons. He's not far away, I'll just pop in while it's still early. I park my car next to the building, it's just a dirt parking lot with trees around, as if it was out in the country, though it's not. The building is old, converted from something. I go in through an unused room into a little waiting room, very homey, old couches, magazines strewn everywhere. There's several other people there, housewives by the look of them, with one or two kids among 'em. I sit on a couch and start to look at this comic or illustrated book I've brought with me - it's Batman or something. The doctor comes out and calls somebody in - he looks nice, shortish, plumpish, smiling, pleasant face. I eventually realize I haven't told anybody I was coming here and it's almost time to start work. I'd better go on back. Frustrating. I go on out to the street. It's several lanes and fast traffic, how am I going to get across? I wait a while and then realize I left my car in the parking lot back there. Good grief, what a dork. Better turn around.
