Mary and I were somewhere. We had to fill out these forms, it had something to do with getting into a place or something. There were a lot of people around whom I cannot identify but we could hear them or occasionally brush into one. It seems as if the forms were something which we should have filled out before we got there. Apparently everyone there had to fill out these forms and before we could get there to this place, it might have been summer, it was warm out, may have had something to do with camp. There were 20 or 30 pages to fill out. There seemed to be a lot of trees around. I know I had 3 or 4 more dreams but they were all mixed up.
