I was coming home on a bus at night, talking to Kate Booth.  She was very friendly-I was surprised.  When my stop came, I said, "I'll see you," but she got up also.  She said she lived across the street from me-and I did remember seeing her there.  She asked me to come in.  It was a crowded little basement apartment.  Seems like her mother or grandmother or someone else was there.
