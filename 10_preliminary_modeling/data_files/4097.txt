["Arrogant Ginny, Angry Ernie"]  I am in a house, staying with Ginny and Ernie. Ginny is trying to help me and has gone into a garage or attic to get something for me. I am waiting impatiently. Ernie comes in, angry, frustrated. He is tired of Ginny messing up all the time. He is fuming and saying "Arrogant!" He stands with his back to me, looking out the window. I want to leave. But Ginny is taking so long. I finally do go outside. I hear Ginny coming to the garage door saying "Set A, Set B, Set C" She is counting the keys in key sets to make sure they are all there. It isn't a task that will help me pack. It is simply one task she got diverted to and is lost in trying to get it accomplished.
