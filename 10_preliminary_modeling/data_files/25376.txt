 I am transferring from Brimson College to the University of Kentucky. It is a dark, rainy night. My friends Ivory Alshire, Cheryl Wrightson, and Kari Kosslyn are with me. Kari has a compass. My friends Beth Mock and Darlene Miller are also there. We run down a hill on a road. We are in a place where there is limestone. I need to get three different types of limestone. There is a grocery cart there, and a long pole. I think I am sitting in the cart. One of my language arts teachers from high school, Dale Zimmer, is there. He says we should have parked in the Quaint Books parking lot, which is nearby.
