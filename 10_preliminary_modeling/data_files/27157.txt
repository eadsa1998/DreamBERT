I was living with my family in a neighborhood of large, impressive houses. The neighbors were not very friendly. I was standing on a lawn feeling lonely when my aunt appeared. She is about forty. Suddenly, down the street, rode my grandmother on a bright red motor scooter. She was riding very fast and going around corners all the time. My aunt just smiled indulgently. Then a group of girls came up to me and said they had heard my father was a famous baseball player and they wanted to meet him. I took them to a large building. We went inside and walked through a lot of narrow passages and came to two swinging doors. We opened them and saw a gymnasium and some men playing basket ball.
