It seems like I was at a lake. I can remember I was sitting on the beach with my shoes &amp; stockings off. The water kept coming higher up on to the beach and I had to keep moving my shoes up. I don't think I was by myself yet I can't remember who else was there. Next I seem to be on the street where I lived as a child. I was just walking along when my closest friend's father called me over to read a letter from his wife, who is dead now. It seems like she was over in Scotland, her home. The letter wasn't written on regular paper, but I don't remember what it was written on, or what it contained. However, I think the letter contained pleasant news.
