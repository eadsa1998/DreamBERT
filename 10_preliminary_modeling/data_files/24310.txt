I am the vice president of Jamaica. The mayor/president of the place is nice enough. He gave me the position when I met him in the customs hall. This Jamaica is smaller than the real one, like Andros in the Bahamas. I'm there on a family vacation. I am fighting with my mother. I hurry ahead to go exchange some cash into the coins they use before she does something stupid like trying to pay for things in dollars. Something is wrong with the guy's counting machine. A coup erupts. I'm left with money that looks like play dough and no way to change it back. Anarchy is in the streets, and I know I need to find some place safe to be -- since I was named the president. I go through the downtown place where there's a merry go round. It's turned into a central place where the revolutionaries shout through their megaphones propaganda. I tell my family to follow me and stay close. I'm worried my mother will say something stupid to the black gangs now roving the streets. I tell them just to keep walking, even though they are hassled.
