I was at a house party. An old boyfriend of mine was there. We were playing games in one room. He was with another crowd in another room. There was a commotion and a man lay dead on the floor. My old boyfriend lay down on a bed in one of the bedrooms and felt miserable. I tried to comfort him. Two boyfriends of his tried to talk him into going to a very good show in town. I talked to him again but it didn't look as if he were paying any attention to us. The two fellows and myself started to the show. As we walked along the street, he caught up to us, handed me a bunch of pansies and said "Here's a dollars' worth of posies." He took my arm and we all walked on together.
