I'd been invited to exhibit some work at an outdoor group exhibition in another country. The man who invited me was a friend of my father who was in marketing but in the dream he's an artist. The exhibition was set along a rural track - perhaps in a park on farmland. Huge billboards have been constructed containing photographic prints and some hold light-boxes. There are also some interior space-like constructions. There are many other exhibitors this place is huge, and there are hundreds of people here to see it. The people seem to be driving along the track past the exhibits. I'm not sure which country we're in - maybe somewhere in eastern europe. The man who invited me has work up here - his work is large conceptual photographs of rural or industrial scenes - quite banal, for example like a shot of a grass verge next to a motorway. He has many pieces on display - I only have a few. But apparently there is a man who wants to meet me to discuss my work. This guy is waiting for me with his wife and children - and apparently (so I'm told) he is "one of the only people alive today who is 90% mexican".  I drive the other guys car down the track to the other end of the exhibition. The car is attached to a large, high trailer - like a cage - containing 20 or 30 pictures in frames. It's a very bumpy ride, but when I get there the guy tells me he wants to come to my country to see my work.
