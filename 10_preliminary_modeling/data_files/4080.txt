["Ellie Has Another Baby"]  I am in a house with lots of old rooms. Ellie and her family live downstairs. She comes to me holding her newest baby. It's a boy. I cuddle it. Then I put it down. Charla has left a big mess of things around and I am angry. I walk downstairs to where Ellie and Kyle and the babies are to complain. They don't pay any attention to me. I am neglectful about the fourth baby boy as I walk from room to room seeing the mess.
