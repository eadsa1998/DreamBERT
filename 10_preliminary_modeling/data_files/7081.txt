I had been staying with the Silsbys and was dressing. As another lady was going I asked her by which door I should leave so that I could say goodbye. She said, "Out the back door; the front is always locked." I said, "Well I was just about to go so I'll say goodbye now." "You'll be back tomorrow?" I couldn't say that I'd stay home. As I was passing the front door en route to the toilet, a two-year-old baby in a blue and white frock pushed the door open and was about to enter but I closed the door gently pushing the child back.
