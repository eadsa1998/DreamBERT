Eugene and I were out somewhere. We went on a bus and decided to go to England. There was a taxi near the door and all these other people had stopped. We went backwards for a bit. The airport was like a train station but it was inside. The bus drove right in. There were people everywhere. We didn't know where to go. We went into the stairwell and there were lots of doors and more stairs. There was a group of people in there who were on an excursion or something and they were going into a room. We found the place finally. There was a lady at the desk and she asked for our passports. I still didn't have one and I gave her Uncle Wilbur's one. We had a few bags with us. I had Grey with me. I was thinking about backing out, but I wasn't going to.
