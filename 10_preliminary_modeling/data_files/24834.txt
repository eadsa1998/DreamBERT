I was a big fish and I was swimming through the air and I fell through a hole in a tree. I fell down to an underground river where a man with a big nose was saying, "Moo, Oh how I love you." And he was saying this to a cat sitting on a pedestal. Then I woke up. Setting: I have no idea. I was in a place I'd never seen before. Characters: Cat: big white angora with purple stripes. Man: never seen him in my life. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. It was one of my many weird dreams but it doesn't surprise me.
