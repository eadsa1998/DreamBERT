I am in a hospital as a patient. I think I am having surgery. A man friend of mine, like Paul of acting class, also has surgery. I suddenly remember it's been days since he went for surgery and I had forgotten to check in on how he did. I start going through the halls of the hospital asking different nurses where I can find out how he's doing and what room he's in now. They are not helpful. I keep trying. I now have to pee and go to a bathroom. I see a woman is in there, so I am by the door waiting. The woman comes out, but another one pops in ahead of me. I am annoyed and say, "Hey. It was my turn. I was waiting here." I see several other women now trying to get ahead of me. One woman left her things on the toilet, a cosmetic bag and so on. Now I am out of my wheelchair and standing so I can muscle my way in if I have to.
