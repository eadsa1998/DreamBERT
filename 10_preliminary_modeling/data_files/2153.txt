I'm in a room looking through lots of things on the floor under the window. A boy comes in and talks with a man. The man says, "Does she know?" to the boy. I say, distracted, "Know what?" He says, "That you are going to die today before 7:00." I am startled and look at the boy. He nods and says, "Yes. You are going to die." I am afraid and I say, "Will it hurt or be bad?" He says, "No. You will go very quickly. It won't be bad or painful." I say, "Then take me now. Let's get it over with." The winds kick up in the trees and a wavy feeling comes over me and then I'm dead, only heaven seems to be the same room I was in before I died. I see God. She's a woman, somewhat distracted. I then look out the windows at the end of the room and see a driveway with a car in it. I say, "Is daddy ever coming home?" God says, "Yes, soon." Then a man comes in the room. He's a baseball guy that gambles. God gets nervous and fiddles with her blouse button. The boy gets very nervous at the idea of God being nervous. God reassures him. She says, "It's OK. Just a little excess suppressed sexual energy," and then takes care of the baseball guy easily.
