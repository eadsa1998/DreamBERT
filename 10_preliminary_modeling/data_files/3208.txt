Murphy Brown and the gang are staying at a motel. They're up early for breakfast, eat a lot and then go back to bed, but our room is the passage the employees use to get to their jobs in the restaurant. And now they are up and coming through, so we get up again and have another breakfast. I gorge myself. Jim Dial sings a cute song to Frank, then a sweet love song to me. He shyly reaches out to hold my hand, but doesn't finish the gesture because he doesn't know how to react to my deformed hand. I hold it out for him to hold and he does so. The audience watches, enjoying the scene. Then he sings a magnificent opera to a large woman on my left. The audience agrees it's his best song. He leaves, with a little self-satisfied grin on his face. Now Corky and I and another woman are going to lie down and nap, but hey, we're on vacation, what is there to do round this seaside resort? We are restless, wanting to do it all.
