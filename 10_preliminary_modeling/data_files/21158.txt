Steve and I were carrying dead people. Steve and I saw a wagon pull up with a large family of kids. I was climbing down a ledge, which was steep. I looked into an old birdhouse and there were nude birds mounted and grass growing thru the box. I saw ruins of an old house. The rocks were hot. A fire was still brewing. It was a spooky night.
