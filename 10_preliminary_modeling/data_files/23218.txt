My wife Anita and I find that our furniture is covered by a pink snow.  Winter is over, and I can't figure out why it hasn't melted.  But when I look more closely, I see that it is not snow, but tiny fibers which I assume are asbestos. I can see the fibers floating in the air, too, illuminated by sunlight.  I am surprised that Anita does not seem to be as concerned as I am.
