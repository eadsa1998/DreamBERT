I dreamt my online friend Jeremy and I met.  We were in a place like a bayou.  I wasn't far from home, just like going to the mobile home park across the street.  He came in a white car, with a girl I think by the name of Holly.  Jeremy was about the right height, but white rather than Japanese, with blonde hair.  We walked around a bit, but I don't remember much else.  When he first arrived, the car broke.  The girl put apple juice or something on the radiator.  Replacing it with water fixed the problem.
