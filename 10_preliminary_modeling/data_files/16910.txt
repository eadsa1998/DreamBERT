In the dream I'm working for a design company - although it feels like I'm at university. The manager seems like the course leader. The emphasis is on creativity and getting it right rather than getting it finished quickly. The boss is based on a boss I had in a job about 10 years ago. There's a disagreement about a design for a retail thing. I'm sent with a colleague to a large department store to do some research. There are factions in the office about how it should be done - a particular sticking point is which typeface to use. I stubbornly stick to my original design. The office is in a large open plan block with big plan chests and tables.
