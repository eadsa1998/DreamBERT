I dreamt that I was going to my boyfriend's brother's house. As I walked up the stairs onto the path leading to the front door, I saw three cows grazing on the front lawn. And over them into the backyard I saw a pond with ducks, geese and swans. As I looked into the house, his brother was on the phone. Once his brother, Donald, saw me, he looked relieved! He hung up the phone and came towards me! He said, "Am I glad you're here! I can't get these guys out of my house!" As I looked around, his deadbeat friends were all other the place. The house was a mess. Garbage all over the floor, graffiti spray-painted all over the walls! That was found in every single room. Donald didn't know what to do! As I inspected the house, I started to get angry! These kids were disgusting pigs! Slobs! I remember going downstairs after him and seeing Donald saying something to his drunk friends! The next thing I remember saying was, "Okay, everyone, get the hell out of here now!" And the guy downstairs said to Donald, "Why should I listen to her?" And Donald responded, "Because she's my sister-in-law!" And I remember feeling very happy about him saying that! So I went around the house kicking his so-called friends out and slowly, they left! And that's all I remember!
