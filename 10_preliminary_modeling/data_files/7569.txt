Mary and I are coming away from some affair ( like a wedding), walking through a banquet room already set up for another party. Mary is walking ahead of me and she's wearing a white cocktail dress. At one point I see myself touching her waist. As we walk through this room, Mary helps herself to some of the goodies laid out on the tables. As we are walking, I tell Mary that she's beautiful. Her response puzzles me. She tells me that most people who know her have gotten over that part of their relationship with her. I don't understand what she means by that. Does she mean that all I'm interested in her is her beauty? I am concerned that she's stealing candies from the tables. I don't recall in the dream whether I said anything to her about this or just thought that I should speak to her about this. I never saw Mary's face because I was walking behind her, but I know I am with Mary.
