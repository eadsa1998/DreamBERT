I was at this place with the school. It had this thing where you sit and it feels like someone pulls you down and you fall off this ledge. You were also supposed to 'see' Freddy Krueger (A Nightmare on Elm Street). I didn't. Calvin and Samantha were there. There was another one where you jump onto this seesaw thing and you get to the other side with a skateboard. Brennan kept hitting his head. Autumn tried it. Someone said something about Hey Ya.
