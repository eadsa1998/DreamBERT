We had this big house (which I had just built on Sims 2) and I think Dmitri's family had a big house too. They came over and his parents came back out and were looking snobby and saying stuff about the house and Ezra and I were mocking them. Melanie went with them. Dmitri and I ended up in some room and were throwing pillows at each other. We kept turning into things and he kept turning into this hell thing which I didn't like. I turned into this strange gopher thing. Later I was at this school and I was standing around lockers. Dmitri came up to me and was looking nervous. My best friend and I were there but he walked off and she started hugging me. Later the police came to get this girl.
