I was in a hallway between two hospital wards. Patients were being transferred. A doctor who knew me passed by, accompanied by a strange doctor. I was embarrassed because I was undressed. Later I sat at a table with food in front of me. Three kinds of food were there. I saw them as eggs, ideologies, and potatoes. (When I awoke I wondered why I had seen the second food as ideologies.)
