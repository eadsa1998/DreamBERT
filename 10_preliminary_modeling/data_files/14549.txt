I was outside. There was a game thing. Ezra was there and you had to jump from these high poles, which had a flat round thing on top. They would get further and further apart. Then it was Calvin and he was with a girl. I ran to swing off a rope thing to get on and Calvin grabbed onto us and I said 'you want [something that looks like last]' but he did and we fell straight away. I said it took 'ten years and some amount of months off' and he said '140 weeks'. I was then on a bus thing with Nana. She asked the girl in front of me to put her chair back and it hit my leg. I was playing Pokemon on my DS.
