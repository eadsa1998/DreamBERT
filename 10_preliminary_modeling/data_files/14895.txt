There was some event on soon. I went over to the neighbours. They were a couple and there was a cake with eggplant on it and it said "Happy birthday" on it. They asked if it was ok and I was like 'I suppose'. I wanted to enlarge it but it was too difficult. There was some dancing mummy dude. Then it was like the next day and the event was on. I went over to help them. They had a picture that I'd drawn and they packed it up, but I went back and they gave it to me. I walked out with it, holding it flat in front of me. Our house was a while away. I walked across the street and a car came. The wind blew and it started acting like a parachute thing and I had to let go. I chased after it and it was ok. Dad was outside with Ezra and he was like "that better not have been your picture". I had to go back in with Ezra to get the cake. As we left he said there was a song on before that he thought was catchy. I also had my iPod with me so I could listen to it on a drive.
