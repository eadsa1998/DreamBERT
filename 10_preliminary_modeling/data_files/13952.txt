I was at Mom's but when I left the room it was home. Something happened and I asked about why it was important to remember stuff about 'snow scraping'' and something for school. Darren said something and then said "it's like 10 minutes from here". I went to put my dinner in the microwave. Dancing in the Storm was playing. This crack appeared in the carpet in the living room. I went outside and told Mom. Mom told me to fix it. I aimed the microwave away, as the radiation had cracked the ground, which was now like ice, and it was dangerous.
