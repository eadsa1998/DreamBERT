I was in France or something. Granma and Uncle Gabriel had taken me to some place. People there were evil and trapped us. There was this weird water and we were training ourselves to breathe in it. David Tennant and I were in it, but then we looked like weird plesiosaur type creatures, and I was observing. Then we were human and we kissed. Later, I had befriended this guy who looked like Laurence Fishburne. We were all escaping. Laurence was helping us and we had to jump over some platforms. We had to go down these steps and there was a GIANT cockroach and this little flying bug kept falling. The bug had to be up for you to go down. This girl saw the cockroach was like "Hell no!". Then it was loose, and I ran up the steps. The girl and I ran to the exit and Laurence stayed to fix the cockroach. This gate was open. Earlier, some girl had electrocuted herself on it. We went to the car and there was a shelf in the back and it was a truck thing. I was trying to remember where to go. There were photos of Ezra and also Wallace, Tiana and Julius. I tried to ask for help, but everyone only spoke French.
