The cops said, "Why are you kids playing baseball up there?" I said, "Because it's flat and there are some trees." He said, "Don't you know that's a crime scene? Go inside." Some kids went inside. I sat in the back of the car. Nick was there and Randy. We were all in a loft gonna go and go out and there was a stranger and once we were, me and Nick and Randy in the same room. Awkward situation. A girl asked me, Will you walk my dog at 10:00 hours and at 14:00 hours?" I said, "OK." I was at the top of a huge pit and I dropped a pack of cigarettes down the pit and then I accidentally knocked the dog into the pit. He was lost forever.
