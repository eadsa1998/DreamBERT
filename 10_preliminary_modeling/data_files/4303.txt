["Shopping in the library."] I am at home somewhere and looking at a computer screen trying to get some information to scroll up. I think I am ordering things off the computer. Bonnie and Mateo come over. She tells me of a great sale in the library. I want to go but have to put the groceries away first. Then I realize that Mateo had driven the car away to go to his job and forgot to unload the groceries. I worry the hamburger will spoil if not refrigerated in time. Now we go to the library. As we walk in, I see huge shelves with many thousands of books, big and colorful and interesting lining the room. I like it here. Now along the bottom edge of the walls are candles and huge shoes and purses. I stroll along the line looking at the candles and the prices. Some stick candles for 88 cents. Some pillar candles for 1.39. Bonnie shows me a very tall pillar candle. She says that is for the winter, but uses a foreign word for it. I think I'll get one too but she warns me it takes me three months to burn a small candle and we wouldn't want the candle to last to summer when it could melt. I decide not to buy it. The shoes are very very large!! I pick up a purse and look inside it. Not enough room, but a nice shape.
