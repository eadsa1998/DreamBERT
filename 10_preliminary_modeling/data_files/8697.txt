[problem with audiotape] why he is saying it. Doesn't finish the sentence and something about scores [not sure what that last word was but that's kind of what it sounded like] as we leave and walks out. I don't know if he's coming back or not so I decide to turn off the lights and leave. there's a woman that had been talking to Bryan N. I knew who she was and knew that Bill C knew her as well. I had a suspicion that Bill C was hiring her to replace me. She was wearing a very, very short skirt, a see-through blouse and very high heels. She was tall and thin with short black hair. I was very upset that Bill C would be hiring her to replace me. I am walking out to the parking lot and this girl is walking out as well with someone else she knows. They keep ____around them and I go ahead and get in my car to leave. There are big piles of dirt all over the place. I'm wondering if I can just drive over one of the smaller piles, out through the circular drive that I normally come in on. I tried once and I almost got stuck. I backed up and tried again in a different place that was much higher. and I got really scared for a second. I was leaning forward in the car and kind of bouncing forward to try to keep the car from tipping over backwards and landing on it's roof. The car did come back down and land safely on the wheels. I decided I just needed to go out the other way. I got turned around and ready to do that and saw someone else do the same thing that I did except it was back in the corner of the parking lot where I always parked. He wasn't as lucky. His car crashed down and____came off the car and slammed back down. Oddly, the man that was in it was able to get out and walk away, though he was walking. Somebody was walking behind me. It's as if he is talking to himself but he wants me to hear him. He said, okay. How much can___something that they knew they shouldn't have done to begin with and all that kind of thing. He's just going on and on and I finally turn around and ask him if he wants a ride somewhere. He said yes, so I agreed to give him a ride____ home. ____was there, Bill C and to help them get along without me. I have a lot of mixed feelings about doing this. I'm very irritated by this, thinking that if they really needed me then they shouldn't have fired me. I'm trying to be nice and helpful, remembering that part of the agreement for the severance pay was that I would be available for one month to answer questions and help with the transition____down beside me. I'm facing one direction. He's facing the other. He crouches down, kind of ____anyway. He's saying something. I'm not sure how I feel about it anyway. He's saying something to me and someone else. He's been having trouble accessing some of the files on my computer____ message and even though I___he occasionally gets a message saying that it isn't. I finally told him that I could send him a copy of the disc that I brought home with me if that would help. He said, Could you? You wouldn't mind doing that? I said, No. I'll do that. It will take me some time to find it because everything is still in boxes and I haven't done anything with it. I'll get it to you. In my head I'm thinking. I'm pretty sure I'm going to take the personal stuff off of those CD's before I make the copy to send to him. I'm not going to send him anything with files or documents related to me on it. Well, maybe I'll just go ahead and send them to him but then I thought, No. The way he just leaves CD's laying around all over the place I wouldn't want someone else to have access to them. Now he says, Really? You wouldn't mind? He's standing up and leaning forward with his hands resting on his knees_____and laundry. I'm trying to fold this laundry and trying to have room to put it in different piles based on what room it goes in. I'm wondering why no one is helping. I need to leave so I'll finish folding it for you but you have to put it away. There was another woman around____ by all means they would get it put away____ to me and somebody else____ but it was a for your head. There was a big V torn in the front. She was walking____ something to do outside our office or somehow she was trying to hold us responsible for fixing it. So I was messing around with it, seeing if I might be able to repair it. While I was, I continued to talk with a gentleman____ kept talking to her and asking her questions. We finally realized that we weren't at all responsible for this and we confronted her about that. She admitted that she had lied to us and she knew we weren't responsible. She was just looking for a way to get it repaired at no cost to her.
