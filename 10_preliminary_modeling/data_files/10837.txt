I know very definitely something occurred in the beginning of this dream, but I find it impossible to remember what it was. The first thing I recall is standing with a partner in a long double line such as one is taught to do in the elementary schools when passing through the halls. The dream is extremely hazy, although I do know that everyone was clothed in a net dress of some pastel color. In front of me and down one step were my parents. My mother was clothed in a green net gown, but I failed to notice my father. Somehow I knew that this was a wedding procession with my aunt and uncle who were to be married on the lead. I took absolutely no notice of whom my own partner was. It might easily have been either male or female. I faintly recall girls in net dresses brushing past me as they went up the steps, but there was not one individual in the dream who took distinct form or personality. Neither was there any plot or action in the dream. However, as was stated before, there seems to be much in the dream that I feel was there but cannot actually remember.
