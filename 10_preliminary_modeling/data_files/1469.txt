I am at a conference. I dance to the music played by a piano and a violin, performed by a doctoral student. I sit in the lobby and ask a man if I can see his agenda. He hands papers to me, but I can't find their agenda. I complain to someone that going to conferences when you have arthritis is hard. It's tiring enough for regular people, all the meetings and the late night socializing too. Some guy and I like each other. Another guy tries to butt in. He insults my guy sarcastically saying, "What do you have in common, the same salary bracket?" implying he's lower than me and not acceptable. I insult the guy back. I need help. A man who killed my baby is after me. I ask an older man to help. He says sure, we'll work just like the E City Brigade. We hid in a square room and when the man approached, I shot him in the eye with a wooden thing.
