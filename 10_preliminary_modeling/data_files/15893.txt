The house was different and we had these 'bumpy' walls, like you'd find on the outside. We'd covered them in something to avoid ants, but it had attracted ants instead. I had gone to sleep and woke up to lots of ants on the walls and they'd laid eggs in my hair, which were deep on the roots and I was pulling them out.
