I also had another dream and its very vague. Just before I woke up its now 5:00+. I dreamed that there were a lot of cylinders, long cylinders around. The image of these was 4 to 6 feet long, maybe 4 to 6 inches in diameter, maybe a little smaller. They were laying on the ground and I could bend down and feel them. And I could feel them rolling around underfoot I know there s a whole lotta stuff regarding those cylinders. They were various lengths and I remember just that they were very annoying, it was very annoying being around them.
