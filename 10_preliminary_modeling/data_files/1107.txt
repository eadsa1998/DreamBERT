I'm trying to find the road to T City. I'm in the city but I can't find the way to the ocean and the farm. I stop and ask for directions. I ask an old woman. She tries to tell me but can't exactly remember. "This shopping center is gone now and that junction is changed now." She says something about Cleveland. I'm annoyed. If she'll just tell me where XXX Road is, I'll find the farm. I walk out and see my Uncle Wilbur. He's a psychic. I walk up to him. I say, "Hi, tell me how to get to your farm. I've forgotten!" He frowns and says, "What time is it?" I say, "A few minutes past 5." He frowns because I've asked him a question after work hours. He takes my hand to do a reading, even though he's annoyed with me. I'm annoyed at him too; I didn't want a reading, I just wanted directions to his home. He twitches and makes odd faces. He says, "Are you from Cleveland?" I say, "No! A woman just said that city, so it's fresh in my mind!" I am then a little impressed because how could he know that? He goes on. Then 2 women join us. One named Beth asks if we'd been together before in past lives. He holds our hands. We're in a circle and he starts twitching again. He and Beth have had lives together before and they talk about it.
