I was out the front of the house, and I saw a creepy guy. I tried to scream but I couldn't. I ended up getting inside, and Mom put me over her shoulder and was carrying me down the hallway. The guy came inside and he had a knife. I was holding one of those little dog toys with the plastic head and the bean-y body. He was right behind us, and I couldn't do anything. Then Mom put me in a cupboard.
