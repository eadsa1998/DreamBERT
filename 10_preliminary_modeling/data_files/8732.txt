I had gone to the CAS office to help with the transition. When I got ready to leave I gave everyone a hug except Bill C. He followed me out, wanting to give me a hug before I left so I agreed. When he hugged me it felt like a very meaningful hug, tight and almost as though he didn't want to let go. He said something to me. The office building and parking lot were different than in waking life. They were both much, much bigger. There was a drive across the front of the building and then a median with grass and trees and then the parking lot. As I reached the median a woman walked up beside me. We started talking. I don't remember if I knew her or not. We only talked for a few moments because we were parked in opposite sections of the parking lot. I got in my car and drove to CI to the Kinko's on R1 Rd. As I approached the shopping center and wanted to turn in there was a lot of road construction going on. It seems like I did this twice. The workers were directing traffic. One time I couldn't turn in. The next time I turned in I drove over a big pile of dirt or sand. Someone told me not to because I would get stuck. I didn't listen to them and I didn't get stuck.
