I was sitting in my room scouring through books looking for dreams to record.  It was late at night.  I read some of my old dreams, and I experienced the dream as I read about it.  There was a stone tower and a little dirt area surrounded by stone wall and a steep cliff or hillside.  We were pretty much trapped.  It wasn't safe there.  Bugs Bunny was there.  We had two options; we could either blow up just the tower, or we could blow up the whole area.  He said to do the whole area, so we strung the lead.  We triggered the explosives and there was a glimmering highlight of red around the edges of the stone as it flew into the sky and came crumbling down on top of us.  Just as I'd detonated it, my mother came into my room to tell me not to, but it was too late.  The stones came raining down painfully on top of all of us, in my room as well, not just in this other dream realm.  I apologized to my mother, since I honestly didn't know it would happen that way.  I followed her into the kitchen.  On the table was a plate with three piles of vegetables; peas, corn, and green beans.
