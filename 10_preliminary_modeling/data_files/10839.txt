I was standing alone in the living room of my home when suddenly I spied a tiny luminous ball floating rapidly through the air toward me. As I moved away frightened, it began to pursue me, continuing the chase for several minutes. Suddenly I was no longer afraid. Curious about the characteristics of the ball, I quickly seized it and was amazed to discover it had assumed upon close examination a very different shape. Its size had increased several times, its form had become conical, and strangest of all, it was composed of approximately 50 tongue depressors sticking out in all angles, but somehow attached at the base of the cone by tightly wound rubber bands. With a satisfied happy feeling I decided the reason this object had pursued me was due to the force caused by the tightly wound rubber bands which propelled it through space. With that the dream ended.
