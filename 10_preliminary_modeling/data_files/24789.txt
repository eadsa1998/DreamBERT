I was in a beautiful meadow when a popsicle appeared in front of me. I caught it and licked it - raspberry - and I was at a concert with this really cool (and cute) guy. I licked it again - strawberry - and I was in the meadow! Suddenly I started licking rapidly, going back and forth between the meadow and baseball games, dance clubs and parties, sporting events and all these other different places. Then I wished and licked and I was at the place I had wished for. Setting: In the meadow, and a lot of different places. Characters: Me and a bunch of people I didn't see very long. A cute guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. I think maybe it means I'm going to travel a lot. But I feel mainly dizzy.
