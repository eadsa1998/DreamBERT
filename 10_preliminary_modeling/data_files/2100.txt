A giant easy chair is alive and tapping on the window at Grandma Mildred's house. (It's outside and I'm inside.) I laugh and go out on the porch and call to it like it's a horse. I find a miniature chair on the porch and pick it up and take it into the house, pleased the chair is at its right proportions now.
