I was at a restaurant, like a Denny's. I was having dinner or lunch with someone but I don't know who it was. I went to get something and saw Tim W. I stopped to chat with him. He was there alone. I wanted to sit and talk with him but knew that would be very rude to the person I was with. I thought maybe the other person would leave and then I could join Tim W.
