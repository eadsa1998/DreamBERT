I was at our house, but somehow I was in the dining room and our machine was set up in there for some crazy reason. And I was working on XP, a much more opulent desk than what we have, and I think I was, I was either typing something in Word or I was looking at pictures; I can't remember which. But Dad was waiting for me to finish something so we could go for a walk or something, and, you know, in real life it's set up so Dad and I have separate logins so that our display settings can be set. Well, I dreamt that in my dream I was so in a hurry, I shut down and I forgot to logoff. And instead of shutting down, it was doing a restart and acting all crazy. And Dad was leaving out the door without me because I had to stay and attend to it. And I think I woke up. [laugh] That was really stupid. I'm kind of wired for sound tonight, can you tell?
