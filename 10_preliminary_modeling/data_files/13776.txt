We were back at school. We had a male teacher and we had written our names and some other stuff up on this board a while ago. We were told we were going to be doing some pairing up thing. The guy started pairing us up and everyone was annoyed about it. Elijah and I got paired up. Calvin was there too. Ms Madsen was doing the role and was asking us who was there and who didn't go to the school. There was someone called Choo Choo. Someone was singing Oh Sherrie. Then we were driving (Elijah was driving). He hadn't driven before but after a while he was driving really well. He was smoking later on. Then I was driving and sometimes the car was a bike. I was driving over this beach (it was where we had to drive). All these Ethiopians (they were black and someone said they were Ethiopians) were lying over the sand and everyone had to manoeuvre around them. I did well (and I was going fast). We went to this shop to pick up my laptop, which was actually some guy's (I was the guy). It wasn't there. The case and charger were there. I said "didn't one of you use it as a [thing you put under a dodgy leg of a table]?" and I was blaming on this guy called 'Pool Cue'. I said "I'm not saying it's at your house, I'm just saying Pool Cue did it". Some guy smashed a bottle.
