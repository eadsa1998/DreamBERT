Frank has booked a bus tour for us; I arrive very late and have to flag down the bus as it leaves the depot. The driver seems angry as does Frank, asking why I was so late? I wonder if I can go on the trip since I have no luggage and therefore no change of clothes. I dont know whether I go or not... frustrated feeling.
