Bev was in the third grade. I was at my birth home with other members of the family. Bev was asking for permission to date. I asked Mother if I could try to help. I started talking to Bev about why she wanted to date and about her age. I told her that I was 18 before I had my first date. As soon as I said it I realized that was wrong, that I was actually 17. I didn't correct myself, though. I was talking to her as though I understood her wanting to date already. However, I really didn't. She was only ten years old.
