I was walking down the hill with Sue. She was saying she was broke but she was buying a truck. A man as going to teach her to drive it. "I've always wanted a truck," I said. There was a gym. I was late for class. Kitty was there with me. I had never seen a cat in a weight room before. She made herself at home. I did some weights. Kitty was walking around. The weight room turned into a thrift store, but all arranged by solids/stripes. I found an old cotton cut-up football jersey I loved. I was at a picnic. The Kennedy family had a tree house there. They had a tall ladder partly painted, partly just metal, not painted, that they took down when the press was around. They had a tall vertical sign, hand-painted that said, "The Kennedy's" There was a fountain. A very old concrete water fountain. I was trying to put a post in the ground for a volleyball net. The net was already attached. It kept leaning over and the net was not taught. I kept trying a few inches over to dig a hole. We tried to put the post into a metal drain. We took off the cover. Inside was a pool of water. A copper whale had been in the water, covered with the lid since we were little. It had a hinged mouth that moved. I said, "Look, Rudy," and I held the whale out in my hand. A film had won for best documentary about whales. It cost $1800 to make. The film was about whales in captivity--the female whale had died and with her died any chance for baby whales. They put the male whale to sleep.
