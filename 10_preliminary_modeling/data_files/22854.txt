I am in the homecoming court.  We have to parade from a long way off.  As we near our destination across a large green lawn, a throng of people form an aisle for us.  I have been messing around with something like a buzzer you swing around your head, and the crepe paper gets tangled around one maid's legs (Anne Groud, I think).  So I have to run past the others to catch up with my maid, Mary Lou Surrey.  Perry Rushton is the first duke.  He is tall and dressed in a long plaid shirt and green pants with frayed edges.  We come up the ramp at the back of the auditorium, and while waiting for instructions, we hear Mr. Firmentante announce "Give me the crown," then "And now your homecoming queen," and he crowns her right on stage, to our surprise.  I look at the audience, and there are only about 3 rows filled near the back, and Judson Schinn closer to the front.  I am disgusted, and say so, but Leslie Leiter reprimands me-even though she too had said she was disgusted.
