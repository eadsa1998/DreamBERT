 I unexpectedly meet my high school crush Harmony Allure. She recognizes me and talks to me friendlily, which startles me. I'm tired: very mellow and compliant. She may be with a man. She asks me if I want to get a drink. We're in a bar-like setting. I know I don't ask her to get a drink. I mellowly agree to go; if it were not she, I would not be drinking: I'm tired, dragging, and I have a glass of water already. I walk to find a table, going from a brown wood dimmed light setting to a bright Wal Mart-type store with many white and pastel items. There are tables dispersed in this area. I sit down at one that is near the main walkway, too tired to get one that is more private. I see Harmony coming towards the table, maybe with a man, from a long ways off. When she sits down I see she has started smoking. She looks more like white trash than I remember: her teeth are not as straight or as white, her hair is in a banana clip. She tells me she's been in Forkville the last year or two studying.
