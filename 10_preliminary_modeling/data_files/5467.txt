I had a dreams last night that first I was in some school in Alabama learning to parasail. My teacher was very handsome and I had a crush on him. When the time came to leave, I hoped he would volunteer to help me parasail back to my home state. He didn't, and I was left to figure out how to work the parasail by myself. It was only supposed to take me 4 hours to get home, and I had to get home that night since my interview in New York was the next day. I landed in Tennessee by accident and was trying to figure out how to get back in the air when I started a new dream. I was walking to Pickering from spinning class with Abigail. I saw Keegan on the way but I don't think he saw me. Then Abigail and I were standing outside Pickering talking to someone and Keegan turned back and we definitely made eye contact. He spread his arms as if he wanted me to hug him, but I was too far away. Then I went inside Pickering: Andy, Alvie, and Professor Simms were all there too. I think Alvie was taking the GMATs the next day. Andy and I were walking around and he spilled his food and I think I might have woken myself up laughing.
