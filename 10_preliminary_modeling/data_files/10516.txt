Lots of confusion. I drive to the YWCA and arrive at the back door to the swimming pool. I get some food to eat right there (chicken wings). I swim and talk with others. Suddenly I remember that it is 7 AM and that I forgot to pick up Pedro; I call him from the Y and he is really upset. Finally he arrives, wearing a brown hat; HE IS VERY ANGRY, but I beg him to PLEASE forgive me; O.K. and we drive to work.
