I was at university, which was different. Jeremiah and others I knew where there. I complained because I didn't have lunch with me. Jeremiah was like 'whatever' and I was like 'well, you have lunch'. Some lady saw a lite Mars Bar and said "did anyone lose this?" and I said yes and grabbed it. I didn't end up eating it though. Then I had a room there or something and it was like a family room thing. I was going to download a game on Steam and asked Ezra if it was on freezone. The game was Left 4 Dead 2, but wasn't. Eugene and I were going out. I curled up next to him on a lounge and we kissed. Later, he wanted sex but I was busy. I was then at the old house and I still had heaps of stuff there, including my bed, desk, toy box and Grey etc. Mom was annoyed about it. I went to bed early in the morning. It was starting to get light outside. I looked up and I heard Mom say "someone coming" and they were in bed in Ezra's first room. Mom had bought a sensor that picked up sounds. I think it says they said the rain made it hiss. I went to my room and there were moths everywhere. I was annoyed because I wanted to go to sleep. I had text Dad asking 'how much weight could I use as [something I can't read], plus others and drinking lite green tea.
