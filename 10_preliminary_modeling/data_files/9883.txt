We have decided to move: we get help from the Levants, friends of Frank's. We are in their home trying to make love, but a little girl come in by the cat door! -- Then we take a trolley. We have to get out by going down steps and putting our feet in a stirrup-like device. We are in Frank's home town, and they have a tent for Zena. I see Frank's father with a black bandaged finger. We sleep in a big room where we can see Frank's mother in a huge golden covered three pillow bed. She is very regal, but a panel will not attach to a wire in the wall; we laugh. I go down to get want ads: a man in a store is giving them away; very happy with new place.
