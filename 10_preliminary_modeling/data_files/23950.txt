I was visiting Jessica somewhere in a country area. Or was it Serena? Serena had some acid that was in little packs of liquid with little thin fish in them. All different colors. I went to some sort of country club and had a huge free breakfast with Hal and someone else. On the way back to my friends, I got a pizza with a whole head of broccoli on top, covered with cheese. Serena had some friends over. They were going to have a party. One girl I hated right away. I seemed to already know her so I slapped her. All her friends were snobby and didn't really include me. I went upstairs to take a shower. I told everyone I was first in line (I really was). Two big fat lesbians had been in before me and had left tons of hair and white dirty bathing suits in the tub. <br/
