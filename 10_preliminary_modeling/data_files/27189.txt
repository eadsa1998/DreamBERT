I dreamed that I was roller skating on a very unusual skating floor. The floor seemed to be slanting at a slight degree towards the middle, from all sides. In the middle was a bridge and underneath it were damp wet leaves, grass, etc. I seemed to be the only one skating but there were several men standing around watching. One man was standing underneath the bridge and motioned for me to come near him. I tried to ignore him but the bridge seemed to be magnetized and I was drawn to him. He began to put his arms around me and I attempted to release his grasp. It seemed that I had no strength in my arms at all. I started to scream as I was terrified but I still had hopes that my screams would attack the other men's attention &amp; they would come to my rescue. The other men just looked at me, ignored my screams, and walked away.
