I am teaching a class. I am hurrying because I'm late. I enter the room to find the substitute teacher all ready there. I wonder why I hadn't called in. I take over. The students are seated in a crowded "jury box" style of seating. As I walk around the outside edge lecturing. I realize I need to be closer to them, to connect, to be a better teacher. I lean in and put my arm around the shoulders of students and talk directly toward them. They like that better. Now I am on stage teaching a larger group I am teaching them how to be good farmers. I look at the back of the audience and see my mentor Katherine Hepburn. I am pleased and honored she is there. I walk back to her and greet her. Then I return to the stage. I call on a student to come up there. I ask him questions. I say, can you tell me when it's a good time to harvest the green beans? He takes this as a cue as to what he's supposed to do and starts picking green beans growing on a fence on stage. He says stupidly, well, when they look big and there's a lot of them, then you pick them.
