I went to Mom's [old] house and it was empty and different. It was very white. Someone was saying how there was nothing to steal, but I was still worried about people being there. There was some scanner thing, which said there were more people than us in the house. We were checking the rooms. I checked the bathroom and the mirror cabinet. Mom was there.
