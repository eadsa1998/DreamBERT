I got an email from the university about driving. I told Mom that Ezra needed to change his phone number and he was angry about it. I was then at university and Ms Burton was there. I had math and we had to round to 30.10, but someone said it was 30.11 but then that was wrong because we were dealing with money. Anyway, I can't remember properly but I found out that Dean had been bitten by a werewolf. We were at a beach and some others got back to the house (which was at the beach). It was very busy and there were long queues. I asked Mom if she knew about Rover and she said "that Rover's a werewolf? Yeah.". He was outside and she put food out for him. Then it was night but I was with him outside. I was trying to get around the back. It wasn't a full moon though. I got there and then he started to change. I ran in and he tried to come in. I started to cry and was upset. Then some celebrity woman and her husband were doing something. She was in a dressing gown and her boobs started to hang out. Lots of similar mishaps happened with the cast of Glee -- they touched her boob. Hayden Christensen said he was gay but it was unknown whether it was a joke or not. Marisa Tomei said she was against gays and Santa Claus.
