I was in Dad's room and there were lots of cats. There was a ginger one, a black one and two big blue ones. They had blue rectangle patterns. They acted and looked like dogs. I was friends with Hayden Christensen. I was then at a shop with Nana. I was allowed to get one thing. I found a book about Peter Paige and Nana said she knew him and used to flirt with him and I was like "He's gay!". Then, we were fishing and there was this duck or parrot. I was then on a bus with Calvin. I had this Star Wars sticker book. It was all cartoon-like though. Hayden Christensen got on the bus and I called him "the dude who played the guy in Star Wars". He was crying and upset. I went to talk to him.
