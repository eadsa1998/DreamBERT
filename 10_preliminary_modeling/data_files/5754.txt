[1997-06-06] Then I dreamed that I was at this school for blind children, sitting on this lawn swing, where I went to school as a kid and was talking to a bunch of guys and women who were on the swing with me. There was one across the way from me who was debating whether or not she wanted to stay at this place. It may have been a camp for the blind which I visited years ago. Anyway, she was trying to decide and she knew her boyfriend was going to be there. Then she was sitting close beside me and I put my arm around her shoulders and I thought "boy, I hope this guy doesn't notice this because he's really going to be upset, but this woman is just so nice, I like the idea of having her close to me and I spoke to her and said "you're going to stay here" and she said "I haven't decided" and I said "nope, I've decided for you. You are going to stay here." And I made an announcement to the rest of the group: "This woman is going to stay here for the week, because she wants to, but I have made her mind up for her." I was just squeezing her with my arm around her shoulders, thinking how nice she felt and how upset this guy was going to be when he got there. Then he got there and he wasn't upset. And we were talking and laughing and just sort of carrying on.
