I was on a dark deserted street late at night and there was no one in sight. All of a sudden a big cat came out of nowhere and jumped on my clothing and wouldn't let go. I kept running up and down the street trying to throw him clear of myself, but he remained where he was. He kept making strange noises with his mouth as if he was trying to speak like a human to tell me something. Then he started for my throat to bite me, when I screamed and woke myself up.
