FD was short-handed. They called and asked me to come in and help for just one night. I agreed. I was surprised at what I found. The place was a mess. I went back to the grill. There was as bun and a hamburger on the grill. not cooking but maybe being kept warm. There were also a bunch of candy wrappers in a section attached to the grill. like the drip pan. The one I remember was an M&amp;M wrapper. I told someone working there that you should always but two meat patties on a sandwich because it will taste much better and people will pay extra for it. I was making someone a fish sandwich so I put two pieces of fish on it. I went to look at the work schedule to see who was coming in that night. It said, Cutler. It was typed in bold black letters. He had been scheduled the previous night also. I thought it was good that he was scheduled because he's a good kid and good worker. For some reason I realized I would have to clean up the kitchen at close. That's a hard and messy job. When it was close to closing time, I took a metal piece off the ice cream syrup to wash it. I got extra syrup on it taking it out. It strung out like melted cheese. The syrup was chocolate and butterscotch. It was good.
