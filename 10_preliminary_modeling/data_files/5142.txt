I am an exchange student in France. A very fat woman is the lady of the house and she is asking me to do some chores around the place. I'm a bit annoyed, but do so. She wants me to do the dishes and then read stories in English to the children. It helps them with their language skills. I have a hard time speaking French. [BL]
