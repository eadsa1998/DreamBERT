I was out in a large field--the grass was up to my knees and it was raining. There were lots of cows all around me. I recall sitting down in a big chair with a small radio on a table next to me. I was reading a newspaper, and I remember reading a story about myself--to the effect that I tried in court for running over a dog--at that moment it seemed as if some big dark vulgar bird was engulfing me and I woke up with a start.
