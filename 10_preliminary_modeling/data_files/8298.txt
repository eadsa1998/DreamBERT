Matthew had gotten a dog for Ashley B. It looked just like Belle. Not full grown but maybe just a few months old. Not a puppy either. Ashley B had just had a baby. We were at home but our home looked different than in it does in waking life. He and a friend left and without asking me just left the dog there with me. There were also seeking permission from the city or something to cut a tree down outside the house for some reason because of the dog. I was upset because I didn't want the tree cut down. But also because they didn't ask me about any of this before he did it. At some point Darren H and Annie H showed up but I'm not sure why. I remember thinking that Annie H looked a lot younger than she does in waking life.
