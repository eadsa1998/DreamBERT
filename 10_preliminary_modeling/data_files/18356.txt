The dream is set in Germany during the rise of Hitler to power. I'm a physician in this dream who is opposed to Hitler, and this man that I know is coming to the hospital for some sort of operation or something. And I know that he has recently done some prospecting along the river and has discovered several types of metals and minerals that would be rather valuable. He wants me to help his family get a claim on these in case anything happens to him. I don't remember this too well, but I think he dies in the hospital after being there a few days and I did do something so that his wife and children have a legal claim on these mineral deposits.
