I fell asleep at the wheel of my car. When I woke up I was driving the wrong direction on a very busy one-way, two-lane road. I was in the right hand lane, the lane to my right. There was a long line of semi-trailer trucks in the same lane headed towards me. A hundred feet or so ahead of me and to my right there was another road. The trucks were all turning there. I decided that the best way to get off of this one-way road or to turn around was to turn there as well. It was a dead-end at a truck stop with a very expansive parking lot. There were quite a few passenger cars there as well. There were rows of something embedded in the pavement, yet protruding from it, in some places. It damage tires but it was very rough to drive over. The best I can describe them as is rows of small squares of raised pavement. I got distracted while I was driving and was lost so I needed to get a map so I could find my way home. I had been presenting a workshop on dreams some place. There was a second small building at this truck stop. It had brown siding and there was an outdoor sitting area with an overhead to protect people from the elements. It was a very small square area with park benches around the perimeter. People were sitting on some of them. There was a map attached to a wooden sign and post, protected by plexiglass. I walked over to the map to figure out where I was and how to get where I needed to go. I was having a conversation with a woman who had two small children with her. Someone else, an older man, also said something to me. As I was looking at this map, some were wanting to look at the map.
