I was talking on the phone and the person I was talking to told me to call back in an hour, so I was in the bathroom blow-drying my hair when the doorbell rang. I answered it and it was my boy friend and he said, "Come on, I got a surprise for you." So we walked outside and there was a limo. We got in the limo and he gave me a dozen red roses and took me out to dinner, then back to his house to watch movies.
