I was at the old house. Mom was in the kitchen and I was talking to her as she made this ice-cream thing. She melted chocolate onto it. This guy was at the door to see Mom about something. He was a little chubby, but kind of cute. I let him in and he took my ice-cream and left. I went back to my room and had an odd feeling that he liked me and I went to lock the front door. Suddenly he knocked and pushed the door open while I was closing it. He said 'I just wanted to look around'. He looked at my computer starting up and nodded. I was thinking of posting on the forum and I felt confused.
