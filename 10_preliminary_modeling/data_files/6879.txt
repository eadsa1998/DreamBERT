I was at a banquet sitting at the right side of the hall facing the wall. They were passing pink and white ice-cream but left me out. I complained and a waiter slammed a plate before me saying, "there you are." But it was a cake like pudding with a yellow sauce. I went out to the kitchen to get ice-cream but no one was there. Out of the door were three men in dark blue work clothes working. I returned. Now I had three plates of cake bot no ice-cream.
