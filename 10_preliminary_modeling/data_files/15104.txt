I was staying at a friend's house with some others (all guys). We went to this place where waterslides were being built; which were a long way down. The slide was in the middle of lots of water. We were dared to go on. The water was green and this guy got in the water. Then we all ended up in the water. We got out and walked back. I ran, being careful not to slip. Went to a toilet which was small and dried myself and went out. They were getting told off and his mother was cooking stirfry. I joked she was out of something and the broccoli was still frozen. She said I had to have a ham, cheese and tomato toasted sandwich.
