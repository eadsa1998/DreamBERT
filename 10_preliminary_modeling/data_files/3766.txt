I am at some kind of convention. I seem to be always late for breakfast. I hear a speech and then go in to the food area to see if there's any leftovers. I find biscuits and so on and begin to snack. I see a woman and sit beside her. I realize it is Princess Di. She speaks in a very soft voice and the radio is playing very loudly. I say, "Just a minute. I have to turn the radio off. I can't hear you." I see two or three radios. I try to turn them off. Which one is it? Another woman is trying to help me. It doesn't work. Now I am in another room. Kids' books are laid out for us to peruse. A man is talking about gun control and how toys and games are inspected for safety features more than guns are. It's a lecture. It's a loud radio newscaster kind of voice. I decide spontaneously to walk for awhile. I start walking up a road, up a hill, and notice I am barefooted. A small girl, maybe 8 or 9 years old, walks with me. I wonder if we can make it barefooted. The gravel spots could be painful. Then I remember I didn't bother to tell anyone where I or the girl was going. They may be worried. Now I'm in a room and a male is telling a sports story about the Raiders.
