I was making this strange project for history. It was dome shaped and made out of many strips of written-on cardboard. It meant to demonstrate an immigrant's cycle and it incorporated a code. I think I was having fun with it. Setting: At school. Characters: Me and my dad. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I'm doing an immigrant project but it's just a biography in story form.
