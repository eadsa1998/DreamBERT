The knife fight with the blacks in the store as I was gathering supplies. It was a like a turf war. I was charged with defending our headquarters but nobody seemed to be organizing, just wandering around like they didn't know what to do. They wouldn't listen to me. As a refugee group was moving, according to un-logical orders from someone else, I started shooting the people in the face. All in the line. But the gun, an mp5, broke. The bullets just drizzled out. I pulled a clip from the vest I stole off the guy I shot in the face with the weak gun that was on the ground. Tyrol (the character from Battlestar Galactica) tried to dissuade me. Getting supplies at the store -- vitamin water and cans and in a backpack. Running around trying to do everything before time ran out. The city was vast, but I had a vague idea of how it was laid out.
