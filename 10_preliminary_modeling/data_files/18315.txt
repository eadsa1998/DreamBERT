I was driving with the children in the car down some street in a town, very fast, and I couldn't see clearly out of the windows. I must not have been able to control the car either because I saw a blue car come from a side street and didn't stop, so I sideswiped it. I managed to stop and pull off the road, and told a policeman it was my fault. He didn't seem too upset with me and was just asking me a few questions, including a short personality sketch. I told him I was easy-going, but had a great sense of responsibility, and my husband came up about this time and said I wasn't easy-going at all, that that was my biggest problem. The blue car was still in the street all this time. It was like Diane's VW. The occupants had disappeared and I had no idea whether they had been hurt or not.
