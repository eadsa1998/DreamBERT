This guy could talk to some fish thing through mind reading. Only one person could do it and it was whoever had the highest 'level'. If someone went into the area and had a lower ability they would die. This teenager guy called Duncan, who was hot, went in but the guy pushed him out and I went in. I was ok though. It turned out that the guy, Duncan and I had exactly the same level.
