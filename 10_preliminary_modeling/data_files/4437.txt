["Tom acting like Howard."] I am in a room with Tom. He wants to make love. He behaves like Howard, begging, whining and demanding. I want to make love, but I don't like this treatment. I refuse him. I'd be kissing him and feeling sexually excited and then he'd push harder for sex and I'd pull back. It is very frustrating for him and for me. I try to talk myself into doing it for his sake, but I keep feeling so uncomfortable, that I stop. He asks me why I won't do it and I say because you nag me so much about it, it isn't fun any more.
