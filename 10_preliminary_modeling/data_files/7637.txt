I was in a church setting but there was not room in the main hall. I found a table for my family with three chairs. There was some group next to me talking about someone from Anderson. I was nosey, but I realized that I didn't know the person they were talking of. For some reason I wadded up paper and threw it towards a basket. It fell on the floor and the people nearly where it fell looked at me. The music became very strong from the inside. I stood up and looked in. There were four young people playing the piano very hard and loud. Not church music. Someone named Walter Reeder, father-in-law, walked out and handed me an item to take care of, about the size of a shoebox. I didn't know what to do so I left to find other people with the same box to help me. After a long search and some problem crossing the street, I found some men to help. They forced credit cards into sliding slots of the box and a date came up. They said the date was a joke on the owner of the box as to how much money they paid to stay at a hotel. The was with a woman. The other part of the box was a , which was a ticket to the dance. Then Walt showed up and I gave the box back to him. I then left with two suitcases pulling them. One was mine and the other belonged to someone else.
