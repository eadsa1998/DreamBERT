["Hospital rooms and irregular fast heart beat."] I am walking through a series of Hospital rooms. Each room has a bed and a patient and a front door to the right. I am using connecting doors the medical personnel use. I feel strange using this door and am relieved I am carrying a stethoscope so I wouldn't get caught. I see a front door opened in a room with no patient. I run through to the hall. Now, a fire alarm goes off, loud and insistent. I am running. I feel out of breath and the beginnings of my irregular heart beat begins. But I have to keep running. My heart is beating very fast. Now the building is like a dorm. I rush out the building and see remodeling like its been bombed out. I notice the room numbers and realize I am several units/buildings away from my own dorm room. I keep running.
