Mom committed suicide at next door neighbor's house. I was with my brother-in-law. He thought it was my sister [his wife] who had done it. We went back to the house and my sister said "No, Mom committed suicide." All of her things were spread out in the neighbor's yard and there was a wet place on the wood fence where her brains (clear, sticky fluid) had splattered. Her body was not there, only a shirt of mine that she had embroidered.
