I was working in a factory that was a darkroom after everybody left at the end of their shift. It was on the edge of Brooklyn. After the people left I had to go around and turn off the lights and wait for them to fade out. The paper was way too high on top of a cabinet. I got one sheet at a time. I asked Ackerman a question. I was printing a picture of him. I turned the enlarger upside down and aimed it at the ceiling. Instead of using a negative, I put my head in the light and printed from the shadow of the light. The shape of the illuminated face. I had found something good and Marianna said she would stand by me till I made it. The prints were 24" x 42." A pile of laundry was on the table. The down jackets had just washed and dried. A man came and picked up the black one and the green one. He liked the multi-colored one but it was not his. He offered $10 for it but the man who owned it was not there.
