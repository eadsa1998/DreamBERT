I was a large reception room which was given by some people that I know. I seemed to be busily at work gorging myself with all types of foods. I noticed a huge display of drinks which was actually amazing in that the containers which were orange and red and yellow were piled on top of each other in a pyramid fashion. I believe a friend of mine entered the picture, and then I woke up.
