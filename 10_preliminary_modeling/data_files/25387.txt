 I'm in a car after seeing a movie. A family friend, Izzy Brock, has gotten new shoes for his wife, Leslie. The shoes may have been free. My friend Beth Mock is there. She has crackers. Someone is asking questions. My friend from grade school Matt Yams is there. He is talking about his case of Horse Hoof beer, in bottles. We are near Armstrong high school. My friend Kevin Simpson is with Beth and I by Armstrong. There is a small river or swampy area there. I find some fossils. One fossil is a huge tooth the size of a fist. The other fossil is a cast of a cat's head. The next day we're in the same place, which is then wooded. We're going to move out of the area; we must have camped there during the night. There are two guys there who are leading a group of male campers. The campers are in a line seven miles long. There are two more guys there. I call one of each of the groups of two guys cute. They are belligerent. One of these guys is my friend Sam Crimson from Brimson. He throws a punch at me. I dodge the punch. They think I'm gay and am hitting on them. I say, "I can't believe you just did that." We fight. I kick his ass. He lands one good punch on me. I land a lot of punches on him: 10 or 11. There is a card table there that I smash his head into repeatedly. Then he is the "multi-gender" guy from my Educational Psychology class (this is my nickname for him). He is mad! He grabs two knives, one of which is a huge butcher knife. I use the card table to beat him away. A police officer comes up behind him and hits him on the back of his head with a gun. He falls down.
