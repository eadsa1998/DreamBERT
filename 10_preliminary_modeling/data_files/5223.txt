I dreamed first that Sue and Hannah and I were all in Poland. We were walking around my high school (in Poland) and saw Angelina at the auditorium. We all went in to watch a movie. Then, I dreamed that my father was up against 6 saber-toothed tigers, and that he defeated them all. Reporters from ESPN wanted to interview him. He kept saying things like, "I'm da man," "Who's your daddy?," and "I'm in da house!" My last dream was that Hannibal Lecter kidnapped me and he wanted to kill me. Then I woke up.
