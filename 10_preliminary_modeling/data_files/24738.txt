The science teacher, Melissa, was showing us pictures of science projects, and she came to one of a girl lying on her stomach with her head to the side. Next to her was her lunchbox. Melissa told us what happened. She was doing an experiment to see if she could tell why her lunchbox was making weird noises. She had her project set up in the middle of a freeway (don't ask why). When she opened the lunchbox this poisonous gas came out and put her unconscious. The police somehow knew about it and came. They told her to put on a gas mask next time, so she did and completed the project. Setting: At school, but Melissa's story within the dream took place on the freeway. Characters: Melissa - science teacher, preparing us for the upcoming science fair. Girl - didn't know, wasn't actually there. Rest of class - my usual class. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. It was a bit peculiar, but not over over weird.
