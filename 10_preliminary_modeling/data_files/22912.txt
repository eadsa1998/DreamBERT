My wife Bonita and I were at a party-at Norman and Sheila's apartment, I think.  Kathy Reynault was there, and we were friends.  Her hair was very long again, and it was tied in a knot in front, with the loose ends hanging down either side of her face.  It was very pretty.  I don't remember much else -- just a table around which we were all standing or milling, and the fact that some of us tried, by means of a rope, to scale the wall of a ceilingless partitioned-off area in the apartment or adjacent to it.
