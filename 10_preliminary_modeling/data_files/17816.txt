I was on a boat with some people, working, perhaps dealing.  I went downstairs into the cabin and was supposed to collect all the guns- there were a lot.  Everybody had some.  I don't remember if someone had been shot or what..but there was some threat that caused the order.  I saw my kindergarten teacher Mrs. Moore while I was down there, and my boyfriend Jeremy was there too.  Jeremy said she touched his arm.  For some reason this occurred to me as a particularly sensitive statement and I was very happy about it, pleased or proud that he would note such a thing.  Then we went back upstairs and for some reason I was left in control of the boat.  Someone told me to steer 10 feet to the right.  I had no idea how much turning would make the boat go 10 feet.  So I just started swinging the wheel around.  We scraped the side of a nearby boat.  We were going so fast any type of control really wasn't an option.  We reached a rim..and end of the waterway we were in and had to make a sort of U-turn banking on the edge.
