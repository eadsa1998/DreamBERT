I'm on the beach, and also maybe an actor in a play that's getting ready to begin (a huge play, with literally thousands of people there. I don't ever remember seeing the actual performance start, though). There's a motorcycle around, and I decide to either ride it around or move it somewhere. Then I remember running through a gate over to some other building, but I don't remember what I did there. I'm back, it's dark, and Laura wants to "demonstrate" something. There's a loud television or jukebox or something making too much noise. I try to turn it down and the volume won't work. I do turn a knob which starts to cover the "screen" with a (wooden?) cover, and it makes slightly less noise, but it's still too loud. Now I remember being at the top of the high hill behind the beach, and watching a beautiful ocean scene. "My motorcycle" is there, and someone else in a motorcycle pulls up. I thought he might think I stole it just by looking at it, or else he'd ask me a couple questions about my particular motorcycle and I'd have no idea what he was talking about, get suspicious, and nail me anyway. I just decided to leave the motorcycle there, and quietly climb down the hill to the beach, as if that's what I was planning on all along. But I think the guy starts to chase me, and I'm running through huge crowds, and a lot of people are trying to catch me, many more than I thought knew that I took the motorcycle. So, I'm running ("beach" is really a brick or stone floor) diagonally toward the water. I could decide to go through the gate too, but something tells me the water might be safer.
