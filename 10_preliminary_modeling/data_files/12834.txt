I was watching this dating show. People kept going to the Titanic. These bodies would always float up. I was complaining to Dad about it. This lady on the show decided on a date with a dog instead of this guy. That white thing from The Neverending Story was on this bridge that looked like the one in a level in Crash Bandicoot: Warped.
