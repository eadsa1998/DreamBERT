I was at some place with Calvin and Elijah. My dream books and dreams were on my bedside table. Calvin was trying to look to see who I liked and I said "Just wait man!". I said that the person I liked had hardly been in my dreams. I was then flicking through the books and showing Elijah some of the pages. One of the pages had a list of 'top 10 guys' from school and Eugene was first obviously. I said "oops" and told Elijah not to say anything. Calvin wanted him to tell him what it said. Elijah wrote down a list of who he thought my top 10 was and Dmitri was third and he was first. I was at a place outside with the school. There was a big track for a rollercoaster type of thing. I was watching people on it and Jeremiah asked me to join them and I said no. Fatima and a girl were with me. I was climbing up from there and Eugene was coming back down and then Alejandro and I went at the same time. There was food and some strawberries. They were giving them out and at the same time, Eugene and I said "No cream!".
