I was at Nana's. She had this swampy fish pond with frogs and she was trying to get them to kill them. She pulled one out and it was covered in seaweed. She was giving it food and water to tempt it over. It jumped on me and was snuggling and then it was a cat. Later, I was driving this thing and was looking out for animals and crashed into this thing and hurt myself. Then it was later and Aunt Sally and Dad were watching this thing where they were acting like mimes. There were three cousins and one was old, and one was a boy, and one was a girl. Dad, Ezra and I drove to this fair and saw a friend or a relative and said "good luck Eugene" -- he was going to have photos taken with a retard. Then Ezra and this girl had stuff in common and this guy and I were looking at "nerdy" stuff. The girl was making Ezra buy her stuff and asked him to the prom.
