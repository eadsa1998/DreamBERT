I was in a medical school or maternity ward. Doctor and students grouped around a pregnant woman--or specialists with other doctors--she had big bulging belly but no pudenda. He was curious as to how she conceived--through anus was some of speculation. He split it and out came baby. The area was hairless and smooth as any skin. Afterwards--a lapse of days?--the woman was sexy and asked me to rub the newly made pudenda, especially the clitoris that was revealed or discovered or uncovered for first time. Some joy of sharing that first experience, but not complete ecstasy since a lingering memory of operation in that area, though operation and birth not ugly or bloody. (The language of the doctors was quite scientific, some big words I don't remember.)
