Am in some sort of hospital or prison and sitting at window looking out. A nurse says the coffee cart is there and she goes for a cup of coffee. Later I am drinking it at window and the cart nurse walks in. I say, "I don't hear your bell way back here." She goes to a nearby bulletin board as another nurse, heavy and severe, approaches and says roughly, "Drink your coffee!" I ignore her and continue talking to the one at the board, repeating what I said earlier just to annoy the bossy nurse. I also add that next time I would like her to bring me a piece of chocolate cake and an orange.
