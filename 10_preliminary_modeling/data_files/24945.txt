 I'm at my house in Oak Valley. The lights are off, and it's nearly dark outside. I'm on my uncle Vev Redding's bed. There is a CD in. It's Bob Mould's Black Sheets of Rain playing, but it's sort of a mix. On the CD there is the shape of the Hot Wheels logo, with words on it. I think it says Bob Mould, but I'm not sure. I'm going to masturbate lying on the bed. The phone rings. I go to pick it up. It's Hilary Nano's mother. My friend Simon Naver picks up the phone from the basement. He's either really drunk or stoned. I think he's hung over. I tell Simon that he's at my house, that this is Kenneth (speaking). He hangs up. Hilary's mother is worried and asks where she is. I tell her they left a while ago, and Hilary should be home in a couple hours. The other phone lines keep ringing. I hear them in the basement, and keep clicking over to answer the calls. It's my sister Heather or her friends. They're distracting me from talking to Hilary's mother. When I click back, Hilary's brother says hi. They are worried about her.
