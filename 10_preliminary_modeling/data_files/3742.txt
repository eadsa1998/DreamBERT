I am on the sidewalk in a crowd. A parade of some kind is about to happen. As I start to work my way through the crowd to get to the curb edge to see better, an Eastern Indian man in a white diaper-like thing dashes past me and shoves his way past me. I notice with some negative shuttering that he only has one leg. He bounces on a table and then takes off. Later, some people are accusing me of something and need to know where I was. I describe in detail where I stood, the man and what he looked like. My witness is Lucy, a blind woman, who had smelled him and that was good enough. They believed us.
