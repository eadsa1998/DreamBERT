I dreamed my father, my roommate and myself went out to a lighthouse in Lake Erie. It was a sightseeing tour of the deepest part of the lake. Somehow, when it was time to submerge, the only person going down was me. I don't' think I was frightened, but I was a little nervous because the man who was to go with me was late. I can remember worrying that my hair was going to get wet and that I was having trouble wrapping a scarf around my head. Finally the man arrived and ordered me to get into the contraption which was like a diving bell. I can remember the opening was a little below the water and I had to hold my breath in order to get inside of it. It was very damp inside and there was water on the floor. We finally took off and I waved goodbye to daddy and my mother from the peep holes.
