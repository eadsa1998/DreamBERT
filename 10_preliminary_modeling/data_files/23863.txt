Several ongoing things about Mondo [the coffee house I wanted to buy in Moab].  I was there, and it was an older and poorer place than it really is, more run-down and yucky.  I met with the owners, talked about the place.  I was looking at the lighting, to figure out how to change it, it was fluorescent.  And there was a whole back area, with wood tables, an extra room, which I hadn't known about.  At one point I was late for something there, stressed about getting there, also trying to find Mondo in the car with my middle sister, but we were on highways like in Dallas.  Also looking for something in my purse which was messy.
