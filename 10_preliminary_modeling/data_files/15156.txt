I was doing quests and one was in a tree. Then I was at a building and I had to get in this secret area that I wasn't allowed in. The name on door was Jesus and the last name also had 'esus' in it. I was going to take a photo. Then I, and someone I was with, got some ice-cream and lollies. I couldn't find my phone when we left, so I got her to call it. I asked "is Henry VIII playing?" and she said "no". I had a different ring tone, but I found it. It was 3pm, but it was pitch black outside. The car was further away then I remembered. We got into it and locked the doors. Some people were driving up and down the road and then suddenly started going fast. I waited and then reversed and tried to leave but they were blocking the street and I had to drive up the curb and get on the freeway. There were 4 lanes and the people in the car followed me very closely. I went over the speed limit a bit and I was worried. I saw a police car with its lights and siren on and I didn't know who it was after because it was a few lanes over. Darren was watching The Hangover and I caught a bit of it. Ed Helms was in it, but everyone else was different. Marshall (How I Met Your Mother) was a character in it, and another character (but not a real one) was as well, played by George Clooney. Neil Patrick Harris was also in it as himself. Marshall, Lily, George Clooney and a girl were making out on a bed. Kristen Stewart was in a car and she was saying things like 'hey, there's Nikki Reed, shouldn't she turn into a dog or something', 'hey, there's Nikki Reed in a tree'. They hugged. I was thinking the movie was really lame.
