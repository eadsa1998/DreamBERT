Mr. Florida removes his shoes and tells me of how he had injured one foot and now it puffs out. Both insteps look red and puffy. Mr. Black enters and Fla. Introduces himself and Black does too. But Dave B. had really come to see me and asked for an appointment. I say, "not today but tomorrow. A girl is coming. I don't know when, but you can see me any time between 9 and 12 a.m." He says 9 is too early. Leaves. I wonder where we'll meet, in this lounge, my room or at the university. I should have told him.
