I was being accused of stealing my roommate's things from his room. An undercover cop came by and went into my top drawer and pulled the missing shirt from my drawer. He warned me but said we'd make a deal. He left and stuff from my roommate's room was winding up in my room. She eventually found out. However, she said she knew it wasn't me.
