I was at a hotel. I walked to a Beauty Parlor. We did this thing where you had to find something and put it in this bucket. I was with these two girls and I almost died - except one of them put in some glitter in the last few seconds, so I didn't die. Setting: At the parlor. Characters: Two girls (unknown). Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I was afraid I might die.
