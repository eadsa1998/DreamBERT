Don Johnson is very attracted to me and vice versa, but he's angry at me because I'm teasing him by acting like I don't care about him and walking away. I walk down the stairs laughing. He follows me and taunts me in an angry voice. He then leaves and shuts the door. Then he says, "I love you." I hear him through the door and I say, "I love you" back. He then opens the door and we hug and kiss. Now he's Dovre and he/she says she's going to get married and won't tell me to whom. I smile and say, "You don't have to tell me, I know. It's Bob, because I already saw the future (like already saw the movie)." She sneers and says, "A lot you know! It's not Bob." I am surprised and ask, "Then are these altered realities?" She smiles and says yes. "Then, I don't have to marry Howard again?" I ask, and realize I don't. So I say to Howard, "Sorry. Maybe some other time," and leave. He shrugs and goes off to wait.
