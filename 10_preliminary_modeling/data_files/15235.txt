Mom and I were watching The Terminator on Blu-Ray, but it was different. I said it looked good and Mom said she preferred it "old school" and I said I was going to say that. She said it felt "more candid" and I said 'yeah, Blu-Ray is too stylized' and then "What do you call it when they make people pose?". Also I was with Dad and Ezra and I wanted ice-cream but they forgot me and told me to go out and get it myself. Some others and I were on the run. We didn't know each other before this. They kept getting killed. I liked a few of them. There was a guy called Dave and he was interested in this girl. He was nice and I was thinking that I'd like to get to know him after this. Then it was night. We were outside and we took the train home. All the lights were off and we quietly moved around the carpark. We saw someone and someone said to try and get into a car. Someone picked up a log and smashed it into the window. This girl ended up getting a bit in the corner and it broke. We opened the doors and got in. Dave was on the driver's side and the person got him and he died and fell out. We locked the doors and the girl got in the driver's seat and we left. We got to some building and I said "I keep thinking I'd like to get to people and then they die!" She went to go to the toilet and there were lots of mirrors. I thought something was up. She was getting attacked by River (Firefly). I got a knife and she threw these spinning spiky things. I had this thing which looked like a pen but it had a soft bit at the end which vibrated and I used it to disable the thing she had thrown. She left the girl to attack me. I pushed her into an elevator and called to the girl and she disabled it and closed the door and I sent it down.
