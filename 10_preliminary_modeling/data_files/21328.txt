I was looking at a pile of pennies and I found a few old Indian head pennies. I looked at one I held it close to my eye and on a slant it was bright and shiny and the series was 1830. I could see it so clear. Audrey was in the eighth grade. She had a month and a half to graduate and she wanted to quit already. I didn't want her to. I was in church. We had chairs to sit on and I got a rag and was wiping up the chairs that were dirty.
