Farrah and her 'mother', Jill, came over to see us [instead of Uncle Vic, which was happening in real life]. Jill looked like a blonde actress, but I can't remember who she is. Anyway, they had this small cute puppy. We were standing near a road, and it kept running out onto the road and I kept grabbing it back. They said it was a Jack Russell cross. We were then at some wildlife place. I recognized it. It was made of wood, the floors and the walls, and the rest was caged (it was up high too). I walked into this section I remembered going into with Dad at the Gold Coast. I realized there were lots of snakes in there wrapped around the poles. I walked away but got caught on something. A green snake opened up its mouth and I called Mom to help. It jumped at me and I grabbed it and threw it away. I could see a dude on the ground below talking to a group of people and he had a baby owl. It looked like a puppy and was extremely cute. Farrah was talking about a dream she had where "we were human and these two killer queens...". I thought of 'Killer Queen' and I said "like the Queen song?!". I think someone wanted to get an owl now.
