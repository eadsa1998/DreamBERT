I was being held hostage by two people who i knew, sometimes it was Ezra and a friend. We stopped at this shop place, and at first I was driving this little car thing (they had a gun to my head), but put it down here. They wanted me to drive straight through this crowd of people and I argued it would draw attention, so we went the other way. We were then walking and went through a security check and it beeped for me because I had my phone, money and a thermometer thing. They let us go. At one point, I stole the guy's keys and ran to the car to get away. It was slow to take off and they jumped in and stopped me before I could get anywhere. Later, I was at school. I was called up to the office for news we (Ezra and I) wouldn't want to hear; Darren had died drinking a "ratty beer". I wasn't sure whether to be happy or annoyed at this news, because this Darren was a 'bad guy' and I was worried about what money we would survive on.
