I'm driving and I keep taking the wrong turns. At first, I end up on a dirt road beside the highway, on the right. I come to a stop and realize I have to back up. I tell the female passenger to watch on the right side so I don't go over the edge into the river. I watch the left side so I don't hit a 3' wall. She turns to me and says, "I think you'd better watch this side. I don't want us to go off into the river." I kind of look at her like, "Woo, what a slow brain." I back up, and get back on the highway. Then I take a left side road and I'm really frustrated now. All this is taking time and I just want to get on with my journey. I pound my steering wheel and say, "Damn it!" We are on a one way narrow road that spirals down and down and down. I am aware that if I had been quick enough just before the spiral started, I could have taken a left road that would have got me back on the highway easier. I feel like it's "one of those days," nothing goes right. We end up in a room. An older woman, the captain of a ferry boat, comes over. I ask her how to get back up to the highway. She says, "The only way to do that is to take my ferry and it will cost." There are 3 ferry rides between here and central (state). I realize we are far below the highway, perhaps deep in the river already. I see it rushing past and wonder how you start a ferry ride when you're under water to start with. I think, "This woman is just trying to get money out of me." I ask her, "Well, how do you get back on the highway? Do you go clear to central (state) first and turn and go back?" She smiles and says, "No, I take route XXX." I look on my map, figuring I'll take that route. I can't find it, so I give up and pay for the ferry ride.
