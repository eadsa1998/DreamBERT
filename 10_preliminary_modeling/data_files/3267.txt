I had been doing some work on paper and then it got crowded and I started to leave, and then decided to return to take my papers. I end up in a library or store and look. I ask where left papers are and she points to a counter. I start to go and then remember it was art work, and not writing I did. That is in another space. Then I feel a strong need to pee and go in search of the bathroom.
