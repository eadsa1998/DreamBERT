Now it's Dwight in the tree and my mother, my father and I are looking for him. We notice the tree is close to a small town and near the coast highway. How clever we think. My mother, my father and I go into a shop and look around. Suddenly we realize we are in someone's home and they are at the door about to come in. We go hide in the bathroom. I'm pushing my mother because she's embarrassed and doesn't know what to do.
