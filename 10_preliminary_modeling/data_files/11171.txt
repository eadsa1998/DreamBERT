This dream occurred at my home where a deserter from the army was now hiding. This soldier was the same young man I had dreamed about the night before. Our fruit cellar seemed to be very well stocked. In fact, it was overcrowded. We were living in our basement recreation room and using the fruit cellar for a bomb shelter. Outdoors bombs were being dropped, but the only visible damage was the presence of huge holes in the streets. There were road blocks at close intervals along the street and I was unsuccessfully trying to push my grandfather's large two-wheeled cart down the middle of the road. This seemed to be piled high with cabbages of all things, which weren't in the best condition. During this time, the blond lad was hiding in the house peering from the front window of the bedroom which was mine while I was in high school. All day he sat there focusing my dad's binoculars on the enemy soldiers who were patrolling the five points in front of our house. Only at night did he leave the house. At this time we would go for walks together.
