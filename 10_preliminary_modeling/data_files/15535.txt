I watched Dr Strangelove with Ezra and some others. The end was similar, but different to what I remembered and they found it funny and I said I didn't anymore and brought it down a rating. They had accidentally started the countdown but had stopped it, and then the guy was on the bomb. Ezra and I were outside on the grass and I said I'd been outside heaps lately because of reading at Nana's. Uncle Wilbur and Mom were there. She made a joke about him being single and in his 40s and said that I'd be copying him/beating him and I said 'that's what I wanted'. Queer as Folk had different endings. There was one that people said was "like 2004 style Queer as Folk" and Stuart had an orgy with 3 guys. This black American woman moved in with 2 gay guys who owned a business that allowed people to move in with gay people. The room for them was soundproof. She said 'I spend most of my time caring for this child' and was very posh. She said 'as long as the latest you go to bed is 2am, it should be fine'. Brian showed up there.
