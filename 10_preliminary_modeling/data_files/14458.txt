I can't remember this dream properly, as it was all over the place. I was on MSN talking to Ezra. I was friend with Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer). There was this rooftop looking place, but it wasn't a rooftop, where there was a moving block that came from the ground and was what Spike used to get into his underground area and back up. I remembered back to when I was young and watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Spike had hung out here all the time. I laughed and told him about him sitting 'cool' and with a skeleton on top of a coffin. People kept resurrecting family members. I remembered walking around the block and how almost every girl had watched some movie. I don't remember what it was and I was telling Ezra about it.
