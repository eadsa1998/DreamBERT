["Stairways to school."] I am going to school again. There are lots of stairways. I tell a nice man that I have trouble getting around with so many stairs to walk. He is helpful. Ginny is there. We are traveling in a white car. I am repacking stuff in the back seat. I place a milk jug in the back window area. I wonder if it will go bad if I leave it there.
