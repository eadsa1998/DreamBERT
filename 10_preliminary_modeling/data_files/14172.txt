Madonna, sometimes Granma, brought me to this boardwalk near a beach. It was night. She had set some stuff up and wanted to show it to me. There were feathers placed around as some sort of clue. There was a hot tub with flower petals in it. I was trying to take a photo of it. The reason for it was she had fixed something with swans in it and the petals were for someone called Rose. Then I was in a car waiting for someone. Someone was outside so I locked the door. I tried to take photos with my phone with the flash on but I couldn't see them. They came up close and it was Jeremy Piven. He walked around the car and smiled. He told me to call him, now, which confused me but I did anyway. I selected 'bitch' on the phone which allowed him to go somewhere. Then Robert Downey Jr. got in the car as the lock didn't apply to him. He went to Red Rooster and asked "Do you want anything?" and I said "Can I get a Flayva?" I think he was annoyed. I think Jeremy Piven and I ended up having sex and we had been for a while. Mom and Ezra were going to Seaworld and I was telling her about the cool stuff such as the jet skiing and the beach at the Gold Coast. I accidentally said "Lindsay Lohan" instead of something.
