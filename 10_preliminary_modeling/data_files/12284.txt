We were at Granma's, but Mom lived there. There were bunk beds. Zander was there and I was saying something about the fact that most of his name uses the first row of the keyboard. There was a bridge with birds. There was something about some evil Juanita thing. There were blankets. I had a science test and we got held in for ages. There was an owl.
