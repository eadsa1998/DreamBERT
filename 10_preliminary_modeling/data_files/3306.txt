I am walking with Ellie and Charla. A huge, rough man comes rushing past and beyond us on the sidewalk to an empty field. Ellie starts taking off her clothes. I am appalled. I want us to get out of here and back toward safety and she seems to be courting the danger. He sits in the muddy grass. She goes over and sits with him. I turn and walk away back to the sidewalk with Charla. I see two steps up to the cement sidewalk and a huge horse turd on the step and a gun or rifle the man had put there. Now the man is roughing up Ellie, and she cries out "No, don't hit me, then I'll look bad for my boyfriend. He'll be upset." The man is going to hurt her, possibly rape her. Ellie calls out for them to stop; another man is going to help him. I rush up the sidewalk calling out, "Help me. I need a phone. Help me someone." I go to apartment buildings and pound on doors and look for lights that indicate anyone is home. No one is home or responds. "Help me," I call, now leaving Charla behind in the men's pickup truck in order to go faster for help. I am scared and concerned for them both.
