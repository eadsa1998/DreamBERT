A woman like Katrina is teaching me to be a light. I try and then I become this beautiful light, like a tinkerbell, with xmas lights flashing. I am flying around the living room, landing in different places here and there. A man comes in and is trying to get me. My light gives me away. He chases me as I move from place to place. Katrina tells me to flap my wings and fly up high. I try, but it is hard. I go through the layers of wood in the frame of the house and he is on the opposite side, nearly getting me (see drawing in dream book). Finally I flap my wings very hard and get going very fast and shoot up into the heavens. [BL]
