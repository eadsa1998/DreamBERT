I was at home, but it was different and possibly a new house. My room was big and had a desk and a bed. It didn't have carpet. Cuddles came in and a small slug dropped off her. There were heaps of slugs around my door, including this big brown snake thing. I told Mom and she told me to spray this stuff everywhere. It ate through things so I had to put the LAN cord and all my cords up high.
