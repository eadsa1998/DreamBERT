My little brother and I were asleep in our room and I felt something fluttering against my head. I thought it was a bird that somehow got in the house, but when the fluttering stopped, [I woke and my father came in and said he just let a dog out of the back door. Apparently a dog got in the house without us knowing and started to roam around when we went to sleep.] [I got the bird idea from a bird I see all the time down at the warehouse where I work, who will fly in a window and sit on one of the steel supports in the building.] [I then thought during the dream that the fluttering was actually the dog's tail wagging and touching my head.]
