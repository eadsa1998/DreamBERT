["Gay men and the contest.."] Two gorgeous men, one George Hamilton, tanned, black hair, well muscled and gay. They are in one of their apartments. They are in competition with each other. They look in the mirror and fuss with their appearance. George decides to make a batch of extremely hot chili. He had to practice eating it so he could survive it. His face looks ashen and grey from the extreme heat of the chili. He then takes off a face mask cosmetic thing and looks better. He is smirking because he knows he'll win this contest. Then the other gay man asks if he has any dresses. He says of course. The other man says where are they? George points to a door. The other man says I don't know which way. So George sighs and walks over to the door and opens it. He points to the right where dresses are hanging. I see the corner of a pink printed one. The man goes in to investigate.
