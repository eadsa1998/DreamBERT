I was in Rome with a patient on the ward named Fugel. We were in a place with narrow halls. Fugel had something strange in his hands. He was saying, "I'm doing as the Romans do." Later a patient named Trout wanted me to buy an amusement park. He had a large amount of money to give me for the purchase. We were patients at a hospital, and I was being released. I suggested that he hire a lawyer to help him get released instead of buying an amusement park.
