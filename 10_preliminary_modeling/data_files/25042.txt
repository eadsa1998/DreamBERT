 I'm at the Body Shop gymnasium. They have some bench press benches with bent bars, with a couple of right angles in the bar. There is almost no room for one's head between the bar and the bench. I squeeze under a bar and do a few repetitions of bench press. It is really hard. (See notebook for sketches.)
