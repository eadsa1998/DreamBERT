["Mom and Ellie paint."] There is a painting of a mountain range, a middle ground and a foreground. I look at another painting my mother did and watch as she accents a circle with darker color so it makes a distinct object like a rock. I look at my painting where there are only vague shapes. Suggestions of the landscape. Ellie begins to paint on my painting. It is taking better shape now. I am learning from the past.
