A young teen woman and me (a young teen woman) are on the run from a policeman who is after us. He is ruthless and out to get us. I try and protect my friend but the policeman (plain clothes man) grabs her and drags her with him. He is interrogating her, threatening her, yelling at her. She yells out "Officer Dunn" a kind of officer at a lower level. He hears her and races up to where she is to help protect her. He races right up to the bad cop, in his face, yelling let her go. The bad cop shoves him aside. He had forced her and me to give samples of our blood. We each have our sample in vials in our hands. He demands hers. She tries to fight him off. She manages to throw her vial so he can't get it. She runs toward Officer Dunn. The bad cop comes after me, livid with hate and rage. I run into a small lab room and out again. I yell I threw it away. He sneers and goes into the lab room and picks up a vial. He says if you say you threw it away, then you didn't and this is it. He tips up his head and drinks it down fast. I scream No, No. It was some kind of acid poison. He convulses out of the chair onto the floor screaming in his horror and the pain. Oh, God, he screams. He is seated now cross legged in an upright fetal ball position. He says in pain I mustn't be so loud. I scream Oh God Oh God. As loud as I can. He dies quickly. I wake up hearing both our screams echoing loudly in my mind. Horror. Nightmare. I felt shocked.
