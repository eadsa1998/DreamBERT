I was with another fellow, a friend of mine. It seemed that we were in occupied territory of some foreign power. It was night and we were near a railroad which at times seemed to be a canal. We were near a crossing of two RR or canals. At the crossing there were four fellows who appeared to be of the tall blond German type. They were throwing small gas bombs at people on the trains or canal boats. The people would die and fall off. After a while my friend and I seemed to be trapped by these same four fellows and were trying to figure a way of escape. Our plan seemed to depend on the capture of some small animal and we were going to attract it with some peanut butter that we put on a crack in the window beside the corner in which we were hidden.
