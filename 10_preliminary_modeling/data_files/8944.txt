I was preparing for my Organizational Behavior class. It seemed to go and on and on. I was struggling with what to cover and what to put in the outline. Somewhere in the middle of all this, it feels like I am at home but at the same time it feels like I am at a university. I am outdoors. Moving from one townhome into another. I had to wait for someone else to move out before I could move into the new place. That meant I would have a different parking space but I couldn't park there until I actually moved into the new townhome. I had my microcassette tape recorder and was using it as a pogo stick. There were four other items that I was using in some way other than they were intended. But I was using them as toys in some way. Some people were teasing me, fondly. It didn't bother me at all. I think my response or thought was something about the kid in me. Someone said something and I said they would need to ask Cedric H. I did the pogo stick thing twice.
