Someone in our close family died. I went to a shop with Dad and Ezra and we were buying food. I didn't want to go to the funeral because "I don't believe in funerals". Dad yelled at me about it. Later, we were at a place where they were buried. I had written something about Runescape and in this hill there were print screens of Runescape stuck on the side. We walked across the hill and went to this house. It was Granma's. She gave me and Ezra these cool pencils to draw with. Mom and Ezra were waiting in the car for me, while I wrote down the brand of the pencil. It was in Greek or something. This cop came and I realized there was going to be a raid. Mom got sick of waiting for me and left. I called and text her to meet me around the corner. She got me and I said there was a raid. The radio was on and there was a Searchers song playing and then Summer of 69.
