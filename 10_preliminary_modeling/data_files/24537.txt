I'm with my friends from Veterans for Peace. I have an idea for a play. It's based on a photo I took of my platoon in VN. When the new picture is taken, we are all dressed in bulky but fashionable clothes dyed in earthy reds and browns.  We look a bit like Taliban, or Arab fighters. We will tour the country. At a train station, we stand like the platoon in the photo.  I'm the leader, and I want people to see me, to know that. My mood is very good. Recollection ends.
