There was this movie in the Top 250 with Will Arnett. It was a superhero comedy thing. It started and he had this 'ring' around him and it broke and people were laughing. Then his wife (who was Olive from Pushing Daisies) explained he was actually dreaming and in a room somewhere. His dream became this fairy floss monster. He wrote a symphony for his wife.
