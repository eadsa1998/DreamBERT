I was in a bathroom.  People were told to leave.  The hand dryer was out of control.  It was the last day of school.  I went in to visit the school librarian, Mrs. Roll.  I had ice cream in cupcake wrappers in a square container.  Mrs. Roll told me to take something out, so my 10th grade history teacher "Mr. Martinelli" would look foolish.  I talked to my classmate Meghan at lunch in the library.  The main lights were off.  Meghan told me how she used to do drugs.  I left the library and went into a bathroom on the left side.  It was 11:55.  It smelled bad.  Everything was blurry like a heat wave.  I was told to get out, the blower was going to explode.  I was in front of it, and the heat was blowing on my left elbow.  It blew up.  I was taken outside and comforted by a guy.  I wasn't supposed to put water directly on the wound, like a chemical burn.  It looked raw and was bleeding in spots.  I had a bloody nose, too.  My friend Day from badminton mentioned physics.  I was stunned.  When I awoke, my left elbow was sore and sensitive.
