I was talking on the phone to my friend Andy. He was saying that he was going to have one of his friends (male) move in with me. I said, "No thanks. I know how your friends are." I noticed a bug. He said, "Come on, he's really nice." The bug was crawling by the phone. It was huge, long, kind of burgundy colored, and had a lot of legs. I said, "Okay." I wouldn't mind having a roommate as long as he stays to himself, and pays his way. I looked at the bug and it jumped right on my leg. I flicked it off immediately. It flew and hit the wall, then landed on the floor. I squashed it.
