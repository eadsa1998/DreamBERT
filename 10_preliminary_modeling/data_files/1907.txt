Bonnie and I are done and go home. It's midnight and we are tired. Then we remember we have to take Mateo's baby sitter home. Bonnie says, "I'll take this one home and you take Maggie home." I am annoyed. I'm tired and hurting and I have to take a 2nd baby sitter home? Why did Mateo need two sitters anyway?
