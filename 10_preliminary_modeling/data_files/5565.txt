[1997-05-19] We were taking a tour of a huge school where many of the people there had problems with alcohol, drugs and other problems. People lived there too. This female high school kid was giving me a tour. She was on my right. I don't think I had my dog. I was going inside with her and so I had my right hand on her left arm. We were walking around the school and she was explaining things, we had to stop every now and again and listen to this boring speaker explain things. Then she said "Oh, remind me that I have to go to my room before we leave" so I said "okay" and I did and she went and did what she had to. She thanked me for reminding her. It was a very large building, and walking around was tiring because it was so spacious.
