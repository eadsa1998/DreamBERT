I was at school and I had to get to the top of this building to escape. The tubes were there. I forgot which one I took last time to get to the city, but I had to get there to meet my uncle. I slid down and landed at a nice resort pool. I went to a shack near the pool and my uncle wasn't there. I went to these bunk beds that were really cramped, but the lighting was very tropical. I climbed down one of the bunks.
