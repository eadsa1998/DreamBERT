It kept going back and forwards between real life and a video game. Body snatchers were taking over. They would be very flat and wooden and I think didn't blink as much. A female friend and I were in a house for some reason and then we had to escape because some of the family were body snatchers. We rushed about looking for windows and finally found one that we could fit through. As we were walking down the street/path, we saw two guys up ahead. One was Kit Harington and the other was ok looking. They slowed down and started walking with us and Kit was walking with me so I was happy that I got the hot one. The rest is mostly a blur, just snippets of us running away and meeting with people and then they would turn and we'd run away from them. I was working at the airport at some point and this little food place had nice looking muffins and cakes.
