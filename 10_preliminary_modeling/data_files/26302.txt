 I see some deer, including big does with fawns. I see many deer, about 10. I see some moose, including big cow moose with twin and triplet calves. I don't see any bucks or bulls. I seem to be near Carter School, near Delivery Avenue on the east side of the school. A cow moose and some calves walk right by us in the alley! An Asian man with three small children walks by. The children are the moose calves, and the Asian man may be the cow moose. There is a white goat that wanders over near me. It has curled gray horns. It has a five-gallon bucket of feed that it eats. It may have grabbed the bucket itself, or a man may have grabbed the bucket for the goat. The man is from Regions College. Two Australian kick boxers walk by in the alley. One has pads on, and the other is practicing on the padded man. The man from Regions says to me, "You don't see that (the Australian kick boxers) much." I agree, but there have been more in recent years.
