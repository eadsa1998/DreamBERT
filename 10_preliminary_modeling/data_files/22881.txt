All of my family, including Daddy, were downtown looking for something, in the 700 block of Crescent City.  I knew Daddy was going to die, and I kept telling him he had better quit walking.  We went by a movie theater where "The Nun's Story" was playing.  Mother said she would like to see it.  I encouraged her and Daddy to go see it, but they didn't.  There was a Walt Disney movie playing next door, and my sister Nancy wanted to see it, so she got in line there.  They were giving out clown suits, and Nancy wanted me to get one, so I did.  It was only a sort of wide, pyramid-shaped outfit with a hole through which to put your head, and a long, tall hat.  I went back to where Hillary was waiting in line for "The Nun's Story" with her family.  I noticed that Doug Dyer was there too, in another part of the line, with his family.  The line was moving toward a counter.  When Hilary, Doug, and all got there, his mother fixed them all some sandwiches.  Doug's little brother was climbing all over everything.
