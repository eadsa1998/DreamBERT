I was at the stadium with Joshua (?) and I was doing a bunch of stuff, and I was traversing the, well, first I was up in the control room with him and I had to go down to the desk to get some papers for him. And then I think I was going to go, but some lady gave me a graduation pencil and I forgot it, so I went back up there and I had my cane because there were so many steps and so many odd things, and nobody really seemed to ______ out any different, I just kind of found my way around. And there was this one set of steps that you had to down like a ladder, and I was glad that I had it, because if I didn't, I would have just went "splat" off the edge. [laugh] And then I made my way down and for some reason I had the notion that the audio control room was outside and down a little path, and down some more steps and down next to the water, where like a fishing deck would be. And that was kind of cool.
