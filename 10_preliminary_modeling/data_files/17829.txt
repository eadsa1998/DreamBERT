I was at the apartment, but the parking lot was much bigger.  I took the recyclables down to the dumpster and ended up in the elevator, which was on the outside of the building, with the fixit man.  He got on my case about not organizing my recyclables better, that the newspapers get moist and stick to the bottom of the dumpster and he has to go clean it out.  It wasn't the first time he'd mentioned it to me, although I didn't recognize him, but I had forgotten.  I apologized.  For some reason he offered me a ride and I got in his truck.  We drove to the other end of the apartments (they were much larger).  I went in the office, and it was like I was going to work.  I think we were getting ready to close for the day.  I took off my dress shoes and sat them in the corner, and I climbed under a desk to unplug or turn something off.  Then I went outside, and the apartment was on the water's edge.  I think then the building was supposed to be a school, and there were children playing in the water.  On the left was a waterfall, and next to that was a small house on stilts just above the water.  Might have had a waterwheel, too.  I noted it was unusual for the kids to have an opportunity like that.
