I couldn't control myself and I ended up miles away. At one point I was driving a car and I was going everywhere and really fast. There was a tree with evil lizards. I ended up on this long road with forests on the side. I was walking along and I was naked, with a towel around me. This guy gave me food and clothes and let me sleep in his car for the night. He lived at some orphan place. When I got home I looked it up and I found 'David McDonald' (David Tennant) on there. The guy sent me a card.
