I was wagging school and Dad, Ezra and Jayson came back from school. I dived under one blanket in a corner. Jayson was asking Dad some math question. Dad came into my room to explain it. He got on my computer and started trying to explain it to him. At one point, Dad dropped his phone right near me, but didn't notice me. I couldn't keep still though, and eventually Dad noticed I was under there.
