["Egor the donkey."] I am in a room with other actors. It has been decided that I won't be in the play, but the director asks me to read for a part anyway. I am to read the part of Egor the Donkey. I try to read the script but the print is very small and the pictures, like yellow beaked Tuku birds are hard to see. I struggle trying to get the character. Then I say wait. I need my glasses. I put them on and continually come up with creative little scenes that are amusing and cute. I am getting better at the work and wonder why he is featuring me if I'm not going to be in the play.
