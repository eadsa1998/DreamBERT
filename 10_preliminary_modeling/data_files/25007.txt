 I'm by Carter church with my friend Tiny Combs. My truck has been parked in a no-parking zone. I have a parking ticket. On the ticket it says that this is my first ticket for parking in a no-parking zone. I feel like I'm at Brimson. I move my truck by pushing it from the driver's side door. I scrape Tiny's car and another car as I move it. I back it up without starting the engine, and then push it forward to start the engine while it's moving. <br/
