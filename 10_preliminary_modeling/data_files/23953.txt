I was on the phone with my parents. I remember most my dad. He was saying that he only had 15 more minutes to live. There were some people who were on their way over to where they were to kill them. Only 15 more minutes and then they would be shot - assassinated. I freaked out. Balling my eyes out. We became disconnected. It was all so fucking shocking that I felt this rage and hardcore fear knowing what was going to happen. I cried so hard my face was red and the veins in my neck and forehead were pulsing heavily. <br/
