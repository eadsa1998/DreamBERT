I dreamt that I was in Toledo, Ohio. I was with my dad (45) in the railroad station waiting for the Cleveland train. A gateman told us to wait at the end of the platform for our coach. There were many people waiting with us. The train came, but went right by us. Everyone became very angry. My brother (20) hollered, "They're sending a coach now." I boarded the train first and found a double seat at the end of the coach which I claimed for my dad and myself. Then I was walking down a quiet residential street with a strange girl who agreed to have sexual relations with me after it became dark.
