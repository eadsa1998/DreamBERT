I only dreamed that I had to take a test and I even dreamed about the questions. Then I was in a port, walking with a friend who forced me to have a beer with him (I don't usually drink it) and then he took me to a house of prostitution (I have the intention and the principles about getting married in a chaste state). We got out of there and I went to my home. I was listening to some music and laughing constantly. Then I awoke. This was a very strange dream.
