I dreamt I was at the bus stop waiting to go home, and there I met Gladys and the Chinese guy whose name is Victor, and they were making up because they had had a fight. Then she told me of their meeting and while she told me, I saw them hugging each other and even I could feel the warmth of their love. The Smith kid was with them and he was getting bored, so she decided to bring her cousin the next time. I saw how happy he and Gladys were.
