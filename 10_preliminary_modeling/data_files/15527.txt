Mom was having people over. She asked me to get these mats to put up on the windows to keep cool (like small window shield things). I wanted to watch the lamest films first for our mafia watching. We watched Vuk and left it because Benjamin liked it. I played a game called Fockle which was a word game based on a TV show.
