And just last night I had a dream that Mom was filling up the gas tank of our red and white '55 red Chevy, and the ringer was down and she leaned in and said, "Go on home. I'll meet you at home." So the ignition started up by itself and I floored the accelerator and I started going 60 and 70 miles an hour on a regular city street, and before I knew it, I was going 90 or 100 and I suddenly screeched on the brake and I spun around and spun around and spun around, and I'm like, "Oh no, am I crashing?" And I woke up.
