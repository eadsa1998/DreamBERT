I dreamt that I was congratulating a 28-year-old priest who plays soccer for having made a goal. The frame of the dream was narrow, and I was not able to concretize it. Anguish. Later I found myself in an old house with a referee who was keeping tabs on the congratulations and said there were 17 more minutes to go. He was demanding that the game continue, while a boy was standing next to him. Afterwards we went out to celebrate the victory, but we found ourselves on the lawn of the house. Green areas. That is all.
