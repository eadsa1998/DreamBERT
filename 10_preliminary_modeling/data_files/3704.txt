I am attempting to write or do a major work on a screen, a TV screen. Maybe I'm writing a script. It's a big one, and important. Now two other screens are on, TV screens, and they are interfering with my work. The script is disintegrating into greeking letters, nonsense symbols. I try to save the script or program before it all disappears into nonreadable form.
