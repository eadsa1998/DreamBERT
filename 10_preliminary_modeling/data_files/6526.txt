The three of us -- Brad, Laura and myself -- go to a local bar. Instead of it being a grungy bar, it is a very nice multicolored restaurant. We sit down to table on a second floor with three young women. One of them works at a nearby cafe, Stella's; the other two I've never seen before. We all order food. Schoenberg's Op. 11 is playing as background music!
