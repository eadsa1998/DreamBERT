 I'm in a party like atmosphere. My professor Dhar Thack is there. I have a bat a baseball, and I hit the ball in enclosed space. Dhar is concerned I'll hit him or someone with the ball or bat and cause damage. I say or indicate that I don't think I will. I feel out of place at this party: my mood is not congruent with the moods of others. My friend Gretchen Warwich may be there. I leave. I go into a huge black church-like building and turn on a heater and some lights that pertain to a small area of bunks where I'm now staying. I hear someone approaching and may know it's my friend Nat Miller. I turn off the heater and lights to play a joke on Nat by startling him. He arrives, and is not surprised by me being there. I comment on our accommodations, which are pretty nice.
