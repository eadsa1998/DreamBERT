I am walking over a log road. Just as I hear its end, I see water between the logs and realize I'm over a deep pit. Jo is at my right and calls to know how near the pit he is. The logs are gone and the pit is about one foot behind him. Suddenly he slips backward into it. I scream for help. There are people across the pit from him.
