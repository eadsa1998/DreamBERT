I was doing this massive real life RPG thing. We pretended we were on a ship and we were all given roles. We were the bad guys. Ezra and Roland were on there. They shot a heap of people and were laughing, but I didn't see them again for the rest of the game. I liked this guy, who was given a role like Jack Dawson in Titanic and he had to put a necklace on me, which I let him do so we could make out, although it was a small kiss and then he left. I took it off the first chance I got. It was heavy and small and made it hard to breathe. There were two Nicole Richie's -- one was anorexic and the other was healthy. Both of them had a lot of makeup on, although they had slightly different eye makeup. Her boyfriend came out with the other one and she was angry and I said "you look exactly the same!". Three guys were playing bums and they put on an accent and said 'mate' a lot. Then someone was looking for some people who turned out to be Ezra and Roland. They were in a room (it was at a house that was a bit like the old house, at the end of the hallway just next to my room). I went to my room and my bed was close to the door and I couldn't open the door, so I sat at the door.
