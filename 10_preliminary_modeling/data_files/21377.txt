I saw 3 in the 7th race and 3 in the 3rd. I was with Peter Arenclas. He was shooting birds. I saw a flasher and I said, "Here come the cops." He handed the rifle to me and I pointed the rifle at a bird and shot, but missed. We went into a cornfield to hide. We met the farmer and he chatted with us. Then the cops came and they were not after us, but were inquiring if Pete's baseball team wanted to play a certain team because they wanted to show Pete's team they could beat them. A lady was looking for a certain man and later chose another, saying, "It is he who I want." A young fellow said he was fired from the track for picking long shots, $180 one's. He said a good horse 125 lbs wt. and a long race can win it. It was a count horse. He was showing me in a race that he could win.
