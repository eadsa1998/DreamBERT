The only part of the dream which I can remember clearly is where my boyfriend TG and my uncle HT and myself were caught in a flood. I recall the water kept rising higher and higher about us. Finally, we were able to reach a higher piece of land and sought shelter there, but still the water swirled about us. At last the water subsided and we remained in our fixed position, waiting for help to arrive. I recall that there was a great deal of yelling and arguing, because my uncle was very hungry. However, we had no food so there was nothing for him to do but wait. When the rescue party finally reached us, my uncle began arguing with them and wanted to know why they had waited so long to rescue him. The rescue party threatened to leave him if he didn't behave so he kept quiet.
