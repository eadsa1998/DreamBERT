Am looking at part of a yacht and it is either in an actual harbor or in a picture. But mostly see its very long and very thick bowsprit, with nets and lines and sails hanging down. Also people, sailors, moving along the lines and adjusting sails. In crowd on bow of ship, see a bunch of sailors in white and amongst them is Mr. W., head of my company, in a dark business suit.
