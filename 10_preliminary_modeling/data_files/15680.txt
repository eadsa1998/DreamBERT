I was somewhere where there was lots of water with various things to climb on. I got quite far and there was a congested tunnel. I waited for people to push through so I could go through myself. I heard people screaming and someone said there was a shark. We all hurriedly swam back and tried to climb on something. The first thing I found was too low down so kept going. The next thing I found was wobbly. I finally climbed on something and someone else was a bit lower. We saw a shark fin come and went towards the the person on the lower bit. The thing we were on lost balance and wobbled. It got distracted and I managed to find another bit to climb on. Then later I was in the car with Mom and I was telling her about it being a dream and it was a crocodile and she said 'and then it [did something] and something to do with Amelia' and I said 'yeah, how did you know' and she refused to answer but then finally said I talked in my sleep. People were making short films and I went to this place to watch one. We got into a 'cage' and then it was swinging and chucked us to the other side of the room (it was a ride). Ezra was there too and I laughed because he'd probably be freaking out. When it was done we left and I realized I'd forgotten my jacket which had my wallet and keys in it. I went back and had to run into the employee area to get back to it. They didn't mind. I bought a chocolate and it was Â£6. Later I was at a park. It was pretty and there was a huge water area which was green-ish. It was only like 1cm deep though. I was eating lunch. Sailing on the Seven Seas was playing on a radio and Mom and Darren said it was lame.
