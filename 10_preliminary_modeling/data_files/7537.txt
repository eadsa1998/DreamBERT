I see Mary, but not clearly. I believe she is angry at me for having had a brief sexual encounter with another woman. But that was many, many years ago (over 20 years ago) and I thought we had gotten over that long ago and there had never been another lapse on my part since then. I'm not sure what we talked about (in the dream) but Mary's mood changed from anger at me to that of being very solicitous toward me for some problem I am facing. (I have no idea what that problem is.)
