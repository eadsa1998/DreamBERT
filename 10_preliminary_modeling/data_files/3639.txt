I and a man are together in a hot air balloon. We are traveling over a mountain. We are very close, but trouble starts. The balloon rope starts to fall or disintegrate. I try to hold on to it. We drift over to the west toward the ocean and barely make it, now landing safely on the beach. How very nice - we can camp here. We land. I see a restroom right in front of the spot we decide to rest at. How convenient, but will it block our view of the beautiful ocean? I look over around to the right sand we can see the ocean, calm but also coming right up to our edge of the camp. I think to myself, "Sure hope this is already high tide or that the calm conditions keep up or we'll not be safe here." We decide to stay.
