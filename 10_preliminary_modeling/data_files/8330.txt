I was working at the CAS office. Bill C had just hired six or eight women to do clerical and secretarial work. I was concerned about the inherent dangers of growing a company too fast - hiring so many people at once. It seems that there was one woman in charge of all the others but I don't know who it was. They were all eating lunch, at their desks. there was a TV in the lobby and a silver cart with two shelves on wheels. I suggested they put the TV on the cart and move it into the break room so they could have lunch there and watch TV while they eat. I was hoping this would encourage all of them to eat in the break room rather than at their desks. I realized that they may have taken their cue to eat at their desk from me since I always have lunch at my desk. For several reasons I did not feel it was appropriate for them to eat their lunch at their desks - they don't work while they eat, they are hourly workers, we enforce breaks with them, etc. Later I was watering the plants, which I don't do in waking life, and saw that Bill C had put small water fountains in the middle of two of the plants in the lobby. I thought this was very odd and didn't particularly care for it but decided not to say anything as it wasn't that big of a deal. Since none of the water was spilling over into the plants I went ahead and watered them.
