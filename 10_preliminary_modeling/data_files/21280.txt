I was in the shop at night because it was dark. The lights went out. I put on the switch. I was driving my car at night. I imagined I would run off the road or something. I backed up and then drove on the edge or seemed to go thru the air on the edge of a concrete peer. I was looking into an old shanty we had on the lot. I was sort of skipping along the street because I wasn't using my legs and I moved along the street.
