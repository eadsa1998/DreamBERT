Some others and I were in a hotel. We were then outside and this gas started coming and was going to be everywhere, so we left. One of the people I was with said it smelled like "toxic gas". We were driving really fast and weaving through traffic. We were outside this hospital. I was with lots of others my age. The ambulances were taking off really fast and I couldn't cross the road. Farrah and Ariana were there. Ariana was trying to climb up the back of the hospital, and I was holding this thing steady for her. Valerie was also there. This other lady was around. I had pants on and was hot, so I went into this little room which was away from the hospital to change. There were lots of towels in a cupboard in there. I couldn't get them around me and so the lady made me 'smaller'. It felt weird as I was getting smaller. I could now wrap the towel around and wrapped around like a skirt. Ezra made fun of it. We ended up getting into the hospital but it was just a large room with kids in it and most of them were dead.
