I'm in a small rather modern apartment which looked to me like an office, very much like some I saw in Coconut Grove when we were out hunting for apartments. I was talking to someone, but I'm not sure who. It's a person about 30. A friend of mine is with me, a student, not my age, rather a boy. The situation is neither pleasant or unpleasant. I don't know, a meteor race or something. I can't tell what.
