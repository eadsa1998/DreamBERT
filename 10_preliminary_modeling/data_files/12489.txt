I was on a bus. I was waiting for Calvin. There was an adult shop nearby. He had a puzzle book from there and had to take it back. Alejandro sat near me and I was trying to keep the seat next to me free because Calvin was taking forever. A girl sat in his seat, so I moved somewhere else. Finally he got on.
