I went in the auditorium. It was dark. Very dark. In the lecture final ???. The teacher was talking about social issues and their influence on composition. She showed slides of Mozart and Beethoven and when they turned the lights on Mozart and Beethoven were in the crowded auditorium and they were not paying attention. They were making faces and rolling their eyes and sleeping when they felt like it; and the class was trying to hear an intelligent conversation about them, ignoring their presence. 2 sisters were very old with gray hair. One was 96. She was older. She was the college professor. The other one was standing in the dark, trying to see any empty seats. She (me) was not paying attention either. The adult Sunday School class was having a discussion about "stacking attendance records," so (that) it would seem like twice as many people went to Sunday School. ???. I did NOT want to go to Sunday School.
