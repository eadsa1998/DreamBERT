The only thing I can report about my dream is that my occupation was killing white rats. These were the size of a dog, white and with funny ears. They followed me everywhere. The surrounding was a country house in whose corridors the white rats appeared. I killed them by kicking them, smashing them, crashing them, etc. When I was about to kill the last one, I was awoken.
