I was driving and there seemed to be someone near us running. I was afraid it would be a holdup so I speeded up. I was really going thru a mist like and they were hanging on. Then finally I didn't hear them after me. We were sitting on the back porch. A man walked by and I had a feeling he was up to something as he went by the corner of the house, so I looked off the porch around the house and sure enough, he was standing there planning on something. I had a scoop of ice cream. I threw it around the corner at him. Then I told everybody to go into the house. Fisher, I and J. Tesar were entombed in a cave or e were looking for an opening from the outside to save John Tesar inside. It is kind of jumbled up. We finally were free or he was free, but he was dead, John T. His body was dissected. His head was off and art of his legs were left. We were going to have a snapshot of this. Fisher and I were to be in the picture. Ann and I were shopping.
