I live next door to Father Andrew's house. See Maggie; she is trimming bushes and puts newspapers on the ground. Mr. Miller (church) and other old men come in to our house. They talk to the children and kiss our bird and other animal (a puppy?). Reynaldo asks, "Why does he kiss the bird?" I explain how wonderful all life is and that we should always be so thankful we should kiss all creatures.
