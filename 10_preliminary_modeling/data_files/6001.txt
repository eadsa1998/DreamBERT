There is a knock at the front door of my house and I answer to find a slightly overweight middle-aged woman. She says, "Take me", and gives me a warm hug and a big kiss. I send her away, thinking to myself, "This is tempting but I don't know her." The screen door comes off its hinges as the woman leaves, and I try to put it back in place. Just then I hear some noises coming from the far side of my front lawn. I go out to investigate and find a group of maybe half a dozen people depositing bagged trash on the grass. I yell angrily at them and they disperse. However, I see that behind where the trash bags were placed is an encampment of several tents and shacks, all covered with twigs and sticks. "Look what they've done!", I complain to a friend who has just appeared. The friend and I run towards the encampment and grab at the sticks when we reach the first row of tents. Knocking the sticks aside, we are surprised to learn that the tents are all empty inside. "They must have left", I deduce.
