Someone's dog had killed a sheep. The people who owned the sheep decided to kill the dog. Mom and I drove them to the place (they were friends of ours or something) and we stayed behind. We had a poodle dog and called it to make it follow us. We went back to the car and drove to the people's house just around the corner. There was a black lady and we told her they were killing their dog. We brought back the dead dog and sheep and put them together. I was sad. Then someone peed on their lawn, which was covered in snow and it all turned yellow.
