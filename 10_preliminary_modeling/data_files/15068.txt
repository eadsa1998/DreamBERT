Mom and Darren got the old house. They wanted to pretty it up and then sell it. I was confused because they had rented it. Then they were actually fixing up some random house and we were staying at the old house while they did that. I was annoyed and said I wanted to go home. A friend of Mom's and her daughter (my age and black) were staying there. Gizmo was in my bed. We shared a bunk. I couldn't sleep. I got up and it was early morning. I asked Mom for the keys to the old house and Darren tried giving me coins. The pickup was out the front. Ezra was with me. My 'car' was this cylindrical container thing on like a trolley. I got in and Ezra pushed it. We were then at a shop and this psychic lady kept giving me readings. This girl walked towards me and realized I was at the booth and I went to the floor and said 'I'm bored. I sleep now'. She said she wanted to play Scrabble and I said 'ok, Scrabble, Monopoly...' and then said Monopoly was too long. As I was trying to get back, there was a little cooking place. This girl couldn't touch anything because it was hot and she kept almost falling over. I accidentally turned a tap off while the girl was trying to wash her hands and she got angry. I was playing a Mario game. You could morph and it was different. Luigi snuck up behind Mario and he screamed and ran and said "Mario!".
