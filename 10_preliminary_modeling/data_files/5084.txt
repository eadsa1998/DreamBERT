I'm in my bedroom and I hear something coming for the door. I go to look. It's like a giant white furry elephant with a short trunk. I try to keep it out of my room. I am afraid of it. I call out "Mother" to see if she'd come help. I poke it with a stick and rush to close the door and hold the door shut. [BL]
