I was at school. It was year 12 and the class numbers were weird and I didn't know where to go for physics. I saw Elijah and I was going to follow him but then remembered he didn't do physics anymore. I eventually found the class and sat down near the front. When Darius and company came they sat in front of me. Eugene came and he looked weird and his eyebrows were thick. Autumn sat next to me. There was a thing which had these profiles of ours on it. I was looking at Eugene's and reading his list of favourite movies, all of which I hadn't heard of.
