I can't remember any recent dreams but about once a month I get a dream where I feel like I'm falling. I don't know where I'm falling from, but it wakes me with a jolt. I've compared this dream with some of my friends and they say that they've had it too. It's kind of scary, but I always wake up when I feel like I'm in mid-air.
