There was going to be an opening to the next stage. I went to the roof, but everything turned cold. The robot froze. My companions, they gave in to the cold. The snowstorm was so ferocious, I gave my blue jacket to a companion, but he froze. I took it from him and put it on. He was gone. I figured with my fleece and that jacket, I'd be fine. The old woman walked out, then froze. I felt bad, but she went without complaint. Then, I walked to a portal and faced the final boss in a Halo (video game) multiplayer map-like arena. It was gray and had cube-like spires. I beat it and got my ranking. But it was real life. I was near the top, but not the best. I was yellow, the best was orange on the scale. Very aggressive amateur. About 1192 out of 1800. I was angry that I should have gotten a higher score. Only one or two was better than mine.
