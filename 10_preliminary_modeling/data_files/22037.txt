I was surfing at a beach which I have never seen, but it was a combination of Herradura (judging by the people) and Barranquito or Waikiki (judging from the sea). I was fishing from a boat and my leg muscle got caught in the fish hook. It hurt me a lot, but I was able to take it off. I came out on the beach, a bit far from where my family was sitting by an umbrella. A boy accompanied me since I got out of the sea, asking me about surf boards. When we were near the umbrella, I saw my board, which I had left where I came out, and went over to pick it up.
