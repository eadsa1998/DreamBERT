I went to Big W with Mom, which was at Midvale. It was Sunday and it was totally empty. There was one person working at the counter, who was an Asian lady. Mom walked off, but I went in. They had only red pens? The lady asked me to read these letter numbers. There were three; red, green and another colour and the numbers were 13, 14, 15. I was going to ask if they were hiring, but then couldn't be bothered. Then Rover was with us and ended up lying in chip packets. We left and I saw Evelyn and gave her a short wave. She worked at the Big W and she couldn't get promoted because she was already at the highest level. Mom said a group of girls were whispering. They asked me a question and I said that I couldn't hear them and they were like 'why is that girl talking to her?'.
