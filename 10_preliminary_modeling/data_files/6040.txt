I dreamt that I was in this room with no windows or doors and it was completely black. But, as I was moving around I kept bumping into people. (There were many in the room; I just couldn't see them.) I was also carrying a pile of books and then they dropped everywhere. I tried to pick them up but people kept stepping on me and kicking the books everywhere. When I woke up my heart was beating really fast and I swear the clock was ticking faster. (This was a really scary dream. I think it was the anxiety I was feeling because of final week sneaking up quickly.)
