There were zombies. Dad, Ezra and I were at Nana's. Aunt Sally and her kids, Poppa, Nana and other random people were also there. For the first week or so after getting settled there we went to a school. We soon stopped going. Some Spanish kids were with us and they were growing vegetables and had zombies wandering around where the vegetables were growing. There were two kittens and two babies. I had something and someone complained about it because I didn't need it. I was wondering where Eugene was and I was annoyed that there weren't many people my age here.
