I saw a book on the table of our living room that I hadn't seen there the day before. So I decided to read it, merely out of curiosity. The first page I was able to read, but soon the words became indistinct and try as I might, I couldn't make out what they said. Suddenly I was conscious of a change. I was still in our living room, but now I was playing a harp. It was a beautiful harp and I enjoyed playing it.
