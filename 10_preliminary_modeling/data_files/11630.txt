I was in a barracks listening to a radio. It seemed that it was time to leave then almost immediately I was outside walking away from the barracks. I could still hear the radio and it seemed that there were other men around. They were complaining about being awakened by the radio too early. A short distance farther on there was a fellow on the sidewalk with a microphone. He was putting it away or getting it out but I don't know which and he didn't seem to either.
