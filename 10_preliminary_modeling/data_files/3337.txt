I'm in the old west and there is an gang, all men and one woman, two old men leaders. They'd worked together for a long time. Now there is some discussion about change. Should we keep everything the same or change things, a remark about whether this man would play with the dog on the right side, where it always had been, or whether he'll be in the fire, if it is moved to the other side, or if we'll be in the 60's (which is new times). Now they have some respect for each other. They sit around and one man says to the woman, "You've changed. You're better at your job now." They take turns complementing each other. There had been friction when they all started. The old guy, like Harry Morgan of Mash, starts to feel sad and he goes off to visit the graves of the two leaders who were killed in the recent fight they were in. He's going to commit suicide and join them. He's on his horse and on the edge of a raging, swollen creek. The horse jumps in and then he jumps in. Now the gang is searching for him. I see the woman with a blind white cane feeling the bank. She's hip deep in the water, carefully searching. The narration feels that she is blind but methodical and will not miss finding the body if it's there. Behind her I see a wooden log in the shape of a crocodile coming up behind her.
