[1997-05-23] My boss was in my dream and he was saying that the first time he got married it wasn't done right and he didn't want people to have the wrong idea, in case, in the future so he was going to have a religious ceremony this time and make it better. He was talking to someone else in the room, I didn't get into it I was more of a spectator hearing him talk. We were in this brightly lit room. It was either a hotel or a conference place but we were in this really big room. It might have been the same part of the dream as the typewriter part. I think it was the same dream where we were typing.
