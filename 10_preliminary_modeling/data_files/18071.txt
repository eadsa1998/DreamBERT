I was at the beach and we were letting things go into the wild and there were big tidal waves there. Well the tidal waves came over to the sand and took us into the beach, but we swam back. We were at a store and there was a little doggy there. I asked my mom if I could have it and it was only $1.00. My mom said okay and she said I could have a kitten next week so I took the dog home.
