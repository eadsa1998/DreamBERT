[1997-05-26] [I am a recovering alcoholic who still attends meetings occasionally] I dreamt that I was at a meeting with my sponsor, we generally go on Saturday mornings together. He had spoken during the meeting, it was a discussion meeting, and then 5 minutes before the meeting ended, he repeated, "My name is B and I'm an alcoholic" but then he got all emotional and choked up and couldn't finish what he had wanted to say. He was quite upset and distraught, and I could hear him almost beginning to break down.
