I'm in a grocery store, towards the back, and I'm looking at things on shelves that make a corner, where I can't be readily seen. Nobody passes by much. As I'm standing I shit. I feel it, and the natural urge to void, then I realize what I'm doing. I'm startled and horrified and turn with my back to the shelves and try to shake it off. Won't go. A person or 2 walks by and doesn't notice, and I finally realize I'm wearing a skirt and underpants. (I'd thought I had nothing on from the waist down at least.) This means it's not just one long turd hanging off, though, it's mashed in my pants. Yuck. But at least I can go to the bathroom. When I get there, there's a line. Theo is in it. I'm not very happy about having to wait.
