I go into the half bath in our house.  Instead of a small room, it is a large room, about the size of the master bathroom, but with no plumbing fixtures at all, only a large square pit in the middle, about 15 feet deep.  The floor of the bathroom is rough and uneven concrete, the walls of the pit are painted, with the paint flaking off, and at the bottom of the pit is a lot of junk, including old clothing.  I am shocked at the conditions, particularly since we are thinking of buying the house.  At the top of at least one wall is a window, or at least an opening to the outside-it has no window on it.  It is covered inside by wire mesh which extends the length of the wall.  This wire mesh is not attached well to the wall, and the window is at ground level (the room itself being mostly below ground level), so that anyone could easily enter from the outside.  I know my wife Anita could not tolerate this condition, and it even worries me, but I don't know what I can do immediately to fix it.  It seems like the owner has added this room on to the house and never finished it.  I wonder how much it would cost us to get it fixed.  Someone, I don't remember who, says that it wouldn't meet code requirements, which is pretty obvious.
