I am in a house. Apparently I rent several rooms to foreign ambassadors. I am very negligent in keeping things clean. I also hardly ever interact with the ambassadors. I regret that now, wishing I'd made more of an effort to get to know them. I must seem very distant and unfriendly to them. I have trouble sorting out piles of paper and parts that have something to do with computers. I try and clean up a machine I hurriedly place a fresh aerosol can of something on a shelf in the new ambassadors room. It is behind something, so it isn't easy for them to notice and find. I wish I'd done that better.
