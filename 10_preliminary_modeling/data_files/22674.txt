In this dream I saw myself taking an exam at the university. We were taking the most difficult exam, which was in Accounting. I was sitting, taking the test, and saw that it was difficult and started to solve the questions, and I saw the desperate faces of my classmates. When the test was over I was not satisfied, and my classmates were even less satisfied. The next day they told us the results of the test and they said only one had passed and the rest had failed. I felt discouraged and the professor came over and told me that he wanted to speak to my parents. I had told my father, but I didn't think I would do so badly as to require a talk with my parents. My father went to the university, and I stayed home crying, and when he came back, he told me that I was the only one who had passed and that he was called to be congratulated because I had gotten 100 and it was the first time that the teacher gave that grade to a student and he promised my father that he would put up my photograph in his house. The dream ended here.
