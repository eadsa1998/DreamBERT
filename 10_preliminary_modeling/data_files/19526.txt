Next scene was south of club house about 300 yards, I was walking near the tree (or trees) standing between 2 of the courses. I recalled once having seen 2 golf balls, played toward the same green, colliding in midair at a height of about 15 feet, raising a small cloud of dust. Grass was burned and slippery. I marveled at what a great difference in apparent distance was brought about by a few yards; that is, as I looked toward the green the distance seemed to call fro a spoon, but if I walked 4 or 5 yards closer to the green the distance seemed to shrivel greatly so that a mashie would be sufficiently long.
