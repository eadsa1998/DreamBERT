Some of us had 'powers'. We came to this place to practice them. Raquel had good balance and something else. Dad was there. There was a tunnel in the wall and someone chased me. He said to go home and don't stop. I went out some hole and ran away and he was confused about it. Then we were in groups, but I think the other group was bad. We had these cards to put up in the middle of the room and they all did different things. We had to make them stand up for them to work though. One guy on the other side had these big hoops that he threw and they would go around people. We built the wall to completely separate us but the guy still got me.
