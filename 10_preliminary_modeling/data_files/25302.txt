 I'm at Super America buying sweet corn from a kid who has a produce stand there. The corn is husked and cooked, and you pick out the ears you want to buy from a big pot. The kid is my age. I say I don't want to pick through them all because I know what it's like to be selling to picky customers, but I do want good corn. My mom and my sister Ramona come over too. We are having steak and corn for dinner. My brother Wally is also there, it may be his birthday. He is having four steaks. I try to calculate how much corn we will need. My mom says she'll eat two ears and Ramona says she'll eat four. There are eight ears in the pot so I decide to buy all of them. Then the kid selling the produce drives away.
