["War and airplane crashes."] I am in a war. I and a man have captured enemy soldiers. We are seated maybe in a building out in the field. I have a hand gun trained on one of the enemy and the man has a hand gun on the other. It is a long night and we begin to feel sleepy. I am nearly asleep and the enemy slowly moves his hand and rests it near my gun hand. I roust up and say We've got you covered. It's a close call. Later I am outside and looking up in the sky. We are in the hills near LA. Airport. A huge plane covers over the hill and I see the huge underbelly of the plane as it is landing. Another comes over and as I watch it try to land it suddenly jerks around and I know it is going to crash. I watch as it does crash breaking apart and into flames.
