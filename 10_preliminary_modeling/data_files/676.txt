I am visiting one neighbor and remember I am supposed to visit my other neighbors, Pat and Steve, that night. (Pat and Steve are actually deceased). They invited me long ago. I go to their house and ask, was I supposed to come here tonight? Steve says no and it is obvious he forgot. He and Pat are in very bad physical shape, and look like the people on the movie "The Night of the Living Dead." He is trying to feed her and his head is transparent. There is also a third person there in the same bad shape. I tell him I'm going to call the nursing home and he says no, they will be okay. I go to the refrigerator to get something for them and find part of a bottle of white grape juice and I am going to warm it. Then he comes out and still looks bad but is apparently healthy and goes into another room where he has guests and a party is going on.
