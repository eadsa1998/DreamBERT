I walked into the backyard of our apartment one day and found that our apartment had sunk into the ground several feet. Hard as I tried, I couldn't jump up over the incline. Finally, the boy from next door came out of the house and got into his bright blue convertible coupe. I called to him; and when he saw my plight, he called to me to hang on to the bumper while he pulled me out. He started the car but somehow I couldn't get over the barrier even with this help.
