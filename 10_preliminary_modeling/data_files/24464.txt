I am with a group of people in danger. Sitting, a light skinned black woman is speaking. She repeats over and over, "If I ever go to such-and-such place (unable to recall name or rest of sentence). She is unaware that she is dying. I take her in my arms to divert her attention. I imagine a man from behind will execute her. At the last moment I will say, "Never mind, shoot us both." Recollection ends here.
