Mother is in the hospital. She looks different than in waking life. I think several of us children were there but decided that only one of us needed to be there at a time. I was going to stay first. Whoever was the last to leave said if I needed anything that I should call Bev first since she lives the closest. There was also something about getting a wheelchair and taking her outside and something about some other patients.
