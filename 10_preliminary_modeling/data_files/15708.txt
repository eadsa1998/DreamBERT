I was out with Benjamin at like a cinema, or a place where there was one cinema. He had found some film club which was like Â£100 a movie that he wanted to go to. One was on today -- it was Les Miserables. I was annoyed because I didn't want him doing it. We were in a building but just outside the cinema thing, eating at a table. He got up and was gone for ages and I went into the cinema to find him. I couldn't, so I went back out and he came back like what's up. I felt silly. We went to some cafeteria type place which had lots of tourists. They kept moving the tables and chairs around. I sat down and Benjamin was still standing and two girls started talking to him. One sat next to me and started talking. He asked where she was from and how long she'd been here. She said '2 weeks and for 6 weeks altogether'. I said I'd been here 6 months and she asked if I had a passport and I said yes and she was like 'oh you're lucky'. Eventually, Benjamin and I sat together somewhere. He signed his name with his right hand and I was like 'why are you using your right hand'. He looked at me incredulously and said he signed his name with his right hand, but it looked like he was embarrassed about being left handed? We were talking and joking etc. At some point we kissed but nothing seemed weird and we were walking around flirting and messing about. It was nice and I was happy.
