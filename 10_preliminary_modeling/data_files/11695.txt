Me, Ezra, Farrah, Pippin (Lord of the Rings) and Dad were standing in the street somewhere. I was friends with Pippin. I was talking to some friends. I turned around, and Pippin was walking off, he turned around and looked me in the eye and I got shy. We ended up in Ezra's stomach and other stupid things.
