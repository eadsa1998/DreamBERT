I was in a building, like a house, but I'm not sure what it was. There was a room with 'Murlocs', but they weren't really. They were found underwater, but I thought they were aliens. I closed the door and left. Later, I walked past an open door and there was a folder on the ground keeping it open. I pushed it away and let it close. I went back to another room and told Ezra. Dean Pelton (Community) and two guys were in the air vent dealing drugs -- it was some alien drug. Someone did this thing to make all guys there extremely horny and they were raping people. This hot guy that I was friends with was in a room with me when it happened. He kissed me violently and pushed me to the ground. I tried to get him off, but I couldn't. Whatever the thing was was turned off a few seconds later. Later, I was walking with him and another guy and he said that he didn't remember anything. I had taken my pants off and was giving them to someone in a trade. Then I was watching Red Dwarf, but it wasn't. Mom had been in a few episodes as a girl from the past who travelled forwards in time. There was a character who everyone thought was going to be a love interest, and it was Dad, but it was 400 years in the future. We had some banana cake but it was black. I felt sick. I was playing World of Warcraft at some point and was doing Auchindoun with others. We hung our bags up and I went to kill the main boss.
