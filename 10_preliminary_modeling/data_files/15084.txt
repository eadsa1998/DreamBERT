Mom and Darren were in the lounge room watching a weird movie. I asked what it was and they said it was Love Story. I said "oh yeah, I was going to watch it this month and watched Barry Lyndon instead". Ryan O'Neal looked different. I watched a bit and it looked interesting so I decided to watch it. A voice sounded familiar (with an Irish accent) and it was Nathan Fillion. I was like 'He's so young!'. It was set in like, the stone ages? Then I was there and there was a guy with a puma. We jumped into this house and it came in. It attacked me and we got it out. It hurt its paw and it was bleeding. I cried and then the dude and I tried to fix it. At the end of the movie, the girl he loved got offered a job far away and took it. They said goodbye. Ezra had to walk 4 hours to somewhere. He wanted to go to the shop later.
