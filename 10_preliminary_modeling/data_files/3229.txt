I am trying to fill out the forms for Social Security. Andrea has written out the right words for me in a succinct paragraph. I see the form has four parts with a question and a long blank space to answer in. I lay out the four pages so I can see them all in a row so I can make sense of them better. I partially copy her sentences and rewrite it with my own ideas. and words.
