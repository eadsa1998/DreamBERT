We are told to line up around the room and start on the bottom shelf of books. It's a book sale and we are all grabbing the books we want to buy. Someone on my left grabs a book in my section, I say, "I already have it, it's OK," and move on. Now I see a display of glass pretties. Someone exchanges the little glass pitcher or creamer with another one that matches the bowl already there. It's like my mother's cranberry sauce bowl, glass rounded ribs. I say, "Very nice, but probably more expensive and too big to be in scale." I go on. I remember to look for a video camera case to fit my video camera and ask a man. He is condescending and looks for an ordinary case. I am annoyed. Can't he see? I say, "If you would just look at MY camera, you would see it is a more complex and advanced camera." I am annoyed he doesn't realize I'm quite good at this and not just average or a beginner. [BL]
