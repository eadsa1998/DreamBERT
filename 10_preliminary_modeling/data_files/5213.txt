I dreamed that it was the end of the year and all the seniors were about to graduate. Sue and I were preparing for our exams. It was the night before graduating; so all the seniors were playing games while all the underclassmen were studying. I remember looking into a room and seeing Nick and another girl, which made me jealous. I forget what Nick said, but I left, furious. Sue and I didn't have the proper materials to study for the chemistry exam. We snuck into the science building to get the stuff. When we got there, there was some sort of leak or something, because the whole building was flooded and smelled awful. Sue and I grabbed buckets to carry everything. We swam through the hallways trying to find a light switch. We couldn't, so we returned to the main building. All the seniors were getting ready to leave, and I was so sad and flustered because I didn't think I would see any of them again. Then I saw Anthony and he hugged me and kissed me goodbye. Then I must have woken up and started another dream about The Da Vinci Code. I remember the albino monk, Silas, was trying to kill someone else, and I was trying to stop him. The man Silas was trying to kill came to me for help. He wanted me to disguise him. So I cut him a pair of jeans. I guess I thought that would disguise him. I kept waking up in the middle of the night though.
