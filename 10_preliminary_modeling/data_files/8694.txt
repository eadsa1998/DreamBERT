I had saved myself two seats on a bus. Each side of the bus had three seats like you would see on an airline except no armrests. The seats were all black. I had saved a center and an aisle seat on the right side of the bus about 2 or 3 rows from the front. I put a yellow piece of paper with my name in large letters in the aisle seat. When I came back someone had moved the sign back two rows and sat where my sign was. Someone I was with was going to say something to him but I told him it wasn't that important. I went back and took the other seat. After we left I noticed that the entire row across from where I had originally wanted to sit was empty so I moved up there and laid down on my back across the row, with my knees up. The bus driver said something to me related to being okay with not getting my original seat. I told him this worked out much better.
