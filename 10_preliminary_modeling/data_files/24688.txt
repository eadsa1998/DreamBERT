There was a store right by my bathroom window. They had really good books that were on sale for 50 cents. I got a tape of Home Alone #1, and a book. Then I saw a great poem book by Jack Peretsky. I wanted it, and I got it. Setting: My back porch. Characters: Storekeepers (don't know), and my mom (I know). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I felt happy because I was getting so many books for so cheap.
