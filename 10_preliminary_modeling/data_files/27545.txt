I dreamt that I was seated at a desk. Behind me was another desk. On the desk in front of me there was a very disorderly pile of books. On the desk behind me there were rows of very neatly piled books. I was engaged in taking a book from the desk in front of me and putting it on the pile on the desk behind me. However, every time I took a book off the desk, another one would be dropped from the air on the desk. This went on until I awoke.
