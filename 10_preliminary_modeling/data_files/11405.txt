I dreamed I saw a house whose eaves were burning. I thought this was very strange that only the eaves were burning. As I stood there watching, an old man came up to me and said, "Don't worry, that house has been burning that way as long as I can remember." Then some women came running out of the house crying, "Call the fire department." Just then a fire truck rolled up and the firemen began to put out the fire. I don't remember them using any fire equipment other than the truck, but the fire was soon out and the house showed no signs of damage. The old man disappeared and the women who came out of the house invited me in and said it surely was a good thing I happened to be passing by.
