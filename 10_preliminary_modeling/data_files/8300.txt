Something to do with computer work and pulling up a lot of files that had some kind of supporting data for the name file. That's the best way that I can describe it. There were a lot of them. I don't know if it was me doing the work or someone else. Going through them one at a time. At the end it seemed to be meaningless. This was sketchy and hard to explain.
