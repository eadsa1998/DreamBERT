I am a member of a committee. I've been doing lots of extra time getting 4 different areas documented so we can make a report. A man then takes over and says he'll report on the ones I've already worked on and I can start work on some other areas. I am fed up, angry at him. I say, "Look. I've already worked on 4 of these. I have no interest in working on these others." He sighs and glares, and I start to feel guilty. But then my feeling is, "No, I've done more than my share and I'm not going to do other people's work." I say, "He and I can share our reports we did on the same area." He says, "No. It will be one or the other." He leaves. I try to get the committee members to agree on a time when we'll meet next. No one helps. They leave. I look around. There are tons of things left out that someone needs to put away or our work will be destroyed by uncaring vandals. I'm the only one left to do it. Now I'm really angry and I feel put upon. I start to pick things up, boxes and newspapers, and I see that the job is too much. I hesitate and waver between feelings of, "Well, I'll just leave it," to, "I can't just leave it." I decide it's too big for one person to do and so I leave it.
