I was bored so I went to this place I had been before with the school. It was closed to the public, but there were people inside. I went in and I asked this lady at a computer some questions and asked if she had this program where you put in a scenario and it tells you what would happen (how many people would die, what would be destroyed etc). She said she didn't know. Then I was doing a quest on Runescape. It was called Slug Menace, but was a different quest. There were lots of toys with stripey snakes and puppets and they moved away from me as I moved. The room was empty and quite dim. I had to get into this cage, but had to go the long way. To get through one part of it, I had to light certain things to get certain colours. There was black, green, red and blue. Dad was there at one point. The second time, a room was pitch black and I almost fell down a hole.
