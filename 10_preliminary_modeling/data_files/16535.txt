Samantha, Sandra and Derek were in town and we were doing a number of different things. But Terri was also there, and Terri knew how to play guitar, and in my dream Terri knew somebody else before she knew Don, and she was getting together with somebody else and falling in love with that person again. And she was at our house and she was kind of playing for us a little bit, and Samantha, Sandra and Derek were kind of partying around. And for some reason I was laying on the pallet in front of Dad's desk and I was like opening the drawer to Dad's desk, shuffling around until I found my tape machine and hitting "record" so that I could record what was going on. Well, instead of recording, it just played. It just played whatever was on the tape, and it was kind of a little on the wild side, and Samantha was sitting right there on the chair next to me and could see everything I was doing. And then we were walking in the park and I dreamt that I had a watch that could record what was going on too, and in order to get the sound ________ phone and that was really a bad deal! [laugh] But then at the end Sandra was saying to Dad how they were going to introduce me to one of their friends, but they weren't going to do it tonight, it was probably going to be too late. "I think we should do it tomorrow," is what she was saying. And I was all set and ready to do it that night, but I said, "We only have a few days; let's make the most of them." And then I woke up.
