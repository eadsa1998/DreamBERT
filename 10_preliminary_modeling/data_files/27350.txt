I was walking along a path which ran beside a broad, calm river. Then the path turned away fromthe river and ran through a thick forest. The forest began to grow thicker and darker. I was frightened, but something compelled me to walk on. Suddenly, I was out of the woods and standing at the edge of a large open space. In the middle of this clearing I saw a beautiful house. It was a large, white house with blue awnings at the windows, and three white pillars at the front. Hundreds of yellow roses were climbing around the pillars. It was a lovely scene, but it was very frightening. I wanted to go back, but something seemed to draw me toward the house. Then, as I came close to it, the whole house began to tremble and collapse. I turned and began to run toward the forest. Before I reached it, I awoke. Even after I awoke, it took a long time to get rid of the feeling of terror.
