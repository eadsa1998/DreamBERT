 I'm at a bar near the Hill Lodge in Oak Valley. Other people my age are there. There are older people inside the bar. Some of the younger adult men court a young woman there. There is a conflict between the younger and older people about noise violations. The older people think the younger people are loud, and the younger people think the older people are loud. A person who went to my high school, Karin Bellview, is there, or the head of a puppet that reminds me of her is there. The red headed-man I caught chickens with is there. He has a goatee. I think of driving home and how much I've had to drink: what my blood-alcohol level would be. I figure I have only had three beers: two in the first hour, so if the police stop me I won't get at DWI, but rather a DUI. I think of getting a DUI on my way home: would I pull over or try to outrun the police officer? I imagine duping the police. When I get home I see a loaf of bread in the driveway when I get out of the car. On the bread my mom has written $1.25. I go inside and my mom is finishing baking cookies. I was supposed to bake cookies, and I forgot.
