I was sitting on a small boat on the water. We were in a pool that was behind a break wall. I looked out along the shore and the wind was blowing offshore. The waves right offshore were about 3 ft. high and as they went out, I could see them going up about 20 ft. and higher. I said, "I never saw waves starting on shore so high." They usually are ripples first, but here the waves were offshore like they came off and Ann was supposed to be a beauty. I was a friend of hers. I whispered to her I wanted to see a certain part of her body and she would expose it to me. I wanted to see her busts and she put them thru a hole in a cloth she had and exposed them to me.
