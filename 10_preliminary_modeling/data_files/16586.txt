It was Christmas time back in Westport and we had our choo-choo train set up around the Christmas tree like we do. And on the way it really is, I honestly don't remember what color it is, but it just goes around the track and goes, "clackety-clack, ding ding ding ding." Well, this one in my dream, there were three cars just like the real one, but in my dream all three of them were red and all three of them had flashing lights on them. And the thing with this train is, just like the real one, in order to start it and stop it, you had to flip a switch on the side of the engine, and in order to stop it or something, you had to do it while it was moving, so it was an act of catching it. But there was this other little thingy on the engine that would have like 20 or 30 different patch sounds saved, just like on a keyboard in M___ or something, except these were patch sounds of combinations of train sounds like a train would make while it's going down the track. And there was a certain patch that would make it go, "Beep beep beep" as it was going forward, but when you'd make it go backwards, it would be the scary back-up alarm sound like, "Doo do, doo do," and I knew in this dream it did that a few times and I was a little scared, but I wasn't terrified. And in the caboose -- in the real one there's a little compartment where you can put candy and stuff, but in my dream we put three chocolate bunnies in there, like about 3" high, hollow ones, and we stuck them in there and they rode in there like passengers. And we were getting ready to go somewhere and I wanted to grab a chocolate bunny, and I reached down under the tree and I grabbed it, and somehow the thing turned on and started going backwards and making that sound. And then I woke up.
