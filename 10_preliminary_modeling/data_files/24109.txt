The setting was in a big grave yard, that had no tombstone. The bodies were just lying everywhere. The bodies were covered in blood. Some of them with their eyes open and pale as the palest thing I can imagine. The grass was very, very green. I remember riding around in a golf cart and having a tall ugly looking guy, kind of looking like Frankenstein. He was also carrying bodies and dropping them off anywhere except the gravel side walk where the golf cart was going. The people, actually dead people, they all looked very young, to me like in their early 20's. None of them were related to me. They were faces I had never seen before. I felt very uncomfortable being there in the graveyard.
