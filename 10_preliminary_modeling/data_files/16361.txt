This was the night that Astrid slept over. I had _____________ what am I talking about? And I dreamt that something was going on in my studio while Astrid was sleeping and Mom was in her work room doing something. And I was doing something in my studio, like the sound, and I guess I kind of got turned on. And I don't know how -- she didn't see me -- but I think Mom found out, and she was telling me, "It's too rough over there; why don't you do that in bed, because Astrid's blind and she won't be able to even see you." And [laugh] I'm glad I woke up. That was just so ridiculous! [laugh]
