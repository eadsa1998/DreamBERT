A woman wants me to give her a decorative scar. I can't find my usual cutting device, so I use a paper and give her a paper cut. It hurts her but it works. I'd made a half moon cut and I push it to see if it had cut through. I see it open up and I see the cords of the muscles (like when I fished with my father). Then the blood wells up. I say, "Good. It will bleed and clean the wound." She is pleased. I had tried to put it on her chest, but it was on the top of her left arm.
