I was in a hospital building. (I recall dreaming of the same building when it was snowing outside in the dream.) It was starting to rain. I went into a yard. Flowers grew on tall bushes. The months seemed to pass by very fast. A man and a little girl came. The man wanted the girl to take the place of God.
