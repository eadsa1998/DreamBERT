A bunch of high school children were involved in some kind of play or some such. They had set up in front of the office to make it look like they were killing some of the people on stage or like they had found them and were taking them prisoner. What the audience didn't know is that they really did it - it wasn't just an act. They took them to this place and laid them in boxes, for lack of a better word. It looked like a long row of window seats that you could open and put things in. They put these people in there and left them. A lot of them bound and gagged. Later, for another program, they intended to go get the people and kind of do a repeat performance. This time they wanted to let them go. They were trying to keep this a secret from people, that they had done this. At some point, I think it was during the second performance, I realized that Matthew was involved in this. I was extremely distraught. I was hiding in the back hoping not to get caught because I wasn't sure what they would do to me. I wanted to get I don't know why but I was trying to find out what they were doing. Maybe I was suspicious that this is what they had done and I was trying to verify it. I was trying to get back out without being seen. I guess I did and then I saw Darren. I told him about it. He was as upset about it as I was. As soon as we saw Matthew we ran him to the car and told him to lay down in the backseat so he wouldn't be seen. We were trying to get him out of this group without being seen so he wouldn't be hurt. For some reason I couldn't go to the car right away. I had to go back and get something and try to sneak back to the car again. Darren seemed very anxious and upset because it was taking me too long and he just wanted us to get out of there.
