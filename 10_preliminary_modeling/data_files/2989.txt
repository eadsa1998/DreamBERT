I am in a room and I am the "affianced" wife of Dr. Abrams. People think I am ordinary-looking and so do I, but I am supposed to be quite beautiful to be the "affianced" wife of Dr. Abrams. When I am announced, I am kind of surprised and think, "But I don't want it to be Dr. Abrams." Later I enter an elevator-like room and see what looks like a dead dog, small, cute and furry, but dead. "Ugh," I think, "I don't want to be in here with a dead dog." Then the elevator closes and I push the #3 button, but the elevator is very slow and goes to the basement first. The dog is now very much alive and is fiercely trying to eat my foot or bite my ankle. I must try to stave it off and pick up a "stick" or rectangular long, skinny piece of wood to force it back. It is a hard fight and it nearly gets me, over and over. The ride is slow and takes forever.
