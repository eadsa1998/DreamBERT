 I'm outside a hideout with my friend Kevin Simpson. We're on roller-skates picking up coins. People come out of the hideout. We roller skate quickly down my alley. I hide behind my neighbor Alvin Bround's bar. A fat gangster and a couple of fat women come down the alley. One of the fat women's names is Smalon. She is huge and fat! Another fat woman comes up by the car. I stand up and hit her with a good-sized log. She throws a log at me back, and I dodge it. My neighbor Greg Olson may be the gangster. He scurries along the fence line between Broud's property and the house next to it, fleeing. Smalon gets in the back seat of the car on the driver's side. I run. It is difficult for me to run, and I move slowly. I want to get out of sight. I may become the fat women named Smalon or Smahon. I am at the intersection of Hill Avenue and 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I roll the fat lady into the yard of the red house on the Northeast corner of the intersection. I want to get her to the corner of the yard to nobody will see her. I may cover her up with a tarp, trying not to make it obvious. The fat lady and the car roll down the hill in Alvin Broud's yard and across Hill Avenue. I think the car will smash into a wall on the other side of the street, but instead it rolls up a driveway. <br/
