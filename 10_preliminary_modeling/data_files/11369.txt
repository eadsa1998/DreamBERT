I approached a small unpainted shack by walking through a field. Inside the shack, which resembled a church in that it was arranged with pews, I saw 5 of my friends and immediately began a gun battle with them in which I was fighting against all five. I would fire at each one of them and always hit them but they would never fall. Then I jumped through a window and ran through a field toward an armored car. While running I noticed two dogs and a small child. I tossed some money to the child and he agreed to sic the dogs after the five pursuers who were shooting at me. I jumped into the car.
