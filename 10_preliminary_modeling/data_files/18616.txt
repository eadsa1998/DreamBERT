There was a 5-story house in Tribeca. Boxes of shoes (used) were on the floor and I found some shoes I really liked. There were a couple of very annoying chicks looking for shoes. When I was leaving I ran into Lisa on the ground floor. She was organizing things. She put a read polka-dotted dress on a coat hanger. It looked like a little girls dress. It was for a daughter who didn't exist yet. Lisa was organizing, organizing and I was feeling bad because nobody would spend time with me so ??? in LA. So I boxed up ??? All down from the ceiling. A few other people were locked up ??? and I got busted. I was in jail ???. In  jail, people were ??? and when I got up to get my sentence (in line) he told me instead of TIME. I asked could I go get cigarettes but the jail keeper said NO. ??? no. When it came time to see the judge we were standing in a line. Tribeca was moving over a block and the drag queens were taking over the block. Very tall zipping up their dresses. The cops caught me and I was in jail and when I came up in front of the judge they said my sentence was to rat. The guy before me, they told him, "We're doing a 'buy and bust' over at 7th St. and you'll probably be shot dead." It was his first offense. He was a nice kid. Then it was my turn and the lady judge said, "Your spot is on 26 St. gaming strip." I said, "the West Side is not my territory. I don't know where that is." The judge said, "YOU BETTER!" And I skated by and sure enough it was the gaming dock and ramps and roller blading and basketball and lots of drag queen hookers and regular hookers ???
