Ezra, Roland and I were waiting for Mom. Ezra got bored, so he started driving. He went up towards Woodside, but all the roads were different and long. We parked at a dentist. He walked through and came back out. Then we were at home, but it was different. I saw a guy at the door in the mirror. I hid, but then he was inside. He had a letter. It said I had to sleep with Roland or the "world would die" and I said "screw the world" and said I wouldn't do it. I asked if he was human and he said he used to be. Then I was somewhere, sitting behind a waterfall. Roland came and was talking to me. Ezra and some douchey friends of his came and they all ended up naked in the water. I got out. A friend of mine was seeing Kevin Bacon and he was "36 months" older than her. She had rejected him when she was younger and said she had gone back when she was 3 "to kiss you". She leaned over to kiss him and I closed the door and left. Something was happening like in The Stuff. Some others and I weren't affected. Your eyes went blue when you weren't eating it. Ezra's friends asked if I wanted some and I said I did, but then ran off. I walked to a booth and took a cylinder of cookies and cream. A guy asked why I wasn't eating the Stuff and I said I liked to eat 'not so great' stuff rather than eat 'delicious' Stuff. He was hyper and crazy. Another girl there had gotten over the Stuff. People would get mad if you weren't eating it. There was a truck going down the street in the shape of a pig. This guy ran across the roof saying "I love you, let's never part" or something. He was an old family friend, but looked old and different now -- I assumed it was from drugs. I went inside and told a friend and said 'you look like a duck'. He was then Gio (Ugly Betty) said 'you told me that before'. He was short and we seemed flirty. Nana was there.
