Someone was at my house working in my kitchen with me. I had gotten out a small bowl to put food in. The person with me asked me if I didn't have a larger bowl. They said it as if they couldn't believe the simplicity of my kitchen or the small number of things I have. I said that I do have larger bowls. I was thinking of some larger Tupperware bowls that I have but I knew I had moved them to a different place recently because I so rarely use them. I was trying to remember where I put them.
