[1997-05-08] I was in a meeting with a bunch of blind people, all friends of mine, and I said to one of them "I forgot to bring my slate and stylus," which is what we write with, and the person next to me said that I could borrow hers and asked if I would take the notes from the meeting with it. I agreed to. The slate was really unusual, it had an extra metal piece in it and the stylus had a plastic flange coming out of both sides of it, and I thought "Boy that's really ingenious, that way if you drop it it won't roll away". So I began to take notes and I could feel the heaviness of the Braille paper, heavier than what I normally use, and I thought "well, I guess I can do it this one time" and I wrote a few things down. Then a male friend, J from [Piedmont] came in, and although I didn't hear his voice, I could hear people greeting him and I got the feeling that he wasn't feeling real well. Then I was outside walking in front of the AT&amp;T building with my new graphite cane which I recently got, and it kept pulling to the left toward the building, almost as if it were a divining rod or something, and I thought that was really strange and I got back in the meeting and I started telling everybody "boy, you know, this new graphite cane really wanted to come into this building, I could feel it pulling towards the left as I walked across in front of the building."
