I dreamt about a football game in which the championship was going to be decided and our team won with two of my touchdowns. Anyway, we were going to celebrate and I remember feeling sad because a professional football player was not going to play with my favorite team any more. Then a friend (M) of mine told me that it didn't matter and I said that it did and I don't remember anything else.
