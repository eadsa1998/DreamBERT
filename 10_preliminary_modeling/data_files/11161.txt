I was falling through space and weird animals were trying to grab me while I was falling. These animals were all ugly. One of them almost caught-it resembled an octopus but had teeth. All the animals were green. I kept falling and screaming every time one of the animals would try to reach for me. Then all of a sudden there were no more animals and I found myself in a beautiful room. I started to walk around the room. On the walls were mounted heads of the animals which I had just seen. I started screaming and then woke up.
