I am in a house, waiting in the living room for the social worker to come. We are going to decide what I need. A few women come in and sit down. I scoot to make room for them on the couch. They sit waiting. I look around wondering why we hadn't started yet. And saw 10 or so people sitting around. I am surprised. We are waiting for more to arrive. I notice there are chairs placed all along the walk. I begin to count how many people are in the room. Around 70 people. I am amazed. Why do they need so many I ask the leader woman. She says because we don't know yet what you'll need so we have to have every dept. represented. I scoot over to the left more and am now sitting very close to a good looking man, the supervisor. He smiles and flirts and we chat. He has his shirt off and his hairy chest and back are soft and warm to the touch. I look and see 2 babies out in a carriage. I notice they aren't wearing anything but diapers. I am annoyed that with so many helper people in the room, no one is helping the babies. They must be cold. I walk down the bleachers over to them and try to tuck them in with a small quilt. Now there is some form of entertainment going on in the crowd. I wonder when this meeting will ever start. I try and list what I might need so I'll be ready when it does start.
