I was getting married. I was marrying the boy with whom I went out a couple of times, but not my boyfriend. I asked myself why am I doing that. I didn't want to, but I was going to. In the room, there were my parents and grandparents. At first, I had a dress on, but it was not the white one. Then at the last moment, I decided to change it, and put on a blouse and a skirt. Everybody was waiting for me. My father was very nervous. Then I saw that my mother, my grandmother and my grandmother's sister are wearing similar blouses. Then I remember that I pointed that out in mind very clearly. Everybody was asking me why am I marrying this boy. I answered that I have no idea and that I know that it is wrong. Then everybody went to the elevator. And I don't know what happened next, because the phone rang and I woke up.
