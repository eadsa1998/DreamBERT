["Lesbian Math"]  I am seated on a couch. A man and a woman are on my left. The man is sleeping at the far left. The woman is nodding off. She sits between me and the man. I decide to look at a book a woman wrote about math problems that aren't generally explained. It is a study guide. This one problem is about explaining the line that is drawn through the bottom denominator which denotes the seller. As I open the book, some of the pages tear off like pages off a notepad. I try to put them back together. I think I would be interested in learning this  obscure math problem. Now a landlady of the apartments I'm in is seated on my right. She is complaining about how she and her husband have to quit the manager job because they expect them to move book cases and so on. Too hard for them with their disability. She then starts singing a silly song about lesbians. "Look them in the eye, now you have to look them in the O." She laughs. I feel a bit uncomfortable that she is talking about lesbian sex, but shrug my shoulders and enjoy the song as it is cute, the pun on eye and I. Apparently the letter O means orgasm or the vagina opening.
