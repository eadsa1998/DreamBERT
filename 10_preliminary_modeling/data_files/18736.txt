I was with William. We were traveling across the night. There were huge high cliffs. Way above the water and William had to pivot from one cliff to another. I had to swing on a rope to a higher ledge of the swaying mountain. I heard a shot steps before we met. I was on the rope swing to the cliff where the guy who shot said, "So," and he shot at me. They were the guys who were chasing me through the snow. I tried to hold on. I couldn't hold on. A shot rang out. I had a pistol and the ropes held my hair. ??? Half way across. I could not hold on any more. I let go because I had to. An academic type, later speaking. My hands could not hold on. I was shot. I dropped my belongings and held onto.........I started falling. I could see the ground and the empire state building and the statue of liberty. I had ended up destitute. I could see the world upside down in my travels. This is if I was alive. The ??? spilled over and was full ??? I had been shot at. I was hit. I missed a step and fell out of balance. Wills were not over yet. When I was falling I could slow film--I could see myself falling toward the points on the statue of liberty's head dress. I had been raped. I had been shot with a gun. They returned my skates and wallet, emptied of cash. my father was trying to catch up. Bobsledding down a mountain in a bubble ??? standard ice rules. I kept waiting to hit. The bob sleds were seconds off schedule, but enough to miss connections. When we finally got there I saw a ball of wax with monster things stuck to the register and asked if Rudy was a regular customer and stuck somewhere under the ice. Merri
