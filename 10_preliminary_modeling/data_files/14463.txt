Ezra came into my room, which was different. I had a TV as a monitor and wallpaper on the edges of my wall. I had piles of stuff and he started doing stuff and I was telling him off and explaining why. I complained to Mom about it and she just told me to shut up. Ezra got angry and started throwing stuff and was like crying angrily and was about to slam my door and I stopped him. He squirted me with choc milk and I went into his room and did the same. I was trying to tidy my room and he came in and helped to do something on the computer. I went onto Facebook and somehow found two accounts called Matthew Clark, but his name was actually Preston Casey? I was going through his photos and I was going to get them but Ezra was watching me. I had posted something on there before, so I deleted it. Some guy said "42" and then I (or someone) said "oh, by 80" and saying that some other model was better than what he had. My webcam was called "Izaela" and I said "No I call it Vera". Then it was Adam Baldwin on the computer and he said "Yeah, coz everything's so much easier if it's called Izaela".
