I was with a couple of friends in a cave. We were prisoners or worked there. The other two tried to steal or escape and they put out the lights and we got part of the way out. The guards came after us. I was innocent. I lay on one side of the cave away from the fireworks and one of the men came near me to escape the bullets.
