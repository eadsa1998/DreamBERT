I was coming home from somewhere.  ("Home," in this case, was a big house surrounded by a lot of yard.)  I found several guys playing football in the yard beside the house.  I was delighted to note that, with the addition of me, the teams would be even.  They decided whose team I would be on, but before I even got on the field, the other team punted to my team.  I was just off the right sideline as we looked toward our goal, and I ran on the field, caught the punt in the air and on the run, and dashed straight down the sideline.  There was only one guy between me and the goal, and he tagged me.  I couldn't figure out why I hadn't tried to run around him.  It had been a good runback, though, and I expected more recognition than I got.  Later, at this same house, I got thick letters in the mail from 4-5 friends.  This often happens in dreams, but this time I was convinced it was real and not a dream, and it took me a while to accept reality even after awakening, and then it was very disappointing.
