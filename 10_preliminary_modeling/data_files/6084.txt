I used to play on an indoor soccer team, but I had to stop playing because it was in conflict with my work schedule. I missed playing the game. An opportunity came along to play on another team. The only thing different was we played with ice skates and a hockey puck. My team made it to the finals. My team was down by two points. My cousin was on my team. She then scored a goal to tie the game. There was a minute left to the game. Playing with ice skates and a puck was hard. But I kept trying my best and with ten seconds left, I scored the winning goal. My team were the champs.
