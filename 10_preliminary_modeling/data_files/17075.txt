I was in class, in lecture, in the same room where I have my psychology class. I have a textbook. It looks similar to my language textbook. There is a geometrical picture of a man on the cover. The word "O.K." is scratched onto his head. I get up to go to the bathroom. I come back and sit down. The man on the textbook is colored differently. Someone has covered the textbook in clear plastic and then colored on it. I open up the cover and it says, "I love Tom Cruise," written lengthwise. I look toward the front of the lecture, and there are three grits (mid-western, white trash, punks) I knew in middle school. They were looking back at me and giggling. Apparently, they were the secret vandals.
