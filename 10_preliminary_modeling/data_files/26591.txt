 I see some very large birds that look like some kind of eagle. They are black in color, with a white head. Their wingspan is 16 to 18 feet: they are huge! I run to get a camera to take a photograph of them. I have my friend Reed Maxwell's camera, which he is letting me use, and another camera. There are several birds.
