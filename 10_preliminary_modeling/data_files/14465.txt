I had some mail and it was my proof of age card. The envelope was big and was full of other stuff. The photo on the card was stupid. My mouth was open, but it had three mini photos and my main photo was me on a 3/4 angle with the front of my face over the top. I called Mom to complain but I couldn't get through. I tried to call the DPI but I kept getting disconnected. I went for my walk with Ezra. We went across the road and there was a lemur. I called out "There's a lemur eating Ezra's head!". It tried to get me, so we ran. It was bouncing around. I was then watching something. There was a boy and he opened the door and there was a creepy scarecrow and I screamed.
