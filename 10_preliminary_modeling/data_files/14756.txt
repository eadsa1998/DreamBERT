I went to university to do something quickly. I walked out and I saw Jamison. I said "Jamison? You take the train?". It was dark there. I ran to the bus. They left the door open and I had to stand right near it and I almost dropped my phone. There was an elevator at the train station (and it was inside and not train station like at all) and Sineita was in it. It was clear and went sideways and fast. When I got off, I ran down the escalator to get the train. I got in, but it was a stingy carriage. It was really small, crowded and dark (there were no lights). I saw a cat jump onto the track. We stopped at Stirling, which was Belmont, and then went back to Westland. I called Mom and I had a text from Ezra about Guitar Hero and a book. Also, the train had finished at Stirling as it was a new thing because not enough people were using the stations past Stirling.
