We had two cell phones, two '55 Chevy's and two clock radios, and one of these two was good and one of these two wasn't. Our first cell phone, it just died, and so the second one, we had to start using the second one, but we would go into this picnic at Lake Hiawatha Park over the weekend, and we were going to use a baby toy phone for the weekend and not use the good one until we got back. And we had two cars, looked exactly alike. One of them had a couple little things that were here and there, and one that was perfect. And then we had two clock radios. The one that was there was, it wouldn't display the time any more, but the display would show like little flowers and things instead of the numbers for the time. And it was showing like stuff like a sailing boy would show, and I had to click the parrot thing to tell the time. But we had another good one that was ready to go. I don't know what all this double imagery means, but a couple years ago I had a dream that there were two Tweety's and, even more, I had a dream that there were two of Dad. So I don't know what all this dreaming in double is about. [laugh]
