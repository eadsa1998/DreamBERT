I dreamt that it was the day after the BW Kent State basketball game. Percy, a fellow I played high school basketball with and who now plays for Kent State, had stayed overnight with me apparently. I was showing him around our campus. The boiler room was located about where Centennial Hall now is. We went there and were talking about the BW team, about Daniel and Jim in particular. They came in and sat down and talked with us for a short time. Percy and I left. I showed him some of the buildings around campus. We then went downtown and were supposedly on our way to the Grindstone when I woke up.
