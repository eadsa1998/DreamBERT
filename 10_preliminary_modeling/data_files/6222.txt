Last night I had a dream that I had a big test in management and it was supposed to be all essays. I wasn't prepared for it so I had to cram the night before. This was a usual thing for me. I was studying till late at night and I happened to doze off. When I woke up, I hadn't finished studying and I had to leave right away to take the test. When I got in the room I was worried and I asked the girl next to me if she was ready. she said, "Yeah," and that made me feel worse. I took the test and I knew I failed. The teacher corrected the tests. I got the lowest grade in the class and I was ashamed.
