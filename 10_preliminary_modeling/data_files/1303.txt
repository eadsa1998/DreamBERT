We are moving back into the M City house. My parents and I are tired but are putting things where they belong. I look around the room. I put my books on a book case. I start sweeping dirt up, my mother is too. We get in each other's way. Finally, we get the floor clear. Someone vacuums the carpet. Paulina moves my bookcase into place. I'm disappointed and say, "No, not there. I can't see it." She shifts it around and books fall sideways and all over. My father insists on moving the piano near that corner. I look around and see lots of old furniture, records and stuff, all my parents stuff. I see the beauty of the room, the lovely windows, the beautiful hard wood floor, and I feel sad that I can't just get more of my parents' stuff out and let the room be mine. Aunt Elaine is there. My mother looks out at the mail boxes and says, "The bills are gone. Someone has picked them up." She's annoyed. I start reading a book that explains that there are hidden puns in dreams. It shows words and how when you break them up, you find the answer (Er rick da Erro Rick, Spanish for gives), like that. There were other examples. It made me want to examine my dreams more closely. Then we get in our car. My father is driving and I'm thinking, "Well, here I am in M City again. What will it be like this time? Who will I meet?"
