Magical grandparents look like ordinary older people, but they are really magical godparents, but cast under a spell. I come to their house and they show me around. We go out into the backyard and walk. I start singing because it is so beautiful and I sing beautifully. I sing, "Oh, Lord, look at these beautiful mountains." We walk across the yard, which is iced over rain water, and I'm worried it will crack and we'll fall through. She says, "No, no problem." We safely get to the other side. There is a sort of children's fantasy playground there and I go in and look around at the cute playhouses and things. The older woman gives me a huge pink crystal on a necklace and I wear it. As I'm going through the playground, it changes to a deep ruby color and I find a big black crystal that pops up out of a "playhouse." That means the spell is broken and they are restored to their magical selves.
