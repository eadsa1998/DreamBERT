I am in some unknown house that I apparently live at. My girlfriend's housemate (male) is now my housemate and we get into an argument. Right away I get ruthless and tell it to him like it is. I tell him that no one likes him and that everyone thinks he is a complete jerk. Everyone else is scared to tell him this, but I do not care; I welcome the confrontation. I tell him this and he really has no reply or comeback; it shuts him up pretty quick. I think that I hurt his feelings, but I don't care because it is the truth. I am living in the house his parents own, so I start packing up all my stuff and putting everything into cardboard boxes. I am not sad that I am moving out, even though it is a great house. I am just completely over it. I feel like it is a lost cause and that there is no point in me trying to salvage or fix anything that already went wrong. My mind is made up to leave, and I do no really care what anyone thinks or says.
