 I'm with a man I'm friends with. We go to my friend Tiny Combs' house. It is night. We're going to steal a 19-pound brown trout. It helps to salt the fishing line and the lure. The Combs parents awake and we flee. We get in my mom's station wagon and quickly drive away. We're then near Pool Park in Wilmerton. It's 11:00pm. I want to visit my friend Kevin Simpson, who lives near the park, because I haven't seen him in a long time.
