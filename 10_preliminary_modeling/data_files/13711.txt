Mom and I were at some weird place in the forest. It was dark. There were these hamster like animals with long snouts. They were doing some weird things, so Mom left a note on the cage saying that they had fallen and hit their head. We got a lighter, some gas and a lantern and it made a little explosion when we put them together. We then had light. We were walking down a path and if we leant forward and walked a bit faster, we would suddenly just go really fast, so we did that. Then we were at a village with a place to sleep. Then it was Eugene and I. We were in a room. He was in bed and there was another me and I was watching her. She was like "Oh, I need my cappuccino" and Eugene and I were like 'what the flip?'. He couldn't see me. I realized I'd been 'separated' and had changed the part of me that didn't like coffee. It was sometimes a game and I was little and jumped onto the bed and collected coins. Then I went in the kitchen and collected the coins in there. Then Ezra, Mom, Dmitri, Eugene and I were in a car. Mom went to a petrol station and Dmitri was in the driver's seat. This guy went to Ezra's side and asked him to write a note about the car and started going to the driver's side to take it. I locked the doors and then I was in the driver's seat and I took off. I was going really fast, but the guy went into a car and was following me. We ended up in a shop, still driving, and the cops were chasing me. I saw a cop car, so I stopped the car and threw my hands up. I told them a crazy guy was following me, but he was gone.
