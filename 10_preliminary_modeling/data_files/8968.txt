The Candy House. I was driving on S.R. 46 in St. Joe and passed a house on my left that looked as though it had been decorated with candy. Even the yard had a confectionary appearance to it. Though, it didn't look like a Gingerbread house. It was different than that. It made me smile, and made me curious. I decided that when I got home I would do a search for candy house on the internet and see if I could find anything. Now I am with a family member and I ask them about the candy house. They told me that the family that owns it has regularly scheduled tours, which they took once. During the tours they explain the how and why of their candy house. I wanted to take the tour. Of course, it isn't really candy. They just used building materials that would make it appear as though it were. We drove by the house again. This time I noticed things that I hadn't noticed the first time. The house sat back a bit from the road and there was a long, curvy, brightly-colored driveway. It appeared to be wet, at least all the way down the middle, but then I realized that I what I originally thought was rain water was actually something else. Something negative happened after this.
