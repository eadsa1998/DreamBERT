Three different scenes where I misplaced or couldn't find poems or other people's creative writing that I was going to incorporate into a program I was in charge of. I would look for the goodies, but all I would find are underwear, or earrings, or hard case eye glass cases that opened up into purses. It was the bus driver's fault and I had to come into the place I was to make a speech late. The audience was waiting. I explained that some of my speech is missing, but that we can manage.
