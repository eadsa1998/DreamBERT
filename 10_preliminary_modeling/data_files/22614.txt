I remember very little about this dream. I remember that I and a different group went to a beach near my house, but we really went there just to walk around rather than to swim. But the water looked so nice that we got in with our clothes on. I and my girlfriends were wearing dresses. We got all wet, but then we came out. We arrived at my home, and as usual we started to play the guitar and to sing. We were a group of boys and girls and we were very happy. Afterwards, we said goodbye because I had to go to bed early to go to the university the next day.
