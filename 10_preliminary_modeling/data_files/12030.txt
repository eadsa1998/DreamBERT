I had a pet pig called Porky. It was very evil and only liked Mom. We kept it in a cage. Mom and I went to this place, which had a human path and an animal path, which was all cagey and had bridges and stuff. She let the pig loose and I ran way ahead, but then I didn't know where to go. I was on a bridge and the pig caught up and tried to get me. Mom gave it a pat. It worked out how to get on the bridge so I bolted for the door on the other side. It had no lock and the pig could open doors. The light switch was on the door handle. The door turned into a sheet and the pig bit my foot, it hurt and I screamed. These people with guns shot the hell out of the pig, but it was still alive and now it was upset. I ran upstairs into a little room. I was trapped and there were zombies outside of the room. There were lots of Cuddles looking cats, but they all had different coloured eyes, which were all bright.
