This dream took place at an unknown or unidentifiable school, meaning a college, and I was being defensive for the school, and that two visitors who were there are asking about the psychology department. I thought that it was almost ridiculous because it was so well known that this psychology department was the best that there is, there were none any better. This is what I was saying to them, and that we had the best professors and the best equipment, and that there just was no two ways about it, that this college had the best psychology department of any college. The visitors could not be identified as to sex.
