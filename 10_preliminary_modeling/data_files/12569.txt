I was at 'Mom's'. I was out in these woods. A rabbit was hiding in a bigger animal's body. I cut it out. Ryan Kelley was there. I was now at home. I was near the pool and I had done a poo in there once. Ryan drew a picture of a nuclear thing because I said that it looked cool, bit he wouldn't show me and then he ran off. Dmitri was there at some point. I was at Mom's again, in the woods with someone. I had a torch and I was running back to Mom's because a Silent Hill siren was going to go off. It went off as I was shutting the door.
