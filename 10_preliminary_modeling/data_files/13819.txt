I was telling Calvin about a dream I had had where everyone was wearing leaf outfits. It was playing out live for me though. Calvin said "And Eugene!". Someone was covering and someone else was hiding in the bush. Darius said something about some flower. Evelyn came back and was hanging with us and we didn't know what to do. Julianna had done something and had called her parents to apologize, but they were still complaining.
