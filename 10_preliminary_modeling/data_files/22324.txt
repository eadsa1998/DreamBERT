I was in a place similar to the fields around Chosica, 25 miles from Lima and at 1,500 feet above sea level. It was a green mountain covered by grass, with a stair-like irrigation system with about 15 feet between each step and about 600 feet away from the valley which was seen at the foot of the mountain which looked at the time like a gigantic stadium which had narrow rows where people sat to look at a parade (like in the national holidays) which was taking place at the end of the valley and which could be viewed with great advantage. The parade was very colorful and there was a mass of people who applauded and hailed the marchers (who went rather fast) to the beat of an extraordinary band; it was really a great panoramic view. At the height of the steps where I was very excited, though rather alone and insecure, I was afraid to trip and fall down into the valley 600 feet below. I was so nervous that I even wanted to urinate, but my fear of falling was such that I chose  to stay where I was. But a very attractive lady who was next to me asked me to help her get to the bathroom. The shame of having to confess that I was just as scared as she of walking on the narrow steps was stronger than the fear, so that, pretending to be very sure and unafraid (which I wasn't), I offered to accompany her to the bathrooms (after all, I was also in need of them). She took me by the hand and we started to move bit by bit, very slowly, along the steps, going to the bathrooms. Since the other spectators were sitting, we had to walk on the edges of the steps and the void offered us the possibility of falling with every step we took. Only when we were near the bathrooms did I have the time to look at the lady because fear of falling hadn't let me do this before. When I went with her to the bathroom, she became awfully attractive to me. She was about 30 and had a sensuous look, which was barely concealed by apparent seriousness. Going into the bathroom, I woke up.
