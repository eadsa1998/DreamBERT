I was near the lounge room. Eugene was in there with some others. Dad was talking to me. Tigger was just at the entrance to the lounge room and I was playing with her and calling "Linxy!". I went driving with Mom. There were clouds in the sky and they were weird looking. Mom asked me if I knew what they were and she said they were hurricanes. I freaked out. We went to a petrol station and Andrew McCarthy worked there. He said my limit (for petrol) was full for today and I was like 'damn, we can't do the logbook quickly'.
