I saw a bit of some bad movie and this guy had a male and a female guard standing on a rocky ledge. The whole place was outside, and was rocky. There was a big ditch next to it. There was this other guy with them who was very flamboyant and gay. Something started controlling the guards and they walked off the edge, killing them. One of them got replaced by Steve Sandvoss. This girl on the internet was in love with him and she was 15. I was then at some place with Mom and Ezra. There was a TV show and something was getting killed on it. Giovanni was on it in his leaver's jacket and said "is it live?" and he was going to be in some movie. Then we were there and it was a Friday the 13th movie, except Robert Englund was in it. Someone decided that I was going to be the first guy to be killed and Giovanni was the girl. The place it was set at was not far away and we were walking there. The actor playing the killer, was actually a killer, and I said "do you really trust him?", but we had no choice but to go there. The room we went to was really green and had some red/brown in it.
