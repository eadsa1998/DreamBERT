Male companion (22) and I were walking down dimly lit street in a poor section of town. Walked down a hill to a ramshackle old house which we entered. We sat down in the living room and he told me he was going to introduce me to a girl he used to go with. I did not resent this in the least and was quite anxious to meet the girl. I remember that he called her by a Japanese name Ishihara. He called her by name and to my great surprise a tall girl entered whom I recognized as a girl who at the present time lives in my dorm. I didn't let either of them think that I knew who the girl really was--felt shocked and hurt. Next day I saw the same girl at her home (in the living room) and asked her if she had previously gone with my boyfriend. She said oh yes, but didn't seem to know that I had seen her the night before when she had been presented to me under the Japanese name of Ishihara. All the time I was dreaming this, I was convinced that it was only a dream.
