I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. Emery was trying to take a photo of my Wiki. Some little girl friend of Mom's was around. Later, Darren was driving down this road with forest on either side. I was telling him to slow down because I had heaps of Christmas presents, "this is Nana's and this is dads". There was a bit of sand covering a section of the road and it had grass and frogs in it too. It was there to block the rest of the road. Darren maneuvered through it, there were people scattered in it too. He was just hitting them. At the end he stopped and got arrested. Mom got 'points' but Ezra and I didn't get in trouble.
