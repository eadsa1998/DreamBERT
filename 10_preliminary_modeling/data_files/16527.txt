First of all, Dad and somebody else was watching upstairs on Mom's little TV and Mom and Merrilee were watching it downstairs. So I came downstairs with them, and then eventually Dad came downstairs and I was able to go upstairs and go to sleep. It's complicated. I don't' think I understand it really. Now the second one was that, you know, we really have a rheostat under our cabinets on top of our counter to control the level of the lights that are mounted up there. But in addition to that, I dreamt that we had a really big rheostat underneath the counter to control something else that was only supposed to be touched when the power was off. And I was thinking how I understand the relationship between power current and resistance, but I don't exactly know what aspect of it we actually pay for and is measured monthly. Well, in my dream Dad told me that we pay for how much current we use, but I know that reason tells me it's how much power we use, which is a combination of voltage and current. It took me a while before I got that! And he was having me check that little rheostat for the lights up there with a continuity checker that was all metal, and just had little things at the end. And I put it on each little screw of the rheostat and the light lit up full, and I took the thing off and it stayed full for about a minute or two and then it went dim again. That is woo-woo, man!
