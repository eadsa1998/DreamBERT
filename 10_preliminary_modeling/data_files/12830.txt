I was in a forest. There were cars that didn't work well. Autumn was there. I had the pickup but I couldn't drive it. I needed to get somewhere. There was a swimming competition on and Calvin was there and his cousin, Acquaintance-F-02, was in it. Ezra was there and he had a cool jacket and these guys were like "Whoa, awesome" but it had a teddy bear picture on the inside, so Mom put it on weird so it couldn't be seen.
