I am around a table with C department people. Josh says we have to go to another place so Tyler is going to walk with me. As we are walking up the street, we look ahead and see a huge water buffalo loose. He is quite active so Tyler and I decide we'll climb up a tree to be safe. I climb up. There are lots of other people in the tree. The water buffalo decides to try and reach me. He rears up and stretches his nose and I scramble up higher and higher. I'm now clinging to some pretty skinny branches. He finally goes away. I climb down and Tyler and I continue walking, talking excitedly about our narrow escape. Then I notice Tyler isn't there. I look around and see I'm in a bad neighborhood, sleazy bars, etc. I think, "Where is Tyler when you need him?" I look behind me and see Tyler and Mabel talking and laughing. I feel jealous and hurt. I keep walking. Mabel catches up and I want to share the buffalo story, but I don't to "teach her" or punish him. Then I relent and tell her. Joe F. is ahead and has a skinny, flimsy motorbike. He asks me to help get it started. I tease him. So do some tough guys. Now I'm in a house. I want to go outside and go to an extension of the house and get a book, but it's dark outside and I turn on the porch light, but decide it's safer to go back in and go through the house to get to the extension to get my book.
