It was night, and I let some people in my house here in Chatsworth.  My house was bigger, longer, it had a long outdoor porch or long living room, kind of like the cabin in Castle Valley.  I thought they came to party with us, but then they started wrecking things, stealing things, destroying and changing things, and I realized they had come to take advantage of me.  I knew I had dreamed of these same people, this same situation before, on another night.  I recognized this same scenario.  And in this dream, it was like it happened twice.  They came again at a later date, I let them in again, and again they took advantage of me, took things and wrecked my things.  There was a scene of the street outside my house, where I was trying to get them out, get my life and my stuff back together.  I couldn't trust them.  I got anxious and scared for my house, my life and belongings, the things I've built up since leaving Lynn.  There was one main woman, a strong crass woman in her 40's, who was heading it all.  I knew I had dreamed of her and this situation before.  And she had these other people with her who all conspired and slowly took advantage of me opening up to them, and ruined my life.  It was a scary dream, with anger and frustration.  I felt overwhelmed and out of control, I couldn't get rid of them.
