I was at home and Raquel was over. She asked me where to find Winrar and some movies and I asked if she used torrents and she said no. I said we used Pirate Bay 'like Google'. We watched a movie called Psycho Killer. She left a note in my room. Uncle Vic was having a 52nd birthday party. He lived in Oceanside and I was going to stay the night there. Roland and Ezra were also coming. Everyone kept making jokes about hangovers in Oceanside. We were buying alcohol.
