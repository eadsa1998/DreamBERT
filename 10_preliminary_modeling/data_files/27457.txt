I dreamed that I was in a doctor's office supposedly receiving a physical examination. However, the doctor merely proceeded to tell me a series of stories and anecdotes which I didn't pay much attention to since I was paying him to examine me. Then he began questioning me on material he had talked to me about, but since I had been bored and had paid little attention, I couldn't answer any of the questions. Since there were a few other people present, we must have been having the consultation in his outer office.
