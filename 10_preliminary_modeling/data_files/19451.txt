I was at the big country music nightclub with a friend of Zack's and mine. I decided if Zack wasn't going to take me out, I would go anyway. Then we spotted Don Smith across the bar. The man I was with said, "Isn't that the nosey guy?" I said, "Yes, he will probably run to Zack and try to tell him what he already knows." Then I spotted a great looking guy sitting by Don. I smiled; he smiled back. Then he came over and asked me to dance. He was wonderful; lots of spins and moves, just like Zack. Then there was the dip. He dipped me so low that my hair was on the floor and my foot next to his face. When I came up, I saw Zack. He had come and he looked jealous as hell. When we walked back towards the seats, Zack got up and walked to the bathroom. Then I noticed that the women's bathroom was full and there were women in the men's room. I saw him standing close to this lady and talking to her. I slammed the door wide open. "What the hell are you doing? This is a men's room, so get the hell out! And you, Zack, do your thing, then make your choice: me, the one who's going to be there when you look like shit and when you're sick, and when our daughter needs us, or these bitches who might be good for a quick lay." I walked out.
