I was in a classroom with the rest of my class (8th grade). Steve, our teacher and principal, was calling up, one by one, the people with long hair and cutting their hair so that it was about jawbone length. I was the last person to be called up. I ran away and tucked my hair into my sweatshirt so that it looked like I had short hair already. Everybody looked at me like I was just being stupid, so I went over to Steve. I had to keep telling him not to cut it so short. It seemed like he finally cut it just above shoulder length. Then I was at home and looking in the mirror in my room. My hair was just below shoulder length. I wondered for about 20 seconds about why he had cut it shorter. I figured I just didn't see where Steve cut my hair. Then I noticed that my hair looked good at this length and looked at the mirror for a while. Setting: Most of it took place in the classroom at my school. Some of it took place in my room. Characters: Steve Smuin is my teacher and the school principal. My whole class, the whole 8th grade, was in the dream. I know them all. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, worried, surprised. I felt like this really happened. One weird thing that I just realized is that my hair in the dream was straight, smooth, shiny. This wasn't really out of the ordinary. If it weren't for the hair-cutting, I wouldn't even have noticed it as a dream, not a memory. The feelings I had were really normal for being at my school.
