Someplace with Ben D. The building began to collapse and people were shouting to everyone to get out. Only one section of it collapsed. We checked to make sure no one was trapped or injured and they weren't. Ben D and I were outside, he was standing behind me, facing me with his arms around me. He asked me if I wanted a behinder. I've never heard that term before but I assumed I knew what he meant. I said that I was sure he would enjoy that. Then the building started to collapse again and everyone began to run. Ben D was still behind me with his arms around me. He barely lifted me off the ground and began to run. My feet didn't even touch the ground. Someone told us not to even turn around to look, to just keep running. We kept coming to places of water and I kept saying with panic that I can't swim. It was as though we skimmed across the water. This happened several times. Finally, we heard the building come crashing down behind us. After we were sure we were safe we stopped. We were just at the edge of the demolished building. Where we were standing was by a type of corridor to the building. It had not crashed completely to the ground. I saw people in there who had not made it out. I started reaching in and helping people to get out. After everyone that I could reach was out I saw that there were more people in there so I went in far enough to reach the others. They had been injured, but all of them were in a seated position with their legs straight out in front of them but they were bent way over towards their knees, a sort of yoga position. But they couldn't move, even though they had room to move. I reached for each of them and slid them out by the boards they were sitting on. I didn't even think about the fact that this part of the building could collapse the rest of the way. It was an old house that had been three floors.
