I was surrounded by boxes and bags of small balls of yarn which I had to sort out and that was a chore I had done many times in my life and one which I enjoy and so that was a nice dream, all different colors, some were in boxes and some were in Shop and Save bags, the local grocery chain... The I jumped from sorting balls of yarn to dress making in my mother's bedroom which had pale green curtains, the bed that she and my father slept in, and all their furniture, but I was trying to use a pattern and cut out a jacket or a blazer for myself and I cut all the pieces out and held them up and where I had folded the fabric, there wasn't enough so that the front of this jacket was very , very short and could not be used. This took place in a house in a very remote part of southern Maine called UF, a town which had a power station where my dad was the superintendent of and in this dream I looked out the bedroom window, which I often did, and I could see the power station and the Saco river behind it, its really a lovely view and it was very real in this dream and there were all kinds of construction workers who were milling around down at the power station which is called Q Dam.
