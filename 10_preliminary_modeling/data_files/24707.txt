Me and my family were all in a cabin up in Tahoe, and were looking at pictures when it was time to go. We had to take two cars because we had so many people. We started on our way when the first car stopped in the middle of the deserted road we were travelling on. My dad got out of the first car, and shouted "fire." Sure enough, there was a small orange flame by the car. And he started to fight it, and eventually put it out. Setting: Tahoe, and on a deserted road on the way from Tahoe to home. Characters: My step-mom, my 23 year old cousin Brandon, his mom and dad (Rob and Kai), my grandmother Marion, my dad Gerson, my sister Dagan. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, sad, scared, worried, hate. I hated my step-mom for making us leave. I was angry that she made us leave. I was sad that we had to leave. I was scared and worried when I saw the fire, and I was happy when it was put out.
