I was walking along Constitution Ave. past Museum Bldg., on my way to my car which was parked behind Museum. Just before reaching the private entry to grounds I was accosted by a wholesome appearing girl, slightly chubby, with clear eye and complexion, and a pleasant voice (remindful of Miss Tabay, librarian). She waved at me and then fell in step. This seemed perfectly proper, although I didn't know the girl -- that is, I knew she was a fine girl and the informality of our acquaintance doubtless only the modern way of taking short cuts. I asked if I could give her a lift in my car, and she replied, very distinctly: "No, you can not." This refusal seemed natural, and there was no hard feeling generated.
