I had gotten a job with the Permanent Life Insurance Co.  I wasn't too sure I wanted to keep the job, and was made rather anxious by the way the guy showing me around seemed to take for granted the permanence of it.  There was another guy starting at the same time I was, and the office manager was introducing us to everyone.  They were all dressed rather casually, and many were at desks along a hallway rather than in actual offices.  The name of one of the guys was something like Zappelletti.  No one gave me anything to do, so I sat down in front of a color TV in a lounge with another guy.  It was a sort of open-air lounge at the foot of some stairs sort of like the Spanish Steps in Rome, at the top of which was a construction site of some sort.
