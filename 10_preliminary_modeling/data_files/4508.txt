["Weird cake."] I made a cake. I am frosting it. This is for some special presentation for a group of people. The loaf cake breaks in two or three pieces. I place it back together and spread the chocolate frosting on the top. Then I drizzle some extra chocolate on the top of the frosting. It makes a pretty pattern. Then I have more frosting left, so I begin to plop big blobs of it on the cake and ruin the pretty look of it. However, it does have lots of chocolate and tastes great.
