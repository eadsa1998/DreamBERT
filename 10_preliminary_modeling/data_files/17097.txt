We had switched classes.  One of my teachers was very strict, and reprimanded me for something.  I went back to history to pick up an old test or something.  We got the old assignments.  My best friends Emma and Jenna were there.  Jose was nowhere around, so rather than leaving, I dilly-dallied.  He never showed, which was what I was hoping.  I waited for everyone to empty out.  I was considering taking his paper.  I wavered between grabbing my things to go or taking the paper.  I was deciding against it.  I had kept the dilemma to myself, of course.  Jenna got preoccupied with something else.  Emma, however, suggested the same idea I was already mulling over.  I admitted my thoughts.  As she came up with it too, I just grabbed it.  I don't think she was serious, but she wasn't completely shocked or opposed when I took it.  I didn't know exactly what the assignment was but I do believe it was about him, perhaps an autobiography rather than US history.  Whether it was on that paper or another one I did not have was the Mexican flag, and Emma made a comment to that.  Later, I remember either going down a tube or pulling it down over my head. Jose ducked into the bathroom about when I did.
