I'm walking through the city airport with my husband and up ahead we see Susie, my best friend from high school. We rush to catch up with her and stop and say hello. I congratulate her for being pregnant and tell her I am too. She has very little to say, so my husband and I say "bye" and keep walking. We come to gate 87 and start searching. This is where the $800 from the armored truck which was robbed last week was last seen. I look for floor panels I can pull up. My husand is telling me the police have already done that and I'm wasting my time. But I pull up a piece of the floor and drop into a crawl space. About twenty feet away is a box covered with a black cloth and inside is all the money.
