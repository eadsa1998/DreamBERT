 I am with Larry Rollie and we're driving in Kevin's car to a cabin where my dad and Lisa are. We drive past a bar called the High Life. Nan Lawson and his friend are there with my dad and Lisa, and they're all swimming. We park the car. By the time it's parked, they're done swimming and are walking up towards the cabin. My dad says jokingly, with his characteristic laugh, that he's sorry I didn't do as well as I wanted. He thinks I've already found out my grades, but I haven't. Then I realize the school has sent my grades home and my dad knows what I got. I ask him. He tells me I got 12 points, meaning 4 B's, with 3.0 grade points for each. I go nuts. I fall on the ground and swear and hit the grass with my fists. I'm pissed off. My friend Esther Thurman's car is there. I'm on the ground next to it. Esther and my friend Marybeth Neumann come to console me. Part of my anger is acting. My old basketball teammate Carl Everson is there. I ask him if he can relate to my dilemma, because he did really well in high school. He says that college is harder.
