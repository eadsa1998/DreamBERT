Someone and I are offered beads to string for fun and profit. We made a baby rattle that's very cute. I try several other designs. Now I'm measuring on a map with a hairpin like device that is unbent. I can't make out the writing on the map but I see some water channels and locks and a bay. I see "Golden Gate" written on the bay. I get a feeling that we're sailing and decide it would be fun to stop off at the Golden Gate Bay before going on our journey east (incorrect numbering there are no dreams numbered 330-339).
