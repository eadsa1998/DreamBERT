I'm in a foreign country, Russia perhaps. I'm trying to escape and nearly get out when someone notices me and calls me over. I am worried. They are going to ask me some questions about my birth certificate and if I don't lie well, I'll get caught. I try to remember which name I should use and decide on B. I do OK by tricking them and sealing the envelope I've written the answers in before they can read them. I leave.
