A small kitten is lying on my lap. I am amazed it can talk English! My grandfather Lloyd brings me a measuring cup with liquid in it. He says if I drink 4 swallows, take a pill, and rub some of the liquid on my wrist, I shall be able to hear and talk with my cat. I then notice there is a leak. I quickly swallow it, take the pill, etc. I call to my cat "Kathleen." She looks at me, but doesn't talk. I learn she prefers to be called Kathy. Then I go out with a friend to get into a small sports car. I unlock her door. She gets in and unlocks my door. It's hard to get in. The car is so small. I notice cigs are on the outside and I start to drive. I open the door and struggle to get the almost empty pack. I think of Darryl. I drive fast.
