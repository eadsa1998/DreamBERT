I know I had kind of a complicated dream last night, but I can only dream a small little part of it because I went to sleep about 8:00, got up about 1:00, did my lab, went back to sleep about 5:30 and now it's 8:00 and I'm awake again in time for class at 9:00, except I'm a little made at myself because I forgot that I already took my clays and I don't have to be there until 10:30. I could have let myself sleep another hour. Oh well. The part of the dream that I can remember is that I was at some kind of apartment place or hotel that had a pool. I think it was supposed to mimic the place here, but I felt like it was a place that I didn't live at. The pool was an indoor pool with a little like greenhouse cover over it, but in order to turn the heat up in the water, what you had to do was go through a little gate, kneel down and crawl inside of a box that had all kinds of pumps and stuff in it. And you had to lay on your back and up on the roof of this box was a touch screen like the one on the keyboard in class. And what you had to do is you had to press a button and then touch a particular object on the menu, just like you do with that, and then it would come on. I was feeling really claustrophobic and I didn't know if I was going to be able to handle that. And even after I sort of did that, I came out and I looked at the pool, and I was going to go in. But I decided I wouldn't.
