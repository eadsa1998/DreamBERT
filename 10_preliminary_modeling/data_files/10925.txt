I dreamt I was sleeping. My girlfriend (20) who also lives in the dorm knocked. I wanted to tell her to come in, but I could only think it, as I was too sleepy. She came in and started showing me her packages. I had a feeling she had a bottle of cologne for me. There were about three packages which I knew were perfume. She then asked me to open one of them for her, and while I was opening it, I woke up, before she gave it to me.
