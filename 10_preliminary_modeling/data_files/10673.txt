I am walking down a checkered path that moves in wave-like motions. It's night time and I'm both scared and excited. There is a carnival in the distance. I want to go, but not alone. In each of these dreams a different friend will be on the path and I'll ask them if they are going to go to the carnival. The friend's reaction determines whether I want to go or not. In one dream my friend Rachel is sitting on the path crying. She feels stuck and she's really scared. She wants to get out of this place but she can't. I tell her she should try to go to the carnival. She tells me I'm crazy and there's no way in hell she's going. I'm disappointed and relieved.
