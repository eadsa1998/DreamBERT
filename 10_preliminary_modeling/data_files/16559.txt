Modern Media College was having a seminar at the Eastport Airport about audio related to the travel industry, so to speak, and what goes into like setting up the PA on a plane, and what goes into like wiring one of those airports for sound and stuff. And I just thought that was going to be so interesting, but how I was going to get from here to Eastport Airport was beyond me. And actually in this dream I was back in Westport, and I actually had to do a triangle. I had to get back over to Modern Media College, then over to Eastport Airport. Somehow Mrs. Dougherty was involved, and I wanted Mom to go with me so I wanted her to chaperone this field trip. And, you know, things aren't organized like they used to be in high school, but I thought they were in this dream, and I thought we were going to have a really big bus that was going to just drive us, and Mom could sit on the bus and chaperone the trip, you know. But the only hitch here is that I couldn't find the papers that said what day that was going to be, and it was going to be on a Tuesday and in my dream I didn't know if that was going to be today or next week. And so I was afraid that I missed it. And actually when I was trying to tell Mom and Dad about this, Mom was drawing something, and Dad suggested putting serial numbers on the back of her painting so that if she did two or three of similar, then it would kind of add value to them. And I could tell it went over like a lead balloon with Mom. [laugh] But she said, "Okay, that's a good idea." And she was going upstairs to her room to look for the papers, and then I woke up.
