I am at a table-like thing; cousin Sebastian and others are there. I am eating my toast and then I want the toast left over on the other end of the table. I can't seem to fill myself up. I lick the jelly off a yellow plastic thing and then get a bit queasy when I realize the paint is in with the jelly. I need to pee, so I go to the women's room. There are two tiny potty chairs, already being used. I go stand up over a toilet no one is supposed to use and pull the shower curtain closed around it. I pee. Delores M comes in. We chat. [BL]
