R. was looking over my old lavender dress to see if she could fix the collar. I was so worn. We discuss it a bit. Then, a sudden thought, "Why not use a neckerchief?" I began to look thru my drawers but couldn't find the right color. I said to others of the family, "Remember tomorrow is our January birthday." (R's is on Jan. 23.) At first they were puzzled but then remembered. I thought I'd get R. a neckerchief for present.
