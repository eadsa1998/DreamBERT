 I am downtown Wilmerton at a restaurant and bar. I am with two friends and one stranger. One of the friends is Stephen Ramos. We are in a basement area, a small shop. I feel like I should buy something. I get a grilled cheese. I ask a stranger if he can buy beer for me, and for my friend Nate Nelling. He agrees. I give him $15. He says it won't be enough. I think beer will cost about $2 a bottle. I tell him to get a 6-pack of Killian's Red and a 6-pack of another beer. He leaves, and brings back Killian's and Coors. I thank him. The place closes. People line up to get out. I pick up a bag for the beer. It has a hole in the bottom. I get another bag. We walk by the church downtown, and by the post office. Then we walk to my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas' house. I am with my friends Stephen and Marge Drummond. We are hauling wood in sleds, and there is snow on the ground. I say to Marge, "Memories from the Thomas household."
