There was a man, a woman and a boy nearby. The boy was their son. The wife and son said they were leaving the father because of something he did. They went down a stairs to the basement of a building. The boy wanted to do something drastic, but the mother held him back. Then she told him to bury a bundle of sticks that she handed him in the basement. The boy took it and went downstairs. (Yesterday, someone commented that in the dictionary a "faggot" is not a homosexual, but a bundle of sticks. I connect that with the dream. It seems to be related to my relations with my father.)
