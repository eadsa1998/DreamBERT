[snatches of another dream] Very old beautiful pieces of cloth on chairs. An ancient woman owned them. Another woman was exclaiming about the beauty of the rare antique. I felt sorry that the woman couldn't live with them normally but had to move so they wouldn't be injured. I wanted them but realized that when the woman died, they would go to some other person because of blood lines. I was only a relative by marriage.
