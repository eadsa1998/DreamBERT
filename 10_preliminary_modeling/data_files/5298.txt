I dreamed that I was in the main hallway. Jackson was there and my friends were asking if we had played "Roman Soldier," which was some sort of secret code, but I don't know what it meant. When they asked if we had played, Jackson must have known. I said No, but Jackson started kissing me. Then we had a holiday, but it was horrible because I had to stay inside and clean the bathrooms.
