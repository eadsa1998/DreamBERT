 I'm in a dorm with some people. Shawn Salzburg is lying on the bottom bunk. In a closet are my clothes. There are a few things I haven't worn since I came to college. I show people two basketball t-shirts with funny logos on them. One shirt says Above the Rim and the other something with the word Pole. <br/
