A man is gardening in a special gardening room. I join him. The rows are racked and I'm standing at the top looking down at him. The scruffy down and out kids come and he's eager to play with them again, to help them out of their shells of mistrust. They don't respond when he tries to get them to laugh. I grab one and tickle her on the shoulder. She finds this very funny and we roll around laughing, her laugh so beautiful and child-like its catchy. Soon we're all doing it. Someone asks me what's my favorite word and I say, "laughter."
