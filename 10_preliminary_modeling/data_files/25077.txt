 I'm in a hotel with basketball players from the Armstrong and Rocker high school. We are having a basketball war, Armstrong and Rival High Schools. My friend Kevin is the lead man. If you don't follow directions, you can't fight. A kid says hi to me. His name is Nate, and I know him as a basketball player from another team. I go into the bathroom. The college basketball coach at Brimson, Yar Glenn, is urinating. Another kid is defecating.
