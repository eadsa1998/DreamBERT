Ann and I went to a dance. As we walked along the street, we saw a big building that was built just lately and some of the old buildings were torn down. A colored man was walking and he made a motion with his hands from a habit he formed and Ann imitated him with his arm motions. Then she walked along lightly on her feet with a swing and I noticed she had a thin waistline from the back view. The entrance fee to the dance was one cent. I had some change in my hand. As I was picking out one cent, the usher was a small fellow, he stuck his fingers into my hand and took out a half dollar and some other change. I was saying something about a hill horse to myself. A priest came into a prison. He was going to give the last rites to a prisoner when he pulled out a pistol and shot the man. It was lunchtime. I was in the shop. So Ed and I went down to have our lunch. I slid down a banister rail. Then I found out I didn't have my lunch. A couple boys were hitting rocks with baseball bats. I took a bat from one of the boys and was batting the stones with the bat. I went outside and I had 4 flat tires. I knew some vandal had done it.
