I was walking down Green Drive in the middle of the night, heading from Quik Stop back to home. It was raining very hard, and I was wearing a raincoat. I got to the shopping center, and I went into the parking lot. I looked around myself, and my attention centered upon Home Video. So I pulled a key out of my pocket and unlocked the door, pushing the door open and walking inside as I did so. The interior of this building was not much; it was about six feet square and looked like a repair shop for VCR's. Parts of VCR's lay strewn about the floor. I grabbed a movie, after much consideration, and left five dollars on the counter. My biggest concern at this point was to get back out with the movie in hand and yet not be suspected by the police as a theif. For some reason, I could not get back outside for a long time. This dream ended when I crossed the threshold into the parking lot.
