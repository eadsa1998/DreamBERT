Dreamt that while we were away WALLY has cleaned all the floors spic and span and put down light blue linoleum in the bathroom. He also fixed up a room for himself and paneled the walls with narrow tongue-in-groove boards. I am amazed and very pleased. Only Reynaldo is critical and sulks for a while, then OK. He said, Wally might have driven a nail into a pipe and it could leak, but I tell him to wait and see what happens
