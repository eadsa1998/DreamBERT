Our house has a big hole on the side toward the H.'s house. In our backyard there is lots of snow and a big black "lake" of dirty water. I wonder when the hole in our house can be fixed and when I return after some time (vague) I see the hole is repaired with many small MOSAIC STONES. "They fixed the hole," I shout, very happy!
