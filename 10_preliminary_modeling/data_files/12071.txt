There was a school ball or something. I just wore my normal casual clothes. Jake and some other boys were wearing this weird suit, which had a blue 'top' thing. Some of the girls had pink ones. Calvin came and he got changed into his school shirt. He sat near me and kept leaning on me. There was this pretty girl at some place who I was talking to and getting along with. Calvin started spending time with her so I left. Ms Doubtfire was sitting in 'class'. Calvin sat at the opposite end of the table and was talking to me. He moved next to me and he 'realized' that I was annoyed that he had been spending time with the girl. I had also seen them holding hands at one stage. Calvin started laughing and teasing me because I thought that 'they were going out'. I kept denying it, although it was true. I was mainly annoyed that the girl had stopped being friends with me.
