I am at the beach. I sit on a rock, which is unstable and "rocky." The tide is coming in. I try to push the rock further into the sand for stability. I get up because it's not working and run/walk for the van because the waves are getting me wet. A man says, "The community college has a piece of the ocean." I say, "Oh yeah? Well, maybe at Florence." I go to the van. Ginny is in the driver's seat, so I start to get in the passenger side. She slides over to the passenger side so I hesitate and then get in the driver's side. I see lots of toys and candy and fun stuff hanging decoratively inside the van. I think it's cute.
