I was watching Game of Thrones, but it was different. I was talking to Benjamin on MSN at the same time. Arya and Jaqen were talking on a path and he left. I was thinking 'a man is gone'. Arya started to leave but returned and then there was a test. She held her sword out then a lady came and told her to follow her. She led her to a door which was a portal to somewhere else. Then it was me and I went through the portal. There was a stage and Eric (True Blood) and I went to climb up, but my legs started to feel like jelly and I fell. Eric asked me if I was ok and I said yes. I tried to stand up but couldn't so he picked me up and carried me. I had my arms around him touching behind his shoulder. I was trying not to blush or giggle, but I was excited. There was wine and alcohol. I couldn't remember which was which. I asked a girl to sniff them and she told me which was which. The wine was nicer. Eric gave a boring speech and I waited to see what happened next.
