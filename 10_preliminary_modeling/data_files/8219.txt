It feels as though I went back and forth between being in the dream and thinking about what I wanted to do differently the next time I was or the next time I am in this situation -. I was still fretting about the possibility of damaging my relationship with Ben D. Then I was at church and I was up front in the sanctuary. I don't know why. Maybe I was a Eucharistic Minister. From where I was standing there was someone in one of the very front pews, maybe in the first 3-4 pews. It kind of looked like Ben D but I couldn't tell for sure because he walked by other people, particularly other Eucharistic Ministers. So when people got up and started to come up to receive the Eucharistic I was moving around and leaning forward to see if it was him. I'm not sure if he even came up or if he was just leaving church at that time. But he went to the far left of his pew, turned right, and then went out the door. As he did I saw that it was him. I wondered if he was leaving at that time because he saw me up there and because he was avoiding me. This made me very sad that this might be the case because I was fairly sure that otherwise he would have wanted to chat a little bit after Mass.
