My mother and I are talking on the phone. Mid-sentence she stops talking. I am concerned because I keep calling to her, "Mom, Mom, Mom." She doesn't respond. I wonder if she's ill or in trouble. I think of hanging up and calling back, but am afraid to let go of the connection. I watch the clock. It's 5 of 10 and I think I'll wait for 5 minutes and then call the police or Lydia to go check on her. Arvonne comes in and talks.
