I had a viscous and protracted fight to the death with an intruder / zombie / enemy in the grounds of a house. The grounds were large and wild - long grass and small wild shrubs. The 'man' I'm fighting is strong and won't die straight away, so I have to reach for levels of viscousness that I didn't know I was capable of.
