This setting seemed to be a medieval one. Mention was made about some form of decorative object. Someone was saying that one had to distinguish between the regular kind of object, which was somehow invented in the metal, as opposed to those that were one consistent type of metal throughout. The object referred to seemed to be some kind of cuff link. Then other types of insignia were shown to me, and I was having some difficulty in distinguishing between them. <br/
