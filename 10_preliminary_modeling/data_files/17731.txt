I went, for some reason, to my best friend Emma's lab.  I don't know if I'd forgotten something or was going to visit or what.  When I got there, though, they assumed I was a new lab member.  I thought about trying to tell them otherwise but for some reason didn't.  A hamster was assigned to me and it was feeding time.  I watched them feed one, and it seemed to turn into a toad.  Before I left, I remembered- they hadn't fed my hamster, but one had gotten fed twice.  I had someone show me how they fed them.  A cone over the nose, and drops.  The confusion over the hamster being fed was due to the symbol on the cage- a CJ was confused with a hiragana "i" which was assumed to be my symbol, for some reason.
