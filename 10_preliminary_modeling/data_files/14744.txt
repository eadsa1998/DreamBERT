There was a kid and Locke (Lost) and two others were after him. They wanted him for bad stuff, except for Locke. They went into a shop and the kid saw the guy in the mirror and ran out. There were trying to think where a kid would hide. They went to a daycare and found a $5 note, a pencil and a wallet. They looked at a note which was actually a picture the kid had drawn. They said it was of the 'Queen' (which was like some monster). I was playing a tutorial of some game. I was walking with others outside and it was night and we were standing in light. There were creatures around and our lights went out. We ran. We made it to this room which was like a safe room before we had a fight. We had to fill our shoes up with milk. We were wearing futuristic armour and our shoes were like high up. There was a little thing on our neck with stuff to shoot and lights. To stock up on weapons and stuff, we had to play Guitar Hero and collect stuff as they fell. Eugene was there too. He had stuffed up somehow and I was making sure he was ready. You had to chuck lights too and you could only hurt the creatures when they were in the light (they were like shadows). Mom text me saying she didn't have to work tomorrow because it wasn't going to be sunny or something.
