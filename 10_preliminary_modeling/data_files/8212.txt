In my home, slightly distorted from waking life home. There is an empty salt shaker sitting on the microwave. I'm afraid it's going to get knocked off so I take it and put it inside the cabinet. I also take a salt shaker that has salt in it and I sprinkle salt on top of some things that aren't edible. There is a very large flower sitting on the floor at the corner of the walls that connect the dining room and living room. It has lots of green leaves and deep purple flowers. The flower reminds me of my clematis but the plant is much bushier, larger, and darker green than clematis. I had my candle lighter to light a candle with.
