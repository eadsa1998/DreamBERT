I was in a hospital. Some books from the library which I had been reading were missing. I went to the library to look for them. They had been borrowed by a patient named Fields. I walked through halls so narrow that I barely could squeeze through. The ceilings were slanty. I heard someone downstairs call me. I went to see who it was. A patient greeted me. When I looked away for a moment he put a lighted cigarette between my toes. I was irritated.
