Some boy and I went to see a very special military movie. The movie house was built quite a bit like our gym. The boy told me that the manager had been greatly honored by being given the right to show this movie and had expected to make a mint from it (these were the boy's words). Instead, however, the orchestra that was supposed to play for a special program between shows didn't show up, so he had to play the organ for it. The program consisted of children, dressed in pretty pink and blue costumes, doing complicated march formations. The manager was dressed in a dark blue suit.
