It was still the week before Christmas and that I was supposed to go to the Botanical Gardens to play one more time and it was a Friday. And I had to haul my own keyboard and my own Peavey system and everything. And Mom and Dad were going, and for some reason Carol and Frederick from church were going to help us out and we had some kind of a Santa sleigh that we were going to put out there too. And I can remember just sort of being curled up on the couch and saying, "I don't really feel like going," because in my dream I felt like I wasn't feeling so well and that I just wanted to lay around and not even move. But for some reason I remember packing stuff up in that dream. For some reason I remember the keyboard being in the front yard, like set up, and the truck was parked in the driveway and I was running to put stuff in it, like Dad and I each picked up an end of the keyboard and just sort of slid it into the truck. And then I ran around to trace the cord to the bushes so that I could unplug the W________ and throw it in my bag too and pick up everything up and just there were other things I was packing, like Christmas decorations. And then I remember it was still a week before Christmas and we were going to play something with hand bills in church, and for some reason they wanted me to learn that too. And I remember we were like at a great big place and maybe we were, I had the feeling Frederick was there and I think we were at the Coolidge Hall an he was going to bring like one or two of the other bells, give them to me to take home so I could practice my part. And I remember just thinking, "Gee whiz, how on earth am I ever going to learn another piece before Christmas?" because I had all the anthems and the quartet and my organ part that I just knew sort of by the skin of my teeth. And that was all that I can remember about that.
