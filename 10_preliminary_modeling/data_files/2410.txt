Theresa B and her family had to move. I am with them. We are all sleeping in the same bed. The husband and the children get up and leave and Theresa and I sleep in until 11:00! It feels great. I needed the rest. Then I wake up and yawn and get two cigarettes and light them both up. This is a rare treat, two cigarettes at once. I puff and puff. Theresa won't wake up; she's so sleepy. So even though I meant the cigarettes for her, I get most of them myself. Then Theresa gets up and goes out, leaving the door open. People are out there. I haven't any clothes on. I scramble for my bra and am annoyed at them for looking and at Theresa for leaving the door open. I feel exposed.
