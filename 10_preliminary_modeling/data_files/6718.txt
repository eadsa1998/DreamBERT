I got to the party in my housecoat and nothing else. Told others present that a friend who was coming with me hadn't and then I nearly didn't get there because just after I started, a funeral came out of the church, saw coffin, and we had to back off the road to avoid it. First backing didn't help, at the second, we went around a filling station and down a very narrow alley (like those in China) stone or brick paved. I said, "There certainly are slums in Honolulu."
