I was on a 'holiday' with a male friend of mine, possibly my boyfriend. We had gotten this "adventure" package which meant we could watch a movie I don't remember or The Hills Have Eyes. The other movie had a fat guy in it, and that was the one we were going to watch. We were watching it in the office at home (it was clean), and Dad, Poppa and Nana put a bed in there for me. Nana had not set up the computer monitor, which she mentioned to me. Before, I needed stuff for Biology and I couldn't remember what it was. Austin was on the computer. I went to the Biology site and they had a games competition. Ezra was playing too. Mom was there.
