Ginny, another woman and myself have on long white dresses. We see a marimba band. "Oh good," says Ginny and starts dancing. I start to dance too. We don't care that it is three women in a circle, no guy. But I am a little self-conscious about it. I look out the window and see a wedding going on. The groom comes over to talk with me. As we talk, he sits on an office chair on wheels and I sit on his lap. He hugs me close and we wheel around as we chat. It feels very companionable. I am telling him how people come up to me and say, "So what's wrong with you?" and "What's your condition?" and "Do you have a family?" I use a whiney singsong voice to answer them. Then I hug him and say, "But like for you, a friend, it's OK, I want to share, but not to strangers." Then he says, "Poor Harry Palmer." I say, "I knew him. Yeah, that's sad." I enjoy being with this guy as we wheel around talking.
