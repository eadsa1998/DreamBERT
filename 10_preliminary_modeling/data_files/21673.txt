I was working in Dill's. All at once it was dark and I couldn't see. I felt my way to the switchboard and tried to put on the lights, but they wouldn't go on. I was ducking the watchman Clem for some reason or other, I can't recall now. Ann told me her brother Frank died. Judy had a piece of hair sticking out of her mouth. I got hold of it and pulled it out and when I got thru pulling the hair out, there was a bunch like my fist. I was watching Hilts and Kotnik run some machines. They had big pipes standing upright. I looked up because they would let the pipes fall down for a reloading. A fellow was talking with me. He talked about a girl that said, "It will be $7," and he said, "It's not worth that much."
