I dreamed that my 2 girl cousins, ages 11 and 15, who live in L.A.; my sisters, ages 11 and 17; and I, were standing in an apartment building somewhere in Cleveland ringing my grandparents' door bell. (My grandfather passed away a year ago, and my grandmother lives in Los Angeles.) My grandparents were supposed to take us on a picnic but no one answered the bell. So my cousins, my sisters, and I got on a streetcar and on the streetcar we met our grandparents. My grandfather told us that they had had to leave Cleveland suddenly to go to Los Angeles because my grandmother's sister had died. I remember him saying "Can you imagine that?" and I felt surprised that he had said that because I knew that my grandparents and my grandmother's sister had never gotten along. Then my grandparents began to playfully argue and everyone on the streetcar laughed. I woke up and, when I did, I felt happy and satisfied because I had seen my grandfather so clearly.
