I was talking to Bill C and he told me that Blair K had resigned and I was very surprised and I asked how he can afford to do that when he is so concerned about money. I asked him what he was going to do for an income. Bill C said something about him subletting some property or something, but neither of us knew how he was going to make it on that. We were both surprised and a little mystified how he was going to work things out. There seemed to be some other people around too but I don't know who they were. I said something like, Why is it that I've managed to stay around for five years? The other people kind of laughed and I did too but yet I was serious in asking the question. So many other employees seem to come and go so quickly but I manage to stay around. As much as Bill C and I challenge each other, not intentionally but by our personality differences and differences in how we think, I'm surprised that I stay around by both of our choice.
