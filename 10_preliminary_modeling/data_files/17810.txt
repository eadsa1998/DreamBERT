I was at my maternal Grandma Jane's house, asleep.  I woke up and went into the kitchen and there was a birdcage- with about 5 birds in it.  I wondered about them and thought I must be asleep, but I felt awake.  I started talking to the various birds.  One looked like a large worm, it's rear end looking like a peach.  My brother Stuart came in.  He asked something about our issues, and I told him that I thought I was actually okay; I just wasn't sure if I could trust that he was.
