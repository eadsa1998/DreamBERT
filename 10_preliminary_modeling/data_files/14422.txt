I was with Mom at an underground train station at night. Some water was trickling in and she told me about a similar time with her and Dad. Then we were in the street and the train came past home. The train was just a single, open carriage, like a mine cart and people kept going past. Mom rang this bell, which they said was "in case of a flood". I got given a new timetable for the next trimester. It was lame, as I had some classes starting at 6.35am, and weird and long breaks in between. The times were all weird, like 9.08am, and 12.05pm etc. I got on the train and I was daydreaming. At 'Kelmscott' I realized I was miles away. I called Mom to get me and she started rambling and I told her to shut up. I got out and it looked like Northlands. There was a pet shop and there was a cute dog in there on the floor. There were more in cages.
