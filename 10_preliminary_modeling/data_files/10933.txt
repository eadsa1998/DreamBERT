I was in a long corridor with many other girls of my own age. Then other girls came filing in with papers in their hands. They had just graduated and the papers were their diplomas. I saw one of my friends who is a senior come in. I went over to her and congratulated her. I was emotionally wrought; tears filled my eyes. My friend accepted my best wishes and then walked away from me; she went to her locker. I followed her. She paid no attention to me. I kept asking her questions, but her answers were short and abrupt. She left and went down a stairway; I tried to follow her, but I found I had taken the wrong stairway.
