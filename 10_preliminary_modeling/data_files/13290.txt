I was at a house. The whole Arrested Development family was there. Gob was upset because he found out that he had a daughter. Someone had twin boys. There was a boat in a pool. I wanted to hang with George-Michael, so I went into the lounge (where he and Maeby were) and said that I couldn't sleep. It was only 6pm. The TV said it was midnight. My Name is Earl was on and Jason Lee was doing something. Maeby asked about some guitar show.
