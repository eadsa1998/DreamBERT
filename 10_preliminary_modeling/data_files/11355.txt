I'm watching the ocean with a friend (male). I trip and fall down a sandy slope, but manage to hold on a projection (a remnant of a dead tree sticking out), so that I don't fall into the water. I think of the cold water below me and the possibility of my falling into the cold water while clambering up the sandy slopes. I feel that even if I did fall into the water I would swim but at the same time I consider the possibility of freezing in the water. However, I get safely to the top with the help of my friend.
