I was cleaning my friend's camper in my yard. All of a sudden it started rolling backwards. I got inside but could not push down on the brake pedal. The camper finally hit the fence and stopped rolling. It all of a sudden became nighttime and I was still in my yard but now with my dog. A raccoon ran by and I happened to kick it. It came after me. My dog started fighting with the raccoon and it ended up the raccoon killed my dog. I was bumming out and telling my friends what happene. Then I woke up and went and checked on my dog.
