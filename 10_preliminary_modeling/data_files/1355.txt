Co-worker Jerome is giving orders to Veronica about a secret book called Tripoli, or something like that. I go into the room to find out more about what is going on. Rich Freund won't let me see the book, he implies there isn't any. I ask Diane about it. I say if you don't tell me, you could get busted to janitor. She sneers and says, "You say that like it's an insult." I say, "It's the same if I was busted to classified." Then I decide I have to find the book and turn it in. I think Jerome has taken over the C. dept and is making judgements about people based on what's in that book. I snatch it and run for Pedro's office. Jerome and Rich follow me, very nervous. Jerome says, "You haven't got anything on me. I haven't signed anything." I say, "You wanta bet?" He's wary and surprised. Then I open the book and explain it to the audience. It's an innocuous book with little articles and cartoons. The damning pages are the horoscope pages. People have different colored symbols and they look up their meaning. Important decisions about people's lives are being made on those silly things. Someone's day is a green 8. They have a candle, an angel's smiling face, etc.
