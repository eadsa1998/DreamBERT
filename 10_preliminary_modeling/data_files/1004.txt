I'm back in history. The knights in shining armor. I'm an outsider and I'm being chased by the palace guards. The Queen mother wants me dead because her son likes me. I'm running up some stairs, and a herd of guards are after me. I run into a cell-like room and I'm trapped. Seconds before they find me, I hide up on a beam near the ceiling. They look for me and then assume I fell to my death as it's a tower room. The Queen is there. Now I hide and peek and sneak around so they don't find me. I hear voices and run down a flight of stairs. Then I hear more voices coming up the stairs. I hide in a cupboard. It's the changing of the guard and a group of soldiers are coming by me. The officer in charge looks into the cupboard but they don't see me. Then I listen to their instructions of who will guard what so I'll know where not to be. There are 2 guards at each of the 2 doors on the top, or the 4th floor. 2 guards at each end of the 4 doors on the 3rd floor, etc. They leave. Then I see a gaggle of young women. One of them is going to be engaged to the prince. The Queen mother has chosen her. She's unhappy because she's sure he doesn't love her. He still is forlorn because he loves me. Then there's an engagement party. Her parents, a King and Queen come. The King wears a black toga with a red scarf or roses on it. She has an ornate head dress, like the one in Alice in Wonderland. The King is plump and annoyed. He doesn't want the match. Then I see a picture of black men in Africa. I think, "Oh that's another story in this book," (I see a book). I hear a narration. The picture is a ragged line of black men, one has only one leg. They are in the fields and are shooting rifles. "They don't know it but they are encountering Jedi warriors," the narration goes. "It's the first battle of the war." I see them freeze-frame and they are all dying, like a firing squad line. One turns a backward somersault from the force of the impact of all the bullets.
