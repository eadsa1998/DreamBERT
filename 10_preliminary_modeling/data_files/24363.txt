There is a causeway made from gray bricks leading across a body of water. I can't see far off the edges. It is perhaps foggy. There is fauna on the banks along this causeway. The banks are muddy and there are a few trees. But it's not the most pleasant kind. There are many snakes. I am curious by them, but there are so many, it's unnerving, especially with so many under just one tree that I fell down underneath. I got up quickly, in case any were poisonous. One of them caught my eye. I couldn't believe it, because it looked like a blue-clouded python. There is no such thing as a clouded python, but there are clouded boas and clouded leopards, both exceedingly rare. The point was, I found a bluish snake that I knew was rare and a good find. I was worried the python would eat the lizards I had collected, which were lined up near the end of the causeway. Someone knocked them over and they all went running away.
