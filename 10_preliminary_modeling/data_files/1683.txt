I am laying on a couch with a baby. A man sits across the room watching. I am trying to persuade the baby to scoot closer and cuddle to go to sleep. I am a little awkward. I see a room full of books. I talk about a Christmas dinner and how the kind I am used to seems the right kind. Imagine! Other people eat things like sauerkraut and think that's normal.
