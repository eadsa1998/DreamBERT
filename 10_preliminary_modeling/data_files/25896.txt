 I yell at someone harshly. I tell them exactly what I think and feel, what I care about, what matters to me, and what is important. The scene may be at Jefferson School in Oak Valley where people are eating lunch. I'm afraid they'll discover that I've eating there already. The mean lunch lady is there: the tall woman with red/brown hair. She is stern, and like a witch. I hate her.
