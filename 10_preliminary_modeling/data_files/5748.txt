[1997-06-02] We were on a trip somewhere, had been down south and were on our way back and somehow we stopped at a rest area and I ended up talking to somebody on the phone for a long time that we had met earlier on our trip in another state I think, it might have been Ohio, I don't know what state we were in at this rest stop but I remember thinking that I had to get off the phone and use the bathroom and get a Coke so I told the person I had to go and would talk to him another time.
