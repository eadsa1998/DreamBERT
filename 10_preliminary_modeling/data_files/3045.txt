I am at a reunion and I see Darryl. He stands near me and I can feel the same sweet sexual excitement I felt around him. He and I talk, sort of aware of the feelings but not acting on them. He then begins to kiss me and I like it very much and start to want more. I am walking and holding his arm like he is a gallant escort. He sees a friend of his and hesitates to introduce us. Perhaps he is remembering my disability and is embarrassed, but he does introduce us. The man isn't very warm. Then Darryl and I sit in a manual wheelchair. I am semi laying down in the chair and he is on top of me, kissing. I say, "We can write for awhile, but then maybe I can come to you in Texas or you can return here to me." We really want to make love now.
