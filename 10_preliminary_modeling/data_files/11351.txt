I knew that some horrible catastrophe was going to happen. There was an air of doom. I remember running up a street screaming and moaning that the world was going to end. I looked up in the sky and saw a meteor or comet coming closer and closer. I ran into a garage and lay on the floor of the garage. There was a mechanic and 2 or 3 other men there. I yelled at them that the end was here but they only said we know, we know and did nothing. They seemed very blase.
