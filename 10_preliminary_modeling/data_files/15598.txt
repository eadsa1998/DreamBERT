I was out with Ezra. There was a lecture on that I went to attend. It was packed inside and we had to go to the opposite side of the room for a seat. The seats were labelled like 'boring and nice' and I went with a boring one on a row by itself. I forgot to bring paper, so I went down to get my bag. A guy sat in my seat as a joke, but I said I'd just go to the row behind it. They showed 4 different scenarios and you had to pick which one was true. There was one about The Sims. I was bored. I went online and there was some lady obsessed with Christian Bale. I think she was Asian. She was married, but also liked women? She hadn't updated her profile in over a year.
