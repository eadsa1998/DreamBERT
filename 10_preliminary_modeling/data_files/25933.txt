 I'm doing a tow with my friend Jasper Parsons on the Dirty River in Oak Valley. We need to move the two boats from by the Railroad Company train area to the portion of the river behind the Boy Scout Building. We can't drive or pull the boats through the water to go from the train area to the river, though there is a small swampy waterway. It is not big enough. I have both boats loaded onto one trailer, side by side. I look for a spot to land them. The pond in Hill Park is a possibility, I think, if we drive the boats through the storm drainage pipes. I see the pipes are full of water, and there would be no room for a boat. Our boss Mike tells us we need to pick up a different party of customers. We need to do one job after another, and will be a time crunch: we'll be late for the second party. I can't find a spot to land the double trailer. The sandy area right next to the river by the Boy Scout building is too steep to use a double trailer. There is another landing we'll have to use. It is back past Big Rock and connects to the main river via that swampy area. It is a nice, big, open paved landing. It is just a bit out of our way, but we'll have to take the time to do it. I eat all six rolls. Jasper asks me if there are any rolls: he wants some. I apologize, and say I ate them all. My boss Phoebe Mills threatens her partner Mike Hollow. There is a moving man with a wife-beater under his work shirt. He is young, tan, and strong. Phoebe says she's going home and she'll make love to the moving man. The moving man was just there. There is a line of food, like a buffet. My brother Wally is there and others I know. I get some food for Jasper since I ate all the rolls, and some for myself.
