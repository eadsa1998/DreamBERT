Part of this was me trying to explain to someone that I needed a cool-air humidifier for my throat and that all I have is a hot-air humidifier. There was also something about going to a furniture store. It always related to trying to explain to someone that I needed a cool-mist humidifier rather than a warm-mist humidifier and trying to figure out how to get one.
