I was standing in an open field or perhaps a large paved parking area, near an airport.  Two aircraft were visible in the air-one was a large jet, approaching the airport for a landing: the other looked like a dirigible.  The latter was too far away to be distinct, but it really wasn't that far.  The jet appeared to be on a collision course with the dirigible, which was motionless, but it was fairly obvious that this was an optical illusion because they were simply in my line of sight but the dirigible was farther away.  One or the other began descending rapidly -- too rapidly and at too steep an angle, it seemed to me -- toward the airport.  I was aghast, because I was sure it was going to crash and explode before my very eyes.  (Actually there were buildings of some sort blocking my direct view of the runway.)  To my surprise, however, the plane was built at such an angle that although the rear half was at a sharp angle with the ground, the front half was almost parallel to it-sort of like some helicopters are designed.  So it didn't crash.  It was carrying a load of VWs, though, and when the plane emerged to the right of the buildings which had blocked my view of it, the wind had caught the VWs and they were flying in the air and bouncing frighteningly on the runway.  Some were already bashed up beyond recognition.  It was a sickening sight.
