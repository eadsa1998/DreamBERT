A few fragments of a dream as follows: A certain man married a girl in New York City. Shortly after they moved to Utah where they became wealthy. He traveled a great deal, ostensibly on business, but there was at least a suspicion that he ran after women most of the time. Later, he took his wife on trips, treated her with all respect, pointed out interesting features in the landscape, etc. His wife was greatly impressed by one view -- looking out for many miles over a valley. someone (probably the man) wrote and published a peculiar piece of literature, the first half of which was in poetry, the last half in prose. In it the expression "little hell" was coined. The above, and a great many other, data were contained in a letter written by this man, and I was reading from the letter to Anderson and someone else.
