I got two little green worms as pets. We kept calling them slugs though. They were really tiny. I had had one for a bit longer. The new one was called Alexander. I went to Mom to ask her what I should feed it, but it complained so I asked her to do it. I went back and almost fell on the floor and there were more slugs. They were trying to eat Rover. Mom and Ezra left to go somewhere and I was like 'what about the slugs?' but they were like 'meh'. Then we were parked on the side of the road with the door open. These guys drove past and Ezra said some 4chan thing and they threw a dark green slushy out the window and went on the car. This teacher told me to clean it with this other person. I had to a project for 'school' and I had to collect materials but I couldn't go. Finn and Rachel (both from Glee) asked to do it and Rachel offered to get the materials but she was organizing to clean the car. She had only joined to spend time with Finn. He had a girlfriend who wasn't happy about it. I was on a train at some point and I was singing Should've Known Better.
