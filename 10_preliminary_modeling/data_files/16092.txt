I was going to have to go to Southwest High School this coming school year. I dreamt that I had Tweety on my shoulder while I was walking around this hallway with white floors, and that we were going to have to go to the Guidance Counselor's office to get my schedule, but the Guidance Office wouldn't be open for the next three days until the coming Monday, which would mean that I would have to wander around until the office was open. Everybody else was wandering too, and these boys really liked Tweety and all of a sudden she turned into a gray pigeon. And then I woke up.
