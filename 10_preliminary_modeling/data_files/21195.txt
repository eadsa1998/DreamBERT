We fell asleep, Ray, Wiatrak and I, in the bowling alley. I heard something come into the room. It was dark and night. I got outside and I waited for Ray and Wiatrak to come out and they were still in there, so I opened the door and yelled in for them, but there was no answer. I started for home. I flew along in the pitch dark. I couldn't see. Then I could make out the path and I flew low along it. The moon came out and we had a moon night. I came near Pleasant Valley Road and ridge. I tried to fly again, but couldn't take off. Then Ann was with me and a couple brought a couple of pillows for us. I floated down slowly on the pillow. I was working in the dairy. We were going to take out a big pipeline and the water was draining out into the ditch. So we got a pump and were going to hook it up to drain the water out of the ditch.
