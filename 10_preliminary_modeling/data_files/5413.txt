I had the worst dream last night. First it started out OK: Aaron and I were fooling around somewhere, and I was really happy and excited. Then I went home and in the guest room was my brother and Lauren. They had been playing some game with a baby, but they accidentally dropped her when I came in. The baby started bleeding everywhere and it was really scary. I was trying to keep her alive with ice and by holding her upright, and my brother and Lauren were really scared. The baby was OK, so I went downstairs to the kitchen to hang out with Judith and my father before prom. I was really happy because Aaron was taking me. So then right before I was about to leave, I asked where my mother was so I could say goodbye to her. My brother looked at me very pityingly and said that our mother had died last night. I laughed because I thought he was joking but he was serious and I demanded why no one had told me. He said because there hadn't been a good time. I started crying so hard and was hugging Aaron really tightly. He kept saying, "I'm really sorry, but if it came down to your mother or your sister, aren't you glad your sister's alive?" I guess he was referring to the baby who was OK after all the bleeding. All I could think was, She's not my sister! It was horrible.
