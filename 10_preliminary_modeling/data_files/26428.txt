 I'm in my room at the Whitman House. My sister Ramona says I should pray more. I go to pray in my room. I pray and worship my three higher powers: mother earth, father above, and brothers and sisters that are plants and animals around me. This is my trinity. Ramona knocks on my door and enters my room. I stop praying. She is playing a Bare Naked Ladies CD in her room, which is next door, but seems to be at home. She hands me the CD case and I look at it.
