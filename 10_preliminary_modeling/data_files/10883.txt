I dreamed that I was walking out of the rear entrance of the hospital with two friends. Both are girls and one is 27 years old, and the other is 19. I was carrying a typewriter and we were going to my car, which was in the parking lot. We were walking around the lot and we couldn't find my car. Suddenly one of the girls called and said that my car was over where she was. I went over there and the two of them were in a car which was not mine. It had a New York State license on it, but it was not my car. I told them that it wasn't mine, and they got out. A teacher who I had for English in high school passed by and said that if I was looking for my car, it was on the other side of the lot. This teacher was a female and about 35 years old. I thanked her and we went over to that side of the lot and there was my car.
