I went into a light trance.  I wanted to feel the presence of Risk, she feels so far away.  I saw a glowing orange red circle of light, not very bright.  I spoke to Risk, my sweet baby girl.  I miss her and told her and reached out to her with my hands.  As she started to fade, I needed to know if she made it to the light, is she living in the light of love.  The light got brighter, white, bigger, like a sunrise.
