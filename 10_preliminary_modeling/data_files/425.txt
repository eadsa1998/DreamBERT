This dream took place in the water. Two sisters wanted to be mermaids. So they turned into mermaids, but one of the sisters really wanted to have her sister's legs, so she took them. She returned them to their rightful owner after she was done using them. One of my sorority sisters whom I haven't seen in a while was also in my dream. She was telling me she was going to school in another state, and I told her that I had family there. I felt uncomfortable talking to her and I could sense tension between us. We had been taking care of some babies as we were talking and I felt like she didn't like me, or had something against me.
