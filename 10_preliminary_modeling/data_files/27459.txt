I dreamed that I was very anxious to buy a ticket to a certain theatrical production which was being presented. However, after standing in line for a long while I discovered I had no money with me and I was quite distressed about it. One of my friends refused to lend me the money, but another girl whom I knew who was also in line, offered to get the ticket for me. I remember specifically asking her to get tickets in section 999.
