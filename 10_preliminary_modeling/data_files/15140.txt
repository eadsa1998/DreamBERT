I went to some guy's place and I went to play Terms of Endearment, but it wasn't actually the film. Jack Nicholson was in it though. Mom watched it too and said it was lame. Then I was in a place and a well-known guy had had a heart attack or something. His family turned up. Then there was a party. They got me to guard the door. Later, there were some big flashlights. I told a lady to get rid of all the non-family guests. I wrote a news report on his death. I heard from a friend that they fired me and they wanted details for the story and I said I couldn't do it. Later, Mom, Ezra and I went to a petrol station. We locked our doors. Mom came back and opened her door and said 'this is a very dangerous neighbourhood', then a dude with a gun ran around to Ezra's side and showed it to Mom. We closed the door and put the car into reverse and I was terrified. Then I woke up and I was still scared.
