I am a Chinese empress and my counterpart is having an official formal dance. I am concerned that she might be my enemy. I go to her and hold out my hands that she may kiss them. We talk to each other in an elaborate, formal ritual. I say, "Do you meet today with good intent?" She kissed my hand and bows her head and says, "Oh, honorable queen, I am at your service." Those aren't the words, but that style is right. I feel relieved that she is still loyal. I watch the women dancers. They are modern women wearing black modern shoes and black pants and shirts, but over the black outfit is a red sparkly net material, like in India. They are lined up and dance in unison.
