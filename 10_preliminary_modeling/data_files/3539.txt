I am seated on a stone staircase in a huge palace. It is near the bottom stair. Derek and another woman are tickling and giggling over in a corner. I am smiling and feeling good about being who I am and not jealous or bothered by their play. Now I get up and walk back unexpectedly into my bedroom. I find Derek and the woman there making love in the bed, only I don't really see the woman, just Derek, fully clothed lying sideways on my single bed. I am furious and tell him off and spin on my heel to leave. He says, "No, please. Stay and talk with me." I laugh angrily and walk out. I want to walk off my anger by going as fast as I can up the staircase until I have gone as far and as high as I can go in this stone palace. I walk and walk until there is a huge stone wall or boulder stopping me. I peek in a crevasse or crack and can't see anything. Then there is an earthquake and everything around me falls until I am alone on a high, thin sliver of rock left from the palace. Then the scene shifts and the earthquake didn't happen and I am on the stairs and decide to retrace my steps down. A guard finds me and he's going to show me the way out, only now he takes me to the sultan's private quarters. I am impressed. I see women and one has a baby and she lets me hold it. While I am holding it, it relaxes and takes a nap. The sultan is near and I'm not sure if it's him or not, but bow and say, "Your highness," just in case. He and his wife are introduced to me. He kisses my hand and I see his fat, double-chinned face and his fat lips. He kisses me several times. He seems to like me. I go back to where the women are and return the sleeping baby and follow the guard out, only to find myself suddenly led into the harem and I realize I've been tricked. He intends to keep me forever.
