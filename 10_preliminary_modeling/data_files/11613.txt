I was standing in a room facing the front of the room. Before me were four large small-paned windows. On the wall between the first and second windows, just below where the wall met with the slanted roof was a pipe similar to a clothes rack. Also before the first two windows where the floor met the wall was a depression in the flooring about nine feet long, six inches deep and five inches wide. All my interests were focussed on why there was a depression in the floor while around me people spoke in English accent about an accident that happened in that very room.
