 I'm driving a semi truck. I pull up at the Roller Derby Rink, outside of Wilmerton, behind four semi trucks. It is like being at a skating party for Carter School. My friend Stephen Ramos and I walk in. We walk by our classmate Ryan Pug, from Brimson. The building is all wooden and rustic. We go into the roller skate rental area. There are little kids there. Stephen gets a pair of skates. They are small: size three, I think. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. I look at him with contempt for who he is and what he does. My high school friend Nate Nelling is there, and has a goatee. I have a bag with some cheeseburgers in it. I give a lady $2.00. I think I'll have to pay her about $5 more for skating. I sit in a booth with no shirt on. I am wearing sunglasses and a hat.
