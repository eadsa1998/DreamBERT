I was at home but it was a bit different. There was a dog door on the front door. Rover kept running out. Ezra and Fug were there. This other Labrador ran over to the house and I let Rover in and then shut the door. This lady from across the road came and got the dog and asked "which one's your dog?" and I said "Rover, a Lab". Spaceman was near the other dog. She asked how big Rover was.  There was a movie called Silimidia, but I got confused and thought it was Suspiria. When I pressed two fingers on my arm, hard, they would 'merge' and turn into a tongue and one started coming out of my arm. I said "Do you know how hard it is to lick yourself?" Then I laughed and shook my head [at the double meaning]. Fug put her hand on Ezra's arm and everyone was like 'aw'. Later I went to university. There were lots of others in the class. It was a class with labs and we all had different numbers. The teacher guy was calling out names and said "Izzy" and I said "yes" and then he said "Izzy Conell" and I said "oh... yes". The other Izzy was 'Connor'. Elijah was there and was sitting next to me. The teacher called me outside. I had to draw/colour something. This teacher/guy came in and the teacher said he was in the wrong place and he left and everyone laughed.
