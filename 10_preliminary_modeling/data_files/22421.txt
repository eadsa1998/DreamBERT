The dream is about a party I had last night. I remember I was at the party with a classmate. I saw him, a boy of 17 years, and his cousin, 19 years, who always danced with me. I also saw the boy's house just as it really is. A hallway which is at the entrance was dark and I think the walls were painted green and the floor in red. There I was with my classmate's cousin. In the dream I was very happy, really having fun. I also saw myself dancing with all the boys who were attending the party. I saw my classmates who went to the party. They were playing fast music and the atmosphere was very gay; everybody seemed very happy.
