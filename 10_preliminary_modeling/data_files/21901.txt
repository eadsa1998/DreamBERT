I was buying another car and mine was getting the upholstery repaired or repaired also the body work was going to be done. I was selling the car for $250 and Bob got it. He said the man wanted to buy it for $500. I went out to see the fellow and he said, "I'll give you $500 for your car," and I made off. I was not interested in the price, but then I said, "Oh, alright, I will take it." While I was getting the bill of sales for a signature, he had the $500 on a pile. I was following a fellow on a road. He was outside the car. He would give it a little push, then let it get in front of him and gradually it slowed up and he caught up with it. He did this several times till he hit a downgrade in the road and the car got away from him and ran down the hill without a driver. He stood there in a daze. The car caused $150,000 damage to other cars. I was looking at the entries and there was a new system or the names of horses were puzzling. You turned a dial and names would come up. I can't recall any of the names now. It was one track that had this system. Mrs. Durdall was familiar with this system and she played it. It had bright colors on its dialing face.
