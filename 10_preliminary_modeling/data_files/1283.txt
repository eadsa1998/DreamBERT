I have a 3rd grade class. We have taken out records, music and books from the library and are looking at them. It's a bit chaotic but manageable. I receive a gift from my brother Jake. It's a small record player. The tag says, "Rather than give the money to him, I'd rather give this to you." I think he meant tax money to the government. We are playing rectangular records. The kid helping me doesn't get it quite right. Time's up for class. They all straighten their desks and quiet down. They have big poster books open to a page of alligators. I shush them and then tell them I'm very happy, thrilled, and excited about their good behavior. I dismiss them.
