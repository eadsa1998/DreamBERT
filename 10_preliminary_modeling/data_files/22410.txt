I had gone on a bus with two passengers. It was a number 42 bus. I saw the color of the bus, which was blue. I had several shoes with me which weren't mine, which I was going to deliver. Then I was crying along the way. Then I saw some sand hills and some land which wasn't producing. Then I came back and found some streets which looked like a housing development area. I found a woman and gave the shoes to her. Then I went back and awoke.
