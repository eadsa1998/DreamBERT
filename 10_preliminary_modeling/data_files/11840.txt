I was at this house and there was this lady who always died at the same time everyday. I went there and the first one died and the girl came out and stood on the train tracks and I grabbed her and pulled her away and then she got trampled by a horse. I was in a car and we were driving to the girl's house and there lots of weeds and stuff.
