 I'm at home. I'm having a party. Nat Miller is bringing over a case of beer sometime, and Nate Nelling is stopping over. There are people looking for me who want money. I'm afraid they'll rob me. Nate's car pulls up in back of the house. He comes in through the garage. I go out the garage door into the garage with a hammer to make sure there is no one lurking there waiting to get in. Nate and I go back inside. There is a car out in front of the house. I think it's the people who are coming to get me. I get down, and tell Nate to do the same. We crawl into the kitchen. Nat and his friend enter through the back door, his friend comes in first. I grab his friend by the neck and slam him down on the floor. It is the kid from my Astronomy class with blond hair. I recognize him, but Nat says that this is his friend Jaime. Nat follows his friend in with a case of beer in bottles. I overreacted. I was protecting myself.
