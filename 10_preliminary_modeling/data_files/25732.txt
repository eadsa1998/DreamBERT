 I'm at a party. Flavored joints of marijuana are being passed around. There is a lot of beer and liquor being drank. My classmate Shelly Mac is spilling her drink. My friend Yvette Ullman is on my back, clinging to me for a piggyback ride. She has hairy legs. We're in a room. She talks about her thighs: she is dissatisfied with them. She says they're not okay. I tell her that her thighs are okay: I don't want to dwell on that topic. I count my money. I have more than I should have gotten. Yvette tells me not to count it on her thighs.
