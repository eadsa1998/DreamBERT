I am off in some arctic wasteland and it is dark. There are men out there and I hide from them. I try to see where I am going and I march in the snow and ice and nearly go over the edge of an abyss. My partner on the trek stops me just in time, by accident really, not aware we are on the brink of sliding off the edge and down a huge fall to a meandering river. The staff I use to walk with nearly goes through the snow at the cliff's edge. I back up, still unaware and find a tent. We decide to stay in it, but first I use a flashlight to look out and over the river far down below. I use the arc of the light to show where I think the bad guys are. I see a snow bar across the river, a waterfall and so on. My partner gets worried and insists I turn the light off because it will lead the bad guys right to us. I am oblivious to danger and we go into the tent. Soon the men are around the outside and we must defend ourselves. The big man has a leather glove on his hand and a long whip, and he is outside the tent whipping around trying to find us in the dark in the tent. I finally, like a bantam rooster, grab the whip and pull on it until I've wrestled it out of his hand, glove and all. Now I am whipping at him fast and competently. He's rather amazed. I go outside and continue whipping. A small "robin bird" goes in and someone says, "Stop him, he'll get hurt."
