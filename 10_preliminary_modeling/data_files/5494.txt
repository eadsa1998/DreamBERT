Last night I dreamed that F and his wife L visited me on their way up to [a veteran's hospital] F is going to speak at the BVA meeting (blind veterans association). And he said, "come out into the hall", and here were cases and boxes of paper towels and toilet tissue, a piece of heavy, heavy metal which looked like an old fashioned wringer that would fit on a washing machine, and it had a separate motor on it and for some reason I was just delighted to see that and we were actually out in the hall of this building, the corridor, whatever and he helped me carry in the cases of paper goods, I don't know what L was doing. We came in and she was getting something out of a cupboard. She was wearing a bright red dress, and she has very short, very black hair and very trim, neat little figure and this bright red dress just enhanced her looks and all of a sudden a great big dog came around the corner and F said "oh, I brought my dog" and the dog came up to me and rubbed against me and I said to it "oh I bet you're hungry, I bet you haven't been fed". I had a can of dog food in the refrigerator, opened, with part of it taken out, I have no idea where that came from because I don't have a dog. I can remember saying to them, that I'm really not much of an animal lover, but this is a beautiful dog. I turned around and we chatted and I made plans to go up to the VA hospital, and I asked if we could stop and eat breakfast along the way and the answer was a very solid "No, we won't have time" and I was bitterly disappointed.
