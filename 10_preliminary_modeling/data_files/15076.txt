There was an online activity up on the University site. I had to put an 'option' subject but they were all lame. I went to University. I parked in an underground carpark which was creepy and there was an elevator like the elevators in Super Mario. This teacher guy read out the new subjects. The ones on at good times were mostly taken. There used to be a Beatles one. Most of them were physical. Dexter's (Dexter) boss or something was called Principal Banshee (and was the principal from Glee). Dexter was in a carpark and he turned and saw something and screamed like a girl. Debra (Dexter) and someone saw and he pretended he was going crazy. I was thinking that I didn't pick up on the 'banshee' reference before. I went to class and realized that I hadn't re-straightened my hair. Then I had a boyfriend and we had a room there. We were in bed making out, he was on top, and then we had sex. Then I was at Nana's. I was trying to find my way to the carpark. I went around the back and there was a big hole and I felt like I was going to fall. They were putting a deep pond in. Poppa and others were working on it. Nana helped me around. I went around to the front of the house. Fido was there with a big snake. It snipped at us and Nana told it off. There were more snakes and she was trying to get rid of them and I went to go back and Darren and Ezra were there and in the way. Then I was watching Dollhouse, which was different. I remember Boyd. There was a face on a logo with something in the mouth -- "a bird" and she had big blue eyes. There was a dead bird which didn't have a disease in its leg, whereas most did. Then I was back at Nana's. I watched Firefly bloopers. Zoe and someone were on a webcam and a 'trial version' came up. Wash was on the other end. The internet was slow where they were supposed to be -- "frozen in space". Zoe touched the screen, but she pressed too hard.
