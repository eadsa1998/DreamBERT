I saw it seemed like harmony hope $45. This horse won the last time and paid $164. Carl Fisher was resetting the die. Someone came up and reset 2-vi-32 scres together and ran the diehead over this and it lined the chasers. I was driving or walking over the highway and it was hilly. Carl and I were working in a different dept. I was looking for a card or ticket to write my time on. There was water on the streets flooding and washing things down. I got a shovel and had some water released that was dammed up. There were things floating down the street from stores that had articles on display outside. I saw a pair of high boots in the water flooded in front of a store.
