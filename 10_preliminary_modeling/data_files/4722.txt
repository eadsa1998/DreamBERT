["Show me my capableness."] I seem to be in a coma and my male friend puts me in a car and says I'm going to show you the greatness you were. I am in pain but I know this will be worth it and helpful. He drives me to a place beside the road where another me is playing a sport. I am hitting a ball or doing something really well. In the past, I was really good at what I did.
