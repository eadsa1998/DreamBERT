I was in H. Fellow I know left an elaborate set of drums sitting there. I went over and sat down. The drums were against the wall - so I turned my back on everyone &amp; began to play. I am absolutely ignorant of drum playing technique. I tried each drum and then I just hit them in a rhythm which was good. I leaned back, satisfied, and reaching for a cigarette - got the pipe which I saw "owner of the drums" smoking yesterday. I took a drag, not realizing; it tasted good. Friend of "owner of drums" - stranger - appeared. He liked the way I played the drums. We had conversation which seemed quite clever, but slips my mind. He could play the drums &amp; showed me how.
