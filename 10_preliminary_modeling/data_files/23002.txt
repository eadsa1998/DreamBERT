Wayne and Joyce were in town, with a car.  They were getting ready to go back to New York, and suggested that I go with them.  Somehow, my wife Bonita was already there.  I wanted very much to ride up with them, but didn't know how we would get back without a car.  (I didn't want to drive mine up; that would defeat the purpose of riding with them.)  Besides, I had my statistics class, and possibly that trip to another university coming up, so I finally declined.  I took me a while to make up my mind, though, and Wayne was getting a little impatient.
