A girl and her little baby named Jo (I unconsciously wrote that spelling when I recorded the dream that night. Sex of Jo never came up again). came to swim where I was sunbathing. It was on a large rock in a lake in Canada. (I spent my vacation at such a place). Girl said she would take me to R. (I want to go there - to see a girl who "jilted" one of my best friends). Girl told me about mauve, long spined animal who might try to eat us if it saw us bathing there. I was amused. They (Girl &amp; Jo) were terrified when it appeared and slid under a ledge. THIS CONTINUES IN MY NEXT SHEET--THEY AREN'T THE SAME DREAM, QUITE--YET THEY'RE CONNECTED.
