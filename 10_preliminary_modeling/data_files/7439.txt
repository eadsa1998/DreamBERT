It seemed there is a woman in our kitchen. (I'm sure it isn't Mary, but I wonder). She is standing by the portable dishwasher, which is connected to the sink by a hose. Suddenly the lights go out. There are several light fixtures in the kitchen. One is on the wall over the sink, another is on the opposite wall, and there are others elsewhere in the room. They are in the style of old-time lanterns and some look like candles. I am frightened by the lights flickering on and off, but don't know why this frightens me. When the lights are on, they give off only a dim light. A small child is running about (in what appears to be our apartment). I am lying in bed (sleeping?) but unable to move. I am completely immobilized.
