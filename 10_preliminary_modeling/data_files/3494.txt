I am at a cabin at the ocean on the front porch. I see a mother cat and her baby kittens, white and black, sort of spotted, striped. I sit and hold one kitten and cuddle it. It is very sweet and cute. Derek wheels out. He's a bit pudgy in the middle, sort of a comfortable teddy bear kind of guy, and I put my head in his lap and we are very happy, sitting together playing with the kitten. It is soft and comfortable. Then it is time to go, to move on, and we go inside to clean up before we leave. The floor is a mess: dust balls, dirt, lots of stuff. I am sweeping with a broom. Derek is trying to clean the floor also. The landlord comes in and is annoyed and gruff, saying we haven't cleaned it all up yet. I am angry at him and we have words. The dream sort of fades out at this point.
