I was driving a car following a fraternity brother of mine who was driving a yellow Pontiac convertible (actually his). We were on a dirt road. We came to a stop street. He went through. I was going to go through it too but suddenly got frightened and stopped. Just then a police car went by (an old Ford with Police written in gold on it). I thought to myself that Paul C. (friend's name) would get arrested. I followed. We were on a very wide highway. It was night, and way up ahead it was very shadowy. I saw the police car go on the right of my friend, and I had a premonition of a wreck, and just then I heard a crash. I then saw my friend's car back out of the middle.
