I dreamt that it was my mother's birthday, but my friends were coming. I was in my room and hadn't realized that they had arrived, and my maid let me know. I opened the window and saw Artie's car which was leaving, and I called after him. Behind him was Michael, whom I also called, and he didn't return. At that moment the bell rang and two friends of my mother's (unfamiliar to me) came in. They gave her two gifts and she happily received them. The bell rang again and it was Joe. I went to meet him, but when I greeted him, he looked like Martie and was Joe's size. I kissed him on the cheek and he gave me a gift. We went into the house and my mother and her friends weren't there any more. My dream ended then.
