["Gay man thinks I am a lesbian."] I played a lesbian character in a play. After the show, a gay man comes up to me cheerfully telling me that he knows where a lesbian is and do I want her phone number. I am surprised and say What?? I realize he thinks I am gay because of the part I played. He quickly realizes his mistake and says, continuing the conversation, that he saw two gay men on the corner and he'll go over and chat with them. I smile at him and wave as he quickly leaves, embarrassed about his mistake.
