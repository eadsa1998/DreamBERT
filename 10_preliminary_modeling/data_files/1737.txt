I got into a fight with another woman. I was mean and wanted to hurt her. I had to go get something downstairs. I had to slide down a steep gravely path. Bonnie said, "I'll help you," and reached up with her hand to steady me. I then noticed there were stairs and I could do it myself. I got on an elevator and wanted to go to the 3rd floor. I couldn't seem to find the right button. The elevator door wouldn't close, so I could watch the floors go by. I finally asked a woman to find #3. I didn't have my glasses on.
