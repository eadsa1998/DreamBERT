I was sitting in the dorm room/home of some people who were comforting a girl who'd had boy problems; she was a friend of mine. Her boyfriend, she, and I and two middle-aged fat women were there. She was being counseled by them about her problems with him. The problems were bad; he had hurt her very badly. While she was being counseled, I sat with her boyfriend and he told me his side of the story in the same room as others. He seemed very pitiful. He was tall and blonde. He got very physically close to me, as if he were hitting on me. During the dream we were entangled around each other with his girlfriend/my friend right next to us. I can't remember why I didn't tell him to stop. At the end of his girlfriend's session, he had his arms around me and his lips were just touching my breast. After my friend left, the two counselors reprimanded him and me by ridiculing us. One of the counselors made a sucking noise in reference to our position. I told her to "Please don't. Stop. That's embarrassing." The scene then switched to a party atmosphere, where, with tears in my eyes, I said goodbye to him (he remained expressionless); to the mean counselor, who seemed to lighten up when I said I was leaving as if she wanted me to stay; and to my friend who was upset that I was leaving, but no one tried to stop me.
