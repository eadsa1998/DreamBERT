I am at a house I haven't been to before, but am working. There is an old professor of mine there, or an old man with some clout in my life. He is influential. He asks for my help to get away from this place. I help him out. He gives me a guidebook. I ask him how he manages his condition. He has a medical condition of some kind. He shows me a bag of weed. I laugh.
