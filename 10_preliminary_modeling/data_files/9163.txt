Pack of horses moving across a desert to reach a specific destination. One colt in the pack. The colt's mother was leading the pack and it ran up to the front to run alongside its mother. A troop of people from another country, fighting in a war, abandoned the rest of the troops because they no longer believed in what they were fighting for. They were traveling across a desert to get back home. All were wearing civilian clothing that had been given to them by a charitable organization. The men were all wearing cotton dress shirts with vertical stripes. They were all similar yet different stripe patterns and different colors. They would stop occasionally for meals and rest.
