I was a spy and I was friends with Bradley Cooper. I was watching some funny Super Mario Sunshine thing with blue coins. A house burnt down and I was running away from some people. [That night I had used one of those patches people use to get off smoking; it was already used though, as Dad said it had given him very vivid dreams].
