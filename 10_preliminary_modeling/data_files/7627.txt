I was with three of the women from the Golden Girls, Blanche, Rose and Dorothy. I was working as a character in a theme park. This was no character that I recognize or have heard of before. I'm not even sure that I can describe it except that I was in water. Maybe I was some kind of sea witch, but not really a witch though. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what I was doing as that character. People were coming through the park. I was doing different things. I don't think I was scaring them. I can't even remember interacting with them. Most of my interaction was with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy. They seemed to be doing the same thing I was. They were characters. We came into the park as visitors though. We also visited a kind of church. It is a very different kind of church. We went in the church and there were no benches. There were folding chairs. There was like this platform. It was not really like a stage, more like a loft. There were musicians on the loft. The music was not rock and roll but something that would really appeal to young people today. Everyone in there really seemed to be enjoying the music. They passed a plate around for the collection and there was a comment about this kind of music really helping them to draw more people in and to get better collections. There is a large hallway outside. At that time, I realized that the hallway was filled with young people who were drawn in because of this music. They were getting ready to pass the plate around out there for a collection. They said something about this helping them to build the new church and maybe a school. They wanted to increase their collections so that they could build a new church, or school and a home for their priest. I don't know if it was a home for homeless girls, runaway girls. It was some kind of home for young girls.
