I dreamt that I was a newspaper staff member. Just what my function was at the newspaper, I don't remember. I was instrumental, I remember, in making up an advertisement and also making a layout for a big boat show that was coming to Miami. Also, alone these same lines, I dreamt that I went out to get pictures for the special edition about this boat show, and if I remember correctly, I went down to the Keys to get pictures, myself and one other person. And I took a picture of this other person fishing -- one picture was him -- fishing out in the ocean, and I was going to get another one of him fishing inland. At the end of the dream, I remember commenting about the direction the birds happen to be flying at the time. What significance it had, I don't know. I just remember making some comment about them.
