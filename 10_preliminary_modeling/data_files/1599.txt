I am on a ski boat thing where you stand up on the thing and it acts like a motorcycle. The waves are huge and violent. I like it. Then I'm on a lake, placid and large. I am trying to catch up to "the big boys." I pass many brightly colored balls in the water as I speed with a single-minded desire after the "big guys." I am catching up to them.
