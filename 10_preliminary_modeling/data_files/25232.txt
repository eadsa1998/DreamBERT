 I'm in a parking lot with a group of teenagers. My grade school classmate Eric Stoner is there and wants to buy some hallucinogenic mushrooms. I tell him we'll talk later. Someone vandalizes a nearby house and we take off running. I'm in a skyscraper, up on a high floor. I bike and roller blade down a hallway. I stand crooked, leaning to the left as if I have weak ankles. The bike has no handlebars. I grab onto the neck of the bike in an attempt to steer it. There are more people biking and roller blading. People are walking towards me, moving out of the way. I kick a door open and walk across furniture in a room. A family friend, Lila Marcher, is having lunch there. I walk to a window, and think about suicide. The ground is near the window, though. There is a hill next to the building. I jump out the window onto the hill and the building falls on me right where I jumped out.
