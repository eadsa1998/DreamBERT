I was sitting in my house watching TV. I heard a knock on the door, it was my mom's friend Dee. She said, "Hi, can I come in?" I let her come in. "Mom, Dee is here," I yelled. My mom came a couple minutes later. (A U.P.S. guy came at some point.) When my mom came to talk to Dee, I decided to go to my room. That didn't do much at all because I could still hear what they were saying from my room. "I was wondering if you guys wanted to go to Yosemite with me and my friends." Mom didn't say anything. We both were silent. Setting: The dream took place at my house in my living room and my room. Characters: My mom; my friend Cara from my school; my mom's friends Dee and Joyce. There was also a U.P.S. guy who I didn't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Surprised, excited. When my mom's friend asked my mom if we wanted to go to Yosemite with her and her friends I was surprised and very excited.
