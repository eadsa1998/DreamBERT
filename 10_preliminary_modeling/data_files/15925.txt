I was in a big shopping centre and it was about 5.30pm because all the shops were closing. I was looking for something to eat, but everything I thought looked good was closing. I left and there were some guys outside looking bored. I didn't have shoes on and it was really hot outside and I couldn't remember where I parked. I heard them talking as I was walking and they were saying they should rape me. I tried moving faster, but they caught me and the leader held me down on the ground pulling down my pants. I struggled and he punched me. He had sex with me and then got up to give the next guy a turn, but they got distracted by something and I got up and found my car. I got in and turned it on as they noticed I was gone. I drove out and was trying to go fast, but there were all these roadworks in place. There was a narrow bridge with almost no barriers and I went off the edge straight into the water. I rewound it and went back and drove super slowly. A family that lived nearby ushered me onto this platform and took me into their house. The place nearby had been flooded, hence the roadworks and bridges. We realised we had to hide my car and the only way was to sink it and I was upset about this and was trying to decide whether I'd rather them find me or lose my car, but decided to lose the car. The guy went out to sink it and they were trying to find all these materials to use for something but I said we'll freeze without them. I was worried the guys would find me regardless and then I'd lose my car as well.
