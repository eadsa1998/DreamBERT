I was sitting/lying open position on a table top with a kitten on my tummy. I was looking open and sexy. A man was looking at me. He and his 3 brothers were paid by my father (a rancher) to protect us from some evil bunch of ranchers who had huge Clydesdale horses that pulled a big wagon. It was night. I kept seeing the shadow of these men riding by in the night on patrol. The guy got up and came to me all agitated and begged me to kiss him. I got coy and turned my head and said, "No!" This happened three times. He loved me and I teased him. Then later, there was a terrible train wreck, cars, the Clydales, everything destroyed. The evil one was trying to hurt me. I married this man who loved me. I was ill or something; I couldn't remember that I had kids. 5 kids came by and someone said, "These are yours." 3 redheads and 3 blondes. One of the children said, "And Paulina died." I was shocked and hurt. The child who said it looked like he felt badly for having blurted it out. It was like I had been mentally ill and was coming out of it. Later, I had some warm feelings for this man and we hugged.
