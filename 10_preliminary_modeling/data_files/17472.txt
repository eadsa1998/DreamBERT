I went diving.  There was a similar set-up to the observatory, but it was underwater instead of space that they studied.  I dove down, and came up into a large metal canister with air (like a submerged overturned boat), so the air in my tubes would last.  Before I resurfaced, I dove down and did some exploring and went into an area where I saw a bloated dead body.  This disturbed me, so after I came up, I talked to one of the workers there.  She gave me pictures of the two people they had diving for them, and they were happy to have me doing so as well.  "You wouldn't believe where they've ended up, and what they've found!"  They showed me around a bit.  A man with a very long ponytail was made up to look like a tiger, and he was practicing acting like one as well.  He approached a real tiger to test his accuracy.  Then, preparation for the diving.  Based on what I told them of having seen before I came up, they estimated where I had been and showed me pictures of what else might be there.  They showed me the pictures of people as they were alive.  I would have to recognize their bloated dark faces.  And so I went down.  I found some of the bodies.  I started pulling out things that I found, getting ready to bring them up.  Paperwork.  Lipstick.  Forms.  Little things for them to analyze and solve whatever curiosity they wanted to know about.  On the way back up I stopped in the metal can again, to breathe normally, because the air in my tubes was running low.
