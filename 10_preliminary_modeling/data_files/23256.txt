My wife Anita and I go to a Greek restaurant on the Mall in the city where I worked before retiring to a more rural area.  It is all outdoors, and there is no building.  As the host takes us to a table, I see that the menu is in the form of little signs stuck in the ground, one for each dish on the menu.  They are too small and too close to the ground for me to read.  I wonder how I am going to be able to make a selection from my table, since they are scattered all over the grounds of the restaurant.
