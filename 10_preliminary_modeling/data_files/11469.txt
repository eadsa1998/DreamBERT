I was sleeping and someone came into my room causing me to come into a semi-awake state. There were two people and one of them seemed to be a friend of mine (who actually lives across the hall from me in my dormitory). I couldn't figure out who the other person was, although he seemed to be an apprentice in the act which the former was performing. He was attempting to play some sort of practical joke. I could hear him opening my dresser drawers. I began to get slightly angry and tried to wake myself up completely. I strained hard, trying to wake myself up. At this point, I really woke up and found that my roommate had just gotten up to go to class. He was opening one of the drawers on his own dresser.
