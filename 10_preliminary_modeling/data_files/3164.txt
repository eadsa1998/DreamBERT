Lionel is varnishing the floor. I am talking to them. I say my mother had a small stroke, and then I realize so had Aunt Elaine and she is right there. I then complain about how hard it is to be back at work, even though it is only half time. I am surprised I have a job again. I thought I was retired. There are bubbles in the varnish, on the floor.
