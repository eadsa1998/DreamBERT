I dreamed I was in a little town someplace waiting, with two friends (one whom I recognized and one whom I didn't), for a train. Finally when the rain came by, it was moving very slowly just before it stopped and we started running along with it to get on it so we could look for someone. As these two buddies of mine were slowly running beside the train, I noticed that the track parallel to the train that they just jumped over was also moving at the same slow speed as the train so I thought to myself why run if I could ride, and I jumped up on the track. I was keeping up with my buddies, who were still running, when I decided to get off the moving track and run with them. Just before the train stopped, my buddies got on the engine instead of a passenger car and I yelled to them something like, "No, you're getting on the wrong car." But they had already climbed aboard and I went running towards the other end of the train (looking for a passenger car) while dodging colored porters pushing luggage carts.
