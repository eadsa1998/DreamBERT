I was operating the old B and S at White's. Haverlock was the foreman. I was running brass and steel jobs. It was dark night and all at once, I noticed the lights were out on my end of the shop and my machines were running. I started to work my way to the switchboard and put the lights on. I picked up some hex bars which were cut short and was going to run them out. I came around a corner and jumped back because an enormous dog's head came in front of me. It was a big dog. I later came in front of a dog again. I won some money at the track. There were some drawings on a big mirror and I was cleaning off the mirror so they could be seen clearly and Ann was going to curl the hair on the women. I spit on the mirror to dampen it so I could clean it.
