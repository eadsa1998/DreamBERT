I am in a living room and Phyllis G is laying on her back naked on a coffee table. A man is making love to her and I am watching. My man is in the kitchen and will come back presently and we will make love. I feel embarrassed. I see Phyllis's mouth all pouty and sexy and her eyes closed in concentration. Suddenly she flips over on her tummy and this throws the guy off his stride and he can't find where to put his penis. She stands up and says, "That's the way he and I always did it. But it's OK. Don't worry. I don't want you to think he's the only one I've done it with."
