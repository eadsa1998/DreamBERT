Mom and I were grocery shopping. I can't remember what all we got, but I remember we were getting loads and loads of stuff. And we got these cookies, we got a bag full of these cookies; some were white and some were chocolate-covered. And they were supposed to represent Celine Dion's songs in some way. I guess when you eat them you're supposed to like think about the song or something. And the white cookies had like wine in them. And the black cookies had peanut butter in them. [laugh] And so we're in the line checking out in the check-out line and for some reason or another I start talking on the wireless microphone, and my voice can be heard on the grocery store PA system. And then the lady next to me in line started talking too. And then it starts making feedback and I shut it off. And I put it in the basket, and we go out of the store.
