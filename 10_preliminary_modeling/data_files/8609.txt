I had the text from the back cover of Bill C's book pasted in an Excel sheet to do some type of work with it. As I was doing whatever it was, I realized that we could use this text in other ways. So I was trying to figure out the best way to do that. I kept cutting and pasting the text into different cells of the Excel sheet to find the best placement. There seemed to be a vertical bar of color along the left side of the text. Sometimes when I placed the text that vertical bar of color seemed to change or disappear completely. I debated whether that was okay or not. I think I ended up not using it in other ways at all.
