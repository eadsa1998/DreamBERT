There was a prom. We were at West Whitehall and I was going out with Eric Christian Olsen. Sometimes everyone was called to my block and we had to stand in two lines with our prom partner and me and Eric had to say something. No-one knew we were going out and we stayed away from each other during school. I sat with Farrah and some of her friends near her block. There was a spooky thing happening in the block. We couldn't go in or we would die. I looked because I heard someone crying. I ran away and this thing came out. Charlene and I ran near our block. Charlene, Eric and I were in some water.
