Walking along a streambed. Betty goes to other bank. I think the right hand bank is more direct. Betty soon finds she can not cross the bank and our destination is on the right hand side. At least she comes to a possible crossing. After crossing the stream she comes up steep rocks by a narrow dirt path.  She lays something down and comes up the steep path with a baby. She dips it in a pool and hands me the dripping child. When Betty handed me the child she said, "This is great aunt Medorah." I have only old towels and I use the blue-edged one to dry the child and talk to it as I dry it. Its white rope is half off and half-dripping.
