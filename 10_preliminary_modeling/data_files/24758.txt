I was friends with a lady named Betty Smith that collected Teddy bears inher purse. I found drugs in it. She figured it out. I chased her with some of the teachers from my school. She turned into a cat when I told her I knew she was smuggling drugs cross-country. She was running at me. Setting: Different places: movie theater, school, freeway, hotel in Spain, San Francisco. Characters: Betty Smith - appears nice but is really dangerous. Teachers - worried. Godmother - worried. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. It was a weird dream and sort of fun to have, even if I was scared.
