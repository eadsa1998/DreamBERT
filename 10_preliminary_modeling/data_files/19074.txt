My girlfriend and I were in bed making love. Well, not really making love, but foreplay and so on toward making love. But then I had to go home, I remember--to put some pants in the dry cleaner, two pair, blue and brown. So I kind of rushed off. It was very early in the morning, about 4 a.m. I guess. I remember thinking, "I have to drive carefully so that I don't get stopped by any policemen who asked me, you know, 'What are you doing out at this hour?" So it was dawn and I was driving back toward my apartment to get the pants. By the way, this took place a few days before our wedding. There was no discussion, but I remember thinking it at the time. [Max: Nietzsche also reports that he was kicking at something while this sexual episode was going on, and he thinks it perhaps had something to do with his girlfriend's mother; that she was in the other room perhaps or something like that.]
