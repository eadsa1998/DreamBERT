I am in Paris but it looks like (state) countryside, with pretty aspen trees and fall leaves colors. A famous woman actress is living in the country outside Paris and rumor has it she never leaves and is unhappy, but she says she loves it there. Another actress joins her and they walk, hand in hand, talking. Three more are there. Now I am one of them and in a car. The brakes won't work and I am forced to drive it into a hilly embankment and get out. I am holding a huge crystal rock that has music in it and is controlled by a piece of amethyst crystal rock on the back, like a volume and power switch. I put it down on a rocky area, next to a fireplace on a hill. I hide the crystal side and start to walk for help. People come by and hear the music and I pick the rock back up and hide the part that works. They are curious and want to know where the music is coming from. I say there is a radio on the fireplace. They are suspicious that there is a radio in the rock. I slide the amethyst rock into my hand and walk away, down a steep hill. I'm lost. I turn and try to go back up the hill and see a pair of ropes and try to pull myself up the hill, but between the ropes are a series of little pigs I must step over. One is a meany and tries to bite me and I have to back up, hoping it comes to the end of it's leash, but it doesn't. It keeps following me and gets my finger in it's mouth and bites hard. The skin is not broken, but I am worried. I get away from it and see Mateo playing with some kids. I go to him and say, "I'm lost," and he says, "Well, I have to go to town where they will pick me up soon." I say, "Good, let's go," and he still wants to play and won't go. I try to tell him how important this is. A woman comes to pick him up, so I follow them, down a steep embankment and up a road. The woman says she hates to do this because she used to be a student with Mateo and he never does his work and plays around and she gets in trouble.
