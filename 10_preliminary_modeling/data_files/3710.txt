I have returned to school, university. I've been here for years. It is getting old. I think I will go to the first meeting of the Disability Student group. I start off in that direction, going up some stairs. I see Rochelle. We talk. She asks me where I am going and I tell her. She says, "Oh, boring. I'm not going to that thing. It's always the same." I agree it is often boring, but it is a good opportunity to meet the new, young disabled people, the activists. I mention to Rochelle that I am looking for a TV set, another one, for maybe $100. We see some advertisements posted on a board and I go up to look. Some TV's are mentioned for $40. But I decide to wait, because they won't be fancy enough to do what I want them to do. I never make it to class.
