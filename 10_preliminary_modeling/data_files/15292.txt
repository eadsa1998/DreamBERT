I was watching Glee, but it was different and I only remember Kurt. They were in a gym. Then this blue guy was in the shower and a girl followed him in. He covered her back with a towel and covered himself up. A lady had told someone to call their 'dead' parent and say there were problems and secrets? Then Mom was getting her car back and I went back with her. Ezra and Darren went in Ezra's car. I sat on Mom's lap and the door wouldn't close. We almost hit a car who stopped suddenly. Later they went for dinner at Aunt Sally's. I got some Oreo wafer sticks and some chocolate snack out of a cupboard and she told me to give some to Ezra and called him the 'fattest'. I said I was the smallest in the house "by 4am" and Ezra said 'you sure' and I said yeah and she said "3?". Then I was back home and we went out and got that Asian soup but one had no veges. They were going to give that one to me and I told them to go down and get me another.
