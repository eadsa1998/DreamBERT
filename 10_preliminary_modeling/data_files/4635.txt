["Radio dreams."] I am a child with other children in a school room. I decide to teach them something. I begin talking on my subject. But some radio is playing. A woman's voice is reporting something. I feel annoyed. I look to my right and see an open door to the hall and see some adults standing around sort of watching. I like that they are seeing me teach. I walk toward the door so they can see me better. But the door closes. I feel annoyed. I walk back to the round table where the other kids are. I ask them to turn off that radio. They pay no attention to me at all. I decide to find it and turn it off myself. I feel embarrassed I haven't better control of them. I find a small radio and find the off button but it doesn't work. I find another larger black radio with many many wires. One by one I follow the wire with my hand and yank out the ones plugged in the wall. Nothing helps. The radio keeps on talking. I feel very frustrated. [NOTES: I wake up to NPR news on the radio.]
