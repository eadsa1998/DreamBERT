I was in an operating room with a nurse and two other girls. One I did not know and the other, named Shirley, I know slightly and have not seen in three years. I had cancer and the nurse was cutting me open in exactly the same way I had dissected my frog in biology laboratory last year. All of the organs she took out of my body exactly resembled my frog's organs, only mine were bright red and much larger. I especially remember the nurse taking out my liver and heart. I was fully awake but felt no pain. Shirley kept running in and out of the room with the unidentified girl, but I do not know where they were going.
