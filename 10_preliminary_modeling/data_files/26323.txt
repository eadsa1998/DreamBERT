 There is a boy about 12 or 13 years old. He is round: not fat, but pudgy. I talk to him and encourage him not to think of himself as fat, and to do what he can to change the way he looks. He plays basketball, and I tell him to work out; not like his father and brother who are big and round as well. He stands on a ladder, holding his hands up over a basketball rim that is lower than normal.
