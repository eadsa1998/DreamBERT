I was approaching an army camp with a fence around it. I was going to sign myself up. A WWII veteran was hovering outside and he was tired. He looked very tired. The old tired soldier lunged at me yelling, "Where's my hug?" I ran fast and said, "Back then, up until WWII it might've been true, but NOT NOW!" I ran fast. I was getting my official helmet. I put a pink ball on top. Someone, a guy, was looking for a clavicle. The only one small enough....he was a little boy, about 9 or 10 years. The man did the SPOCK SHOCK on him and his skeleton separated. He finished and then surged forward as if his head was a chicken. Me and Evelyn were doing a cartoon. We were discussing lower-cost animation from Mexico. Evelyn said that just South of the border everybody was doing animation and good. They had work tables set up outside. Everybody did. The cover illustration of Evelyn was NOT good. It was too light and did NOT look like her. I was carrying a machine gun through the park in Columbia where Aunt Jenny used to swing us. A guy was looking sneaky in the park. He was trying to steal my machine gun. Me and Evelyn got an apartment and slept on the floor. ???. Christian came to visit and he was lying on the floor next to me and he kissed me. Evelyn knew how long it'd been since I'd been with anybody so she yawned and said, "I'm going to bed." It was 6:30 p.m. He forgot something and he had to leave and come back. When he got back I was rinsing my mouth out with water. We started making out. He put on a tape of himself singing a Bread song. His sister came in bringing 2 presents for me. A small used tape player and a used microwave. I was happy to get them. We did NOT have sex because of the allegations that we had searched, and only found folding bicycles.
