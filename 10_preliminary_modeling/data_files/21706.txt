I was in our old home on East 68th St. Pauline Lenarcic was in the basement washing clothes. We were talking about the metal in the machines. A fellow brought a belt like with the metal it was made of. I looked it over and felt it. It seemed like a cloth although it was metal. I was in the dark. It was night. I put on my flashlight, but no light went on. I went outside and it was raining.
