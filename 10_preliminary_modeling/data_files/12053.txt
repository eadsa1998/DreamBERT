Ezra, Jayson and I were trapped on this island. We hung out on the beach. We had boxes we'd made, boogie boards and That's Life!. The tide started coming in and we moved everything up and also put some stuff into a house like Nana's, but it had different furniture. Nana kept coming to the island in a little speedboat acting weird. There was something about shortcake sea water? Something broke and the water came to the house, then I was watching it as a movie and it was The Beatles, not us. They left the house and then the camera focused on Darren, and they were walking through a forest and they got shot at. Then it was the people from Lost. Jack and Kate were talking.
