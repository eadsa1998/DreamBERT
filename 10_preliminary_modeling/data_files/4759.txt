["Going to Las Vegas."] I am in some large room with Aunt Millie. We are talking about a workshop I attended that she is very interested in learning about. Some man and a woman, who had been featured on the Oprah Winfrey show. I said I could teach her the stuff I learned. She wants to learn. We are sitting on a large sort of couch platform chatting. Now we get up and walk across the room to a small kitchen area. Millie is mixing up some whipped cream in an unusual way. She has it poured out in a rectangle shape on what looks like a grill on a stove. She uses a whisk and the color of the cream is a milky blue. I comment on the unusual way she is doing it. I am interested. As she does this, I tell her that the three things that are most important to learn from the workshop is you must have a goal, drive and motivation. As we are talking I become aware of possible danger. It seems we are on a large ocean ship and huge whales, hairy black scary ones, are circling the ship. They are coming to eat us. I feel worried. I look out and see them deep in the ocean coming closer. One very hairy one surfaces and goes back down. I move toward the center of the room. I need to look in cupboards. I begin to open a large cupboard like a closet. I see a baby's hand poke out. Aunt Millie is very upset and says don't open that! Now I wonder if there's a dead or hurt baby that's been in there for a long time and did Aunt Millie have something to do with that? I try to shut the door again but it won't shut, the stuff that's in it won't go back in enough to shut. The feeling of fear now. A man suddenly enters the room from a door that leads to an elevator. He's come for us. Aunt Millie is going somewhere bad, like she will die. I think I am going with her, but the man says to me, No, you are going to Las Vegas. I walk into the elevator relieved it's not my time to die yet.
