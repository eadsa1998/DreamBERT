I was watching video on a video camera of Calvin, Ezra, some others and I when we were younger and went to the Royal Show. It was afterwards and we were pranking people, asking them to take us to places. I was filming from a while away. Then I was there. We went to this indoor place and I was like "Don't I seem much older than I was?". Abukar was there and some other people. I was then standing up and another me was sitting on a chair. I touched the other me and got sucked in. So we decided we wanted to film it, but another me didn't come. Elijah and Evelyn were there too. We thought some of the people there were dodgy. We were reading Laura Palmer's diary (Twin Peaks). It mentioned tapes and that "Izzy's condition is cool. It's Izzy cool. Cool. Cool. Cool." but never said anything about what it was (she was trying to hide it, in case someone found her diary).
