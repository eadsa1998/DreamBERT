Mom had just picked me up from home and there were police cars everywhere. We started taking all these strange roads and for some reason we got out of the car. We were walking and this drunk guy came up and said to Mom "cracking piece of crumpet". He said something about me and guitars. I was like "What?! I'm only f-f-thirteen!". We ran away and I called Dad and then we hid in a ditch thing at a park. A policeman drove past and somehow Mom took his car and then got me. We stopped for fish and chips and then we were driving and in lots of places there were police depots? We went in and I remembered to get keys. The lady at the office thing let us in and we were messing around with videos of this lady whose car we had taken. Luckily, she looked a bit like Mom. They had a big DVD player. Some people thought that she was different. The lady gave Mom name tags and she had to put them all on the right person. Then we were allowed out. I went home and I left my bag up on the street. I remembered and ran back to get it. It had stuff missing, like my phone. These two guys were there and one of them had my phone and I snatched it off him and got my jumper and the other put my bag high up in this tree. Then Loren Dean and some other person came by, they were friends of Mom and they were cops?
