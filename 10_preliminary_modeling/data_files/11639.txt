I, age 20, was sitting at the breakfast nook table with my father, 54, and two other persons who I remember only very vaguely. They may have been my sister and one of her girlfriends, ages 19. I was supposed to be studying my German homework, but found myself reading and discussing an army handbook on field artillery. The front door bell rang and in came a fraternity brother of mine with a large double decker birthday cake. I asked why the cake and he said that he had received one the week before and now it was my turn. My dad asked him if he had been out to Eisely's place, meaning John Carroll U and he answered that he was applying to their med school (they have none) next week. My dad said that he had better hurry and he returned that he liked Reserve and Case better anyhow and that they were damn good schools.
