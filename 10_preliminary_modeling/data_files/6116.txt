I am listening to the radio and singing along. I am dancing and keep looking at my reflection in the mirror. It is pretty good movement. I stare on the wall, where I post all my favorite idols. I like them and keep doing my dancing movement. Suddenly, my idols turn into real people. They all gather around me. I feel very happy because I can talk to them and hold their hands. Oh, my goodness. I will have a chance to know everything in Hollywood. I ask one of the famous actors if he had a girlfriend. He said, "No, I don't." I am so happy and I fall in love with him. He is so handsome. Then we are holding hands. After, he comes close to me and whispers something in my ear. I cannot hear him because there is a loud ringing sound and it is nonstop. Suddenly I woke up and it was my alarm clock sound.
