I was at home on my computer. I was trying to access results of some test. I couldn't remember the password. Calvin came over. I was in the dining room and I saw him go into my room with some other guy. I went down there and my desk was a mess. He was sitting on my bed and the other guy was standing next to my bedside table. My desktop was different -- all new icons and the resolution was like 640x480. I went to change it, but the guy started opening my drawer and I quickly slammed it shut and said it was my underwear drawer, but I had a bright pink vibrator on top of my undies. He didn't say anything but was hinting at it. He said "take a picture of my bum" and I said "take a picture of your... balls" [in a 'yo mama' type of way]. I was thinking that I needed to stop saying balls so often. I finally got to the results and I had gotten 5.5/10. I was confused and disappointed about it. Some stupid girl had gotten a higher result. I was watching an Arrested Development video, but I only remember seeing Buster.
