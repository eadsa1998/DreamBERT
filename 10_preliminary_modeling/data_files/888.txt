A vocational rehab counselor was questioning me about my cousin Sonja and her capabilities as a VR counselor in the coast office. I told him that Sonja and I go back as far as birth. She had a few things to learn yet, but she was pretty good. He said he wanted to know more. We got into a car and drove to the M City house. There was some snow on the ground. I suggested that he park in the driveway. I say, "Turn right into the driveway." He obstinately turned left into a bank of dirt and snow. He and I agree that that won't do. He turned the car around and parked on the street, facing the "bad corner." I was concerned but saw another car was parked right on the corner so that we were protected from collision. We go into the house. I took him the full length of the house to the far end. I say, "Let's start at the oldest part." It was a freshly remodeled room, empty of furniture, and freshly painted. I told him how this used to be a half-finished garage. I pointed out where the grape vines used to be. It was now a lovely wall with windows. We moved to the next room, the rec room. I pointed to the door. I said, "It used to be somewhere else. I still can't get used to it being there and it startles me when it opens. It too has been freshly remodeled." As he and I had driven up to the house, I had pointed out the rising creek that was in flood stage. I told him that sometimes the creek came right up to the door and sometimes came in and started to flood the house. [BL]
