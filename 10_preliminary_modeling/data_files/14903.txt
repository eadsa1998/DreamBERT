There was a movie with Jensen Ackles and one with Jared Padalecki. I watched the one with Jared Padalecki one night and I think it was good. I went outside. It was late and I can't remember what I was doing but I was trying to breathe quietly so I didn't wake the neighbours. There was something about the movie out there. Ezra was around at some point. Later I went through a drive thru with Mom. We had to put our credit card in a slot. The girl at the counter asked us what country and we told her. I did something and she laughed and said she was on something with a president.
