I was at school. Rebekah and her whole family were dentists. Genevieve, Jemma and Rebekah were sitting near the PAC and we were sitting around from the Accounting classroom. They asked me to sit with them (they were joking). Calvin was sitting with me. I called Genevieve a "stupid prostitute ho". I was doing Biology work. I complained to them that they didn't have to study because they were doing the easy subjects. Later, I had a sore tooth, which had been sore for ages. Some teacher, who I think was Ms Solomon, was painting people's faces. The only dentist was Rebekah (she had dentist skill). She was saying something about a "mass of breast". A teacher said that I had to trust her. Then I was in a science classroom and we had a seating plan. Eugene was in the row next to me. They passed around a didgeridoo and Eugene liked it.
