I'm at home - I live with my family - and I'm late for work, I suddenly discover - got about 15 min. and I'm confused. I start to move fast, thinking about my hair, and get deodorant on, then realize I need a shower and shampoo. Damn. I hope I can get by with perfume. This is terrible. I keep looking out the window at the bus stop as if I could run down and catch it if it was in sight. (No way.) In the bathroom, the little cabinet has been moved forward of where it's supposed to be, next to the toilet, against the shelf - I make some snotty remark about slovenly people - the place is a mess anyway, stuff all over the counter, including the boxes of curlers my mom uses. I've got 2 of them in my hair, actually, last night having hoped they would help. I push the cabinet back where it should be, and start to pull the curlers out, wondering what I should do first.
