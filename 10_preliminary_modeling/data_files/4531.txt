["Drew Carey live."] I am in a room, working on my video project. I sit at my desk. Someone comes in to have me guess who has come to visit me. A curtain is pulled across the left portion of the space by my desk. A man stands behind the curtain. I can see his outline and the yellow suit coat he is wearing. I am not fooled. It is Drew Carey. Someone tells me they are very pleased with my video project and will buy it but I must edit it down more tightly. In particular, the ending segment. I am happy they like it and assure them I will be happy to edit it. I know it needs it. Now I am looking at a survey Lucy has filled out. I read her answers and decide I will answer the same way. I notice she checked on the SEX question that 50% of the time she has sex alone, 40% of the time, sometimes with people and 10% of the time she has sex with someone. I think I should make it more accurate for my situation. But I don't. Now we travel to someplace. We are in a house. Drew Carey has come with us. We are attracted to each other.
