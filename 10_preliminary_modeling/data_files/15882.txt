I was at this hotel on an island. It was a big hotel with 100 floors or so. Spaceman was with me and the hotel had served alligator or crocodile and I'd fed him some, but he was sick. I got on the elevator and took him to floor 100 which had a vet. Later, an alligator/crocodile was loose in the hotel and killing people. I went back to the 100th floor to get Spaceman so we could escape, but the whole floor was covered in ice. People were frozen in ice columns on the wall. I found Spaceman and put him in the elevator, but saw the alligator/crocodile coming towards me and I ran into the elevator, scaring Spaceman and causing him to run out, but I had to close the door and leave. Then it was a year later or something and we returned. There were actually multiple alligators/crocodiles and they still hadn't gotten rid of all of them, but they had started to rebuild parts of the hotel. I was exploring in one of these half rebuilt areas and I saw a cat and then I saw Spaceman and it turned out there was a female cat and they had had kittens. I was happy he was ok.
