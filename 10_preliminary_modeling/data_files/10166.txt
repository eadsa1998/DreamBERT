Pedro and I are in a play; he gets lots of applause; later we sit and talk and his gay friends arrive and I leave; shift: with Marissa Camden again, helping her take care of a baby; I call Father Andrew and tell him that I have broken my fingers in several places; He says: "How is your motivation now?" I say: "Fine."
