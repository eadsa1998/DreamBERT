I was at a shop. It was small and Mom and I were in an aisle that was close to one wall. It was a really tight fit and we could barely move. There was a door on this wall that led to another shop. I complained to Mom about the size. Then, Calvin had to hand out ice-creams to these people on an oval. I was with him. They were playing a game. Michael Trucco was there and the game was called Pyramid and I said that was weird since he played Pyramid Ball in Battlestar Galactica (he was actually a character though). There was a mud flavoured ice-cream.
