I was with Bill F at SMW. We were trying to see where Doctor Pi lives. We went in this large building. It looked like a combined office and storage space. Everything was a mess. There were many different rooms. Each room had many different things in it. no boxes. but things sitting out piled on tables and such. I finally looked into one room and I saw Doctor Pi. He was sitting with his back to me, watching TV and combing his hair. Bill F and I walked away and looked into this big double-door closet. I don't remember what was in there. Suddenly Doctor Pi saw us. He seemed a bit embarrassed at his living arrangements. He said that most of his money goes to child support so he couldn't afford much in terms of a place to live. The next thing I remember is he saying that he loves me and wants to marry me. I replied that I love him to and that I accept. We talked a bit about Matthew and about Belle.
