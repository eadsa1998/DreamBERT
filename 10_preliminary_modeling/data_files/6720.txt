I had been showing off my curtains. Miss P. had moved into these apartments. They were only rooms in a large house. The phone rang and we let her answer it while we went to our rooms but I went slowly by a round about way, waiting to hear who she wanted. Relieved that it seemed to be herself. I heard her say, "They are all there." Then she came to get someone and she stepped into my doorway just as the door opposite was opened by M.M. (who I had met a few days before). I said that I was glad to see her and asked her to come in and see my curtains. She came in but didn't admire the curtains much. I picked up a corner to show her but the lowest bit was all a hole. She said, "Never mind. You can cover it up with something." I reached for the second curtain. It too had a hole. I fell badly but thought, "This is just a dream. It'll be all right when I awake."
