I was with Bill C, but I don't know where. We were sleeping together. Well, not exactly sleeping. The physical sensation was so real and intense. I recognized that I was dreaming and took note of the fact that I was feeling the physical sensations so strongly while in a dream. I thought to myself that I wanted to stay with it and pay attention to how intensely I feel the physical sensations. I didn't let it go for very long until I decided that I needed to wake up. Instead I tried to wake him up, which makes me wonder if I was dreaming. As I thought I was trying to wake him up I thought, Oh. This isn't a dream at all because we're both awake. At first he initiated the kissing then we stopped and were talking very briefly about the situation, with me working for him and with him being married. The next time I initiated it with the purpose of making a point. I put my hand on his face and kissed him very hard. I don't know what my point was. He stops. We stop kissing. He jumped out of bed very abruptly and said something about what just happened. I said, Well, we just can't. He said, It's not that easy to just say we can't. Then he said, We'll just have to talk about this later. He had a program or something that he had to get ready for. I did something else to try to test and see if I was dreaming or not and decided that I wasn't. I was standing at a table with a bunch of pocket folders that had various materials in them. Someone came up and said something to me. I said that I worked there, that I work with Bill C.
