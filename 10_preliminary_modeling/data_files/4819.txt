["Mean residents."] I am moving into some large house where lots of people live. Like an orphanage or Care Home. I am outside and see windows and doors and say I'll go in here. The person with me says, no, those ways in are blocked. Come this way. We go around to the front door and enter. It is a very old and crowded . Dark wood furniture. I am told to sit in a small space against the wall with the Windows. I am in a wheelchair. No one speaks to me. I hear them talking with each other. In Spanish. I understand Spanish but decide not to let them know because they are talking about me. They are tricking me by not telling me things I need to know, or telling me the wrong things. I go along for awhile. They don't smile and they don't like me. In the dining room, they get their food and leave me to figure it out on my own. Finally, I answer in Spanish and they realize I'd heard everything they said.
