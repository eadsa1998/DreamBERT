The first dream was when I was in an airplane with my brother (year older) and my girl. It was a small, one-engine plane. We landed and I got out. My brother and my girl wanted to see how high the plane would go. I could hear him talking to the tower and the man in the tower said that he could only fly as high as 11,000 feet. The runway on which I was standing was constantly smoldering.
