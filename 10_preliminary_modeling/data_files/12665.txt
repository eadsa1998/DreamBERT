I was at school and all the subjects were the same except for the main ones. On the first day, my first four periods were all options. I asked Samantha what I had next and she said media. I said that I don't have it. Media had moved to this small cylinder and it kept rolling. Calvin was in there. Ms Braun was the teacher. I saw Dmitri at some point.
