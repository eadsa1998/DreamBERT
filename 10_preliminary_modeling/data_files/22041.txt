This dream is really something produced by fantasy, although the previous night I had several encounters with those people who are actually repudiated by society; I am referring to homosexuals. The dream starts when I and some classmates from the university go on a trip to the center region of Peru. When we are around Chosica, we see a reform school for that sort of person, and before our eyes they continued to behave in a rather unmasculine way, as though our presence didn't disturb them, and furthermore, they were offending us men. Therefore, we began to criticize them, until one of them picked a fight with me and we started to hit each other, until after a long effort I was able to defeat him. That's all.
