I was at this school place and this guy got kicked out of his room for masturbating. Some other bloke was a spy. Harris Allan was at this place. There were these certain places to sit when people came in. One lady was on a piano with a kitten. A lady came in. She stopped and packed her stuff up. Samantha and I were at a table. There were cards of people from school. I wanted to find Dmitri's. Samantha found this logic problem book and some other thing she liked so we were doing that. Later somewhere else, Calvin, Evelyn and I were miming songs. One of them was Sugarbush.
