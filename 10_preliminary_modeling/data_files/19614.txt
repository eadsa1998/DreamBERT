I am at McConnell's. Mrs. McConnell, Anderson who is carrying a child of 2 or 3, Hall, and I are in the room I am wondering where I had best go, and explain that I must now return to town. However, I am dissuaded from this purpose and presently we find ourselves walking along a passage (seemingly underground) about 5 or 6 feet wide and with low, uneven ceiling -- so low in spots that one is forced to stoop. Everything (walls, ceiling, floor) is solid rock. I now am carrying the child and I set her down presently on a shelf protruding from one of the walls. I am dressed in tan shirt and seersucker (tan striped) trousers and suddenly I realize that there is a large hole in the seat of my trousers. Glancing at Hall, I note an amused expression (trace of smile) and I now he at least has noticed it. I then begin scheming on how I can manage things so as to walk at the end of our procession where no one (and particularly Mrs. McConnell) would see the hole in my pants. This, however, is not easy to do.
