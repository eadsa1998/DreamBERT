The first thing I remember is holding a CD in my hand, and then all of a sudden being able to hear the music perfectly in my head. I was amazed by my ability, although I wasn't sure if I thought I was awake or asleep at the time. I don't remember what disc I was listening to either, but I do remember my brother saying something about a band called "[something] Hill" and then I thought about the band Sugar Hill that DC Talk sings about on one of their albums. So, I think I was going to put my DC Talk CD into the player. At that point, I remember going "unconscious"- I started seeing pictures in my head or something, and I really felt like it was another form of consciousness. The next thing I know, I'm in my bed reading. I come across this passage, but I never really know what it's saying because every time I read it I go unconscious. I read this passage several times, but I'm never able to finish because I just black out to another world, temporarily (it only seemed like a few seconds each time). Anyway, finally I was able to read most of it, and I remember something to the general effect of (paraphrasing): "According to the research of [John Smith], every time [certain phrase] is written, people are proven to go unconscious, because when you really believe something, it will happen." I think I still blacked out, even after the disappointment of somebody actually TELLING me that this technique was just a placebo (I really could have killed that guy for spoiling it!), but at least I was able to read more of it that time- enough to understand what it was saying.
