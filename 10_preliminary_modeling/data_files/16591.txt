Wow, I thought I was through with the tape thing, but I guess I'm not. We'll see. Last night I had a dream that I was taking classes again at Westport High School, but that I had definitely made up my mind that I wanted to major in Music, and I wanted to minor in Education, I think, something like that. But I was already going for this degree while I was a magical aerospace engineer, and what that means is pretty much a fancy term for studying illusions and stuff. I was studying to be a magician, and I knew that was going to be like a nothing degree. And when Westport College has you seeking a degree from them, they give you this little pink plastic case with these red laminated cards in it telling people what you are. And I opened my pink case and I had three cards in it that said, "Jasmine Henderson, Illusionary Aerospace Engineer." And I just thought that was so ridiculous, and I wanted to change my major and I wanted to know if that was possible. And so I was looking through the brochure for the number for Guidance. There were phone numbers for principals and teachers and all kinds of offices, but no phone number for Guidance or Admissions or General Information. I couldn't find any of those numbers, and I think kind of stuck and lost. And that was really all there was to it. I woke up.
