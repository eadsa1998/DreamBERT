I was going to church on a date, and while I was there I was very aware that I was going just to pick up a man. I was very conscious of my appearance, and I didn't want anyone to know that I was pregnant. It seemed really important to me to try and find a husband, and I didn't feel like I could get one unless I lied about my condition. The whole thing seems too time consuming and impossible. I know I'll never be able to find one and I get married before I start showing.
