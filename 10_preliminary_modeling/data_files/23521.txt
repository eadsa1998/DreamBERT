I dreamt I was cleaning Donna√ïs house. I was cleaning the kitchen and I did a really good job but when she came home I realized that it was 2:20 and I was supposed to finish by 2:00, and I had only done one room. I started rushing around thinking I could finish the rest of the house in half an hour but it really wasn't possible and I discovered an area of the house -- a downstairs bedroom area -- that I didn't know was there. At least Donna didn't seem mad about the situation.
