At one side of the room a lecturer is demonstrating. He has five glass tubes with red liquid in each. Asks which tube is brightest or darkest. His class doesn't answer. He comes around the separating high counter and asks me. I tell him it depends on the background and show him how the tubes change shade when the blackboard or white hall is behind them.
