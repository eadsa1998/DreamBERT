Am standing on a train or subway platform with my wife. We argue about which is fastest way to get home. We each decide to take his own way. The argument annoys me and I stand some feet apart in anger. A few feet away stands a woman who apparently heard the argument and this too annoys me. Later am in the bow of a boat as it approaches a wharf. I grab a wire and swing around and down onto pier gracefully and then walk fast down the street determined to get home first.
