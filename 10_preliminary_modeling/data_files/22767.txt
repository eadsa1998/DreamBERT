I had a horrible dream. I dreamed I was in an old house, which I have never seen in real life. The walls had many cracks and the ceilings were high, so much so that when one tried to see where they ended, only could only see the darkness up above. I was afraid that a ghost would appear, like in the movies, and in my dream I tried to convince myself that the horror stories I had heard were not true. I awoke frightened, and the fear lasted until a while later when I went back to sleep.
