I was driving on an open road. I was speeding. My foot was down hard on the accelerator. Suddenly I saw a beautiful girl waiting at the edge of a road for a lift. I tried to stop the car but my foot couldn't find the brake. I frantically looked for the brakes but they had disappeared. Suddenly in front of me on the road was my girl. I wanted to stop the car and suddenly the brakes were in their proper places and I stopped.
