I was at a shop with Mom. We were sitting on this seat which was near a table and chairs. Some posh people sat down at the table and this girl had a little dog with a mane of hair that had been crimped. Mom hadn't seen it but began talking about how disgusting it was when people did things like straighten their dog's hair. I got up and walked out of their eyesight and started miming the cut-throat action to tell her to stop. She stopped before she actually said anything and changed the subject. Later I returned and Mom said the posh people had made fun of me leaving and that it had something to do with my hair. I was wearing my Good Advice crew shirt and I saw Judah at the shop also wearing his crew shirt. He acknowledged me and later I was saying something about something 'sucking balls' while he was nearby.
