Mom and I were at a shop. We went to the pet shop and they had a container of ferrets with a big snake in there. The snake started chasing me and Mom. We split up and I was floating on a little cloud thing. We drove somewhere full of scary dogs. We went on a roof. A good dog explained that Mom was bad or something.
