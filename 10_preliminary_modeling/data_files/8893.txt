I was at an event and saw Barry C there. I walked by him without saying anything and then, returning, walked by again with no intention of saying anything to him. As I walked by this time he said something, as if to himself but intending for me to hear him. It was very sarcastic about me not wanting to talk to him. I walked a few steps closer to him, pointed my finger at him, and almost angrily said, and that's exactly why. I turned and left the room. I was thinking that I am just so sick of his constant criticism. I had an adult daughter who had been out socializing with some of her friends. I was concerned about her drinking, or having too much to drink. Her father and I were divorced. It wasn't Darren. I was insisting that she come back. We weren't at home, maybe at a hotel. We insisted that she come in for the night. He and I agreed to stick together on this and between the two of us make sure that she did stay in. When I thought she had snuck out and then realized that she hadn't, I apologized. She said it was okay. I checked on her once or twice after that and both times saw her sound asleep in bed. I had gone to a women room. I must have been having a period because I was changing my tampon. I put the wrapper in the little disposal container attached to the wall of the stall. I stepped to the side of the toilet as I was doing this. I did this because I didn't want anyone outside the stall to see my feet. But then I realized if they didn't they might try to come in and I didn't want that so I stepped back around to the front.
