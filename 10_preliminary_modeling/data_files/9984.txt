Hillary (my best friend) is getting ready for the wedding of one of her children; The house is artistically arranged. I help her prepare food. We find time to go on a bicycle ride. shift: We are getting ready for a BAPTISM which will precede the wedding ceremony. A woman (the president of the Jung society in reality) is about to perform the ceremony. Why not Father Andrew? I cannot find my proper clothes nor my choir robe. Then I hear SIRENS: a tornado warning very black sky and people huddled in doorways of buildings, underneath black umbrellas, afraid of things falling. I go back to a stone church and feel it is safe; See baby holding its own bottle.
