It was like a film and there were lots of landscape shots and was generally just nice looking. I think it was on another planet/in the future (at one point someone said they were 254 years ahead of us technology wise) and there were trains that went around the whole world. It was just two tracks going each way in a loop, stopping at stations. They were super fast as well. Anyway, they had a limit of 50 people per train and there were 5 carriages (they had a specific name but can't remember). If someone got off, someone had to get on or it wouldn't go.
