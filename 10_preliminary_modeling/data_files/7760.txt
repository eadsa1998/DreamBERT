I was on a first date. We were at my house, though it wasn't my house in waking life. We were sitting on the sofa talking. I mentioned the movie Stigmata and he said he would like to see it so I put it in for us to watch together. We had kissed 2-3 times. They were very brief, gentle kisses. I thought how nice it was to be with such a gentleman, and someone that I had things in common with. He was laying on the sofa watching the movie and I was sitting behind the back of the sofa taking some bottles of drinks out of their original packages and putting them in a larger box with compartments. Some were beer and some were pink wine coolers. It was the kind of box that wine and liquor bottles come in but there were many more compartments. The bottles were different sizes. Some were very small like those you get on an airplane. One was larger than all the rest. I put more than one bottle in some of the compartments. I don't know why I was doing this. When I was almost done, I realized I was making a lot of noise. About that time, I heard something from my date. I leaned over the back of the sofa and asked what was wrong. He was about to turn the movie off because I was making so much noise with the bottles. I kissed him lightly and told him I was done. Then I lay down on the sofa next to him to watch the rest of the movie. It felt very good being with him.
