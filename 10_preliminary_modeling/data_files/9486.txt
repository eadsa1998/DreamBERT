I am all day with children at Bible school at the swimming pool. I feel guilty because I forgot to go to a General meeting; and to a 1 pm class. second time this happened; I have been away from work; I meet Marvin Lewin and some other girl: Frank is late, I call him and he says he is drinking whiskey with Astrid and others. He will be there 3 more hours; I get very mad at him "All you do is drinking (whiskey)... Values my dear, values!" I give him an ultimatum, but awaken before I know what happens.
