I came into work and no one was there, but there were lots of empty pizza boxes and soda cans laying around. I had a green slug in my pocket and I remember picking it up and putting it there. For some reason I didn't want to touch it, so it crawled out of my pocket and stretched very long and climbed onto the counter and then it got really big and fat -- huge. Then there were these two little slugs crawling around and I wondered, "Where did they come from?"
