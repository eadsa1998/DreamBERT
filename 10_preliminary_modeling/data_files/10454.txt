I am sitting indoors taking a test and see many tired, pale faced people working hard; I look out at skaters having fun on a lake and wish I could be out there. I see my fiance from Vienna (Xandi) come in and sit beside me and talk about the test; Father Andrew is talking about monitoring the test; Then X's mother or someone who looks like her) comes to ask him to help deliver flowers to some address; I wonder if we are in Vienna? Xandi is willing to do the errand for her; I ask, "What about the test?" He says he will be back and I watch him get directions as to where to go. Then we get out a crude map of Vienna and look up where we lived as children. He shows me where he grew up and we find out that we grew up within 2 1/2 blocks from each other! We are amazed. A real sense of connectedness. Then he has to leave and I look out sadly and have that abandoned feeling but happy to have connected with Xandi again!
