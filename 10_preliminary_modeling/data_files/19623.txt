A long and complex dream, scarcely any of which can be recalled. The fragment remembered is of a talk between Chester and me. I am sitting at a desk reading from a large, type-written book. Chester is in a chair nearby. He tells me I must change certain of my methods of work, or else lose his friendship and aid. I stubbornly refuse to change, and feel I have burned my bridges.
