I am to nurse a baby. He is to care for. Going to bed, decide should feed child first and start to hunt for his room clad in kimono. It is a large hotel, two turns in corridor, see disordered storeroom, can't find his room, No. 21, for some time. At last there, talking with him while nursing child, don't see baby only my breast but feel it. Ask if he won't carry baby to my room to finish and get it when it has nursed 20 minutes as it would be undesirable for me to be seen in his room in kimono. Start back. Child is mine, 2 days old. Vague impression its father is Q. Trouble in finding my room. Get into public rooms. People stare at my kimono. Suddenly splendid view of see from lanai. Then it's a steamer. Hunting cabin. Then I'm in a trail and mountain club car, middle seat. Only empty seat being held for someone. Ask if there's room for Ile. No there isn't. This is the only car going. Then I can't go for I can't leave the child and I get out of car.
