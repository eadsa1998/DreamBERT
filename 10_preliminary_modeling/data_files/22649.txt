I dreamt that I had prepared a beautiful cake, with frosting and nicely decorated, and I had left it on a table in the dining room because I had to go to the university. When I came back, I found that some little kids (girls) had eaten it and I was extremely angry, so much so that My mother had to make me calm down (thinking it over, I really shouldn't have gotten that upset).
