 I'm in a special plane. I say, "All I want is a safe ride." I don't have a seat; I am standing. We take off. At 50,000 feet the plane turns and dives. I hold onto two objects, on in each hand. My arms are spread out like I'm flying. We keep dropping. I think I am the reason we are dropping, so I try to pull up on the chairs using my arms. It doesn't work. We're at 20,000 feet. I jump out of the plane with a parachute. No one will probably ever see me again. I think we are over an ocean.
