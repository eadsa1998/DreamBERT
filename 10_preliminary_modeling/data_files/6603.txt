I was going for a ride. Heard the Dunlays had returned. I said I must run to the office and see if they had come for they'll be sure to stay at the Donna. Waiting for someone to finish talking, look below curtain and see H. Dun. there. Run over and embrace her. See J. Dun Jr. Hr looks fat and flabby, has no clothes on. His father greets me and says to Jr. "Go on with your sun bath." Talk to H. Dun but she doesn't respond. See she is wearing a big instrument like a telephone receiver at her ear. I exclaim "Oh, what have you done to your ear." It seems she is deaf. Still little response from her. I feel very sad. She doesn't look like H. Dun but she is her. She has very bushy light brown hair with a reddish tinge. I now go for a ride with her and three of my family (The Dun's were old friends and I had just heard they were coming to Hawaii again that summer.)
