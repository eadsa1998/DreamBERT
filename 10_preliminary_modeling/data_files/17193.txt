I dreamt of being within an episode of the X-Files.  Watched something on the screen, and concerned ourselves to the danger it posed us, were it true.  We searched around a run-down house like Silence of the Lambs, but smaller, and a small dirt worn path beneath the windows along the outside.  Then, a blue car.  Going into a store, and my maternal Grandma Jane was going to buy the favors and corsages that my mother chose for a wedding.
