I was in a car with Mom and Ezra. I think Clayton was there. We were talking about movies and Ezra asked "Which Scarface do you like better?" and I was like "What the hell?". A movie was being made in this place. I was walking with some guy. People had tape all over the backs and stuff. I asked someone if that was where they were supposed to get shot. They ignored me. I was standing with these REALLY tall girls. There were two guys nearby and my friend said "fat gay man".
