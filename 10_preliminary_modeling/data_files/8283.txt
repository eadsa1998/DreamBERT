I was working at BCC. We were driving to work, myself and another woman. As we were pulling up we were talking about the one circular drive that people can use to drop someone off or executives can park in the one parking lot off the circular drive. We were talking about the executives only thing. We went to the regular employee parking lot and parked. Myself and this other woman were both wearing business suits. We were walking down the sidewalk to the door. For some reason I got behind her, she got a little bit ahead of me. I had some papers in my hand and my daytimer. I started to run a little to catch up with her. As I was putting my papers in my daytimer. We started skipping. To catch up with her I had to pass a businessman in a suit. We started skipping. I laughed and said, look at us skipping to work. We liked our jobs and were happy to be going to work. This man caught up with us and started talking very surface stuff about going to work. He wasn't very excited about going to work. Apparently his department wasn't doing well. We said something like Well, you should work in our department. There was something about the fact that his department wasn't doing well, wasn't meeting their numbers or something and our department was, plus we said we work in the best department anyway. He said, Really? You work in chocolate? We said, Yep! As we got in the building, he smiled and went through another door to get to his department. We had to go through a different door to go up to our department.
