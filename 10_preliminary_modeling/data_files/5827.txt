[c. 1992] We were only in bed about 15 minutes when I had this dream that an oil tank somewhere was going to blow up. I just knew it! That's the dream where Mary says that I woke up and started shouting: "The oil tanks going to explode!" I remember being around where there was a lot of dirt, we were outside and why I knew that it was going to explode, I don't know. It was warm outside and I felt the dirt. The violence of that dream sent me into a really frightened state. The oil tank never exploded and the plane never crashed and I don't know if the dogs ever died.
