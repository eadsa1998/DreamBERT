I am at a meeting and feel pleased to be included with such excellent people. I am aware that I have the least qualifications of them all. I only have a Master's Degree and I wear a silly hat (like Evangeline's). They are warm and receptive to me. The leader drives up. I change places to the other side of the table. Someone says, "Will he know where the center is?" The woman leader says, "Center stage is where every B is." I feel very happy and pleased.
