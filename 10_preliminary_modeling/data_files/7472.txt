I am in the Treefrog Street apartment (where we had lived before Mary died) and Mary comes running down the hall to greet me. She has a big, happy smile and looks beautiful. But she has gained weight, and her dress is too tight. Mary had always been particular about her attire and this dress was not up to her standards. But I couldn't care less -- I am delighted to see her. I know she had been dead and has returned from the grave. So when I study her, it is for signs of what death has done to her appearance. I am so happy to see her. Other people had come running down the hall with Mary. I do not know who they are -- they might be our children. When Mary enters our apartment, someone is standing beside me. I don't know who it is -- perhaps it is Bonnie.
