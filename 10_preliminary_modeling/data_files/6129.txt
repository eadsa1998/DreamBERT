When I first received this dream sheet, I was a bit nervous on what to write. But after a few nights of thinking about it I had a unique dream. My first dream was that one night I went to this house and knocked on the door. The boy who answered the door was a boy that I once had a crush on. When he asked why I was at his house I said, "Well, I am coming around collecting the Dream Sheets for Dr. Busik. You have to finish yours so I can collect it and pass it in.
