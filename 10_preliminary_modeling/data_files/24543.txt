I'm hanging with a high school crowd. I'm in conflict with a punk, who I knew in real life. The police come. He's now in trouble. After sticking around for a while, I don't feel safe and decide to leave. It's dark and raining. I'm walking in the pitch black through thick vegetation. There's a deep ditch to watch out for. I arrive at a house similar to those of my childhood. I walk through the house to the back door and try to lock it. As I'm doing this, some of the high school crowd arrives. The punk is with them. I tell him he has to leave. We start to grapple. I wake up.
