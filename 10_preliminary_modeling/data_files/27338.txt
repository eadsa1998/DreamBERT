I dreamed I was sitting on the front porch of our cottage. It was dreary and rainy outside. I saw my Aunt sitting on a swing which hung from the ceiling (We do not have any such swing). She had a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on which fitted down over her nose in a peculiar muzzle-like way. I remember particularly a piece of the contraption fitted down the nose, following an indentation between the nostrils, like this. In a wicker stand were some plants which we were admiring. All at once the plants heaved upward, and a pig emerged oinking loudly. We all laughed and thought the pig was darling. We became very attached to the animal.
