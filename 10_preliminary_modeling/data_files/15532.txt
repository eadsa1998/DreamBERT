I was talking to Leif on MSN and sent him a message Benjamin had sent me about Linus, then thought maybe I shouldn't show it. Then Benjamin came online and we talked about Linus. Mom was in the bathroom getting ready to go out. Rover and Spaceman were on the floor and Rover was barking nonstop so I went out to see what was going on.
