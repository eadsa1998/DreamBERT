Last year I was in a university fraternity and belonged to the fraternity choir. When I was 10 I was the altar boy at the church which is one block away from my house. The dream: I was going into the church and saw, when I was near the altar, that my classmates were getting ready on the stairs as we do when we sing. But I had to hurry and put on my white tunic. When I went into the room where the clothes were kept, Father Z. (aged about 40, whom I met when I was 11, kind person, and whom I never saw again until I came back to help in church) was calling a man because the faucet in one of the lavatories had broken and water was coming out. The man arrived, complaining. I called him because the faucet in the lavatory of the room was also broken and water was coming out. But he didn't pay attention to me. I understood this and went out on the street through a door. When I got out, I met a girl X (age about 18 or 19) from the choir. I went out with her and with another guy. When I was out on the street, I got rid of all my clothes while I was talking to them. I felt very good walking naked in the street. When I got home, I saw, or assumed that my mother was there and I covered myself. When I got in, I had already put something on and she was shouting at me for getting home late. I got very angry and wanted to -- and did -- scream, swear, curse, etc. I don't remember more.
