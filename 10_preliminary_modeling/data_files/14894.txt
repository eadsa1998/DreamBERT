Our house had two floors. There was a hole in my floor under my desk. Water shot through. I went and woke Mom and she said she would get Darren up. He came to look. He took the carpet off. There were lots of pen size holes which he thought were caused from where something had fallen. He said I couldn't have the desk here all the time and I said that I couldn't put it anywhere else. He went off and I was trying to work out what to do. I was going to ask why but he had gone back to bed.
