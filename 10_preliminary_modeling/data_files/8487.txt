I sending out a mass emailing to a list that we bought. The email was about the DOP free teleseminar. I don't know of the email actually went out or if I was concerned that it was going to go out before I talked to Jeff K, or maybe it went out and the responses were mostly unsubscribes. I think there was some concern about what we would do if we had too many people register since the call can only handle 150 participants. I was thinking that I needed to call Jeff K before it actually went out to make sure that he and I were both clear on everything and that I understood everything well before it went. I also wanted to make sure that I took time to think through it all well before I told him to go ahead.
