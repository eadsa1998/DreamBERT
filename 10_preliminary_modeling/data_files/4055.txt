["Aliens and Capt. Picard"]  I am in an old run down apartment building. I walk fearfully into my bedroom. There are weird little metallic spiders. Capt. Picard comes in to examine them. He has a detector machine and we hear the things humming a high pitched sound. They gather up in a swarm and come at us. We run. They are aliens and are going to attack us. We get into an elevator. One of the aliens gets in and is plump and white like a small puppy. It tried to sting me. I grasp it and fight it off, throwing it to the floor. One goes for Capt. Picard. We struggle but they win and overcome us. Now we are on their planet, held prisoners. We must escape. I run down old dilapidated halls. They follow. Now one of them looks like a German soldier. He throws me to the ground and lies on top of me to rape me. I push him off and grab him by his toes and drag him down the hall. I see a sign on the wall saying Gender Toes. It means their sexual organs are in their toes. I release him and run to the elevator to escape with the others. I get in, he chases after me, I slam the door. He forces it open. I hit him forcefully. He falls and I escape, just barely.
