 I'm the principal of Carter School. Two teachers are goofing around with their students: taking them places and leaving school. Pressure is on the teachers. In the teacher lounge is my third grade teacher Liza Minikel. There is a bunch of Lucky Charms being shoveled. My friend from high school Binky Ahmed is one of the bad teachers. I find the two bad teachers and the students and tell them that tomorrow morning at 7:30 am will be a meeting with parents, teachers, students, and me. I imply that the students will be suspended for the following day.
