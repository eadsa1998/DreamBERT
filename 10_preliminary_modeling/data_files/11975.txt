I was at Mom's and we heard gunshots nearby so we started hiding our stuff. The people got to Mom's and were messing around at the top of the stairs and I was trying to get Mom to hide my bag. She did, but I ended up getting them out of the house. They were both girls by the way. Mom complained about me having so many animals. I had had a pet sheep called Aaron and I had also had a pig. The moon was big at 12 and when I got Mom to see, she thought I was playing a joke on her.
