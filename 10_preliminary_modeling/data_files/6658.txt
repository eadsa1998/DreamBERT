I was returning from the coast and the boat was nearing Hawaii. Was packing suitcases. Tell the other two in my cabin of the larger staterooms in other boats. They have full length mirrors and wardrobes and beds for each. See parts of wharf passing. Someone tries to come in but they're in the wrong room. Then I catch sight of a paper cap and wonder why I have none. Then realize we had no captain's dinner. I had left my packing and return to find had pilled things in neatly. I try to puzzle out what I had done on this trip as I can't remember any sports or anything else about it.
