Right before waking up I remember standing in the kitchen of that house and my mother and my grandmother were there, that is my mother and her mother and my mother asked; "what would you like to do, go for a walk or go using your wheel chair?" And I was somewhat anxious about going at all, I really didn't want to leave the house, but I thought to myself that it would be easier to use the wheelchair, but I needed the exercise so "I guess I'll walk" I said to my mom, "I guess I'll walk." And I was looking in the refrigerator while I was waiting for my grandmother to be ready to go, because my grandmother was also going to go on the walk with me. I was looking in it and seeing the different foods, and the light, the way it came on in our fridge when I was younger and I could still see. And people were talking, I don't remember who exactly, but they were discussing a recipe which sounded especially unappealing to me, something about some low fat chicken parts or something and my mom was talking about replacing that with beef and how it didn't work very well.
