I was a patient in a hospital. I was going to be released. I accidentally hit a young patient in the face. I was excused. Later I accidentally poked another patient in the face. He thought that I had done it purposely. I was afraid that I would not be released because of the incident. I asked to see the doctor so I could explain that it was an accident.
