We are invited to Brenda's for a Sunday evening get-together; she is vague about the time and does not call to confirm. While we wait, I see Vi Tharaldson (neighbor) walk by like a mailman delivering some flyers. We finally get to Brenda's and I have to go to the bathroom: a very modern and different looking toilet seat, made of wood, with 3 hinges. I shit a large corncob - half eaten! - and it wont flush down... What to do with it??
