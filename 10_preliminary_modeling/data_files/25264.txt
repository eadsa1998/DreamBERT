 I'm at Armstrong High School. There are new rules imposed there to keep people in school until 3:00 pm. Everyone must take at least a half a bite of an ice cream bar. Today's flavor is mint ice cream. For healthier people there are other things to eat. My brother Wally, sister Ramona, and I are there. I talk to a woman who is a bouncer. She says the new principal wants to be promoted to superintendent so he is cracking down on students. I think the rules are insane. Outside the doors I see some girls who play softball and other girls trying to leave school early. They are chased inside by a police car battering ram. It is then 3:00 and we can go. Carefully, the three of us go out. There are men with huge fire hoses spraying water on everything in the parking lot to wash blood off the vehicles and walls, etc. There are two boys that are playing football in the wet grass. One boy pushes the other. There is another kid, who goes out for a pass and flips over a fence and breaks his arm. It looks like a good catch, but he doesn't actually catch the ball. I say, "That's my kind of catch."
