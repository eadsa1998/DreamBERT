We went to Classmate-M-09's house and his room was this shared room full of bunk beds. Tristan was there too and had said Daniel was actually a girl, and I was trying to see if he was until I realised it was just because there were teddy bears and 'girly' things around but we later found out they weren't his. The house from the outside was made of stone and was very rounded and fancy looking. He said his parents used it for their 'clients' (they worked in film) so they didn't have to book hotels. I was walking down the street later, wearing my sunglasses, when this girl said 'hey, Izzy' and I stopped and vaguely recognised her but didn't know who she was. I said as such and looked at her name badge but it didn't ring any bells. She said she went to 'Bush College' and I remembered I had gone there for a month or so in highschool. She was talking about some stuff I'd said and was acting like we were best friends. We were somewhere else later, outside, and people had made some short films and were getting awards. One was for best film made by a 'homeless' person and this guy we had seen staying at Daniel's got the award. I went to the canteen later and it was this round booth that was quite large (looked like those kind of bars in the movies at a beach resort) and I got a ham crossaint. I went to find somewhere to sit and didn't want to sit with Tristan for some reason and saw Emmanuel sitting with some other people at the 'bar' of the canteen, but didn't want to look weird or have to sit with other people. I was annoyed that I wanted to sit with Emmanuel. Later I was somewhere else with a bunch of people from the Technical College and saw Emmanuel again and he said something to me and I said 'shut up Emmanuel' and he said 'shut up Izzy' and then we walked away.
