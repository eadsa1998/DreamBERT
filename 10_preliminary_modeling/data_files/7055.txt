The atom bomb was to go off so we hurried outdoors and down to the beach to see the glow. I wondered if I should have left my handbag. With everyone gone it was a good time for thieves. Before us were quite a number of people lined up in groups along the shore. "Look there," I cried. Streams of bright light coming from beneath a dark cloud but no auroral display. I wondered why they shot the day after yesterday's failure. (We are the household from the Home where I live.)
