We had a school excursion at another school. For some reason I had to drive there and back three times. The carpark was 'squished'. There was a lollipop man who let us across. I wondered why he was there. I had water bottles and was drinking my third one by the second hour. I went to the toilet and the girl's toilet was only open on Wednesdays (It was Wednesday today). I went in but only a few toilets were in cubicles. Mr Stevenson and someone else came in and saw something in the sink. When I came out he accused me of whatever it was, jokingly. Ms Corbett was there too and said something about oranges and China and 'I thought that must've been why you knew so much about China' which had something to do with something that happened at school. Then I was in a bus. I was at back and Eugene and Darius were at the front. I think they saw me looking at Eugene and they moved to the back. A teacher who didn't like Darius argued with him and I took a photo. There was a big flash and everyone looked at me and I pretended like I hadn't known my camera was on. They moved next to me and I was squished. Darius was talking to Eugene about shoes that he'd had with an 'evil' horse on them.
