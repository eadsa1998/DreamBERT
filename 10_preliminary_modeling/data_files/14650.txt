I was playing World of Warcraft. I was fighting some monsters and needed a group. I was then in a shop with Mom. There were costumes there. Mom and I bought some chocolate and it was all melting. The girl behind the counter told us to go back and do something I can't read. There were pieces of paper with stuff written on them. We took them back and the girl had something to do with a special quest on World of Warcraft.
