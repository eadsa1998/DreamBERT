I dreamed I had been walking for hours, but I wasn't tired. The scenery never seemed to change; it was always the same large homes, unkept and musty. I wanted desperately to find some other scenery, but mile after mile showed the same result. I could see myself, too, during the dream and although I was anxious inwardly my face was calm and showed no emotion.
