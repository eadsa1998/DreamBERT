Last night I had a dream that I was underground in some sewer. I was hiding from these assassins. I went home and had to go to class, but I couldn't find anything to wear, honestly. So I had to cut up some of my mother's clothes to wear. When I went to school, I had to make a salad as a test. There was a dressing that would sting you if you poured it wrong. I couldn't remember which dressing it was, but I wasn't supposed to ask, since it was the secret of the test. Pauline was in line inside and I tried asking secretly which one it was, but then I got yelled at!
