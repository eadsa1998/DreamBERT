[1997-08-02] Food again. I was standing in my kitchen at my breakfast bar and I was holding in my hand my largest kettle that I really do own and in the other hand I was holding the cover, I hadn't done anything with them, I was just holding them. I was moving around my apartment stocking feet and I kept stepping on small objects. At one point I stepped on something that was so sharp that I did check to see if I had stepped on a thumbtack and instead it was just a very tiny Lego.
