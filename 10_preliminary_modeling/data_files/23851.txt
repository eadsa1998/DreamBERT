Dreams about controlling things too much, taking on responsibilities, stressful.  Trying to control the outcomes of things, I should just trust that the universe provides and let go control.  I was grinding my teeth all night.  Then - parking at the street of my childhood home.  I was supposed to park down the alley at the neighbors', but they were full. I was in the Bronco (my parents' vehicle).  Jack Nicholson was there.  So I went to our house, frustrated, and told Dad I really wanted a doughnut, could I go get one.  He agreed, I think he wanted one too.  I went to get some, and Jennifer was there at the store/cafe.  But she was choosing a bagel with onions and cream cheese, and I thought that would be better.  We were spending so much time picking the ingredients and critiquing the bread and choices, it was way too self absorbed and picky, I thought, just order something, does it really matter this much?  If only I gave this much attention to my other big choices in life.  Something about choosing not-sweet food instead of sweet, but the dairy was an issue.
