[1997-05-12] I was at a Council of the Blind meeting and I realized I had been sleeping and I realized that I was secretary and should have been taking notes. I didn't know what to do, I didn't have a tape recorder with me, I hadn't been paying attention, and I didn't even have a slate and stylus. I thought, "should I borrow one from somebody?" ^Then T, one of the other members told me that he wanted me to remind him of something, because he had to do it and I thought I didn't know how I was going to do this. I was just appalled that I had been sitting there sleeping in the meeting.
