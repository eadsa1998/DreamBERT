 I'm at an Armstrong High School basketball game. Coach Shooter has an injured elbow. The team has a one game-winning streak. They are about to play Bible College, who is not very good. Chris Rodriguez is in. He is quick, but he misses all his shots. Two girls are in the game for Armstrong too. All the bleachers in the gym are not pulled out. It seems like the basketball program at Armstrong is falling apart.
