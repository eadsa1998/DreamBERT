Mary and I are lying in bed, laughing and fooling around and hugging. Both of us are in a good and happy mood. Then a woman gets out of our bed and says, "Well, I'll leave you kids to have fun " ... or words to that effect. Mary, laughing, yet partly serious, asks me, "OK, Ed, why don't you tell me the truth?" I'm not sure if that is how she phrased her questionto me, but basically her message to me is that she believes I am withholding some information from her. She is asking me to "come clean" about that "something." I become quite worried. I try to figure out what she's getting at. Then the truth of it all came out. Apparently, whenever I had to urinate, I would tell Mary that I didn't have to go. I would defer going to the toilet as long as I possibly could. I was very relieved to realize that it was a silly issue like this that is troubling Mary. I'd hate to think that Mary believes I'm not totally honest with her.
