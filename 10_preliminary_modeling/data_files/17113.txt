I was in a dark room, sitting in groups, like taking notes in class or something.  My online friend Del was sitting diagonal to me.  My classmate Kally sat to my right and leaned over and kissed him.  Del got up.  The teacher was speaking in French.  From above, a cloth dropped in front of my face, and was pulled gently against me.  It was Del standing behind me.  It gave me a calm contentment and comfort compared to the sort of jealousy I felt when Kally kissed him.  "You already know this, don't you?" Del said.  "Then come and I'll show you your room."  He led me away by the hand.  We entered a dark rumpus room, lit only by the TV.  Del is standing to my left.  He moves in front of me and sits on the couch, and I sit next to him so he is on my right.  He asked me a question with several options, but he spoke too quickly and I couldn't hear.  He asked again.  I only heard the last option- his sister's room with the light on.  I lay my left hand lightly on his arm, and awaken in about that same position.
