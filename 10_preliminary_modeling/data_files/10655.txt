Polly, Tina, and Nancy had a party for me in a big arcade. I was shopping there with Nancy and there were two people with a little kid who kept moving the rack. I told him to stop three times and finally I screamed, "Would you just stop it!" His mom wouldn't tell him to stop, so I fought with her. It was a big toy store, clothes store, and arcade with a lot of people. I had to go back home. We had to climb a big hill that was steep. I wanted to go back to the arcade because I forgot my clothes (I was naked except for my socks and shoes). No one seemed to notice and it was a long way down. A kid behind me also wanted to go back because he forgot his hat, but he couldn't go either.
