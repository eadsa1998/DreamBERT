I was in Spain with Mom and Dad, and somehow we got our car over there and we were riding on a bus, and we were riding back to our hotel where our car was. And I was asking the bus driver in Spanish where this mountain with these carvings on it was so that we could drive over to it. And I was constantly translating for Mom and Dad in different places. And then we were in our car and it was like we were driving through an amusement park. It was all kinds of stuff, only it was all in Spanish. And I was constantly translating. And then next thing I knew we were in this auditorium watching this show, and again it was all in Spanish because we were supposed to be in Spain. And the person next to us who was giving us these candies, this box of candy called Blue Bird Song Candies, and it was the oddest, dumbest thing. And then I thought that I had woken up, but I was still dreaming, so I was basically dreaming of waking up. And I dreamt that I was telling Mom what a scary, scary dream I had. And she said, "You have scary dreams almost every two weeks."
