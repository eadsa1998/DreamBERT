I'm in a cinematic narrative - part secret agent, part surreal Kubrick-type film like Eyes Wide Shut. I enter a large house where a party is taking place. Men have to wear a tie to get in. I don't have one but my aunt Catherine gives me one. There's other relatives there too, as well as a large variety of strangers - like a strange wedding party. There are some dangerous characters there trying to kill me, and I have to kill them first. The evening pans out to be a bizarre blind date game where everyone must find a partner.
