I am on a talk show, maybe Phil Donahue and acting as an assistant CO-host, I make jokes with anything at hand and the audience loves me. I'm very funny. The audience is far away. There are pillars or partitions between them and me, but they love me! Phil is impressed and calls me into his office. We chat. I use the label on a package of dried meat to use as a prop to tell jokes.
