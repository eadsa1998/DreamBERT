We had a swan in our back yard, a mother swan and she had three babies. And for some reason, the chicken killed the baby. And everybody was mad at the chicken. Whenever somebody would see the chicken, they'd shoo her and stuff like that. And then I had to go to the bathroom and Mom was telling me to go across the street to the hotel and go up to the second floor and go in and use their bathroom, and I said, "Why can't I just use ours?" So I went around in the front and our double doors were much more ornate than they really are, and I knocked on them and pounded on them until finally she came and opened them. And I think I had the notion that I missed a class again in this dream. And that's really all there was to it.
