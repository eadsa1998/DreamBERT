I am leaving a C. Department meeting, by airplane, only something goes wrong and we have to get out. We land without crashing, but it's close! We are getting out and I check my pockets. I have change, 50-cent pieces and other coins. I have a receipt/ticket to get into the place we are going. I have someone else's ticket too. [BL]
