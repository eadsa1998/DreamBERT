 I'm in or on a vehicle. We go by a man on the street. He is fat, and he is a rapist. I throw a bottle at him and yell some remarks reviling him. We keep driving. I'm afraid the man will come after me. I look back and see him walking a dog. He doesn't look like he's going to come after me. I get home and am scared that the man will know or find me, and will come after me.
