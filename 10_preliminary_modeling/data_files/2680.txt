A family reunion of the V. side. I have photos of some of us as children and people (aunts) want to see them. Someone sees my face and says it reminds them of ___, a cousin or relative. I am amused and say others have said I look like ____, another relative, and as I see my profile, it keeps changing so that eventually we all at some point resemble one another. Everyone is going to use the photos and make historical videos and I see that Aunt Rosalie is the first one to get her crew together (her kids). I hope to use her kids to help make mine later. A man (William B Hurt) is seated, looking at me through his round spectacles (frameless glasses). He has big, serious blue eyes. I walk over to him and say, "I work here. I mean, I'm the owner; what can I do for you?" He seriously hands me a bill for $833 for his services (maybe a plumber or a carpenter). I say, "But I've paid this, I think. Let me check." I find my checkbook, but it's dated 10/3, too early. I find the right one and prove to him I've already paid. He hands me a pen. I take the top off and find a "short ____" in there that somehow represents my relationship with Howard.
