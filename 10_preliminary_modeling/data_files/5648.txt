[1997-06-26] I was at a rehabilitation center for the blind. I had been sent there by my agency to find out if they were wasting the money we spent there for clients we sent there. For instance were they saying that our clients needed more services and not delivering them but only using the money for their own gain? So I was kind of like an investigative reporter. When I was told I had to go I felt kind of strange because I hadn't done that kind of work before and I told my supervisor I don't want to do this, I'm not the qualified person to do this job. He said "you're exactly what we need because nobody will suspect you. In fact we're going to send you as we would a client except you're going to be taking all these notes and asking all these questions and they won't suspect you. Well, I thought about it and I said to him; "All of this will be a challenge, where am I going?" And he said not to the nearby rehab center in Pennsylvania, I was kind of hoping for that one because that's where the Philadelphia Flyers were. He said I know you like hockey, but we're not sending you there and we're not sending you anywhere on the East coast. We're sending you out to Little Rock Arkansas. And I said "Little Rock, Arkansas! The center out there? Its hot and humid here in the summer and you're going to send me out there? " He said, that's what we've decided to do, Mr. Flip, the head of the agency has selected you to go and they gave me the airplane tickets. I recall calling the cab and taking a ride to Dunkirk Airport, which is always a hectic airport to go into and I talked to Sammy, I was saying to her, "now Sammy, I know you don't like to fly, it always makes you a little nervous when we take off and land, once we get up there I know you're okay, but you always get a ,little nervous so you relax." And I petted her and I reached into my purse and gave her a Milkbone dog biscuit and we flew to Little Rock and they announced the plane was landing and I woke up.
