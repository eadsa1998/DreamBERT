I was in Rivertown. I went up Swaney's hill and I looked to see if any of the big trees were still up, but there was none of the old scenery. There was one tree. It was partly uprooted and I noticed it was pruned of its big branches. I looked at the trunk and wondered if the trunks were larger just because I was small and it seemed that way to me.
