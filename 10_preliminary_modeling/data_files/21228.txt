I shut the door in Carter's house and the wall started to crumble. I went into the room and Mrs. Carter Sr. knocked down a chair or something and the burning coals fell on the floor. I was out at night driving and the car turned out to be a buggy. A truck like the one we have for rubbish in the shop came by. I hitchhiked and the boys stopped and picked Audrey and me up. The truck was full of boys smaller than Audrey. Ann and I wet to bed and we left a night light on. I stood by a closed closet door and it opened up by itself and gave me a start. I thought of spooks. I made the sign of the cross and it closed, then opened and closed again and again at the sign of the cross or motion of my hand. Ann was driving a car. I looked at the steering wheel and noticed it was not mine. I said, "You are using Carter's car." When we drove by Carter's, they said, "We saw you drive away with the car." Ann cried and I said, "You are lucky you didn't get shot." I went to the bookie and a girl said, "You have a winner hooked."
