Bonnie and I are offered a job. We take it, thinking, "This will be a cinch!" As we walk toward the lake with our male guide, I start to feel uneasy and unsafe. I am on a wooden sidewalk and as I get close to the lake I see a huge and horrible monster like a giant squid thing in the lake. I realize this man guide is not going to be able to keep me safe and I can't back out of the job. I am very afraid and try to hide behind a door. The monster comes out of the lake and now is a very tall and huge man. He comes to collect and eat the women who have been hired to dance and entice him out of the lake. Even though another woman is dancing, he sees me behind the door and comes after me. I run and find a town. I become a dancer on stage. I realize it is time to go back to the monster. I start to go back, but decide I can't do it and go hide. I am going home, but I'm peeking through the door cautiously for fear the monster is there. I think I smell him, but it is Grandpa Lloyd. Then a door opens to the dining room and I see my parents. I think, "Oh no, not them. I'm not ready to meet them yet."
