Not too clear, but apparently I was going to fly somewhere or had flown and had a really big, bright green suitcase and it had been stolen , and I was upset because a great many of my valuable personal items were in it. And there was an elderly lady standing by who was very sympathetic and gave me an envelope with a 100 dollar bill inside which I tried to refuse and she wouldn't listen so I took it and as I was leaving her she handed me a 50 dollar bill and rather than argue with her again, I accepted it and her name was Mildred, and I believe her husband was standing beside her and what concerned me the most and... ahh, I was going to fly out, this was at an airport, it was a long concourse, not with a lot of people around, but a few and my biggest concern was that my ID had been stolen and in that case I could not get on the plane.
