The dream was about Princess Diana and Prince Charles. I was Diana's best friend and she and the prince were going through an awful divorce. Charles was bitter with Diana and was terrorizing her, threatening to take and kidnap the children. One afternoon Diana and I returned to her palace and found a note from Charles saying that he had killed the smaller child and left the older one because he was going to be king someday. I remember running through a forest with Diana saying that she was going to kill Charles. Then I woke up thinking about how ridiculous this dream was.
