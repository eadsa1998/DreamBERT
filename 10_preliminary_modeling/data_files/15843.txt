I was supervising something like Kathmandu at night. I had 12 people or so on the job, but when I arrived I realised I had only 2 guns and I hadn't charged them (or the ones I'd left at home). Esther turned up with 6 guns or so but I was panicking. I got some people started scanning in the back room and went to get the files on the laptop. When I went to check on people, everyone without a gun had been sent home. Hugo turned up at one point to see if we needed help but I said we didn't have any extra guns anyway.
