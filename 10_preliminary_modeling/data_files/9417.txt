I am riding a bicycle over deep ruts in heavy traffic, very dangerous. We are living in a small apartment without a sink. I see Edward and Marita in the bathtub; sexual play. I say it is disgusting. Shift: We are riding on a ferry. I am with M. (old lover) and his pregnant wife. Excited by M's presence. But we have no privacy and Edward comes in and I realize I have a husband and a child. Feel lost.
