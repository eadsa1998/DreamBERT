Dad and I ended up somewhere and found this cheap hotel. There weren't many people. We got room 12. We got to where it was supposed to be, but there was a just a wall with a kitchen look to it and an oven. There was a thing at back to turn and I was worried about flames. It clicked and opened and there was the room. It had stingy blankets.
