We were entertaining a large group of elderly ladies. A.B. was there. I began to speak to one but Miss W. asked me to go into the kitchen and take the potato rolls from the oven. I do other things first and then realize I had better get things from the stove lest they be overdone. Find some rolls well done. The potatoes I had thought baked were browned mashed. One lady wanted a large helping of the potato dish but I tell her it's for supper, not for the party.
