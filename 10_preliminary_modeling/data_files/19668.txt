Faye and I are at the dining hall of some hotel (possible Aunt Addie's in my hometown). There is a whining hum in the air, evidently the noise from several vacuum cleaners which are being used in various rooms. Some time ago a fire, or threatened fire, happened at hotel, and a good deal of water was squirted in by the fire company. This made the rooms and furnishings damp, and $50,000 is needed to remove the musty odor from the drapes which are made of very thick, dark colored material. The hotel plumbing also is in need of attention and repair. Faye says it is the renovation of the drapes chiefly that will be expensive. I reply, yes, like those on the book case. (Each book case has a strip of the drape material hanging across the front). Faye explains it is the long drapes more particularly that are musty. Faye and I get ready to leave. I head for the toilet room, though some girl tells me she has just come from there and found it crowded with people. However, I go anyway, and find the room empty. The entire place is filthy and foul smelling, with not a clean or dry place to stand. I urinate into a large tank of water. Just then a man enters but leaves immediately as he wants to stand exactly where I am standing. Soon after I am walking west in hometown past the Brooke house. There is a light in the house, but I see no one about. There are 2 or 3 pasteboard boxes visible on a table in the east room. It is just 6 o'clock and I fear the people are preparing or eating super; though, on second thought, the day being Sunday, most people probably ate early in order to have plenty of time to get ready for church services. They are probably wiping dishes at this time, I thought. I seem to have started out to call on either Anna Brook, Anna K, or Wilma Keck. I keep on walking and detour to the right enough to go through a part of Hess' yard.
