I am sitting on Abner's lap and we are lovey-dovey. We are going to get married. We are at a hotel, room #72. It's time to clean up from breakfast and I decide to clean up the dishes and utensils for Abner and me. I realize this is very wife-like and I say to Abner, smiling, "I'm only going to do this three times a year." I don't want him to think this will be normal operating procedures! I take a pile of utensils to the kitchen area and ask where to put them. I realize I could have left all this for the staff, seeing as how we paid for our room. The staff is already coming into the room to prepare it for the next guests. Now I get to choose a free gift and I'm looking at some pages to see what's available. I can't make much sense out of the words and there aren't any pictures. I see a wooden book holder with a light and a magnifying glass to read books more easily. I like that. Someone shows me one without varnish and it has two dishes with a pink liquid in it. I decide to take that one.
