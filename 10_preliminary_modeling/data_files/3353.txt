I am in a house and the landscape is black and toxic as though black clouds came down and covered the ground. I want to walk over to Dora's house (two or three down the way) and am warned not to walk on the black clouds because they won't hold my weight and they are poison. So I find some cement beams like a curb side and I walk on it to the house. I go in and find Dora vacuuming and cleaning house. I feel a bit uncomfortable and apologetically say, "I've done that kind of thing too, sort of." I look out the window and see a black, toxic cloud sky coming towards us. It fills the entire sky and then suddenly it passes and a brilliant green, fresh spring landscape is there. It is beautiful and I want to go out, but I don't quite trust it, having come from the black cloud formation passing over it.
