I'm going up the stairs in a tall 3 story house. Everywhere I look, people are in some kind of orgy, sex, drugs, etc. In a room at the top, I see a sign that says, "Don't disturb" or "Don't look." I look anyway. It's a male client, older, engaged in sex with a woman. The thoughts are, "Good, he's now able to enjoy it, older and wiser." [BL]
