I was attending some kind of sporting event in a big stadium.  The people just kept packing in-the figure 60,000 sticks in my mind.  Pretty soon it was crowded that I couldn't see anything, and I even became nervous about the crush of people, so I left.  There was no way to get out through the people, though, so I dropped down under the stands to escape.  A lot of other people were also trying to leave, and there were a lot of young punks around, many of them with knives, terrorizing people and trying to prevent them from leaving.  Four or five of them joined hands across my path, and I was really worried, but then, for no apparent reason, they let me through.  All around me, though, these thugs were throwing knives at people and at each other.  It made me very nervous, but for some reason I was spared.   It was night as I left, and on my way to wherever I was going I passed beside an elementary school at the top of a terrace.  At the bottom was some girl I knew-Phyllis Rogers, possibly.  We spoke, but I don't remember what about.
