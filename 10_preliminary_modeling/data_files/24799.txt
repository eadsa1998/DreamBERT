Me and Robin went on a date with these two 15 year old guys. They turned out to be jerks who just wanted to kiss us and stuff. Robin is a good friend of mine. In the dream, a car fell off the roof and Patty broke her leg. I never finished the dream and it was really weird cause I'm going out with an 8th grader now and I thought they were the same guys. Setting: At this humongous movie theater with couches for seats. Characters: Robin, a friend from school. Bill, also a friend. Patty, a first-grader. These two guys that seemed like brothers but they were weird. And Glenn, my friend. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry. Happy at first to be on a date with a guy and we were holding hands. I was angry because on the second part he didn't sit next to me.
