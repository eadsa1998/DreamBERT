My sister Lori and I were at the dad's house. I was looking for a pair of pajama pants. I couldn't find mine so I asked Lori if I could borrow a pair of hers. She said, "Sure," but when I tried them on they were too small for me... Then me and Lori were at a beach in San Diego. We had been drinking and smoking pot. Dave (a former T.A. of mine) was there teaching a class. He was smoking a joint. Everyone at the class was stoned. I put my arm around Lori and said, "Isn't this great. I knew you'd like it in San Diego."
