I dreamed that I was an old man, happy and good and I had my children and grandchildren and lived in the same place I live now. I had a son aged 17 who had problems and was always crying, and I gave him advice. He thought that looking at the mirror he turned old and ugly. Then a star appeared to him (shining) and a very beautiful girl came out and told him, "Don't worry, your face is not ugly or old. Be calm. You are going to be happy and very rich." Then I was at the beach with a group of friends (M &amp; F). One of the girls was in love with me, but I felt a great pain and I woke up.
