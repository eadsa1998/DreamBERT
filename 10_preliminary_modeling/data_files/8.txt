I'm somewhere with a friend I don't want to be around much and going back to her house and then elsewhere on errands. She asks me to take something with me to return to the library. At her house I see her mother and stepfather. (Rather young and both attractive.) They're both in a hurry to get somewhere too, rushing about. I seem to want to stay, or I want something from them, and am reluctant to go out the door - but I do, and stick my head back in several times with one last question. Then I remember the library - the things to take back are very large magazines ("American Baby"?) And even have "return to Marty" written on the front - Marty is the mother - so I say to her, "don't you work right by the library?" and she says yes, she'll take them for me, so that was nice. I can almost remember where she worked, someplace like an aerospace or computer office, standard modern waiting room, light colors, plants, etc.
