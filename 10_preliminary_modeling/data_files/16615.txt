We were in the ____________. When we first went in, it kind of seemed like the Cracker Barrel, but as we were walking around, it kind of turned into a Walmart. Derek was looking for some kind of book that he wanted to give Dad. Dad was generally being a cranky jerk like he can be sometimes. He was looking for like, I don't know, paint or something and Mom was looking for something too, and I was just kind of like bored to death, not sure what to do. And I got the feeling we were not in Westportrsburg. I got the feeling we were like in Centerville or something, although I wasn't going to school. We were doing something, some kind of one of those trips that we used to do of something, and I was looking around and I was seeing these different stuffed bears and things. And I was trying to think to myself how I wish I could just go home. I'm going to think for a minute what else there was to this. I was really angry in this dream because of how Dad was acting. I don't remember anything he actually said, but he was doing that thing where he was taking a kind of a little thing and blowing it out of proportion, where something that was not _____________, he was taking to make Mom feel like she was being selfish just because she wasn't thinking of him like 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And, like I said, we were out somewhere in some of the city, and I was thinking how I had the notion my _______ might leave the store and walk somewhere and how long _______ had the car keys, and how I wanted to go home so bad. And I was thinking to myself in this dream, you know, it's like ___________ hard to get home. And then, well, I wasn't really feeling like I could drive in this dream. I was just feeling like if I wished hard enough, I could get the car to go home all by itself kind of a thing. [laugh] But then somehow things changed in this dream. I don't know how it went from a Walmart store to being at a Jungle Park like type place, but it did. Mom and Dad and Derek were still busy diddling in the store, but somehow I found a way to like get outside to this path that was very much like Jungle Park, and I was walking around through these different paths and bushes and things, and just being outside, I felt so much more at peace. And being away from everybody, I felt a lot better. And I heard this harmonica player. I couldn't really tell where he was, but he was on one of the bench pavilion things and he __________________. And I went around again and I came to a flamingo exhibit that, you know, they don't have any more animals any more, but that used to be the fun of going there, to see the animals. And so there were two flamingoes that had flown outside the exhibit, but I could climb on the rocks and I could climb down inside the exhibit to go and see them. And they all came up to me. They were the most tame and gentle birds you could ever know. And I was petting them, and there was this one I picked up, and they were just really tame and they made me feel much better. And then somehow I was back up on the path again and there was a really sweet flamingo _______ just standing there. It wasn't going in the exhibit. [laugh] And then there were these dogs, these little puppy dogs that came along in this park ___________ and kind of scared them. And then I woke up.
