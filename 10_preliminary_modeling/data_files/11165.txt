I was in a second story room located above a building. A number of girls were in this room playing a kind of golf game. My psychology professor was sitting watching these girls play and I went toward him, sat down and started to talk. Then I found myself pushing a cart down in the flats (Scranton Rd.) After making a left turn, I had to cross a bridge. The bridge was closed, making it possible for a boat to pass. But I was going to try and get across before the boat came near. However, there was a long stump of wood across the bridge which made it impossible for me to go over. At this time the professor came to me and said something. Later in the dream I was with one of my girlfriends here in the dorm, but do not know where we were. We were just talking.
