I was in a library like room. I read Paths of Glory and the movie had George Clooney in it, but then it was Bruce Campbell. I went to class and sat at a desk and they were collecting something that I can't read. I had six and someone took some and then I had three. Some girl mentioned Gossip Girl and I followed on saying "is retarded, yeah" and people laughed. There was something about a pack which had effects and something about a murderer.
