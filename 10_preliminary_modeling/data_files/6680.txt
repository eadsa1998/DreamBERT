I have reservations for an A.A.U.W. supper but have forgotten. It is at the University and I can make it but I have two other engagements which if I dine, I may not be able to make. I may have to call up Mr. -- and tell him I can't play chess as promised. I am dressed as I would but start to assembly point. See B's colorful prints coming, Mrs. St. J. [I do have two conflicting dates for the 16th.]
