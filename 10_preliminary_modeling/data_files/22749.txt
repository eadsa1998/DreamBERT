I was at home and my uncle and 16-year-old brother appeared there. My uncle is a brother of my father who comes to the house on Friday evenings and leaves Monday mornings. I remember that my brother and my uncle were having an argument and that I was questioning everything my brother said. That is, I was taking part in the discussion to his detriment. (In real life they always have arguments.) That's all I can say about this one; I don't remember any more.
