I was trying to find some pictures on the SAID website that I was looking for to download. I was having trouble finding them. I finally did find them, or at least some of them. But they were all part of this file that I had to download. In this file there were also a lot of the graphics that were used to create the website. After I finally found the file and downloaded it I was going through it trying to delete all of those graphic images that I didn't want or need so I was left with just the pictures to go through. Maybe I was going to go through those as well and delete the ones I didn't want.
