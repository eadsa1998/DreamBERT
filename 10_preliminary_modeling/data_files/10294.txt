In a car with many friends and young boys; one of the boys is my son who tries to squeeze in next to one of the older boys; finally I take him on my lap. It is a SCARY ride over cobblestones, but we arrive OK. Later the little boy puts fistfuls of food into his mouth and cries; I pull a strand of hair out of his mouth..
