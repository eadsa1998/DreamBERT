[3rd dream] Getting dressed to go with mother to lunch. The shower has some junk in it which I remove. Start showering without closing the door and see L. coming upstairs. It's 11:30. I'll have to hurry. A maid comes in the room and drops towels in the shower so the towel gets too wet to use. I try to dress, use toilet but make little progress. Maid comes in with letters, which she throws into the tub. I tell her to get them out immediately or the ink will run. She picks out a Chinese copybook with large characters. It's Rae's.
