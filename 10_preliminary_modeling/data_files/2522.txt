I go to the house in T City. A man and woman, married, are there and very upset with each other. She cries and is despondent. She wants to leave him. I counsel her to stay. It will blow over. I get in the car and drive away, only the ocean is across the road and high waves are coming. I throw the car in reverse and back up quickly, back to the house. I go in to discover the two have killed each other, a murder/suicide thing. I am guilty, sad and upset. A small little girl cries. We have to stay the night because the road is blocked by the water. The girl is afraid to stay, but I console her, saying it will give us time to get used to it and forgive and learn to not be afraid of it. The next morning the man's spirit appears and forgives us. We go in peace.
