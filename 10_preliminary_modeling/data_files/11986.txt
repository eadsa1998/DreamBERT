Mom was getting married but I don't know who to. We had Tinkerbell, Tigger, Mittens, a dog and a bird in the car. Mittens was in the glove box. We had just come back to the car from somewhere. It was a hot day and Mittens needed water. Mom was telling me about when she got her wedding dress and how she didn't look very fat in it. Then we pulled up at some marriage motel thing. Mom told me the people liked playing jokes. We got there and there was a sign that said something like 'Don't park too close to the water'. A car was parked really close to the sign and then a lady ran out saying "Oh, sorry!" and she moved her car. It was a joke, but I didn't get it. We went inside and we were booking in or whatever and she said no cats were allowed, and then that no pets were allowed. Then she pulled out a fish, a cat and a dog. I said to Mom that it seemed weird that what she had pulled out were opposites of ours. I told the lady it was a joke and she was denying it and she left. Then her sister came in and let us up. The dog went behind the counter and she looked at us angrily and I thought she was going to say "no dogs", but she let us up. I was getting food for the dog when I noticed it was pooing and looked sick. I thought it was another joke so I went downstairs to ask them what their problem was, but I woke up.
