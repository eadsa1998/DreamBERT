Dad bought this house. I didn't know until Nana said "Have you seen your new house yet?" and I was like "Huh?" Dad showed me and it was one we'd been to before (in the dream). There was a library in there. I wanted to get a book out but you had to fill out an application. I was yelling at Dad for buying it. Ezra was walking down the street, and we were in a car. He was behind us and was going to get in the car with some shifty dudes. He took a guitar off them and I was calling for him not to get in the car with them, but I don't think he could hear me.
