I was either on Big Brother, or knew some of the Big Brother people. I knew Helen (BBUK 2014) and we had not gotten along, but we had each other's numbers. Anyway, I was on a job that Esther was running. It was like a 2-storey chemist or Priceline. I had a text from Helen saying 'hey you should check out this website, you'll love it' and I thought it seemed spammy, but I opened the link and it was some random site. I got a call from her but couldn't take it as I was being briefed by Esther. I took her phone for some reason and also went downstairs with my phone as Helen called again and I answered. She said to ignore the text and I said 'the spammy one' and she said yeah. I said something awkwardly, but politely, like 'was there anything else' and she repeated what I said with a sound of disgust in her voice. I said 'hello?' but she didn't respond. I could hear an indicator and realised she was driving. I kept saying hello but got no answer. Then Hugo was there and a bunch of other people who turned out to be Esther's kids - one of the guys was quite attractive. They were messing around and I took out Esther's phone and took a photo of them and they wanted it deleted but I said no, and one was playfully trying to get it back and saying I'd sent it to myself and I said I hadn't, but then thought I should so I did so while they tried to get it back. Esther then came down and looked sick and then vomited quite violently. She muttered something about needing her phone and I gave it back to her.
