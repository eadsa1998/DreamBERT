I always wanted to drive a standard automobile. My friend has a standard Mustang GT. He let me drive it a couple of times to learn how to drive a standard. One time when he let me drive, my brother, my friend and he (the car's owner) were in it. It was a snowy day. The road had snow on it. There was already like 6" of snow on the ground. The snowbanks were high. As I was driving and turning a corner, I was switching gears, and I slid into a snowbank and put a dent in my friend's Mustang.
