I was at a shop, or a shop-like place. Laura Roslin (Battlestar Galactica) was there and she was the president. I was friends with her. I was paranoid about some work of mine, for Communications, and went to ask her if she could copy it and put a presidential stamp on it so it was known that it was mine, but she said she couldn't.
