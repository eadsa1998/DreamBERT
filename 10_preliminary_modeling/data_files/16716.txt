I remember walking into physics class, and my teacher letting me make up a test. In the dream she told me specifically, "You got so many problems wrong, it wouldn't be fair to let you do the test at home, so you'll have to get at least a couple problems done now." I remember thinking, "WHY DOESN'T SHE TELL US ABOUT THESE THINGS BEFOREHAND!" I'm searching for my problems, and a pen and everything and I couldn't even find everything. Then, I remember her giving me a paper that said pretty much, "I'm very disappointed in you, I don't even know why you're here." There was something else in this dream sequence, something a little more positive (maybe it wasn't, but that's my waking impression).I don't really remember that part. I just remember it was a trip somewhere with some girl who's identity I'm unsure of. I don't remember why, with whom, or anything about it.
