 I'm at my house, at home. There is a dragon on the south side of the house. I don't see it, but know it is there. I'm on the north side. In a window well are valuables: electronics, pagers, cash in purses, wallets, etc. I take these. There is some kind of a plan that I am a part of. There are other people working with me. Among them is my friend Persia Miko. We are going to pull something off, to do something. It may be a prank involving taking things. We may give all the stuff back after it is over. We all meet in a room, which feels like the old lunchroom at Carter School. We talk about our plan. My grade school principal, Candy Bevner, is in the room and hears us. I know this but we still talk about it. Everyone leaves. I'm the last one to walk out the door. As I do, Candy Bevner says, "Kenneth Hanson and Fred Slick, I want to talk with you!" Fred isn't there. I walk back. I'm not supposed to be taking part in this plan: it is against the rules. I say to Candy Bevner that we do it every year, or that it happens every year. She makes me come to school two hours early the next day, for detention at 5:30 am. <br/
