Dream Fragment. I am in a war. A plane of unknown origin flies overhead. It is identified as hostile and anti-aircraft guns begin to fire at it. The plane circles around in the cloudy sky and begins to drop bombs. The explosions are sharp and devastating; fountains of earth raise high up and fall back to the ground. There is a firestorm of smoke and flame. I run and become engulfed in the haze. I find a clearing and find my dog. Recollection ends here. I wake up anxious.
