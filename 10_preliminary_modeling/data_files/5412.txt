Last night I dreamed that I was at some combination of my high school and my college and there was an end of the year spring dance. I was hanging out with Kim, Jessica, and Julian beforehand. My date was someone from my high school, but I can't remember who it was. Some boys from my high school were there. I was really anxious because I thought I was being stood up. I had bought a really flashy, silver dress that was really low cut, and I guess I only just realized that it was too low cut. Then I woke up.
