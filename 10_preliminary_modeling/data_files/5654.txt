[1997-07-02] I was walking in the woods. It was springtime birds were singing, the sun was out, I could feel it on my face. I could smell the pine trees and the different scents of the different trees. I could also smell some of the wild flowers that have that sweet. Real sweet kind of perfume smell. And I was just walking by myself, no one else was around, I was walking, my guide dog was with me, and we were just going through the woods. We passed a little brook and I listened to the rippling sound of the water and decided to sit down because there was a tree there and it was shady and I decided to take a rest. I fell asleep near the tree and then I woke up and continued on my way in the dream, and kept walking through the woods. I decided to go home, I looked at my Braille watch which was on my wrist and discovered it was afternoon, so I walked back home to my condo.
