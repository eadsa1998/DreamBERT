This family had moved into a new house. There was a cat and a dog and they were weird looking and were staring at it. The kids ran into the house. Then the father was actually dead, but they could see him. There was a building nearby that had a public toilet sort of feel and there were vending machines in it. Some guy wanted to get some Picnics for his friend. The father was getting the Picnics and he got in trouble with the police. Someone asked the guy what his pets were called. It was Bellick (Prison Break).
