A beautiful girl had completely fallen in love with me and told me some beautiful things. Since it was the first time I felt something like it, I felt as though I were floating in the clouds. With shaky hands, I touched her face and almost stammering. I just couldn't believe this beautiful moment. I kissed her and embraced her passionately. I was so sentimental that I even cried with emotion.
