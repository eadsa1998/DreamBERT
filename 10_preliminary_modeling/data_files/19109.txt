Roger and I were working together on some project, and it seemed as if he were the boss and I was his employee. At one point he had become annoyed over something I had done, and he shouted at me, did I realize how insolent I was behaving and how dare I have the nerve to have said or done something or other? I was surprised at his reaction because it was such a strong one, and I asked him how in terms I had behaved this way. He said to come into his office and he would tell me. As we were walking thru this one door, I was saying to myself that I didn't feel I had been behaving as nervy as he had suggested, but that he seemed very angry and might fire me, or something of the sort. Then I thought no, he can't fire me, or he shouldn't fire me, because I had been doing good work for him, and he needed some of the skills that I had. <br/
