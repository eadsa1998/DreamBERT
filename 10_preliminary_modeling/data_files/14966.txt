I was at a school. A guy who looked like Cory Monteith was flirty and nice to me. The day after I met him, I found this thing on a locker that said that guys got points for how far they got with girls. He also got a wheelchair and was using that (for sympathy?). I went through the locker. After school there was like a party. Cory was in the wheelchair and I wheeled him down a hall. I stood on the back wheels which was fun. The doors were all locked. We went back and he got up and walked in. He gave something to some girls. Two girls kissed.
