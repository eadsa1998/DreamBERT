I went to the newsagency with Mom. The guy behind the counter was kinda hot and was called Warren. He had given Mom something on World of Warcraft. She said she hadn't used it yet. There was a joke about me and someone who looked like me "can't tell the difference". I got the Dolly diary and it had green and blue stripes. There were two versions, one with the blue on top and green on bottom and vice versa. I went outside and Roland was there and was wearing a Spongebob shirt. There was a dog in the back of our car and he was called Roland. I thought it was weird that I hadn't noticed. Ezra said he thought he had gotten bitten by a spider. I flicked through the diary and there was a picture of Jensen Ackles in the back. Ezra was watching TV later and this show came on called 'Sullivan Bro's', which was like a spin-off from Heroes.
