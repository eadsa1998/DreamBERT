Errol is here to help me. Anastasia told him to do so. I am seated on a couch in a living room. He wants to talk. To tell me about himself so I'll trust him and have me talk about what I need. I feel self-conscious but he's a genuine nice guy so I relax and let him help. Meanwhile, Sunny comes to visit and I need to help her. She's had another baby. I comment I could have been more help before she got pregnant, but I'll work with what I've got. I start talking about Assertiveness training. I remind her she knows this stuff and just needs to remember and use it. A group of people are there.
