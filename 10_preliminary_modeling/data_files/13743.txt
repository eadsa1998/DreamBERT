I was reading a little red book. It had random stuff in it, but also had a Twin Peaks thing in it. I was reading it, but watching it. Truman went to some barn after Josie died and there was a problem with insurance. The next day, they found Truman dead, slumped over a window. Dale Cooper (sometimes it was me) was in this other barn with some others trying to work out who killed him. There was a photo of Jack Nance in the book as Pete. Darren came out and the Log Lady was there and Darren was saying stuff about who killed Laura Palmer and that it was obvious and I was thinking 'they already solved that'. I was at home and Dad wasn't feeling well. The next day it was freezing cold and we had heaters on. Dad was in his room and he had this really bad cough and was sweating like crazy. Ezra was on his laptop. Dad went into my room and took a notebook of mine to read and I was like 'what the hell are you doing?'.
