We are traveling to Europe on a tight budget: Cindy is along and seems to have enough money for everything she wants; I am slightly jealous of her. Frank and I have breakfast alone, but he goes off without telling me where; I try to find him at his class, but he is NOT there; I hear some Shakespeare recited; then I see Frank walking with a tall, curly-haired brunette; I get angry at him and yell an obscenity; he leaves her and comes over to me.
