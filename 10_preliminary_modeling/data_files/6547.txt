Bombs explode in yard and set things afire. Go over to boys' school for dinner. Afterwards tell Cousin Newton. Come back to find mob guarded by few guards at gate, fence torn down and regiment coming up to sound of bugle to help. One of mobs starts for me, grabs arm but is called back. Turns out all right. At missionary gathering in America. Dressing for reception.
