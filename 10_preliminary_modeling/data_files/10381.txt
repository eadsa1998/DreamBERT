On a BICYCLE trip with WALLY and large group of people; we come to a lake. "Is this Lake Genessaret? "Yes" "Can we take the ferry across?" "Yes" "And how long does it take?" "About 10 minutes, or you can take a trolley around the lake and that takes a half hour." We decide to take the ferry: vivid image of waves lapping at the shore. We stand in line to get our tickets and put our bikes in special stands; we have to wait and while we wait Wendy beckons me to come to eat in a nearby cafeteria. The ferry is due in about half hour.
