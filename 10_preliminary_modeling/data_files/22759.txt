Last night I dreamed that a group of boyfriends and girlfriends were in the living room at my home. I got together with them the other day. I was inside and didn't know who was there. I came out and saw that one of the boys was throwing water from either his mouth or his nose. I went over to him and it was the boy I like. I and a friend who knows about first aid went inside and she told me that talcum was good for that. We took it out and went back to the living room. I looked at him and was very worried and wanted to fondle him, but all I could do was look at him. Then Esther, my friend, gave him a spoonful of cologne instead of talcum. He took it and then I took his hand and asked him how it tasted. He told me it was horrible. He withdrew his hand and we continued to talk and he looked better. I don't remember any more, but I felt very upset, and when I awoke I felt very sad, I don't know why.
