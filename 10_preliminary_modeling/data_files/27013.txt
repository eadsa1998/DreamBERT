After the alarm clock rang, I apparently dozed off to sleep again and I remember hearing my father-in-law and the maid talking outside our door as to whether or not to call us. So, in a loud voice I yelled, "We're awake". When I actually did wake up, I asked my husband whether he heard me yell and he said he didn't. Neither were my father-in-law &amp; the maid talking outside our door. It seemed so real, that it was hard to believe that it wasn't.
