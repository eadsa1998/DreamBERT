The next thing I know, I'm in this big, fairly dark room, and my old female teacher, Mrs. Jones, is there. It was right before a school trip to Vacation State, and I looked at the clock-- as soon as I looked at the clock, the hour hand went around the clock faster than a second hand normally would. Distorted time is an interesting thing in dreams- it's probably where Salvador Dali got his idea for the painting. Anyway, before I know it the Vacation State trip is over and I missed it. I saw Mrs. Pappas outside after that and she asked me why I wasn't there. I don't remember what I told her, but I didn't mention the distortion of time in the dream, it seemed completely normal like, "oh no, there goes time again" and it was my fault I missed the trip.
