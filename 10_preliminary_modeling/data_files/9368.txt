I'm walking across a field, undulating and tall grasses. My friend Patrick comes up to me and looks handsome with fine forehead. He smiles and is immediately not as handsome--teeth uneven and sharp like little fangs of a snake or devil. He comes close and wants to kiss me. I'm shocked because I know he's dead. He's a ghost, handsome as he looks. I turn my head, for fear of what I'll see when he becomes a corpse or skeleton again. He whispers in my ear, "I want to suck you, go down on you. And you do the same to me." I want to break away, but he holds me strongly in a grasp, as I continue to look away and keep eyes closed. Then I break his grasp and I wake up, holding myself with crossed arms and a pillow against my stomach and groin, lying on left side.
