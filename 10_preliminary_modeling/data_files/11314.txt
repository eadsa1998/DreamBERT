I was playing volleyball. It seemed that the game was held on the lawn of a cousin's house. The other participants were unknown to me however we seemed to be talking back and forth. Then we all entered a house which apparently belonged to my cousin, however I have never seen this building before. We all sat down and indulged in various activities some listened to the radio, others danced, while still others just sat and had something to drink. I recall holding a glass of something in my hand, but I don't believe that I actually drank any of the contents. After this some of the people announced they were leaving. I decided that I should stay for the night. There were members' of both sexes present.
