Tony Schnurer and I were in a class. Apparently we were just studying with this large group of students. The class wasn't instruction. There was no instructor or anything, just all sitting around studying, and I was studying with Tony. I went to look for some notes. We were studying respiration, and the only thing I could find were these notes with hemoglobin showing regular hemoglobin tied up to meth-hemoglobin in such a way that the regular hemoglobin was no longer functional, and I looked at several sheets of paper and they all had the same thing on it. Then I went back and some of Tony's friends had come over, and he introduced me to this girl. Her name was Linda or something like that. I said hi. She was sitting where I was sitting, so I moved her chair over and sat down next to her. I started to talk to her. Then an instructor arrived in the room and started talking and everybody had to be quiet.
