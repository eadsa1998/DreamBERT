We came down the hill. Many groups were on the picnic grounds. I went to a shady place on the left and tried to settle there. People next objected but I showed there was room. A boy offered to bring a chair, a low red rocker. You can't sit in these small bamboo chairs. I wondered where the rest were. Only Jo. present. Then I spied mother in lavender and pink print. "Now I can find out where the rest are." Mother tells me she had come down for baby chits. She could then get gifts for new children. She told me all the rest had been invited to a big dinner and wouldn't be coming. I said we had much food ready and what should we do with it? "Why aren't Jo. and I invited?" "I thought they wouldn't have room for all and their own family too." Then I ate a thick chicken sandwich and said I'd like half a one of beef.
