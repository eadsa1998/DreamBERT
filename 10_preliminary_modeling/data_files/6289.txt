[This is the most recent dream I have had.] The dream has to do with a Baybank automatic teller machine. One day I went to take some money from one of the Baybank ATM's. This ATM ran out of paper to record the transaction of "fast cash." I was eager to know how much I had left in my account. But because the ATM ran out of paper, I couldn't tell. I made purchases with my Baybank Mastercard that allowed the store to bill my account. I was a bit nervous maybe there was not enough money in my account, I thought. I wasn't sure whether the bank paid the store or not. So this confusion led me to dream about the ATM giving me a receipt of my transaction, which would have displayed my balance. Strange, isn't it?
