I was in a large open space, and huge animals of all sort with huge roars and wide open mouths (big gnashing teeth) were chasing me. I ran from side to side trying to escape. I was out of breath. The huge animal monsters finally hemmed me in (surrounded me). They were going to eat me and claw me. I then awoke.
