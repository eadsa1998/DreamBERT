I'd been in far wing, when three or four in print dresses come out and tell me I had better get dressed for breakfast. I'm embarrassed, returning in my nighty but get thru darkened dining room and lanai. OK. Dress hurriedly. Start back and but over grass and get to a rocky ledge about 6 or 8 ft. High, decide against returning and clamber down singing, "I love you by day, I love you by night." (Forget the rest but thought it quire a song.) When I reach dining room, I am surprised to find it all changed with stove in room and a few round tables. While I'm wondering where to sit some small children arrive. One asks a child already there if she has any brothers and sisters. Child says she had two older sisters and Brother John. Her mother interrupts to say he is John Brothers and to tell of his recent graduation in the presence of somebody. I think what a showoff.
