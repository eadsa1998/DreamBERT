My friend Tyler is the main character in this dream. He wants me to participate in something - I can't remember what, but I'm not that keen. There's a large house party. There's a woman who seems to be in charge and is making some kind of rules, which tyler and I try to ignore. The atmosphere is like a dark, late night soap opera.
