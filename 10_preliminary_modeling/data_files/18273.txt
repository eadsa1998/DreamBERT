Then there was another dream which I just can remember a fragment, in which I was in a cafeteria, and had gotten a cup of coffee, and was going to pay for it at the cashier's. But she wasn't there. The cafeteria hadn't been open for very long, and there was a group of women seated close to the cash register who might have possibly been waitresses, or who might have been nurses or something, because they seemed to have on some sort of uniforms. And the drawer of the cash register was open, and so I thought, well, I'll just pay for it, since the cashier isn't here. And so I took a quarter out, and left it on the cash register, and got four nickels change. And this seemed sort of, well, sort of an unusual thing for me to do, and it seemed to be related to a dream I had yesterday in which I was giving a speech before a whole group of students about parapsychology and something, which was sort of a more independent sort of thing for me to do than I usually do. That's about all.
