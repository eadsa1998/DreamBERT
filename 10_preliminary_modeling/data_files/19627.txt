McAtle and I are sleeping together. He has a large collection of photos, also a considerable number of manuscripts of his unpublished papers. One photo, which is highly prized (apparently a rarity), is of a girl whose features have been largely burnt off. The photo is a dim one. Horace M, keeps asking questions of all sorts, and then asks what sort of subjects McAtle wrote on -- I say, "on everything."
