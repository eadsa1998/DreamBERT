I dial Pedro's new telephone # and reach him, waking him up, as it is 2AM in the dream. I ask whether he wants to go swimming, but he says that he is still trying to sleep. I apologize and feel embarrassed and than up. I wake up IN THE DREAM and go to the kitchen where there are people from Church, weighing liquid ingredients for a cake. (cf. made Brenda's b'day cake in reality). I ask if they can understand that I dialed a # and actually woke the other person; they laugh and ask me if I want to be weighed? (wake up at 4AM in reality)
