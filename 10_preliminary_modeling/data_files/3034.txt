I am living in a 3-room apartment that has a downhill slope in one of the rooms. I have a sweet, chubby baby boy and I've been ill, but now I'm recovering and I get up and carry him around with me and feed him food and hug him and love him. He laughs and chuckles and is very content. I also do exercises by walking from one end of the apartment to the other, back and forth, back and forth. I look out the bedroom window and see on the hill right behind the apartment men who are camping there because they are homeless. They are on horseback and have makeshift tents. It is icy and slick outside and I step out, slide down the ramp and slide back up and back in. The letter A in fancy cursive is written in the fogged-up bedroom window.
