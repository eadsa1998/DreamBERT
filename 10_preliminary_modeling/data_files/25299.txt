 I'm fishing with my dad and my brother Wally. I tell them the lake is half full of weeds. I reiterate what I said when they see it. My dad is then in his canoe. I go into Bill's Country Farm Stand and give them by cash box with $50 inside. I look for something. The store is closing. It is the end of the season. The store is bare. I watch television with Wally in the lounge there. A high school classmate, Sherri McDonald, and others are cleaning the inside of Bill's store. One guy yells at me, telling me to help clean. I tell him I only work outside the store, and that selling season is over. I walk out. He runs after me, and jumps on my back. He pinches or squeezes my testicles, or does something painful. I fall down on my back, smashing him against the parking lot. I thrust my elbow into his face. I put my thumb on his throat like I can kill him, and tell him to leave me alone.
