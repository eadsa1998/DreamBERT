I am driving a sort of golf cart thing. A man and woman in the back are sort of hugging, but the woman needs to leave the man because his hugs are so strong, they are physically damaging and dangerous. She runs for my cart and I start up the engine, hoping we can escape the man. I am afraid. She gets in and we drive away. I say, "Which way?" and she says, "C City." I say, "Good. That's the direction I'm going." We come to a river and I nearly drive the cart right in. I hit the brakes and teeter on the edge of the road. The bridge man says, "You could go over the top freeway." I say, "It's longer that way. I'll just go across. It won't take as long." Then I say, "It sure will be cold" and I imagine the cold, dark green water. I grab the boat, which is more like a Frisbee now, and we go across as fast as we can. We only get a little wet and I think, "There, that wasn't so bad." Some one asks how close Dalles is to C City. I say, "Not far."
