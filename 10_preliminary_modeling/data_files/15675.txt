I was staying at Nana's, though lots of other random people were too. Kieran was there. He was sitting on the lounge across from Dad. They were talking and I heard Dad call him Andrew. I was staying in a room down the hall. There were 4 single beds. I got in one to go to sleep, when 3 other girls came in and said they were sharing the room. They weren't ready to go to bed and were talking and messing about. I was annoyed.
