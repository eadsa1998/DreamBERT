I am coming home from some school and going to the bus stop.  I am looking for someone, but I don't see her among the other school kids.  I cross to the other side of the street, and I realize I am crossing on red when I see a steamroller coming. I stop and allow him to pass, but he is turning left, and narrowly misses hitting me, especially with something extending from the back of his vehicle.
