I had this "imaginary" friend who was Rick (The Young Ones). Anyway, he and some other people had gone to this place which had exploded. This black guy told us where to go and when we got there it was all exploded and everyone was dead. Mom found this little secret bit and we went in and found all our friends lying on the ground. I saw Rick and even though he was supposedly imaginary, I got upset, thinking he was dead. But then he jumped up and I slapped him in the face and then we made out. Then he said he wasn't invisible anymore or something. And Mom looked at blankets.
