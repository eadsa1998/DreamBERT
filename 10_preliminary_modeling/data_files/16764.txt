I'm in my bedroom and I see two cages, one for my guinea pig and one for the hamster I used to have. I look into what I think is the hamster's cage, and I'm surprised to see she's still alive. All of a sudden, the "hamster" is out of the cage, and there's some dialogue (between me and the hamster?). Then, she's on the floor and starts running. She runs downstairs and I'm afraid a cat might get her (until I realize she's a guinea pig, not a hamster). There is a very wide kitchen door that I try to close but the guinea pig gets out of the house. As soon as she sees the outside, she runs even faster across the street and keeps going. I run after her. I see her in the yard across the street but then she keeps running. She runs a little further into someone's backyard, where there are leaves all around. My grandmother is there, and I try to tell her to be careful where she walks because the guinea pig could be under the leaves. Then, all of a sudden my grandmother sits down on the ground, and says something which I don't remember. I think she might have stepped on the guinea pig, but it was right next to her. There's a puddle or small pond in the yard, and the guinea pig then swims through it. I manage to pick her up while she's in the water. She seems to be purring like a cat, and it seems all she needed was a bath.
