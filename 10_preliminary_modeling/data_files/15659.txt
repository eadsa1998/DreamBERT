I was at a party or a gathering at a house. It was like the after party of a big funeral or something. A guy in the family, who was about my age, was a bit weird and someone suspected him of doing something dodgy. I found some bombs in some bins and I moved them into one bin next to the house. My car was a few metres away and I went near it and wondered what to do next. I heard a noise and saw that a small bomb had gone off in the bin and the other bombs followed. The house caught on fire and an explosion ended up throwing my car over the road. I ran around the corner and started filming it on my phone. I turned another corner and everyone was screaming and running around. Then it was a movie and 'I' was calling out for my mother and found 'my' mother and checked if she was okay. Then 'I' was part of the conspiracy. I was talking to someone about it and they were saying there could be evidence so I should stop filming.
