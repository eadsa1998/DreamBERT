Suddenly I found myself inside a drugstore. The pharmacist was a man (I don't remember how old he appeared to be), happy and a bit fat, and he waited on me and gave me a box full of medicines (a lot of medicines). While I was inside the drugstore, I clearly saw the shelves on which the medicines were. When I came out of the drugstore with the box, my dream ended.
