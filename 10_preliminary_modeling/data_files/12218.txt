I was in a village. This crazy blue zombie guy started biting people and within five minutes, I was the only one left (the last guy that got bit, I killed). Calvin was around too and I found a normal guy lying around so we took him with us and ran off. Blue zombies chased us and they had lasers in their eyes. We ended up at this village, where all the buildings were completely empty. There was a big door and fencing all around the outside. We put the guy down in a room and tried to check if he was bitten. He turned blue, so I stabbed him with a fork I had in my pocket. Some people we knew knocked on the door and we let them in. I assigned jobs to people, as I 'founded' the place. Some people went to get food, but Calvin and I ended up going outside the village to get food and got caught by these evil monkey people. I managed to escape. There were puffer fish, crabs etc on the edge of this island. People were making beds. I ended up getting caught again. I escaped on a giant donut at the last minute (before they killed me). I found out that Daryl was at another village and I wanted to rescue the people from there.
