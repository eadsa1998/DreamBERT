I'm at work [veterinary hospital] and it's quite busy. Two techs are knocking a cat under anesthesia for a mcu removal. I'm going back and forth in the treatment room not doing much but somehow when the cat gets taken into surgery the two techs leave and I'm in there monitoring it. Everything's fine -- the cat's okay but I cannot remember what I'm supposed to do. I can't remember the formula for third rates, how to prep the cat or even where the mcu is. I search for a calculator but when I find it I don't know what numbers to punch in and I'm not asking anyone for help. I just lean against the wall and wait for the doctor, knowing she's going to wonder what's going on. But I feel very uninvolved, uncaring or useless.
