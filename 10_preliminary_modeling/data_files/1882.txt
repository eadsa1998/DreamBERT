I have 2 children, a girl about 4 years old and a boy about 2 years old. I tell the girl, who is clamoring for my attention, to wait; I have to deal with the boy right now because he's being bad. I see his round, sassy face and I slap him. "Listen to me," I say. I slap him again and again. "I know what you are doing up there." He lives in some institutions. "I'm going to keep you here with me until you shape up and behave right." He's not happy about that. [BL]
