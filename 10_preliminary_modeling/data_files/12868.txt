I was at home and I went in the pool for a swim. I was in the shallow end and I got pulled to the deep end. I managed to get out and I went inside. It was different and I did a reality check and I worked. I saw someone so I wished for it to be Eugene. He stopped walking and turned around. I wanted him to kiss me and he put his hand on my face and we kissed.
