I was in aftercare at school, and all of a sudden I could buy stuff there. The total was $7.98, and then some woman that supposedly was my mom picked me up. I was in kindergarten and we had this test that I wasn't ready for. So I missed school, but still went to aftercare. I realized I didn't pay. So when I went back in my mom was in there again (she wasn't in the car). And the owners had gotten these humongous lobsters. They were about 2 yards long and 1 1/2 feet high. Then I went to pay (there was a long line of girls in white dresses that kept laughing at me). He told me that I had already paid, and we had a debate about it, and he won. But while I was going up to the car, I saw my sister and another girl (her name is Emily). They were discussing how Emily looked in the performance the school did. Barbie was just saying how bad Emily looked in the play, too. She looked bad. They were swinging around then while I was going up. My backpack was extremely heavy and the car was a Volvo. We do not have a Volvo, and it was so messy. Setting: My school's gym and parking lot. Characters: My sister Barbie. Emily, Barbie's not-really-good friend (but they are friends). An after-care guy (who) I don't know, a "Mom" I don't know, and some girls I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Regular. I think that the part about the lobsters is weird, but everything else was fine.
