 This is a television show that I see with my mom and sisters Ramona and Heather. As the dream goes on, I lose the knowledge that this is a television show, and it seems real: Two tiny UFO's are flying in Montana, in the country. The UFO's do a loop-de-loop and fly through the windows of a big brown house. The windows break. They fly though the woods. They go past a tree. There is a shotgun tied to the trunk of the tree pointing upwards. When a UFO goes over the gun, it fires and blows up the UFO, which is about as big as a football. I see the gun clearly: I look down the barrel. There is an investigation by a team, including a man named Ross and a lead woman, and possibly another woman. A squirrel was blown to bits by the shotgun, not a UFO. The investigation group can't tell what it is. It is all moldy and rotten. It was splattered all over by the blast. The group figures the squirrel was running full speed when the blast occurred. There is an evergreen branch that had the tips rounded off in the blast. This demonstrates that the squirrel was running full speed when it was shot. People come to guard the "thing", the investigation. There is one woman and three men there. They are dressed with yellow clothes on. The woman has a sword. The others may too. Two men are in a pool with others. They are arguing over tape measures. One man yells at another and says they should agree on what a yard is. This man suggests a yard is "two inches, one-quarter inch, and three-eighths of an inch."
