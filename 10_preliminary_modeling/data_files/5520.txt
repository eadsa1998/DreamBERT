Last night I dreamed that I was in someone's home in a good sized room with other people and there was a nice looking man there and somebody said that he was a doctor and I went upstairs in this house and there was an accordion on the floor and I knew that it belonged to the doctor, and I brought it downstairs and I asked the doctor if he would object to me playing that accordion and he asked me if I knew how and I said yes I did and that at one time I taught both accordion and piano. We went upstairs and I put the accordion on and he adjusted the straps and it was a beautiful instrument and it was black and white and it was definitely a man's accordion it was so big.
