At a gathering at Church: danger of fire -- we are to wait in the car. Frank goes back into building - open porch. I wait; I have qualms about Greek Orthodox Church. Finally go after Frank. "If I don't go to bed early I'm not much good the next day." Father Andrew smiles: "How pleasantly domestic." He kisses my hand and cheek. I go home knowing I did the right thing.
