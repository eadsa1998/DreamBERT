I am upset with myself because for years I'd been taking a few classes here and there and often not finishing them or doing the work. I have a long string of incompletes on my transcript. I am wishing now that I had chosen a 2-year master's program and just focused on that and done it. I'd have something by now if I'd done that. Some how this has to do with moving to a new city to turn over a new leaf, many years ago. The feeling is that in some other dream I had moved to a city to start school. Now in this dream I'm at the other end. So I try to do some homework and now I go to the school office to pay my tuition and fill out papers. The secretary is busy and I watch a mentally retarded girl lean over the counter, laying on it in my way, so I walk to the right and catch a secretary's attention. She asks for $56. I hand her a sealed envelope with my tuition in it. I thought it was to be $53. She opens it and pulls out a piece of paper where I had drawn pictures. I look at it and am surprised to see many different pictures of my cat in different poses and postures. I thought I'd only done one. I point out the empty spot where the mentally retarded girl had blocked my way. The secretary says, "That's a cold spot." I say yes, because that's the feeling I got from it. [BL]
