The girls are going to be visiting and I am talking on the phone with Howard's third wife. As we are talking, we are constantly interrupted with noisy situations. At first I am out in the fields, green bean fields, and the crews and trucks are too noisy, so I retreat back into the house, which is spacious and huge. There are several hundred Boy Scouts there, and their parents are coming to pick them up in long train cars, like a zoo train. I retreat further and go down to a laundry room, where a mother of a girl who had been visiting comes to get her girl. We go into the next room, where miles of clothes hang on racks in this opulent closet. Even the visiting girl has a rack of her own. The mother is showing me her cute outfits. I admire them. I move down to another level and I am outdoors in a park-like setting with trees. I look up into the sky and there are flying giant pop bottles and other huge debris flying. I realize I'm so far below the earth level that it appears to be flying above me. I also realize that gravity is working and some of these things are falling down. I look for a safe place to sit. I decide to sit under a fir tree so the branches will protect me. I'm still talking to Howard's third wife. Now I go down another level and find a huge shower room and around the corner a luscious bathtub, rich and expansive. I decide I can get into this tub because there is a ramp-like thing which goes up to it so I can use my knees and get up and down. Dovre is there. I ask Howard's wife if Howard is drinking more, as she is telling me hew has disappeared and is more miserable. Yes, he has a drinking problem. I offer to let them stay in my huge house when they come with the girls for a day or so. I say, "Do you want me to get you a motel room? or will you schedule it? or you can even stay here, if you want." I feel generous.
