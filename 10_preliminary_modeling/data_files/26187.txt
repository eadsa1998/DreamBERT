 I'm with my friend Matt Yams. We pull into the Greasepit drive-in in Oak Valley. It isn't how it looks in real life. Jasper Yams is slow to come to the drive thru window. He comes up from the basement, it seems. We order burgers and fries. Jasper is going to make us pay for them. The library is open 12-6pm.
