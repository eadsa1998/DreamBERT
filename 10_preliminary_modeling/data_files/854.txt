I was asleep in my bed at home. I was in a deep sleep, the kind on the edge of waking, just after you've fallen asleep. I was aware that I was fast asleep and meditating. My body slid to the side of the bed; I was in danger of falling out. My arm draped over the edge and my hand hit the floor. I felt it. I became afraid and wanted to wake up so I wouldn't fall and hurt myself. I decided to relax and flow with whatever happened. Then I was in an unidentified room sitting up but my body wasn't there. The only things in my room were a window and a chair. I felt myself growing smaller. The room got bigger and bigger. The chair got taller and taller until I was so small, I was the size of an insect. I then realized that if there were a spider in the room, I'd be so small it could really hurt me. I started growing bigger, out of fear. I began filling the room. I raised my arms skyward and I was as big as the Earth. My hands reached out clear into the stars. Suddenly, I saw a pair of hands holding my hands and I heard or sensed the statement, "I'm here." I feel overwhelmed with what I'd done, and retreated back to my sleeping body. I was still not able or ready to wake up yet. I flew for awhile, higher and higher. I was aware of a sense of height and that I'm afraid of heights in reality. I saw mountains and red and blue houses on farmed lands. I enjoyed my feeling of flying. I came back to my body. I was not willing to wake up yet. The rest is hazy, meeting people at a meeting.
