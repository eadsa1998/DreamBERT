Vince P and Sue P. She was very upset with me over my friendship with Vince P. He showed up and she was talking about that with him and he said it was all my fault, that I kept coming on to him. I tried to push it off on him. For some reason, to make amends, I had to paint all these walls. They didn't have a ceiling. It was as if I was floating or flying. I could paint the tops of the walls.
