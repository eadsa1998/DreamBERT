My dream took place at the bus station in the downtown. The station is familiar to me because I frequently ride the city bus on the weekends. A lot of the people around me were adults, from about 30-45 years of age. Mostly they were males. None of them were related to me. As I was getting off the bus, I started walking towards a stoplight to cross the street when an old banged up car pulled to a stop. The man inside wasn't clean-looking, and it looked like he hadn't shaved in weeks. Very quickly he got out of his car and came over to me and tried to force me into his car. I felt like my feet were in cement and I couldn't move. I opened up my mouth to scream, but nothing came out. I was completely helpless. This dream was extremely unpleasant.
