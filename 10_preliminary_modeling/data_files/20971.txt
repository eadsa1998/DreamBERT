Grandpas, Bob and I went thru a door and there were two bulls -- a brown one and a white bull. I noticed the bull come at us, so I went back and closed the door. The white bull's head came in the doorway, but I made him pull his head back and I closed the door. I saw big eyes on some kind of a large fowl. I gave Grandpas a rifle and told him to shoot their eyes out.
