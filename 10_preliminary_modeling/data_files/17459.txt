I was walking around a sort of showcase room with aquariums.  I was trying to pick out a little fish, snake, goldfish, etc.  I left and was pursued in a warehouse.  The warehouse worker dropped a car onto the pursuer's car and stopped him.  I was thankful.  I spoke to an old man and issues about appearance came up.  He said he was an ugly old man, but when he fell asleep with his nose on the floor, I couldn't help but say, "aww".  I took a picture of my brother Stuart, but the picture didn't look like him.  I took a picture of the worker as well.
