I'm in a sort of candy-land and everything is mainly red and white like those peppermint things. There's a big mushroom-shaped thing that looks like a peppermint candy, and it's boinging like a trampoline. Whenever I jumped on it I would be suspended in place and a soda would appear in one hand and some candy in another. Then I'd drop back down to the ground and play in candy land! Setting: Candy Land! Characters: I was all alone. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I loved it! After I woke up I really wanted to get back into it but I couldn't.
