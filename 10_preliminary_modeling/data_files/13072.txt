I was at school. Some people and I were doing a test. I had a headache. Elana was there. I realized later, they were trying to erase our memories and control us. I was in my room at Mom's and Clayton and a made-up friend of Ezra's called Jeffrey were there. They fell out of my bed. Jeffrey couldn't hear anymore and we all had to collect letters to answer some questions. An answer to one was Patchy. For some reason I needed an 'S', so I put 'sparkle'. I forgot to cross it off. Ezra was there. Later, I was at school and they were asking about it. I was writing and my spelling was all weird, along with other people. Something said "love Izzy" then "more than Eugene". I was like 'what the hell?'. They had this back needle thing.
