The store where I used to work closed in January, and I had a dream that it opened again. I didn't know until I happened to walk past the now-empty store and noticed that it was like a busy Saturday. I went in and found some of my old employee friends working, and they greeted me the way they usually do. Also, everything was switched around, with clothing racks facing different ways and what have you. I went home and told my mother. I said something like, "Well, I guess I'd better apply again." For some reason, my mother did not seem too enthusiastic about the situation. This is surprising, because she loved that store and the fact that I was working there. I also remember wondering if the old managers were back, in addition to a few other choice individuals.
