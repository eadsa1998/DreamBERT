 I'm in a big van with a lot of young adults my age. We get pulled over by the police. I'm sitting in back of the van. I tell everyone to put their seatbelt on. I am then sitting on the side of the van. A police officer shines a light in the back of the van. My ex-girlfriend's sister Jessica Thomas is driving. She gets out. I think she'll deal with the police. My friend Tim Zelling called up his father to help get us out of the mess with the police.
