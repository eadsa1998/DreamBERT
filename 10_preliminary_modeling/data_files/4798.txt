Cary Grant and I are having a wonderful affair. He and I have a secret apartment we meet at. I am falling in love with another man. I take him to the apartment to have him meet Cary. Cary is in the apt. looking cute and silly like he does in his comedy movies. He opens the door and says, "Why are the three of you just standing there in a line." Some woman is with us. He says that will give away where our secret apartment is. He is a little upset.
