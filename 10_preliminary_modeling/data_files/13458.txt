I was watching a comedy show thing. It was in a bar and Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson were in it. It was made in 1987. There was a girl and they were making people 'turn' into Ringo Starr - their faces would go green and look a bit like Ringo. The first time, the girl freaked and then was like "It's so ugly!". Then I was there and she said I turned into him and I said "What?! I'm not doing it, they are!"
