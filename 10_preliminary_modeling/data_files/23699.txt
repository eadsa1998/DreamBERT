Also had a dream I was in the Sarah Lawrence Performing Arts Center, watching a student-choreographed piece.  It was in the present because I clearly felt sad that I had once watched Xandria (a fellow student at Sarah Lawrence) dance there, one time after her abortion.  The piece in the dream was incredibly beautiful and moving.  I remember one young woman sitting with one knee up? moving her head in precise, haunting ways.  Lighting was interesting.  I remember missing seeing those concerts, and missing Xandria and Isabella and also the person that I was then, feeling the happiness of the person I was at that time and place.
