I'm in charge of designing a book cover, poster or document - not clear which. I'm either hired by a client, or I'm a student responding to a brief. My client/tutor is an older woman. She suggests I find the actual handwriting of a particular author. The author is a children's fantasy writer like C.S.Lewis or someone like that. I'm told I'll be able to find his handwriting on the internet. I search for a long time and don't find what I'm looking for. Later I realize the authors handwriting I'm looking for is in fact Charles Darwin of which there are lots of examples. Suddenly I'm in the role of tutor and I have a student. She is shy and likes the Smiths (band) I'm explaining to her about the beauty of handwritten type, especially Darwin's fount pen letter-forms.
