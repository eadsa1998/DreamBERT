I am on the farm and a horrible blowing storm is on the way. I'm on back porch and see laundry. I go out and quickly take it in; a pastor is on the porch and he says, "I hope my grandmother doesn't see you... there is a Finnish way of wrapping and bringing in laundry that is better" and you're just wadding it--implied. In the house with laundry, I saw Emma run out front door, even though storm is coming closer. She runs to a donkey and starts trying to tie its tail in a knot. A man sees her and gives her a long finger-wagging lecture on cruelty, etc. I go out (storm no longer exists in the dream) and see the donkey is part of circus--at least one long elephant, like two men inside cloth elephant; it is twice as long as real elephant--gingham and calico; another creature had run in front of me like cloth armadillo ... real or people inside? Donkey was real, then I see house large and brown-sepia Stratford, like our Chalet with a sign on front said "Made by a Blind Man." The name is vague; first lost completely. End of dream was looking at house and wondering where it was going--pulled by donkey and elephant, or are they just to attract a crowd?
