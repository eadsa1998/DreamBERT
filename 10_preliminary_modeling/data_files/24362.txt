I'm an architect living with my single mom, who's like Nancy from Weeds (a TV show). I meet a girl. Her mom is a spy. We hit it off immediately. We are in my house. It's a large house. I'm writing a story about the agency. That's how I meet her. She's young. Still in school. She rides in a car with me. We have sex in the hallway of a building as we're leaving. She starts it. It begins as a generic apartment building but turns into a house. Nancy comes out with a gun when the spy mom sneaks in to case the place and find out who I am. I watch her like in a movie as she snoops around my messy bedroom and closet and tries to discern things about me.
