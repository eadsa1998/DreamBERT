This girl had a movie/TV show based on her autobiography. When she was little, she and her brother were friends with this guy. When she got older she liked him. As an adult she went over to his house and he was a doctor. She asked him if he ever kissed his patients and he said "Sometimes". Then she said "And sex?" and he said sometimes. She said something else and they went to kiss each other, but he pulled away and said he couldn't do that because she was married and it wasn't fair to her husband.
