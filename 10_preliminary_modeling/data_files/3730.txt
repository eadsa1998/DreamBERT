We had a wonderful time at the party and it is 2 or 3 in the morning. It is time to go. The other two women insist I call Dwight right now and get our raffle ticket reimbursement. I say, "It's too late." They insist, so I try to find his number. I say, "He hasn't got a number of his own," and then I remember he's married now and not living with my parents. I find the number. I don't feel good about this. I wake him up and tell him what we want. He says gently but firmly, "No, that's not fair. It was her raffle ticket. Why should I have to pay out of my own pocket?" I can see the reasoning on this and feel bad and caught between Dwight and the two women. I explain to them.
