I was like riding in a cab with somebody and I got out at this like dollar store where I was supposed to meet Mom. And some guy in a tuxedo came and knelt down like to the side of me and grabbed my arm with his hand. And he looked me in the face and he said, "I'm going to make a deal with you -- you come with me and I'll keep your secret quiet." I guess I kind of like bit his hand and he let me go and I went in the store. I was supposed to meet up with Mom and I never did, and then I met up with her eventually. And then the TV people, some news people were calling me because they wanted me to go on TV for half an hour and talk about what had happened. Somehow that got misconstrued, and instead of that we were going to talk about what it was like for a local girl to be in the snow for the first time, and that was really silly. And I don't remember anything else in this dream, and then I woke up.
