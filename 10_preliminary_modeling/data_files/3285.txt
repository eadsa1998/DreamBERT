I am working at a hotel counter. It's the end of a shift. Murphy Brown asks me to rotate and stay another shift because her child needs help. I go to the counter. Merle comes by and is sympathetic and agrees to stay and help. We are tired but trying to keep up. I pick up a glass of milk to drink but realize it is curdled, thick and creamy. It tastes terrible. I look up and see Murphy coming back very jauntily. We are exhausted and we poke a woman co-worker in the ribs and say, "Don't tell her." It's a silly kind of revenge. Murphy tries a glass of the stuff, poured over a cake as frosting, and loves it like it's buttermilk or something. Shucks! She would! Now a teen boy and girl comes up to the counter and I introduce them to Murphy, like she's their Aunt. The girl's name is Spirit. She grimaces when Murphy is introduced like, "Ugh, that eccentric Aunt!" We are exhausted and make mistakes because of it. We just want to be off duty and go home and sleep.
