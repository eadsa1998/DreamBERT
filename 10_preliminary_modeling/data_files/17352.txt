I was paintballing in a neighborhood.  One of the guys from my boyfriend Jeremy's team was across the street.  Our friend Jake was by a car a ways down from where I was.  We decided on a certain type of game, and I went all out.  I shot a person across the street and I went running down towards Jake.  He said something about being 17 feet away. I got closer and yelled surrender.  He didn't and I tried to back away so I could shoot him.  I ran into the middle of the street and got hit from all sides.
