A girl about 8 came up to me and said that if I came to her house she would give me some candy. I was writing something and I said I would come when I have finished. When she was out of sight, I tried to recall where she lived. One girl lived in one direction and another in the opposite direction. It was close to nine o'clock, and I wanted to get home so my mother would not worry. I went about 8 blocks, then I decided that it must be the other way. I decided to call a taxi. The driver said I would have to wait about 10 minutes. I became impatient, and started to walk. But I made a wrong turn and ended back at the taxi. Three other passengers were inside. I was hoping I would not get back too late.
