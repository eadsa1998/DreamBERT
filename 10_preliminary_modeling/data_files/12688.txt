I died, as did Ezra and a bunch of other people. I was trying to communicate. We were at a park and I saw Hugh Laurie. He was on the other side of the fence and we were in the playground area. I was trying to convince Ezra to go on some Superman ride with me. Hugh and I actually knew other and we were going out or something. I was up at the fence and was gently blowing and he could feel it on his face. I put my feet on the fence and was moving it. He could work out what I was trying to say? He put his feet up to. I sent him a message saying "Pirates of the Caribbean sucks balls, Izzy". Then Silas sent heaps of stuff to him. I said "You're dead too?"
