I was to bet a bundle on two horses in a race. I was at a race track and was going to play a horse. I played one and he won. I don't remember his name. I was getting the track ready for a lady. There were padlocks on a steel rope, but I pulled them off. I had money to bet. I put some eggs in my pocket and they broke and ran down my leg and out of the bottom of my pants. I took pants off. I went to a gambling place with George in a tough neighborhood. I took my wallet out of my pocket and put the money into watch pocket. We went in, one of the guys saw me put the money there. He reached for it and I said no. I said, "I got 3 kids and just bought a house." One tough guy came up and I slugged him. I punched him and he bounced back. Then they ganged around me so I fled. They gave chase, but I flew up and they got into a car. I flew over a river into some woods and hid in tall weeds. I saw them coming. I went into a building and there was another superman. We went together. With a disguise. It was raining. We saw one of the kids. We ducked him and got into a building and that was a trap. The roof was low and the doors were locked. I couldn't fly high. They had two lions for me. I was afraid, but I couldn't get away so I grabbed one of the lions by the mouth and whipped his body on the floor. I cleaned him up so they got a large dog to get me. He was easier than the dog. I went into the next room and the gang was there. I cornered them. Now they were afraid of me. There were dice games and card.
