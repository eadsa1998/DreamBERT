["Candles that won't stay lit."] I am in a big room, maybe a hotel room. Charla is there. It is a family reunion. I look on the windowsill and see some small birthday cake sized candles. I decide it would be fun to light them. I tell Charla I like new fresh candles to burn. I light one or two and then the rest seem to start to light but fizzle out very soon. I keep relighting them. I look again at the ones on the window sill and realize they are under a wood sash and that is a dangerous place to light a fire. I blow them out. Now Corinne comes in as I am packing the candles up and cleaning the place in preparation for joining the family reunion, I ask Corinne who all is coming this year. My father comes in and mentions that later they are going to the radio station to hear "Gulliver's travels" being read. I say I wouldn't mind going there with you. He is surprised and says I didn't know you got that station at your place. I say I don't. I'm not interested in the content. I just am curious about how a radio station works. Then I change my mind and think it would be boring to go there.
