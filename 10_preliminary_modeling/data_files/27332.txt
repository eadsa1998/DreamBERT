I dreamed I was in a very small general store with my fiance. In came the brother of a fellow I used to go with before I met my fiance. The brother is about 14 years old now, but he seemed older in the dream. He showed me some money he had gotten on a trip. It was foreign money, and I felt it came from some island in the South Seas. The name on it was something like Madeira. This brother told me that P--- his brother was home now.
