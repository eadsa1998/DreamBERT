There was a platypus called Peter, an elephant called Ellie and another thing. They were in a classroom and Peter or the other one was explaining a plan to catch this "bilby". They were outside. They had set up a cage underneath this little undercover area, which had a curtain surrounding it, on top of the cage, were some ropes. Ellie tried to catch it, but it didn't work. Peter got caught in the ropes and the bilby was coming. I was then the one caught in the ropes and I got on top of the cage and saw the bilby coming through the curtain, and it was a really big blue/green monster, which scared the hell out of me) and then I woke up.
