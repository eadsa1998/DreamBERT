I was very mad at somebody. So I was walking to my grandma's house (which is 4 hours away by car). So I was walking past a corn field. A tall man in a suit with a top hat stopped me and put me in his top hat. He ran through the corn field with me in his top hat. So I cut out the top portion of his hat and fell out. He did not notice that I fell out. So he kept on walking. I walked the other way.
