My husband and I were in a cafeteria (food is a big motif in these dreams too, it was in the one about the hospital, where I wasn't getting enough), and I was before him in the line. I went off looking for a table for us (we knew several other people there, like Bob) but were afraid that they wouldn't want to eat with us. I had to go up stairs to find a place, but my husband didn't follow, so I had to go back to find him. This led into another thing with Bob, where the three of us were going up and down stairs, through a couple of nightclubs on our way up and down, back and forth, looking for some indeterminate thing. It was all sort of sordid and dirty, and I was afraid my daugher would get dirty from walking up and down these stairs with us. Bob was evading going to some class, or had, and was telling us how he managed it, and with what sort of slim excuse he rationalized to himself that he shouldn't go.
