I was making plans with Jimmy and Will to travel. They had just come back from a trip. I said "You know where'd be a cool place to go?" Everyone responded, "Europe!" So, we built a boat and sailed over. Yup, rolled up our sleeves and built a boat. We landed in some country after sailing the Ocean Blue. I guess it was France, because everybody was speaking French. I walked up to an office building, and hurt the feelings of an attractive woman, with long black hair and large breasts. I don't remember feeling very bad about it. We were standing in a place that looked like San Francisco, and along with all the people doing Tai-Chi, Napoleon was there! Yup, in his uniform. Getting very angry. We tried to change the language of the country so we could understand what was going on, but I did not succeed. For three seconds, I was in 1904 Dublin, standing on a bridge, across the river Liffey, watching a procession of people mentioned in *Ulysses*. Leopold Bloom leaned over to me and said, "Pity, isn't it, that they're all dead? Still, you can't argue with them I suppose." He then tried to sell me something for five pounds sixpence. Then, I was back in "France". The woman with large breasts was standing around trying to seduce Napoleon. We were very glad she was doing that, because Napoleon had gotten extremely annoying.
