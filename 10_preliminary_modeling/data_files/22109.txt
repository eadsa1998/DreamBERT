A beautiful dawn, everything shone, the sun seemed bigger. The birds had already stopped singing. I felt a great happiness; my dreams were being realized. A clean city among beautiful landscapes. People were happy. There were many schools, parks and sports fields surrounded by gardens. There weren't any poor people or beggars. Everyone worked; it was heaven on earth.
