Our neighbors across the alley are about to sell their house; reasons vague; I go over while they are away and find it is stuffy inside; I try to open a window, but it is STUCK --shift: I see a lake or the ocean near our house; the water is very deep and there are lots of waves; there is a warning sign: WATER IS 25' DEEP -- KEEP OFF.
