I had my work on trays and the track names were on the tray bottoms like Aqua, oak, lin, etc. Audrey was checking or inspecting the work or gauging it. There was a strip by the company store in Rivertown where the autos were speeding. I noticed the cars and there was a policeman and didn't bother no one for speeding. So I drove thru the strip at high speed about three times. I really did gun it good. Some young lady was kissing young fellows. I happened to be there and she came up to me and kissed me, to my surprise. I was flattered. Audrey said, "Did the reason she did that was she knows you have money?"
