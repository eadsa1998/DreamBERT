My father, my brother X. and I are standing in a line at a bank. My turn comes and I step up to the cashier's window to cash a check. After receiving my money, the teller asks, "Do you want the free coffee with that?" Suprised by this offer, I accept and am handed a coupon. I think to myself, "I wonder what 'coffee' means." I'm then taken (alone) to a big ballroom or dining hall in the back. At the door I'm handed a cup of coffee and a plate of pastries. I walk up to some round tables in the middle of the room and see that there is bread on the tables and that many people are sitting and eating. "Oh, it's a whole Continental breakfast," I say. I look for a place to sit, but the occupied tables are all full. Before sitting down I realize, "The bank is in a hotel." I go back to the cashier window, which is now an ornate desk in the hotel lobby, and see that my father has just gotten some money and is walking away with X. He sees me and says, "Oy, I didn't get a breakfast." From his tone of voice it is clear that he regrets forgetting to ask for his free breakfast.
