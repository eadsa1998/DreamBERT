I'm in a car and it needs gas, oil and a tire check. I keep parking it in different places, but the station is very busy and I can't get anyone's attention. I finally drive in the gas pump line and get gas. I then start to drive to C City but must get out of the car because of a group of people parading down the street. Chuck is in the parade. A male friend calls out, "You owe me a quarter." I search my pockets and only find a nickel. Chuck digs up a quarter. I say, "Well then now, I owe you a quarter." I start to walk to C City. Aunt Bridget and her daughter walk with me a short way. I think,"I hope I can make it." My knees have really been hurting. I then walk up and crawl up a stairway. There are handouts about counseling techniques on the steps. [BL]
