Hello again! Dream cycle has started again! I go into a woman's house. She has large white onyx cat statues all over her house. One is glued to the drapes as though he is walking down the drapes, head first. I am amazed they can do that, it being so heavy. I see two cat statues curled up under a table. They are the same as the ones under my TV. She also has pretty red and ornate vases. The woman approaches me and asks angrily, "Why are you in my house?" I answer, embarrassed that I was looking at garage sales and stopped to admire her lovely cats and vases. She coldly tells me that she's not having a garage sale. So I leave, asking her if she knows the way to the county fair. She doesn't know. I get into a car. Hank is driving. We are unsure where the fair is, but think it's to the right. Hank suddenly grins and starts driving backwards uphill. I say, "Oh, did you figure out where the fair is?" The scene changes. We are in an outdoor scene, but it is all enclosed in a sky-scraper kind of building. There is an ocean and I watch as the water is being sucked way, way out to sea. Now, there's trouble, because that means we're about to experience a tidal wave. I see it coming and run for high ground, scrambling over rocks. I then keep climbing up, sometimes rocks, sometimes stairs. I need to find the car, which I can't see, but know it's somewhere. I will it to be there and see a small toy car under a table. I then get in it, it's regular size now, I drive down the stairs looking for the first floor exit. I see windows and look out. I see large expanses of flooded land and a car driving down a road. I ask someone how to get there. They say, "Why bother, you can't go far anyway because of the flooding."
