Cats - moving from one place to another - two of them, somewhat awkward - not clear - at one point I go back to my family house and see my cat there? I'm feeling relieved that he/she is still there. While there I'm trying to use a device on the end of a hose, dirty, like car-repair tools are - you're supposed to press a little nub and (compressed air?) comes out. It's not working, and I go to a garage (or ?) and while the person I'm with talks to the mechanic I try out the one at the garage and it works so well I nearly fall over. Then I try mine again and it definitely doesn't work right. Sometime I go to a friend's house - I'm carrying something - she takes me to meet her parents - her father says he knows who I am and doesn't want me in his house - I think he says he doesn't want me around his daughter but he can't actually forbid her and I think she says so. He's not hot about it but very firm. My friend walks me outside and I've got an impression now of Kathie H. and/or Bobbie. Sort of hanging on me, and I'd rather get on my way.
