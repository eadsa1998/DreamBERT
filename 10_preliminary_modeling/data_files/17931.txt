I was doing some deliveries on a busy day, like Valentine's.  Some of the driving was around a grassy field.  I stopped somewhere maybe for a break, and I met up with my old dorm roommate Chelsea.  I think we were staying together on a little 3-sided bunk sort of platform.  She broke down crying, and I was sort of sympathetic.  Then I was in perhaps a mechanic's garage, in the back of my car.  My dad was there, as were two other men.  I tried bragging about my car.  "It's a 1975.." then I stammered, unable to think of what I wanted to say to brag.  I was trying to say something like "3200 SE.." but I was confused.  I looked at my father for help.  He prodded a little.  I stood in the back seat of my car kind of hiding behind the front seats, embarrassed that I didn't know my car well enough, having failed at bragging.  After the men had left and my opportunity was over, then I thought about the Kleenex box holster and automatic door locks.
