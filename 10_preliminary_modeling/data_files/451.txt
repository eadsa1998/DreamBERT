I was in a hallway with a lot of doors. It looked like the hallway of the elementary school that I went to, which looked as if it had been remodeled My friend who attended that school with me was in my dream. She and her husband were on the other side of one of the clouded glass doors making blowfish faces at me. I thought that was out of character for my friend. Then I was getting my car fixed and another friend of mine from high school wanted to give me a deal on my car. Then I suddenly appeared in a bedroom with my sister in it. She was in bed trying to sleep, but couldn't because an alarm kept going off. She told me the alarm was going off because she was using sheets that didn't belong to her. Then I was outside on the campus and two women staff members came up to me and said it is good that I am in the new program because if I was in the old one, it would be twice as hard for me to graduate.
