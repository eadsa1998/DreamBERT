 I'm in a grocery store relatively late at night. I walk by a man and woman and say g'day to them. My left shoulder and torso bump and brush their right side as we pass. This was an accident: I didn't mean to be rude. I see four people dressed in full bird-like goofy costumes. In a bin of some produce item I uncover a pair of sandals with brown leather straps. I think I'll take them, and I go to get a grocery basket. The sandals are smashed and wrinkled.
