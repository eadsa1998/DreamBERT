I was at like a fair thing with Mom. I can't remember if Dad was there or not, and I think that Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry were in this somewhere. Oh, and I think Merrilee was there. Mom and me and Merrilee were walking into this little park thing. It was kind of like a scaled-down Six Flags, and we walked in this path of flowers and little animals in cages and stuff, and then at a certain fork in the path, there was this sign that Mom read to me and it said, "Piggy Zoo Zoo." [laugh] And it was kind of funny. Mom said that we're going to have to go into this auditorium, and we went in and we were seeing this like play. And Mom met up with Dad and Aunt Janice and Uncle Larry, and Merrilee kind of disappeared. And they went and sat in the seats in this play, and I stayed behind and I sat at a table in the back of the theater facing the wall, meaning that my left shoulder was facing the stage and my right was facing the door. And I was in this little entrance way hallway and I was facing a wall to the right. And I was doing homework, and I was listening to them doing their play while I was doing my homework. And for whatever reason, I had this tape machine. I think I was listening to like notes I took from class, like if I had recorded a lecture, and I was like listening to that intermittently, and get this -- the main actor onstage came off the stage, came all the way back to where I was and said, "Excuse me, Ma'm, but you cannot be taping this for any reason at all, any reason." And so I was really embarrassed and I shoved it in my bag, even though I wasn't recording, but then I can't remember a whole lot after that. I think we were listening to this play some more, and then we went out and then we came back to like a hotel room. And Dad was there and we were talking about something, I don't remember what. And then I woke up.
