I went to the cinema. There were people in front of me talking (the movie hadn't started yet). I recognised a girl's voice and I suspected it was Ramona. The chairs were movable and the cinema was eventually packed full. The screen was like a TV. They made us move to the sides and I sat on the edge of the middle set of seats. Then it screwed up and they told us to leave. There were lots of people outside. I started walking and a guy in a car propositioned me. I said no and he said 'good' and continued driving. I couldn't find my car and kept walking. I saw it reversing out. I opened the passenger door and said 'what the hell, get out of my car'. This guy just looked at me and continued reversing. I reached over and pulled out the keys and stabbed him in the arm with them. There was a Ute nearby. The guy who had flirted with me earlier got out of his car and helped me. I called Nana and said some guy was stealing my car and she said she would call the cops.
