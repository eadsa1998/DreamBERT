A girl and I, and others, were taken by this guy for a game. We were on a small platform and we were surrounded by nothing -- it was just floating in 'nothing'. There was this 'door' which was special. If it turned on, we would float standing up in the frame, which is how we slept. It never worked properly for us though and we would always float around. On 8 October, the guy came back and we complained. He was different though and he said he didn't care. He said something and we realized he was actually a bad guy and had been taken over or something. We said the game was pointless and stupid. He made us get in a car and took us away. We went to Midvale shops and the deli was bigger. I thought about asking for a job there. Someone in the car wrapped string around our wrists. The guy talked and he revealed he was 'evil' and I sarcastically said 'no-one saw that coming'. He misunderstood it as 'no you're not'. He started to explain how and why, but I stopped him and explained what I meant angrily. The girl with me was now Farrah. He started driving the car crazily and almost hit another car, then slammed into the back of one at a petrol station. While we were stopped, we got out and ran. I ended up on a fence and she was on the ground running. We caught up and he was in a backyard with Farrah and told me to come down. We decided on her coming up and me going down? She came up and we got ready to run and I said I was coming down now. Then we ran. I took off the string. There was a small caravan park and we ran in there, but it was silent. We walked quietly and she suggested we hide somewhere in there, but I said it was too obvious. I went to a fence and saw the beach and suggested we go there. We ran along the wet sand to get to the main part of the beach. There were lots of people and we joined in the crowd. I was thinking I could go to dads. We started having fun and stopped worrying about the guy.
