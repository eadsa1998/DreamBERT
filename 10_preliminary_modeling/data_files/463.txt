I was in an apartment that belonged to a group of my friends. I was talking about my class schedule and one of my friends was saying that I didn't register correctly for a class that is worth two units. He suggested I go and check it out. I said, "It is too late to do anything about it now. I will just have to wait until the beginning of the quarter to get it fixed because I have to go to a specific office for the people in the registrar's office to help me." Then I was in a downtown bar, and someone I used to hang out with was there and his hair was wet. That's why he looked unfamiliar to me when I first looked at him. He was drunk and draping his arm over my shoulder, telling me he hadn't seen me in the longest time and I should come over to his apartment and hang out with him. The rest of the dream involves me trying to get to his house and having a bunch of obstacles preventing me from doing so. Finally I get to the house.
