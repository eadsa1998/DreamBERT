I was watching Battlestar Galactica. The ship was different and was actually like a planet, where the main action happened in this building and there was an outside area with a pool. Gizmo was there and I was trying to get food and water organized for her but the room I was in was on a slope. I saw an explosion in the distance and got down. The window smashed, along with other things. Starbuck and a guy went into this room to have sex and Adama walked in on them. I went looking for Roslin. She was on a balcony outside; oblivious to what happened (it had affected the whole ship). I opened the door and she asked what happened. There were gates, like for the SmartRider, but they were all closed. I remembered another way to go. The bad guys came and were going to shoot us, but there was another explosion and we got away. I would see fire in the sky and we would duck down. I said to stay away from the windows. I saw another and said "get away from the windows!" and ran around a corner to get away. There was a loud explosion and I looked around the corner and called "Laura!". Her arm was a bit burnt. In the control room, Adama and Starbuck were talking. When the camera was on Starbuck, her nose was sometimes painted red and with lipstick to match. They were joking about Adama walking in on her. There was a flashback of these two Asian nerds in a small ship in space. They saw a fireball and they were like 'what's that, what should we do' etc. They flew off and said to warn Gaeta. They also had this virtual game, which had a sex option. In real life, we got the game, which was really cool and there was a virtual world option, but it said it had to be registered to use it and we had an illegal copy. But I then found these squishy packets that had different virtual things to play, ie one of them had 'give guy a massage' and one had 'cute boy helps you'. There were pictures of Freddy Krueger (Nightmare on Elm Street) in the Foxtel guide.
