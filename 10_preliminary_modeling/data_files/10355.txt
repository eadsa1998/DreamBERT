I am on a long TRAIN trip: see view of the mountains. I get off, but forget my purse which I had placed underneath the seat; I have to squeeze through a narrow passage to get back on the train. Find my purse? Later I talk with Patrick about an airfare to Boston, when and if I am accepted at the Holy Cross Seminary.
