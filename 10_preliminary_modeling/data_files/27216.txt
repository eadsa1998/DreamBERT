To begin with, I dreamed that my father had been killed while working on the railroad. I seemed to be crying and could feel the choking in my throat. The scene changed and I was in C--. My aunt (40 yrs. old) told me that she and my uncle (58) were getting a divorce. I asked her why and she said that she knew he was still in love with his former wife. The scene changed again, and I was uptown in P-- with my cousin, the daughter (17 yrs.) of the couple written about above. We were crossing the main street and narrowly missed being hit by an automobile. Dream ended.
