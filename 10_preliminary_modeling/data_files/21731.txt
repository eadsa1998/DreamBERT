I was hunting. I shot a small pheasant and could not find it. I was looking at some boats on a lake. We were going to borrow one for a while, which we did. Then we got on a truck, the back end of it, and it started off fast. I just got hold of a bar and had a hard time to get my other hand on the bar from the speed he was going. I was in Rivertown, my boyhood town. We were going to a funeral. I saw Mitzie Evans at the funeral.
