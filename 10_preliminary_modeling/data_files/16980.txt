I'm entering a religious building where either a mass is going on, or some sort of ritual - a baptism maybe. Perhaps I'm in a foreign country. The guide I am with puts $1000 down on a table near the entrance where donations to the church are made. She tells me I ought to do the same. Stupidly I do - I actually put $1000 down on the table. I feel sick about it, but am too embarrassed to refuse to pay. As I'm leaving I come to my senses, and return to the table to take back most of the money.
