I was at Nana's talking to her. I was thinking about her fainting the other day. Ezra was watching TV. I had my period and I went to the drawer in the laundry. I saw Poppers outside with his hat on the table. I got a pad and went to the bathroom to put it on. Later, Nana went into the bathroom and I followed her and was worried that I'd left the wrapper on the bench, but I think it was in my pocket.
