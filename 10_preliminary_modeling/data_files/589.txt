I am in my kitchen and everything is cleared out of the cabinets. Everything in the kitchen is yellow, including the table and chairs which are the old wooden table and chairs my parents had when I was a child. I am trying to glue a dish but can't find the glue. I am in bed and holding my oldest son, who is a little boy, and telling him not to pay me anything but to buy me a present instead. He asks "like a baby buggy?" I wonder why he asked that but say it is okay if that is what he gets.
