The dream started with me at the Catholic University, watching the play "The Puppies" with my girlfriend. After the play ended, we left, but as we were talking and walking, I was somewhat distracted and then somehow she disappeared and I tried to find her. I turned the corner where the San Martin theater is and while I was walking, I was very sexually aroused. And suddenly I found a prostitute and she started to call me and I agreed to go and make love. The two of us went into a store where they rented rooms. We passed through the door that joined them and there were naked men and women doing the sexual act and while we were going up, I saw a naked prostitute who was tempting me and I told her I was going to be with the other one. When we went up, there were no beds, and she told me we should get into a bed with another couple. We were naked. I said no because I wanted to be with her alone. Then somehow we appeared together, alone in a room, and in the middle of the sexual act, but there was a point when I stopped "moving," because I didn't want to ejaculate and she did want it, and she started massaging my penis and I sort of started to awaken and I told myself that I wasn't going to ejaculate and I reached such a point of excitement that I ejaculated in the dream. And when this happened, I awoke and the first thing I did was to look in my pajama pants to see if they were soiled with semen, which they weren't. What did happen was that I had an erect penis, in an upside-down position, and I felt very excited.
