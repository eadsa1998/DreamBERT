I'm skating (or skateboarding or cycling) creatively. I'm skating along, and I notice Stephen Fry sitting on a park bench, or by the side of the road, reciting prose. It turns out he is writing a book or something by speaking the material into a dictaphone. We notice each other and eventually we speak. There's a creative 'understanding'.
