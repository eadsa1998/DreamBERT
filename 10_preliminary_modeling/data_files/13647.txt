I was going out with Silas for some reason. We were all staying at this big hotel type of place (but it was one storey). I was somewhere near a forest and I saw this purple box. A guy came out of it. He left and I saw someone leaving in a purple box and it reappeared. It turned out he was from another planet. He came back later with some others. One of them and I became friends and liked each other. They looked like humans, except that some had pointy ears. At first, they wanted to take some stuff for their planet, but some came back to stay. We had separate rooms at the hotel place. Mine was across from Dad's and Ezra's was down the hall. Dad had the light off in his room and was watching 24. Ezra, the guy and I went down to this water place and there was a statue of a guy from his planet surrounded by Charmander statues. Then Pokemon were real. One was having a fight with a Dragonair. It was big and scary. I had my phone and the guy and I were trying to move quietly over the water and I trying not to get my phone wet. We went back to the hotel and Ezra was trying to make marshmallows. I had this stick in a cup which I burnt at night for water. He used that one and another one and they had marshmallows on them.
