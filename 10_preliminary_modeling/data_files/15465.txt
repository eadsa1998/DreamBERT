I could teleport. I was at a clothes shop with Mom and I said I didn't like the look of the store (the style was country like [like that shop at Brookland]). I was rolling around in a wheelchair and went to explore the rest of the shopping centre. A guy in a wheelchair talked to me and was with a group of wheelchair bound people. I got away from him. There were three different toilets -- male, female and any. I was dressed as a guy so I went to the male toilet but there were only 2 cubicles free so I left. I couldn't find the female toilet. The 'any' toilet had some that were totally enclosed and others were in a group. Most of the dirty. The only clean one was with a bunch of others, so I left. A girl was on one and a group of girls were waiting.
