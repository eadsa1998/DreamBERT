I'm at a Disneyland-like park (I'm an adult) with some members of my family. There's something sinister about the place though. At one point we're surrounded by many huge sea turtles and the water below us. My mother is there -- somewhat bossy. My nieces are there -- I'm a little frustrated with one because she doesn't follow directions. I'm trying to find the fun rides I remember, but the place is still kind of threatening in some way.
