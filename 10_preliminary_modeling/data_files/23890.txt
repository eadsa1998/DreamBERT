First I was with Lynn, and things started to go bad, fighting, and I got fed up with him and scared of him.  Things got so bad I decided to leave one night quickly.  Then I was homeless.  Madison was with me.  We went to a place with many other homeless people, it was also like a reggae concert outdoors.  It was very late night, other homeless people were there, trying to make sleeping areas for their little groups, and listening to the reggae band.  There were wet paths among trees and small knolls in the dark.  I had some anxiety about not having warm enough clothes with me, not having brought the right things, especially with Madison there, I worried about her staying warm at night without my sleeping bag.  I started making mental lists of the things I would need to get from my stuff, like my sleeping bag, maybe my tent, warmer clothes.  Then I realized I couldn't go back home, and I realized I would probably never see my stuff again.  There was anxiety about the loss of my stuff.  One of the reggae band guys, or maybe just a man there, was laying near me.  At one point he kind of rolled over on his back with his head sideways, looked at me and said, "We're gonna have some ROAST BEEF!  You like that, Roast Beef "  His point was that everyone would assume all these reggae/hippie people were vegetarians, but he was proclaiming that he was not.  At another point a man, maybe one of the reggae guys, was fishing around near my purse, which was on the ground.  I saw him pick it up, and start to carry it off, though he didn't see me watching him.  He was going to steal it.  It was the purse I carry now, exactly.  I went over to him, and sort of reached for it, to show him it was mine.  He immediately went to where he had picked it up off the ground and put it back.  There was no fuss, and he seemed embarrassed.
