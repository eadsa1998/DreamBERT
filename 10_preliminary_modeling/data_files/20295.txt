I had some kind of responsibility. Later I was in a wooden enclosure. Someone opened something and let cool air come in. Then I heard what sounded like excited chickens on the other side of one of the thin walls. I concluded that the air had excited them. Then the enclosure started to move like the trailer of a truck.
