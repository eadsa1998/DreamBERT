 I'm with others and we're planning our trip to the Big Resort Area. I'm coordinating more than others. I remember that there may be a fire ban in effect: we'll have to call and find out. I leave in a van with my cousin Archie Weber, who is driving, and my sister Ramona. Ramona and I are in back of the van. We go out the driveway from the white house, which we were at. I see a big nest in an old dead tree. I ask Archie if it's an eagle's nest. It is, and I see four immature eagles perched on it. I ask Archie where we're going. He says to Idaho. I think he's joking. I think we're just going down to Lake Lodge on Oval Lake to get gas for the trip.
