I was in someone's house with Ann, Bob and Audrey. We sat on a bed like and there were two girls and a fellow. Ann said, "Don't these people look familiar to you?" I said, "Yes, they do." They were a troupe that played in an aviation picture. I was eating bread. The girl came over and took all the inside of the bread and ate it. I picked up the crust and ate that. Then we went on a trip to new York City. We were on a streetcar. The streets were deserted and I could see the car had big wheels on and it ran on the street where there was no track. I said, "This is a dream." Then my family got off and there was one horse there. He seemed to be wild and I saw a house. We ran for the house, but I knew the horse would catch me and trample me. But he didn't. I was scared. Had my hands over my head waiting for the hooves to drop on my head. He turned into a large, playful dog. I picked a couple balls at Mike Gocan. I heard Blue Jay is one. I was in New York riding the subway and walking in it. I told a kid I was taking a train to Rivertown, PA. Then Primiontown, PA. I got mad at Ann. I gave her all the money I had, including my change. She was going on a big liner on a trip. I looked for a stick, broom handle. I was watching a tabulation of donations in New York.
