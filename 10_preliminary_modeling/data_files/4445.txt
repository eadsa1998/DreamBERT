["Taking on the bully."] A woman is afraid because this man comes over to her and beats her up. He is a bully. I decide to help her. Maybe I am a social worker. I am teaching her how to be assertive. The man walks up to me and I chat with him in a friendly manner. As long as he is friendly to me, I respond warmly. Then he starts crowding me, standing very close and being pushy. I instantly punch him in the belly with an elbow and then take him out using very excellent karate moves. He is stunned and I quickly overpower him. Later I tell a social worker man that I am concerned he will sneak back when I am not alert and get revenge. I don't like having to be on alert.
