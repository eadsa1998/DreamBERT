 I go into my living room at home. My friend Nate Nelling is there. His head is shaved on the top. There is hair sticking out on the back and the sides of his head. He is drunk. He was supposed to go home. He is going to sleep at my house, on the floor. I bring him up to my room. He is a pathetic drunk.
