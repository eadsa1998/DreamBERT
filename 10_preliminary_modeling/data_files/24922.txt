I remember hardly nothing about this dream. I just know that there was Liz, Laura, Anne, Will, Jeannette, Anna and I, and we were trying to figure out a math problem, but we looked at the time and said, "We'll never have enough time to figure it out!" Setting: In classroom 2, where we have math. Characters: Liz, Laura, Anne, Will, Jeannette, Anna and I - everyone is in the advanced math group with me. Feelings and Thoughts: Frustrated. We had had trouble figuring out a problem yesterday. Also, when I woke up my clock was going off, so maybe I heard that subconsciously.
