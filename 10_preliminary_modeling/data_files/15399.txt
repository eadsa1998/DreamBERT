I was watching a movie with Alain Delon in it. He had a nose ring that went over the bridge of his nose and it annoyed me. He was also sort of Asian looking and I was thinking that my favourite actor was Japanese. He said something and I said 'You're Le Samourai' and Mom seemed to recognise the name.
