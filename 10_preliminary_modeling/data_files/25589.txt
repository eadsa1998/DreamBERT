 I'm ice fishing with Grandpa Redding, one of his friends, and one of my friends. It is late afternoon. My friend and I decide to head back out onto the ice. I am handed the keys from the man's car, which is a BMW, to go to town and get bait. I go outside. The car is parked on a steep slope. Some people wave at me from the next hilltop. I think the car is stuck at first. The people that were on the next hill are then next to me. They include my mom and others. They point out that I can back the car down the slope, turning it, and come out a different way to get on the road. I do this. There is a lake at the bottom of the hill that isn't frozen. I drive into a town that I am not too familiar with. I am then on a bicycle. I stop to buy stamps at the post office. I don't have a shirt on. Then I put a shirt on.
