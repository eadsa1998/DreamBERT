I dreamt I was in a swimming pool but I have no idea where I was. My friend that I don't talk to anymore was in the pool with me and we were getting along. I could actually feel myself lose my breath when I went underwater. I was doing flips and jumps off the diving board. Then I remember being underwater and trying to reach the surface but having difficulty and not being able to breathe. Then I felt nervousness come over me. I finally made it to the top and then I woke up.
