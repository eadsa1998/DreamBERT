I tell Richard R I am having hypnogogal images and I watch them as I try to figure out what they are and what they mean. I see words on a page, some very colorful yellow. I am impressed with how much I see and recognize. A woman is being operated on. A special throat surgeon comes in to work on her deformed vocal cord. Since theey're there anyway, maybe there is something that can be done. The nurse is like Marilyn of Northern Exposure. She helps him put on his gloves as he enters the sterile field. One drops to the floor, they hesitate and then put it on anyway.
