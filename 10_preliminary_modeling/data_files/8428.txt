Grandma F was in the dream a lot. While in the dream I was very excited that she was in the dream so much. We were on Grandma F's farm but I was an adult. We were doing chores but there was also something about baking cookies or some kind of cooking. I was very nervous about this because Grandma was such a good cook. I didn't want her to know that I don't even like to cook. I know that I'm good enough when I do it. Things taste good enough but it doesn't taste like hers and I didn't want her to be disappointed in me. Everybody was having fun. The overall feeling was very light and happy. We were talking and laughing.
