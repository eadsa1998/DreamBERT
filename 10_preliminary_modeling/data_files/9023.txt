Tony S and Dorothy S had twins and I was telling people that they had just had twins. They named one of them Melody and the other something like Delemy or Demily. The second was something I had never heard before and thought it was very odd. There was another reason that I questioned their choice of names but now I can't explain what it was. Maybe because I thought they were too similar. Later I realized that they had quadruplets, not twins. I had a picture of them with the four babies. I was running around showing the picture to members of my family and saying over and over, Tony S and Dorothy S had four babies. I immediately thought that I really needed to go see them now. But I also don't want to go see them while I am still unemployed.
