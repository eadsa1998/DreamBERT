I was bored and went to this funeral place. It had a cemetery and a building. I was walking through the cemetery and there was a funeral happening and Kiefer Sutherland was there. Then I was at this creepy place that looked like it was set in the western times. I asked this young girl, who looked like Jennifer Morrison and was also British, where I could search where the funerals and gravestones were. There was a roller door and I had to push my finger under it. There was a bright light and I got trapped there. Then, I found the building and I saw Eugene sitting with his family. I had actually gone there to look for him. He gave me a little wave as I walked up these stairs. I was wandering around waiting for Eugene to get upstairs, then Dad and a friend of his came and they were getting haircuts. Eugene and his family came and they were saying speeches. Julianna was talking and I was angry about this, as I was annoyed that she was close to their family. Jeremiah was there too crying and smoking. Eugene was crying too. Jeremiah said "Yeah, yeah we love you Eugene". Then they left.
