I am in the woods with Edward and he picks up a snake. I implore him to let it go, but he laughs and says: "It is a boa, but it can't hurt you." It is green with brown spots. He lets it go and it follows me and attacks me as I flail wildly in fear. I hold the snake with my left hand as it sinks its teeth into my right thumb. I feel two little toothmarks and see blood oozing out but I jerk the snake's head away before it can bite me more deeply. I say to Edward: "See what happened! Now I am poisoned." Edward laughs and says not to worry. The snake goes off into the woods.
