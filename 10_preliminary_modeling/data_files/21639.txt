I was unraveling some string I was going to tie on a post. Some men gathered around me and were going to beat me up. They accused me of going around nude. I yelled for, "Help Police," but no one came. I seemed to get away from them and was running and kind of going up flying like. Mr. Fisher (deceased) was coming behind me, then he turned into a young man and he was catching me by the foot. Bob and I were hunting. He shot twice and got two pheasants. I walked over and picked one of them up. As I was walking, I saw a rabbit standing. I thought he was dead and stiff. I was going to poke him with my gun. When I got close he ran. By the time I got my gun up, he was in the bushes and I found out my gun was broke. I had no shells in it.
