I opened a huge package I had wrapped up and saw it was the "Life Monopoly" poster/movie I was sending to Dovre. I was tired and annoyed that I made more work for myself. I am too tired to wrap it back up, but I don't want to keep it any more and wonder if Dovre will mind storing it for me. I am bored and restless. I wander around and see a man I like, but I feel like I won't get him; he's in the distance. I feel like it would be nice to connect with him, but too tired to do anything even if I could figure out what do to. [BL]
