I am walking down an unfamiliar street by myself and it is very busy. Open shops and street vendors make it seem like a carnival or amusement park atmosphere. It feels like a place where tourists would go to buy overpriced T-shirts or something. As I walk down the street I notice a group of about six people walking up the other side of the street. There are four random, unfamiliar guys and two girls. One of the girls is an unimportant friend from high school who I last saw in line at some club a year ago, and I ignored her, sort of. Even though I recognize her and make eye contact, I walk by like I did not see her. For some reason I know that I do not want to talk to her. As I glance back, I notice that she has changed and is now someone else, but I do not know this person. I keep walking by and someone yells my name, and I turn around to see who is calling me. Now the girl is my girlfriend and she says something like, "Are you going to say hello at least, or are you going to just walk by?" I walk over to her and the other girl who is with her and I tell my girlfriend that I did not even see or notice her. The other girl (who I do not know) looks at her and says, "C'mon, Patty, let's go." Then she laughs and says, "Oh, my God, I just called you Patty, and that is my name!" Then I woke up.
