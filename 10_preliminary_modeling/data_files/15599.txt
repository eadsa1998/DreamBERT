Mom went to someone's house. There was a cute guy there, but they said he was 16 and I was like 'ergh, pedo'. His name was Alex. Somehow we spent some more time together and he liked me. He was nice, but he was 'bad'. We needed to hide from some people. We were with some others and they said that we had to go into hiding for some years and I said no and they said we had to go to Disneyland. We went to this huge house. I was by myself and it was night. I walked in and locked the door. I went to the kitchen and there were 2 dogs and a cat and I said hello and pet them. I kept walking and then I saw Alex hiding around a corner. He flirted with me. There was a cleaner lady there. He kept trying to corner me and kiss me and I tried to go somewhere else. There was a wall next to his bedroom and he leaned up against me and went to kiss me, but the cleaner walked by and he pulled away. She finished and left the house. I walked off into a bathroom. I sat at the end next to the counter and wall. I could see the mirror and saw him coming this way. I got up and he was still flirting and I said 'you're 16!'. We ended up back near his bedroom and he talked very candidly about sex and referenced a guy I had gone out with, but I couldn't remember if I had gone out with him or if I'd slept with him and I assumed not. Alex was being pushy and I tried to resist, but he got me up against that wall again and kissed me and we went into the room and had sex. When I woke up, there was another guy in the bed too. I hid and Alex told him to leave. Then he left and the guy came back and saw me and realised what had happened. He grinned and left. I was feeling weird about the age difference. In an alternate version, he drowned 'me' and then opened my shirt and touched my boobs. Then he jizzed in his pants and was like 'damn it' (but it was actually a movie).
