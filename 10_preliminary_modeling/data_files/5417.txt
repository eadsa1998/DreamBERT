Last night I had a dream that I was first reading Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and it was taking place in space. I kept trying to stay asleep so I could read it, since it wasn't really coming out for a while. Then Andrea and I were at the ocean, and she accidentally let my hand go, and I was floating in the middle of the ocean. The crew team came and saved me. Then I was back at my college and moving in for the year, clearing out drawers and closet space. It was really bizarre because my brother knew all these people that I did.
