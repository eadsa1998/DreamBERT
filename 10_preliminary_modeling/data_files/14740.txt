I was at a shop. I was looking for a dress to wear to some event. I was friends with Jensen Ackles and Sophia Bush. Jensen was my date or something and Sophia was helping me look for a dress. Most of the clothes were gone though. Bethany Joy Lenz had a shirt which was the same one I was wearing. It was purple with flowers. The shops were closing and I looked in this other shop but they had nothing.
