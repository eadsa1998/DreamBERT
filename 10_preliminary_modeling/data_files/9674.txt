       I look out: next door a lovely woman and child, she looks like the Virgin Mary: we serenade them; she is very beautiful; I feel unworthy. I wonder if we should invite her? I see boys play outside: I wash dishes: see beautiful blue sky and white flecked clouds and half moon and transfigured dove hovering in the sky. I look up and say "I can't stand such beauty" and see second dove... quote: "Ah Bright Wings" (Gerald Manley Hopkins).
