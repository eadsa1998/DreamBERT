I am given a gift from this rich guy that likes me. I call him up. His secretary asks my name. I tell her. She reads the names of the women he has given priority. A list of women who the secretary will put through to him. I'm not on the list. I feel angry and decide to never see him again. He chases after me, but I ignore him. [BL]
