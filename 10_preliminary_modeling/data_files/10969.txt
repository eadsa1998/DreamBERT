I dreamed that I was sitting in the back room of Moe's, a well known college beer joint and one I know fairly well. The back room looked a little different. I can only explain that it seemed to be turned around. I knew however that it was Moe's. It was a very colorful scene, looking rather like a Hollywood version of a dive. There were bluish clouds of smoke, people were dressed in colorful clothes. The scarred tables and chairs were the same as they really are. I was happy because I was in a place I knew well and was fond of. I decided that I would have a beer and called to Al, the bartender, to bring me one. He refused to do so. I couldn't understand this but I didn't feel that I should make a fuss. I felt rather inferior because while I was sitting with people I knew who were very friendly to me, I lacked an escort. Here the dream ended.
