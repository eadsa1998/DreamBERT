It was the future, except we were all the same age as we are now. We, being Dad, Ezra and I, were at some person's house and when we left some guy had a gun and Dad did something and he got to our car which was really cool and small. Ezra ran down the steps and the guy shot and Ezra and Dad said "FBI! Freeze!" and shot the guy. We all hurried into the car. Then this other person was having a party and all these famous people showed up. There was this girl (a celebrity) who got romantically involved with this stupid guy. Her ex (another celebrity) was angry and got evil. Then, or before that, we were at home. An old friend of mine except I didn't really know her was there. We went out to get something from this place out in nowhere. There was this evil lady who nobody liked. Something happened and we ended up surrounded by clouds. This evil bloke sent us all back except for the mean lady who had to stay there for eternity.
