I was in my room and two girls came in, wanting to borrow my Care Bears to play with.  I was a little apprehensive but let them.  Then went outside to sit at cafeteria tables at school.  They were doing hearing tests and supposed to be partnered, but for some reason I got stuck being tested several times and my partner not at all.
