Ezra kept hanging outside a guy up the road's house. He was an old guy and kept getting annoyed at Ezra. Ezra and Mom thought he might also be killing or raping (and killing) kids and burying them in his backyard. Ezra was digging there one night, but he found nothing. Dad told Ezra that the guy was moving soon.
