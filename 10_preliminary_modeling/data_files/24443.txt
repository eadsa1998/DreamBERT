I am on a small wooden dock by a lake. With a long carrot I taunt a giant snapping turtle. I hit him on the nose but never let him get a bite. Then he manages to clinch the carrot for a moment and I see what appears to be the length of his jaw and teeth. Then he half raises up and clinches the carrot more firmly. Here is what I saw: [drawing]. I am terrified and am not sure what to do next. I only know that up until now I had not realized how big and powerful this turtle was.
