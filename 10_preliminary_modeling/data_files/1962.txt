I am at a conference. I look for an elevator. I see a ridiculously small dumb waiter door. I wonder if I'll fit! I go in and see a toilet, a desk, several chairs. It's an office for the operator and quite roomy. So I go in and we travel down and then out on the street to the next location. Now Rochelle and I are going into a room. There are lesbians in there and Rochelle takes my hand. She is wearing white gloves. My hand lays inept in hers. I don't want to hold her hand because I don't want the lesbians to think I am one. I feel uncomfortable, but I don't pull my hand away because I don't want to hurt Rochelle's feelings. In another room, I hear a man talking and he mentions M City High. He's a coach. I say, "When were you there?" I also graduated from M City High. He smiles and says, "1939 or 1932." I go into another room where people are talking about women's issues and a man is grimacing cause he's tired of hearing about it all the time.
