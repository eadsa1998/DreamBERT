I was standing on a corner when I saw a girl (who I think likes me) coming with a friend and classmate of mine (M). She looked at me as though she wanted to say something, and I watched her without doing anything. Then she passed by and I thought I had been rude to her, and thought I had to apologize. I went towards her and she turned around and smiled and ran with opened arms. I felt happy, but when she got to where I was and hugged me, it wasn't her but my friend. I looked around for her and didn't see her. I was confused. I walked with my friends around some streets which were destroyed like after a bombing and suddenly I found myself in my old house. We went inside and there were some acquaintances on the balcony who called my friend a homosexual and they bugged him and made fun of him. Then I gave them a lecture. I was upset and they threw a block of wood on us.
