I dreamed I was going somewhere, but I appeared in a very ugly street where some blacks who looked like hoods were. I thought that if I went past them, they would rob me, but didn't pay attention to this and went by. Suddenly they started to come towards me, to rob me, I guess, and I remained standing. One of them came over with a knife and then I applied a judo trick on him and left him lying there. The rest of them came to attack me, but I felt fit and started to fight all of them and defeated them. I was in a park filled with games. There was a game which surprised me because it was so nice. The game consisted of a machine. There was a guy who told me that if I wanted to rest and have my second self work, I should go through the machine and my second self would work. But some hoodlums appeared and destroyed the machine and then I awoke.
