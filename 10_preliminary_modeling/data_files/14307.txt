I was at school, but it was a different school. The same people were there though. There was an 'assembly' and everyone was grouped together in different classrooms. I was sitting next to Fang in class. During the assembly, Calvin ignored me and sat with someone else. Rebekah was sitting somewhere else and was laughing with her friends. Ezra came in and sat next to me (we were at a desk). He knew my password for DreamBank and I was on it later trying to find out how to change the password. It looked different and had a forum. I couldn't find anything about changing your password. I was then in a lady's home and I had to leave (I was with others and we were on a mission thing). I had to drag this heavy carpet out. Then it was a TV show and this girl was wearing some latest fashion and these people took photos of it so it couldn't be released.
