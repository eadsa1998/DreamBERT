A man named Jim has big green eyes. They are pretty. I'm in a car with Ellie, Rochelle and another young woman. Ellie ask, "Whose the lead Ingenue part?" I say, "I am. I get the guy." Ellie doesn't like that. Rochelle says, "I don't remember you telling us that part." I say, "I tried to, but you said never mind. You didn't want to hear it." She says, "Well, I do now. You should read the play so we can all decide." I feel frustrated, angry and feel like I'm going to lose my part.
