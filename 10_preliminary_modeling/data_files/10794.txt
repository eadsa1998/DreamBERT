I was walking on Euclid at Wade Park at night. I had on my bridesmaid dress (which I wore at the wedding of my sister). Suddenly a strange man flashed a light in my face and laughed. Then he started chasing me and I ran into a dingy bar. There were many men at the bar and it was very noisy and smoky. I didn't know what to do. Then I was in a designer's shop. My gown had been ruined in some way and three women were making me a new one just like my old. I kept worrying about the time because it seemed as if I should be at the wedding. No one would let me call my parents and I didn't know where I was. Then I was with my cousin (f, 5) in a small room. I don't know where. I left and went outside to a parking lot where I found my parents (both 45). Then my cousin came running out and she was crying very hard because she thought she had gotten separated from me. I felt very bad for having left her. Then a friend of mine (f, 20) appeared in my newly made dress. I was disappointed because it was a dull brown whereas the original had been a beautiful orange color. I said do you get to have the dress after the wedding? She said yes.
