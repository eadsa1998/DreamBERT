I was with Darren. We were married. I had gone to see an apartment but I don't remember the reason. I was telling Darren about it and he insisted we go look at one for us. I agreed to go along. They were really incredible looking apartments. They were maybe three stories. Contemporary yet with a classic elegance. One room was a media room. This one room appeared to be two stories high. It was all white. One of the tall white walls was to be used for projection. I knew that even if we could figure out a way to afford the rent we could not afford to furnish it properly. I said this to Darren, I believe more than once. I was also thinking to myself that I didn't know if it was right to commit to an apartment like this when I wasn't sure that our marriage would work out.
