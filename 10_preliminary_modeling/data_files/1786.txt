A teacher has two students who are laying down on her left. The teacher is addressing an audience of parents who are in a semi- circle around her. I am in the audience on her right. She tells the parents she wants their permission to interpret the students and the parents would accept what they say. The parents feel uncomfortable and say no. The teacher looks perplexed. I suggest that I could help the teacher understand if I could interpret what the parents were trying to say. Then I see a huge mechanical alien thing looking in the window. It sucked our consciousness out of our bodies and put each of us in a metal oval container to take us all to their world. I escape my container and dart around invisible, keeping all of my molecules together so I didn't vaporize all over the place. I follow the mechanical alien as it goes to talk to its followers. Then a human-like male, the real King, enters and takes over. He's very good-looking and I'm interested in him (attracted to him?). I come up close to his head to observe and feel him. He is very self-centered. He and his father talk about the missing human consciousness and aren't overly concerned. The father is concerned about the unfeeling, self-centered son. The man goes to take a bath and gets an erection. He laughs, calls to his guard to send him in Angela (the next woman). She comes in and they make love. I am excited by it all and try to enter his head to hear what he thinks.
