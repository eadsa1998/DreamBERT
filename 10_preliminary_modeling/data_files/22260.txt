I was working with a friend in the North, in the city of Paita (Piura), fishing. We had bought a boat because we needed to raise some money for a business enterprise. The fishing gave us such great profits that we thought we would buy another boat and invest the rest of the money in a small canning factory, and started to breed shrimps and lobsters. Everything was going well and then my friend fell in love with a girl from Piura who started to get her brother into the business. I didn't like this because he hadn't contributed anything to it. Then I separated from my friend and in time he started to lose everything until there was nothing left.
