I was at conference and going to dinner with Ben D. We went to a hotel. There was a lot of dark wood, cherry I think, on the walls. While he was checking in, I excused myself, telling him that I needed to use the restroom. What I actually did was sneak into another hotel room. I hadn't had a chance to shave that morning and I wanted to do that before we went to our room. I knew it wouldn't take me that long so I thought I could get in and out without anyone knowing. The room I snuck into was a suite of several bedrooms and each had a private bathroom. While I was using their bathtub to shave, the whole family that had reserved that room arrived. The couple whose bathroom I was using came in and realized someone was in there. I somehow managed to get out without anyone from that family seeing me. There was a big ordeal between the time that they realized I was in there and the time I actually got out unseen. I was at a computer screen and there were several columns of information, each were a different category yet all were related to the time Ben D and I were going to spend together. I was trying to decide on which three columns I wanted for that time.
