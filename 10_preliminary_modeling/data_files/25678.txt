 I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson and my woman-friend Jackie Hunter at a country restaurant having dinner. Jackie is talking about two men she knows named Matt and Dan. We are talking on the phone in the restaurant. I tell her if she's not interested in me I don't want to wait around thinking I have a chance with her. She has to leave. My truck and Kevin's Bronco are parked outside. Kevin and I are going to get in my truck. Jackie calls me over to the Bronco. I jump up and lean my weight on the open window. I fall in the window, and the door closes. She may be on the phone. I lay across the front seat with my head in her lap. She backs the Bronco up. There is a skunk on the side of the road. The skunk is spraying a thick golden-yellow syrup-like liquid out of its backside. A car stops behind us, maybe because of the skunk, or because we're backing very near to the road. Jackie wants to talk, as we start driving. She says we should have dinner Monday night. I tell her my feelings again. She kisses me, hard. She straddles me and kisses me, ignoring the road! I try to steer and kiss her at the same time. We drive through a stop sign because we're going too fast and can't stop, and then go over railroad tracks when the red light is flashing. We finally come to a stop on the shoulder of the road. There is a field and lake off to the right. She asks me if I had garlic in my drink for dinner.
