I was playing pool with somebody I couldn't see. I was in a room, probably a bar, that smelled of cigarettes and beer. In the background, music was playing. The song was a solo I had in a play last year, that I was in. Setting: In a bar that was dark and smelled of cigarettes and liquor. Characters: I was myself. I have no idea what I was doing in a bar. There was someone else playing pool, but I don't know who. Feelings and Thoughts: Wondering why I was there? Last night we went out to dinner. The restaurant was huge and had many rooms, and one that was a bar. I think it was the bar in my dream, although they didn't have any pool tables.
