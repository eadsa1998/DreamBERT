There were three or four green plants in my room, gifts or put there by management. I neither thought them pretty nor wanted them. I was waiting at the bus stop on my way to a university convocation and was wearing academic regalia. A woman put on my cap and wanted me to wear the tassel on the left. I said that side was only until degree was granted. I would wear it on the right. She continued to urge her point but I said I must follow the University's rule not her request. More people came to the bus stop. I kept losing and finding my handbag, newspaper, etc. Then some one produced a corset and asked if it were mine. I couldn't see how I could have lost it but examined it carefully.
