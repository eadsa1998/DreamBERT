I was setting up some things we had brought back from our travels.  There was a whole set of ebony statuettes, 18-24 inches high, that we had brought back from Africa, about a dozen of them.  I was arranging them on the floor much as they would be arranged in a store display.  We had also brought back from Europe several wind-up toys of the small rocking horse size.  In fact, one of them was just such a rocking horse, with rider.  Some were fairly modern, and some were definitely antiques.  It seemed like a valuable collection.  I started winding them up to get them all going at once, but there were too many, and the first had always run down by the time the last one was wound.  It was quite a sight nevertheless.  They all made some kind of movement in place, like rocking, and each had a head, like the rider, which could be loosened slightly and would bob up and down with the motion.
