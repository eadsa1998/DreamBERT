Eli comes in from the kitchen door: I embrace him and we walk around in a circle several times, like a dance. Then Eli pushes me, compulsively to the front porch of our house, it is completely free of books and has beautiful flowered wallpaper, no windows; it looks like a regular room. Eli stands at the N end against the wall with the wallpaper. A man with a muslim type shawl wound around his head comes and stands next to him; he begins to explain his faith to Eli. I step back and begin to DANCE, clicking my fingers like castanets!! I think it is rather sexy. I am aware of Eli watching me, it is exciting. Then it shifts and I drive in a car with Wendy and some older folks to an ART GALLERY. We enter and Wendy stops to talk to some women she knows. It is dark with only dim lighting. I walk into a hall down the way and it has almost exactly the same wallpaper as I saw on our front porch with Eli! I am amazed... I call to Wendy, "What a synchroncity!!"
