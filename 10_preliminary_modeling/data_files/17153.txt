Outside my window grew grass, not junipers.  I was in bed and my mother was in the room with me.  I opened the window shade to see a dead body hanging grimly from a noose attached to the tree.  How I do not know.  Blood was dripping from the neck; I guess the rope had cut through it.  In any case, the head was missing. I don't know if it was actually missing at this point, or if I realized that later when I found the head.  I certainly didn't spend much time looking at it.  I backed away from the window in a hysterical fit.  I originally assumed it was a gang's doing.  The victim was a classmate Wally.  My mother held up much better than I.  She closed the shade and helped me re-gather some composure before going back to the party.  Everything was a blur there.  The party might have been for me, I don't know.  I remember my paternal Grandma Fay talking to me.  At some point I went to the bathroom to wash my face and hopefully clear my mind.  We were at home, but there were stalls in the bathroom.  I went in the middle one.  Sitting on the top of the toilet tank was Wally's head.  I screamed and backed out, closing the door best I could.  For some reason I expected My mother to take care of the body.  For the time being we were trying to keep it from being seen by the guests.  I was having a very hard time coping.  I never mentioned seeing the body but I did let school friends know.  At some point before this I'd concluded it was suicide- the third after schoolmate Tod Carpo and..not sure if the second was my mother's Uncle Irv since finding out about cancer, or for some reason my badminton teammate Ben comes to mind.  Anyway, I told them.  I wasn't 'there' enough to remember their reactions other than badminton teammate Polk crying.
