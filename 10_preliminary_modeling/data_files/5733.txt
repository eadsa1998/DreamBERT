[1997-05-16] I had to cross an intersection, turn left and cross the other way and instead of walking, I got down on my knees and was crawling across and I was thinking "boy, I can hear the traffic better this way than if I was standing up, but it's really hard to go fast enough to make it across before the light changes." I got across and began to turn left and my friend M was there, who is also blind in reality, and he started to tell me "you're going the wrong way, we're going the wrong way." And I said, "This is 4th avenue here isn't it?" and I insisted on going that way and I knew I was right but he kept trying to get me to go the other way.
