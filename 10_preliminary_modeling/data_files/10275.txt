Father Andrew is at our house and sits on my bed and leans back very comfortably; even takes his socks off; pleasant talk. shift: SCOTT THORPE helps build a new kitchen in someone's house (he is an architect) when we are alone, he dresses up for Halloween: a very funny get-up: one shoe is a boot, the other is a woman's shoe; he carries a cane and wears a bowler hat and a red scarf; his shirt and coat have unmatched patterns and he wears suspenders; a hilarious costume. we get along swell, lots of jokes; Then I notice that it is getting dark outside and he has to be at the party by 7 PM; as he is ready to leave he kisses me tenderly on the mouth... vivid and pleasant!
