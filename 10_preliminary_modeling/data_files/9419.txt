I meet our L. City neighbor who offers to rent me their house which is two houses next to ours. I am thrilled because it is very large and has extra bathroom. But on way to look at it, road is blocked by huge boulders and lava comes bubbling from the hill. I barely make it inside the hosue. See muddy water rising from the gutter. Scared. I explore the house and find a gorgeous upstairs room in the shape of an oval with lots of windows! I imagine this as my own workroom, with an easel, typewriter, books and a crib! Very happy but outside I see huge boulders rumbling down and crushing people. Fear. Then water subsides and I start to take care of their son.
