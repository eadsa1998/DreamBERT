I am on a platform stage talking to a large audience. They seem far away. I am lecturing on the new computer program I spent years creating where now I have 3-D virtual reality companions I've created. I display one that was created to protect me. He's a burley big guy. I tell them of the long hard struggle of lonely years of work to complete this task. Then this audience which is full of employees of a large company are dismissed and we all go to a smaller classroom. I am writing things on the blackboard. My name and the name of the thing I created using physics. Another of my creations, a young immature shy teen girl, is on stage and I talk with her. A man is in the audience. He and I are attracted to each other. I keep my eye on him. A woman gets up and leaves the room.
