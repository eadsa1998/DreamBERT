They guesses my weight as 126 lbs. I protested just last week it was 117 lbs. I went to the scales to weigh. The hand spun around for some time, went down left side which was numbered across the bottom and stopped in middle where there were no numbers but counting marks, perhaps it was 120. A girl comes along and changes it to an easier to read dial. I move the scales and the other woman also. She says, "you go first. I can any time." I get on but the hand stays at half past 12. Then J. gets on but the hand doesn't move.
