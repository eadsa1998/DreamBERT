Jamie came to me for help, or solace, and I remember lying in bed, her head on my chest area, and I was stroking her head. I remember being at school or with my school, and walking on train tracks on a bridge, that I knew was very old and not very sturdy. Something gave me the impression of my grandfather's neighborhood, but it didn't look anything like it, after recalling it. There was a black bag, filled with something (books?), and I think I tripped over it and almost fell into the water- I grabbed onto a pole attached to the bridge so I didn't fall, and I remember the word "leer"- Spanish for "to read" flashing before my eyes. I remember dreaming that my parents were black. It was interesting because I recognized them and knew who they were, possibly from previous dreams.
