At my maternal Grandma Jane's house, I found some old carving and writing behind a door.  I was looking at it.  I had drawn things with colored marker, and there was text carved into the wood.  Later on, my brother Stuart made an image of three of the things I had drawn.  Something of a house, and my mother as an old woman with somebody.  I left the door open and it all got washed away, and I felt horrible.
