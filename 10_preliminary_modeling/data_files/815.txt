The end of the world. Outside forces of the universe were pulling on Earth. We were in our final days, volcanos, ash falls, real lava. I was in a small town, like M City. There were feelings of doom, some panic. We were getting ready to be rescued by a big plane but it needed a place to land. I looked around. The ground was too bumpy and full of sage brush. The railroad tracks were the only answer. But then I saw a train load of people on the tracks. I felt upset and annoyed. I couldn't let the plane land until I'd cleared the tracks. The people got off the train. They were insane, crazy, helpless people. I feel overwhelmed, sad. I wanted to get  rescued. I didn't want to die, but I can't just abandon these people in their need. I couldn't make the order that would kill them. I was annoyed. I thought, "Maybe I will. To hell with them," but I couldn't.
