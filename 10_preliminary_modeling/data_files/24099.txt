I am at work and I am talking to two of the waitresses. We are basically just chatting about nothing, but I am enjoying the conversation nonetheless. As we stand there talking, two big husky-type dogs walk up to us. The girls seem apprehensive, but I am happy to see the dogs even though I do not know them. They walk directly up to me and I lean down to say hello to them. Both dogs are very friendly and they lick my face. I am very happy to see the dogs and I am stoked that they like me so much.
