Father Andrew wearing a black suit comes to see us and sits down to eat with us, but he doesn't feel well. He complains of his heart; he opens his collar and sits downstairs. I run up a hill on a steep dirt path. Then we are at the Retreat Center and Father Andrew walks around with us, looking at apartments. A church member, who lives there, has closed the doors to the view. Father Andrew keeps saying, "I remember you're telling me about this." Finally, Father Andrew sits down and tells me about his ailments; he has a small 4th toe that is without feeling. He takes off his sock and shoe to show me the toe.
