The setting for this dream was very much like the lobbies of large airports. However, it was not specified due to the fact that this airport, the background was typical of spaciousness and carved floor, lot of room, stuff that can be associated with the airport terminal. The action refers to myself and another person. However, his identity was not clear. What it was while coming down the terminal from one end to another, the compulsion to kill bugs was bothering me. The setting was not stable in the sense that there seemed to be a movement from ___________ something that made comments and was just natural to just something altogether out of place. The trouble with the bugs was very (spawn?) real lonely. More than a fear of a number of different bugs, the dream was centered around a particular individual bug or insect, something to this effect. It was just a matter of a couple different people reacting to the fear of this insect. The identity of the insect was not known.
