I was at some place and I fell into some tube tunnel thing. The Beatles were hanging around. John Lennon and Paul McCartney got trampled the most and I gave George a hug before he got trampled. John and Paul started walking back and I said "Hello, don't worry I won't mug you!" Then I was at a school and I'd been away for a while. I had to sit next to Cedric. There was lots of paper. We were laughing because of Ezra. There were trophies. The people there were giving this girl there chocolate. This girl and guy were psychic. They were in a car and someone had a dream about a bar.
