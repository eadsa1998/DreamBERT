I think I was at CIIS. I said something to a group about my trying to live by the Golden Rule. They just smiled and snickered. I went into another room to change to take a walk with two other women. I put on black socks and black tennis shoes. I had a dress on. I said, This looks goofy doesn't it? They agreed with me. I pulled the skirt off and was going to change into pants or shorts. I was trying to zip my suitcase closed, but it was full of potato chips or Tostitos, and they kept falling out. Someone told me a call had been made to let someone know that the group had voted me best because of my comment about the Golden Rule.
