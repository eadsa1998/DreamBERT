It was my graduation (in my dream) and I had this white lacy dress that looked much better on the hanger than it did on me. It was see-through and you could tell that I was wearing my bright yellow Victoria's Secret underwear. So I ran up to my room in Bundy to change, when I ran into Mrs. Persky, who confessed to me she had 3 boyfriends she had been seeing. I excitedly followed her upstairs, where she said she was hiding one of them. But on the way up, someone had dropped her camera and everyone on the staircase got "camera poisoning." They were all rushed to the infirmary, where all the old senior boys were the doctors. Then I woke up.
