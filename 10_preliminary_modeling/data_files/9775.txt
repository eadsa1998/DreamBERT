       (2) Dinner at our house: With the Pearsons (neighbors). Joyce Pearson (daughter) wants to knit a sweater: she somersaults over table where she will do it; Frank talking to friends; talk about XEROX. I look for a xerox copy that George gave us at Bible class; then I see Cindy and Gene (her husband) arrive at our house; Gene wearing glasses, looks like my father....(?) He is walking with a stick; limping. Find a chair for him and shake hands with sympathy. "My back and arm hurt too," I say; Cindy and Vickie (her daughter) wait on couch while I put out candle stubs that have burnt very low on piano and other places. Also take down 2 prints from wall that I had tacked over painting over mantelpiece. Cindy says that "letter you sent was not very appropriate." Something about Spain and marriage; finally we leave and go out to eat and talk.
