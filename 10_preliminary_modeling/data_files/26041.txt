 I'm in a bedroom with my classmate Brianna Eggert, friend Hank Anderson, Hank's grandpa, roommate Stephen Ramos, sister Ramona, and others. We are all about to go to bed. I'm on one side of a large bed. Brianna is in the middle of that bed, and Stephen is on the other side. It's hot in the room. I take off most of my clothes and sleep with my brown corduroy pants on. Brianna sleeps half naked as well. We all lay in bed. I have my hand on Brianna's stomach in a nonchalant way. I want to have a sexual encounter with her, but I don't want to be too assertive. She moves my hand to her breast. I start to rub and suck her breasts. I don't want Ramona, who is in the room, to know I'm doing this. I move my hand down and touch Brianna's crotch, rubbing her clitoris with my finger. I awaken, and am sitting up not in or near a bed. My hand is in some crusty or crumb-like bird-food substance. I smell my fingers, which don't really smell like a vagina, but smell a little different.
