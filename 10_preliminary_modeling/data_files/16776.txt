It's Halloween and I am at home and need to get to someone's house, where I'm apparently spending the night. I don't think I know this person in waking life. My mother is supposed to be getting me ready to go over there and it's about 6:00 p.m. and she's moving really slowly. (I don't know what she has to do). I go upstairs and see some books I don't have in the bookcase behind my bed. One of them is a book version of the movie "Election," hardcover, and priced over $20. I thought that maybe my grandmother had bought it for me. My mother is still in the bathroom doing something or other (probably getting herself ready to bring me), and there's toast in the toaster for a sandwich. I hear my brother leave the house, and then see there's only one piece of toast in the toaster. I'm really in a hurry now, and my mother yells at my brother who's walking down the street. He pretends not to hear and when she calls again he runs like 5 feet away and then looks back to listen to her. I'm not sure what she said but I don't think it was about my toast! I don't remember what happened then, except that I went down to the bottom of the street to catch a ride to school from some seniors from last year- I remember Wesley and others. The car looks like a convertible, and we're driving down the street. All of a sudden, I remember thinking, "We've been driving here a while. I thought in dreams, scenes changed often and people were always actively doing something." I wasn't really lucid, but I wasn't aware of the time we'd been driving down the road until I sort of realized I was in a dream. If that wasn't enough to make me lucid, I then thought, "It's the middle of summer! School's not starting yet," and I became a bit more lucid at that point. There was a cute blonde girl in the back seat, who I called over to the front (I don't even know if I said anything. I could have just motioned, or maybe just thought about it). I had her put her legs on my lap.
