       - Marissa Camden we walk upstairs together; I tell her to tell me about her dreams. She walks very fast; I say: "I wish you would tell me everything," and take her by the waist. But she must go inside.... I RETURN TO MY DIGGING. I Find Coal - very surprised to find coal - esp. made from oak leaves - then see Frank return via underground tunnel.
