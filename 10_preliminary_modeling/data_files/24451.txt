I am walking my dog in a field. The field becomes heavy bush and triple canopy. Where is my dog? Is she lost? Then I am in Vietnam and we kill many soldiers. It is a recollection from the war. The dead lay clumped in heaps, like pictures from the civil war. Then the situation is reversed, as in the dream I imagine what it would be for an NVA to come across American dead. I wake up anxious, angry and fearful.
