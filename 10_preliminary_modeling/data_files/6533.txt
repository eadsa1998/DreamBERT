I'm at the theater to watch "Xiu Xiu" with Laura. Laura goes into the auditorium and I go to the bathroom. The bathroom is an outsized, dirty locker room, a lot like the locker room at the public pool. I have to piss, and wind up peeing in the disused ashtrays. I hear a voice: Judi emerges from a stall. She has obviously been crying. I ask what I can do and we talk for a while. At length we get far friendlier than usual and have a good fuck on the floor. Afterwards I realize that Laura's probably wondering what the hell happened to me. By the clock only ten minutes had passed, but the sex felt too satisfying for it to have been that short. I decide my watch is wrong, and cross into the lobby.
