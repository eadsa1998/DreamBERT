My green van is broken and a man is inside fixing it. I want to explain to him some info so he can do it better. Gaston walks up to tell me, laughing at me gently, not to bother the man. I see a small fluffy dog hop out of the van and get on a small skateboard. He skates under another van (sort of a duplicate of my green van.) It is jacked up and Gaston gets under there to assist the dog out. I am worried he will accidentally knock the van off its jack. It might fall. I ask him to get out of there. It's not safe. He ignores me, laughing at my fear.
