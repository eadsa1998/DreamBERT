For some reason _____________ ________ show, and somehow _______Mrs. Dougherty really well, and through her mother got to help do some of the fashions and I got to help do some of the sound work. And so I dreamt that I was like sitting in our garage at Westport with Celine and she has her short hair, and she has this like thing that's kind of like a guitar amp, but it could amplify any signal, in this case either her voice or somebody else's. And it had most of her reverb settings and program that she has to go through, kind of like the ones in school and how I have such trouble with them because they have everything that you need to know in this display that I can barely read. So ____ program 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- well, she was 4 or 5 and was getting these weird swirly kind of chorus effects, and she said, "How can I get none of this? How can I get back to having nothing?" And I suggested going back to program #1 and that works. And she has this other little thing with tons of reverb in it too, and we really couldn't turn it off. [laugh] That was strange. And the next scene we were at Westport High School and I think Mom was ______ or something and she was laying on the couch. And I was getting ready for class and I was in Mrs. Dougherty's class again, and we were ____________ and stuff, and this time I was one of the misbehaving and acting up ones for some reason because Mom was there and every time I thought of something, I wanted to tell her something. And [sigh] I don't remember too much more of how that unfolded. But one of the crazy parts was that there were these little figurines that she passed out of like Celine in different costumes because we were analyzing how the costumes made the mood of the show change. And I said to Mom, "If there's any extra figures laying around that people like throw on the floor or something, pick them up for me." You know, they were like leprechauns that you put in cupcakes, and I had one of her in the red. And then I woke up. That was crazy, but I think it has something to do with getting into the production side of things now and how things that become big don't really appear big to the team that's putting them on. And even if they are big, they don't treat everything as though it's going to be big. They go and they do their thing among themselves.
