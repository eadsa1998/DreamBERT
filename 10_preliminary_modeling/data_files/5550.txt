[1997-05-13] Visiting a friend in the hospital, F, who had hurt himself, gotten into some kind of accident, he had hurt his shoulder, and was spending a couple of days in the hospital. I went to see him and he was doing okay, so it wasn't too sad and he was making good progress and he wasn't really sick and he was going to be coming home soon and he seemed not to be in too much discomfort so I wasn't really upset about it and I thought he was getting good care and we were just talking together for a few minutes.
