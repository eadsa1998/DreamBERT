Frank and I are younger and have a baby as we return from our trip. Frank has found a new place, but it is located in a sunken mall. "But this is not like home at all!" Riding on a double decker bus to the end of the line to a STONE BRIDGE near the ocean but very little leeway in case of a storm. I return to our home and buy a sandwich and malted milk in the nearby shop. sad feeling......
