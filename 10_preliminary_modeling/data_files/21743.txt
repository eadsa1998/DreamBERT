I was behind the schoolhouse of my boyhood days. Louie Pretiel was knocking out flies and he actually knocked some in back of himself as though someone was pitching to him, but they were not fouled out, but hit squire by the bat and circled back to the back of him. I watched the ball go and I picked it up. It was a little out of round.
