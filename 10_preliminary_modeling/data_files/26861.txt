 A large semi-truck is outside a liquor store. The store is being stocked, and there is lots of alcohol near the back entrance that has been unloaded and is waiting to be moved inside. I'm with my friend Hank Anderson. There are crates of bread on the back of the truck, for storage and hauling. We rearrange some of the bread. There are some sandwiches in different compartments on back of the truck: meat and bread. A woman, who may be my friend Melanie McDyss, is made to sit on back of the truck in one of the compartments. I'm glad about this.
