I'm in the bathroom brushing my teeth. A tooth implant that in real life must be repaired, and will eventually fail, falls from my mouth. It looks to be made of copper. I'm scared. I call the dentist. A man answers the phone and says the dentist is on the way. Then a black man is on the phone. He seems to be in a night club. There is jazzy music in the background. His voice is casual, elegant, lighthearted and boozy. The dentist walks in. He is young, athletic and stocky, bare-chested. I'm surprised and relieved. I kiss his forehead. I say, "What brought you here?" Then I wake up.
