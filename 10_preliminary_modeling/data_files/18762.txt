There were little children wandering alone on trains. They were going skating. Or they hoped to. One little girl with blond thick wavy hair was obviously poor. She didn't know this so she'd talk to anybody. She was in her own world. She had on red pants. She talked to another little girl who was obviously very rich. This had no affect on the way they saw each other. Skating was more important. I was roller skating through moments. I had forgotten my ??? for days. I went to a grocery store. Apple Jacks were on sale--very cheap. I got a box and sprinkled Apple Jacks over a healthy mix of Asian vegetables. Ben was sitting on the floor looking at a drawing I'd done of a little Asian girl. She had on a red dress. She was a happy little girl. He asked me for the drawing. I said, "I meant for the colors to be darker." So he started to rip the page. But then he stopped and didn't rip it. He put it in a closed cigar box. We went. Then ran. I was on a train with Dora. She was standing. She had not combed her hair. I was curling her hair. I just curled the top layer. She was having her picture taken.
