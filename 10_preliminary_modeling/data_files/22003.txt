I watched Louie Kaufman, our deceased boss at White's, go out on the roof of a building with a rifle. I watched him shoot it. I thought it was a high power rifle, but it didn't make much noise. Jerry from Dill's gave the bullets to him and it was a low velocity. There were a couple of robbers in our yard in Rivertown. I pointed my pistol at one of the bandits and he started to run in a circle. All I could see his let's go around. I shot at his legs and hit him, but he kept on running. I met an old friend of mine on St. Clair Ave. He was carrying a chicken and two loaves of frozen bread. There was paper coming loose so I took the two loaves and carried it for him. He was complaining that the farmer was keeping the chicken on a diet and it wouldn't be good to eat.
