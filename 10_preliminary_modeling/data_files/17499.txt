My psych stats teacher Melissa Maynard's class was doing experiments with hanging measuring spoons as weights.  Then there was an experiment about testing what we'd learned from our parents.  We were to fake a shopping trip and buy items by shape while the packaging was unknown, covered with foil.  I could tell it was all meat.  A little girl offered to be my partner.  I accepted.  We were lying on my parents' bed and a foot-tall evil Gumby and Pokey were running around.  I pulled the girl closer from the edge of the bed so she wouldn't get hurt.  I pulled the clay into two and the lumps became Eeyore slippers.  I pulled off a bit more and we were safe.
