I was at work and on the phone talking to a travel agent. We were talking about airfare to somewhere for me. I don't remember where. Then he said it would have to be more expensive. I asked him why and he said, "Because I need to pay for my office. It has big gates surrounding it." And then there was this small earthquake. The travel agent said it must be very big in his city, but where I was didn't feel it very much. But then there was a huge earthquake and I was standing in a doorway, hoping that nothing would fall on me.
