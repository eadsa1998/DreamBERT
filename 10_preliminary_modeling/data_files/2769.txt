I am in a house. Judy and Bill are there. I am packing up my things to leave. I pack books. I decide to take my broken laser printer and broken computer games also, rather than leave them and Grandma Mildred trying to use them. She would only get confused or frustrated. I'm leaving earlier than I expected. I'm not sure why I'm leaving now. Grandma is upset that I am going. Now I'm in the back seat of a car with Judy. Bill is in the front seat, driving. I realize that in my haste to leave, I left behind my pills and some clothes and so on that I will need in the morning. I apologize and say, "I guess we'll have to go back." Bill is annoyed. I explain to Judy that if we don't go back now, then we'll waste much more time because if we wait until we get to our destination, we'd have to turn around anyway and go the whole distance back. They agree, annoyed. We return and walk into the house. Grandma Mildred sees me and is very angry. She walks upstairs and lies on her bed, deliberately not speaking or looking at me. I sigh and go to get my things. I leave and now I am alone in an office building. There are two men, doctors, and I am applying for a job. They are explaining that they do research and autopsies. I would be assisting them in the autopsy. Inwardly I'm thinking that I could never do this; it would make me sick. But outwardly I'm listening and nodding like of course I can do this. Then one says, "Oh, we have to do an emergency one now. You'll have to help." I feel scared. The one doctor says, "I'll perform the actual autopsy and this doctor will be my scrub nurse, since she has already gone home. You will do the receptionist and gofer work. OK?" I agree, wondering if I can actually do it without fainting or getting sick. I see a body under a sheet.
