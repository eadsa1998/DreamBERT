I am in back of Lark School in my hometown and there are all kinds of kids and coaches from my hometown schools playing football or baseball.  Some were from McAddo High, judging from the colors they wore.  I saw Wally White and asked him if he had been to Juarez and seen the "pee-pee stations."  He said yes.
