I had met Broken Lizard before. I only remember Erik Stolhanske and Paul Soter though. I went to a cinema. It had a small screen. There were a bunch of guys I was friends (adults) sitting in a row at the back, so I sat in the row behind them (you entered the room through a door at the back). They ignored me and then moved and I was annoyed at this. I remembered back to when we were friends. I had gone out with one of them, but this other one and I had decided to have sex. I remembered back to this and we were on a lounge thing and he was on top of me and I wondered why I did it. He was really nice though. He came to the cinema and said hey to me. I was then outside of Mom's and I had photos of celebrities and other people for my PowerPoint presentation and for my Wiki. The photos were in plastic and I took them out and tried to put them back in but they were ruined. Meyer came over.
