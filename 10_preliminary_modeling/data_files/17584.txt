I was attacked by a lot of ants.  My boyfriend Jeremy put his bass on a stand outside.  Our other housemate (not Gina, but a guy) came home in a guitar-shaped car.  It tipped the bass and it cracked it in half.  Jeremy said he could fix it.  My other housemate Andre told the roommate it wasn't working out and he had to leave.
