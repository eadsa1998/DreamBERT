I was going on a date, so to speak, with Dwight W. I had misgivings about going on a date with Dwight W but decided to go ahead. We were going somewhere with a lot of other people that we know, some of them members of my family. It was somewhere around St. Joe and outdoors where there were lots of beautiful flowers. I had a broken leg and been confined to home for a few weeks. Dwight W came in and was going to carry me to the car. I told him if he just helped me up I could get to the car myself. I hopped on my good foot to the car and was surprised at how easily I was able to do it. I realized that I was healing very well. Driving to where ever it was that we were going I was impressed by how Dwight W and others remembered exactly how to get there after living away from there for so many years, because I know I would not have. We seemed to be driving on a very narrow dirt path, that at one point involved a hairpin turn. The trees and flowers and such seemed to be right next to the edge of the path where we were driving on both sides. It was so beautiful there.
