Someone was hosting a pitch-in dinner party to celebrate my 50th birthday. It was attended mostly by friends rather than family. Vince P and Sue P came. Vince P was very aloof; in fact, I'm not sure he spoke to me at all. Mostly I spoke to Sue P. After I greeted them at the door, they went into another area and began introducing themselves to some of the other guests. Doctor C and Sara C also came. I was very happy to see him and spent some time talking with him and catching up. A light bulb had gone out in the fixture above the food table. Matthew climbed up on a chair to change it and placed one foot on one of the long sides of the table as he reached for the burned out bulb. The table began to tip slightly. I was standing on the other side of the table so I grabbed it quickly to balance it and keep it from going over. He didn't put all of his weight on it, just enough to steady himself as he reached for the bulb.
