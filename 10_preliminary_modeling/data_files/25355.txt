 I am about to go to school. I am talking with my mom. A car pulls into the driveway. In it is my sister Heather and my aunts Sherry and Nisa Redding are there. They walk in, and I hug them. Sherry looks just like my mom, and so does Nisa! They are both wearing red dresses. My mom is also wearing a red dress.
