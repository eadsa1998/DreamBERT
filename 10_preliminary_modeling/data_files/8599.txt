I was working at the computer on a document similar to the CAS operations manual, but it wasn't for CAS. I was part of a team that was creating something personal for someone and this was my part of it. There are parts of it that remind of a TV program I watched last night where they were building a new home for a very sick girl. she could only come home if the house was as sterile and safe as a hospital. I was getting extremely frustrated however because there was one part of it that I couldn't get to work the way I wanted it to. I kept trying over and over and over. There was a male named Mikey. I have this sense that I had seen something on TV in the dream. and that's where I saw Mikey. I was trying to incorporate something about Mikey in this document I was creating because I thought it would make this girl smile or laugh. It's like I had created a hotlink in the document and I was trying to cut and paste it to a different page.
