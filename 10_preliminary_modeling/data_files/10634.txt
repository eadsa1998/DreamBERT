I was in a vacation resort with Polly's family. People invaded us and we kept running. I realize I've had this dream before. My friend Nancy runs down the roof and I follow. I got caught up a lot and then I kept escaping. There was a tiny town below that looks familiar and I go inside. My friend Mike and his friend come underground too. We ran. I went into a tiny door I didn't think I could fit into. Then I was at this girl Mandy's house and my friend Betty was there, but she had a shaved head, but she still had hair. I left back to my friend's and we kept running.
