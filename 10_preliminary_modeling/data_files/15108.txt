I playfully kicked Dad in the butt and he said ow and grabbed it. Then he said that he thought something went up there and I was like 'what the hell could've gone up there?'. He put his hands down his pants to check and it had been his balls. There was a female doctor and she said that a hair straightener nearby was for "bum hairs". There was a girl with a boyfriend called Chris but he liked the doctor. The boyfriend was lying on a lounge and she laid on top of him and said "I love you" and the doctor was in the room too and said "Who? Oh, you're talking to your boyfriend". Later, Seamus posted some fail pic on Facebook and someone said "dat comment".
