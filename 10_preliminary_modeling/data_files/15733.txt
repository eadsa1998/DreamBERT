I was at university having a meeting giving feedback about Genetic Engineering. Ms Foucault was hosting. There were only a dozen or so people and we were sitting on the floor. Everyone said there should be questions and learning objectives. Then I was in a study area thing. There were lots of long desks (2 chairs per long side and 1 on the ends). Stephen Merchant was there and did the 'boobs' calculator thing. I started laughing and couldn't stop and was like 'I'm studying genetic engineering right now and I'm laughing over 'boobs''. Later, I was in an office. It was dark outside, but was apparently morning. It was dirty -- there were lots of crumbs etc. The owner was complaining and asked where the cleaner was. Their assistant tried calling them and the owner went into the cleaning closet. They came back out and then the cleaner came out of the closet -- she was Hispanic and old-ish and I thought 'there's a stereotype'. She started cleaning and we realised she was blind. We were all kind of fascinated by this. The room we were in was like a waiting room with lounges and a coffee table. Later, Stephen Merchant came back and we were having sex on the lounge. He was on top of me and I came and he checked that I was done and then he kept going until he came [this 'followed through' IRL].
