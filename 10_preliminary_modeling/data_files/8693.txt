Susan J working there. The other reps came into office. There was a black limo in the parking lot near my car, seemingly watching or waiting for me to come out. I went out after dark and used my remote to spot and unlock my car. Then I got in car and left. I'm back at the WDF office. Told Rich P to get down on floor to hide and told him about the limo outside. He thought it was there for him and had something to do with gambling debts. He apologized for putting me in danger. I tried to go out and leave but the limo was right next to my car. There were several men standing around. One was a black man. He was leaned on the driver's side door trying to hand me a gun. I was trying to get myself and Rich in the car so we could get away. I started shooting and accidentally shot two people I shouldn't have, people that were with me. They were taken to a hospital and survived as the bullet wounds were not life-threatening. I still felt like I was threatened or in danger.
