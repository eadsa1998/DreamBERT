I am a playwright and have written a one-woman show. The actress is onstage doing it and I walk down the hall to go peek in to watch the audience response as she does my work. Some women laugh and then they sit quietly, moved by the emotions of the play. I feel a moment of concern that my intimate thoughts are being made public, but then feel OK about it. I try to get closer to see the audience. I step in the curtains and watch the actress doing a scene. She is swinging out on a trapeze bar-like swing out over the audience and back. I remember the actress said she's done this before. I am concerned she'll hurt herself or fall. A small girl is on a swing in the background depicting the childhood memory. There are voices of children teasing, male voices. The actress gets off the swing and almost gets caught up in the chains, but manages to free herself. Now it is near the end of the play I want to be closer to hear the response. I then somehow manage to go to the wrong audience, a group of uniformed men (army brown) watching a show that ends with a commercial selling things. They applaud thunderously. I realize I'm in the wrong place. I go to the next auditorium down the hall and see a huge concert hall and they are applauding thunderously. No, this isn't my play. I return, but it's too late. It's over. I "count the house." Maybe 40 or 50 people saw it, including some uniformed Boy Scouts. I wonder if they understood the play or if it was too painful for them to see. Now I go out in to the hall and the actress (dark haired) comes out. I say, "I wish this had been taped so I could see it. She says, "Well, I did tape it, but who is going to pay for the tape, reimburse me?" I say, "Well, I will." I feel a bit put upon, but am trying to be reasonable. Then she says or does something and I say indignantly, "Do not (either attack or hit or wallop) me." We glare at each other and she goes on to finish whatever she was doing.
