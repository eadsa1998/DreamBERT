I am back at school. There is a pile of my stuff on a table and I'm trying to pack it all up so I can take it home in one trip. Carob chips, Lily Tomlin book, children's books, papers, etc. I feel tired and wonder if I can manage it all. I feel tired of always taking it all at once. I try to figure out how many classes I have left to take. It is never clear. I think I'm majoring in journalism.
