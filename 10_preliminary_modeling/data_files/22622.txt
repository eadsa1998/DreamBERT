Later I dreamt of a place, a house, unfamiliar to me, a bit dark, perhaps because it was nighttime. It was supposed to be my own house. There was a room with two beds on the left and a closet on the right. In my real bedroom everything is just the opposite way around. I was in the bedroom with 2 boys of about 22 or 23 years who I now see often since we work together and we are friends. One of them starts to kiss me and fondle me, to which I strongly object, because besides my brothers are nearby (this boy courts me in real life), I think that I should not let this happen, but at the same time I don't make a strong enough stand to stop it. A little later I changed my clothes, and I remember distinctly that I put on a black pair of suede gloves, and I put my hands around his neck, telling him that I had put them on in order to strangle him. He starts kissing me again and fondling me all over, and I maintain a shy attitude. The dream might have produced a certain pleasure for me, but at the same time some shame and inhibition; but also a certain amount of calmness because in the dream itself I thought, "It's not true; it's only a dream." The dream continued til the morning (9 a.m. more or less), even though in the background I could hear my mother's voice trying to get me up, and mine answering her, almost unconsciously. I finally woke up with a big headache.
