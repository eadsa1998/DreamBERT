I dreamt that it was the birthday of a male friend at the university, and during the dream I thought that I had to make sure that I would remember to call him because I generally forget my friends' birthdays. I called him early in the morning, but when I called, his sister, who is also a good friend of mine, answered. I kept talking to her and I could hear through the phone that there were lots of people at her house. I remember this because I could hardly hear her voice on the phone. It seemed that her brother was not there because everybody kept calling him and nobody would answer. Therefore, I could not say hello to him. Then I dreamt that on the same day I had my sewing class, which is generally on Thursdays, though that day was a Monday. I had not done the assigned homework because I had not had the time (I want to point out that the other day I was not able to do the homework for my sewing class). I dreamt that the girl who teaches me had not realized it, and I was thinking that I really did not have to do it since my class was on Thursday and this was only Monday. Finally I cut the pattern for a skirt, and left in order to finish it. Then it was already late, and I found the friend whose birthday it was; he lives next door.
