I was at home. Emery and other people were outside and Ezra was talking to them. I went back to school and Ms Bigwood was chatting to me and said "oh, you haven't changed yet" and I replied "I'm not going to". There was a lake thing with crocodile heads. I left my car at Midvale petrol station for some reason (it was different). Some time ago I had hacked two games by typing this word in some 'code' and then it gave it a virus? One day, in Japan there was something that was sold to "topless [it looks like it says venlon?]". Later when I went back to my car there was stuff missing from my bonnet. Something in the shape of a symbol had been taken off. Then Dad was there and I showed him and said that my car had been there all day. He asked them if they knew anyone around you like to steal "hubcaps". Two guys got into separate arguments and seemed violent so I got into my car and locked the doors. Dad got in the car and we decided to leave. As soon as I got on to Princess Rd it started pouring (like in The Passing stage of Left for Dead 2 which I played yesterday). I kept driving and we ended up at Nana's. It was no longer raining. We went in and usually the first room was the kitchen but it had changed. I was confused about it. Poppa was in the room watching TV. To the left was the kitchen and dining room and the room straight ahead had another TV in it and led outside to a pool. I said that I didn't like it and Dad was like 'don't be rude'. Nana hadn't liked the kitchen and had gotten rid of the long cupboards and the long benches. It was annoying because everybody seemed like they were in the same room. Granny was there and she had very grey/silver hair. I was thinking she was supposed to be dead, but wasn't sure. There were kids in the pool. We watched some Gossip Girl. Chuck and Blair danced at a dance thing. Jenny was dancing to some hip hop music.
