I dreamt that I was going to this banquet. Dad had it planned that this one fellow should introduce the program and make the toast. The fellow wore glasses and had dark hair. They gave us red wine and we had big red plums we were supposed to drop in the wine. Everyone started drinking their wine and the fellow still didn't get up to make the toast. Dad and mother were angry and nervous. I kept wondering why he didn't, yet it seemed as if it was the fault of the people serving us and not his. The wine was delicious and I wanted more, but I was afraid to take it. Then I was eating a cream cottage cheese salad with peaches on top. Still the toast wasn't made. There seemed to be confusion at our table and soon we were being served steak. Then I thought it was too late to make the toast.
