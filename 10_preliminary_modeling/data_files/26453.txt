 I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona in my mom's old maroon station wagon. The new car has broken down, so we're using the old one. We drive down the alley, turn left through our neighbor the Trammell's driveway and go out onto Home Avenue. There are a lot of cars driving. It is morning, and people are going to work. The police stop traffic on Home Avenue in front of Trammell's house and ask questions to the people around. One police officer is a woman, and she waves a blue bandana to stop cars. This stopping of traffic to survey people is illegal, and someone mentions the possibility of a civilian suing the police. I'm annoyed because of the traffic delay.
