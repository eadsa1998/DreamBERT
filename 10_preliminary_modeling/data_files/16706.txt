Last night's dreams are a little fuzzy in my mind. I remember living somewhere seemingly far away from my own home- most likely somewhere in the country, but I don't really remember any buildings. I remember meeting two girls there who I thought I had met once previously (in dreams, I guess, maybe the same night). For some reason I wanted to be really friendly with them, and I felt some kind of personal attachment. I don't remember much about them, except that they lived far away (Although it seemed I was far away from home, I think they were even further), and I wanted to keep contact with them. Then, I was away from them for some reason, and I was thinking of things I wanted to ask them next time I saw them, such as if I could have their address/email address and if they wanted to stay "friends forever". Then, when I went to look for them, they were gone- just left, gone back home. At that time I was in a house that very much resembled my grandfather's house (dreams are weird in that you always know something looks familiar, but can only guess if that wasn't what it was supposed to be, or if you really did make that connection in the dream). There was a small van (it was definitely the same van we went to the college Model UN in), and I saw someone get inside, Mr. Rosetti I think. And as far as I knew, we were going into the city for a school trip. On the van (which seemed more like a really big, fancy bus when I got in there), there was a guy lecturing us about something. I was so tired, half-asleep within my dream; and it was a weird situation. It was kind of like a partial dream within a dream. The lecturer asked a question, and in my "dream" I imagined I knew the answer so I raised my hand, and when he finally called on me, I said I didn't know the answer, and I only raised my hand because I was half asleep and I imagined either I knew the answer or that he was asking a different question. I don't remember anything after this.
