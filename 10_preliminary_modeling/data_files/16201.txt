Mom and I were in ToysRUs and something struck us. We saw this Mermaid doll that was advertised, it was like it was a human doll holding Sebastian. She was in a box that advertised, "Come to the store at 8am on Thursday morning and we'll take us to see The Little Mermaid at the Performing Arts Center." [laugh] So we picked up that box, and we picked up a little wind-up helicopter for Bobby for Christmas, and I dreamed Bobby was still a little boy. And we picked up one or two other things; I forgot what they were. Then all of a sudden I was in school and watching Warrior Vision and saw that it had changed majorly. And they were giving us these little newspaper on civil rights, and so we just walked around to see how it had changed. And we found out that they were doing things a lot more on computers, and that the computer had taken over my job as the sound person and the b-roll job and the director's job. The only thing that needed to be somebody monitoring the VCR and somebody anchoring. And the board was kind of like off limits to everybody. And next thing I knew, I was back in there and they needed a sound person right away and I was doing the sound for this show. And I did it and I was real careful not to let it over-modulate (?), and of course Mrs. Talmadge was standing right there. And soon after that I woke up.
