I had gone on a trip to Miami with my oldest sister to buy my wedding trousseau. We went to a very pretty hotel. It was a very tall building with beautiful balconies which overlooked a very big pool. We went to the room and changed and then we went out shopping. The stores were very big and we got to one in which they sold toys on every floor. There were very pretty toys, there were toys everywhere and I didn't find any of the things I wanted to buy. Later I was at a Spanish restaurant eating with my whole family, including my boyfriend, and then a dancer came out and started to dance on top of a table, just in front of my boyfriend. It was horrible for me. There was nothing I could do to make her leave.
