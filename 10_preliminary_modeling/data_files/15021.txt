I went to this place to see Poppers and Nana. I was with Mom and Ezra. We had chocolate but had only four left. There was a white chocolate bunny which only had 6g of fat so I ate it. I think someone was chasing us and we were driving fast down a snowy road which had lots of things in the way to stop you from driving wildly. Then we started running and I was jumping over traps. I was then at University and I went on and MAIS. I had new grades released for an assessment for ANS102, but the assessment was actually just saying that the site was going to be down later. I had grades for the self quizzes on which I'd got 81% and 82% and a valence thing on which I had gotten 80%. Somehow my average grade was 88%. I couldn't read the notes on the valence thing (it wasn't really valences). I went outside to wait for Mom. I called her and she said she was just leaving. I sat at a bench and then this girl came up and said 'I want to sit at this table, we're going to [something I can't read]" and I said okay. Two of them were black and then they weren't. The girl in front of me said 'look at this' and she had drawn a random squiggle on a piece of paper and then she said that I had screwed it up. She turned around and it was a drawing of her face but it was really good and had colour but the other drawing she tried didn't work. This guy there wanted to try it by drawing a love heart. The bench started spinning wildly around barely missing the trees. I was screaming and laughing. It finally stopped and he had basically drawn nothing but there was a small love heart drawn in pencil. Mom called to say that she was here. Ezra was then there and I took a photo of them all.
