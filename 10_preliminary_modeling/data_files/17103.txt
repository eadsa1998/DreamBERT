I think I was sitting on the couch with my father, waiting for some program to come on, I guess.  I was leaning against his arm, and I was kind of singing along to "Unpretty" by TLC.  My dad was surprised to hear me.  When he made mention of it, I was too.  The conscious thought made me nervous, but I kept singing.  If I stopped, I would be embarrassed.  I kept on; I knew if I continued I would sustain.  Stopping would only do me in, so I ignored his comment.
