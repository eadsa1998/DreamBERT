 I walk and talk with my sister Heather. We split apart in an area where there are several nightclubs. This is a cross-dressing area: there are many transvestites and transsexuals. Heather may go to work. I walk along a road. Many cross-dressers pass me. I'm hauling two bags of garbage. Faintly, I hear the words, "Sluuu, Sluuu, Sluuu..." I look and see my friend Stephen Ramos! He and his brother Jose come over. I'm happy to see them. We talk, and may continue on together.
