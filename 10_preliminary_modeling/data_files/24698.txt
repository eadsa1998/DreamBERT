I was at a wedding. We were getting ready. I was a flower girl. There were a lot of people there. Steve was there. The bride was worried. The groom was out buying the flowers. Then I was at some other place. They were playing a movie. We snuck in and watched until it was over. Then we went outside and I begged my mom to buy me something from a stand. Setting: At a wedding, and at a park like Disneyland. Characters: My mom, the bride (unknown and Caucasian), the groom (black, unknown), Steve (a boy at school who I know). Feelings and Thoughts: Fine. It was an ordinary day.
