My boss decided to throw an impromptu company party. He wants to do it on a Sunday night and I am worried about getting a band and also about being able to stay up late until the end. We are all to wear costumes and mine is a very lovely renaissance inspired Ganesh (elephant god) design sleeves. I am also to give everyone a new key and a real mouse. The new key has an odd shape to it and is meant to replace 40 other keys. I'm trying to get people to sign for their keys and they're signing for the key in funny ways because they're drunk. (They're giving themselves funny names.) We start with the company meeting and someone is doing a political sketch about the company which is stopped halfway through so we can move to another space. It doesn't appear it was stopped in malice.
