I dreamed that I had moved back into Bundy with Camilia and we had an awesome room. Dorothy was our proctor and it just generally felt like it was going to be a good year. Then I had to go teach Sue and her dad how to play a combination of poker and gin right outside Langton. During the game, I realized that I had a field trip now. I ran back to the dorm and Sue was my roommate and all the furniture had been rearranged. I was really confused, but needed to pack for my field trip. I packed jellybeans and my ipod that was pink and also doubled as a hairdryer. Then I was home and had to get to school fast because I only had 2 minutes until 8am, when the bus for my field trip was leaving. My mother was pulling out of the driveway, and I kept waving at her to make her stop, and she finally did, but told me that if I wanted a ride I needed to get her the 2 Siamese kittens from the garden. I'm pretty sure I missed the field trip. Then I was a rabbit, and I was in the woods. The other rabbits were planning my funeral for the next day. They kept calling it my wedding though. I had decided myself though that I should have a funeral tomorrow though, because there was this bad rabbit that was going to hurt me. I was choosing the flowers before getting fed up with everything and just buried myself alive. How scary!
