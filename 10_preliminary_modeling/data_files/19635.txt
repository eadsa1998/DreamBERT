My brother and I are in bathroom shaving. He finishes first but doesn't use toilet apparently waiting to give me first chance. When I complete my shave, I sit down on stool. He gathers up his razor, etc. and leaves, pulling the door part way closed. Then he returns and closes the door entirely. I mutter, "Thanks."
