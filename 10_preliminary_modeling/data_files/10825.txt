I was driving with a friend of mine (f, 28) through a snow storm. We were attempting to discover the house of a third friend, but got lost enroute appearing to proceed in circles. Finally we got out of the car to ask someone where we were. We appeared to be in a rather tough part of town, and my friend suddenly disappeared. A man in a mask appeared out of the darkness and the next thing I knew I was in his home, which was quite comfortable, awaiting ransom. It was paid and I was released without mishap.
