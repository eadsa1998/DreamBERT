I was at Midvale shops. A big pet shop had opened up where the bakery is (it went out to where the bottle shop is). It hadn't opened yet. There were lots of shelves and exhibit things with some puppies in them. There was a lady there and I was going to ask about a job but then she was talking to a group of kids saying that once a week, she got kids in to feed and care for the animals. She also did this weird thing where she would dance at the front of the store and kids had to march stuff up to her. It was really lame. I started to walk home, but then I was walking down a path next to a forest (but it was up higher, so I couldn't see it). I heard people talking and there was a guy with a little machine. Little bits of rock came up in the air. I screamed and covered myself. Then I kept going. There was a big obstacle area. There was door which had barbs all over it and I climbed around it and beat some guards up. Then a guy was with me, helping. He said "They reckon $40 a week for this?" -- it had continued on from the last dream and they had kept some V's for studying. We broke into the place they were keeping them. We let them out and there were some we knew. There was a small box with a metal thing in it, which was a 'brain' of this girl we were friends with. I got upset when I saw it. There was a copy of her outside, but without her memory, or something was wrong with her, so we couldn't put her brain back. One of the people we let out was a black guy, who was human, and thought the V's were good guys.
