I am going to lie down in this square, empty field on a sleeping bag. Some members of the C. department are there setting up an electronic surveillance device around the square. They ask if I can see if the one near me that stops things coming from the corn field seems to be working. I say it is. Something approaches the other side from the street and at the curb is detected and stopped. I think I am holding a dolly.
