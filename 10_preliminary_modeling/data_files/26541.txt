 I'm in a church that seems to be Carter Church. My uncle Rusty Redding and friend Kevin Simpson are there. My aunt Shelia Redding is worried that Rusty won't come home: Rusty is packed to go to the Big Resort Area. I wrestle with Kevin aggressively. I have two light sabers. I'm either guarding a group of people in the church, or trying to get at the group. At first I think I'm guarding them. There is a man with red hair there, who keeps me from getting at the people. I strike him with one and then both light sabers, but nothing happens to him: the sabers don't harm him. He won't go away. An Asian man escapes from the church. I say he better have yelled for help. My classmates Vince Washington and Rebecca try to escape from the building. They run off, maybe to rock climb, or parachute off a cliff. I run after them. I run past Rebecca: she is slow, and I know I can catch her later. I run after Vince, who goes westward from the church. I catch him, and call him Sal Watson, the name of a classmate from high school. He is like my grade school classmate Patrick Bergman, and sounds like my friend Reed Maxwell. Patrick weakly punches me twice in the groin. I'm not really affected by this. I punch him but it doesn't hurt him. I don't seem to be able to punch with full force. I really want to beat him up!
