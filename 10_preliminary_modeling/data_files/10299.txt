Frank and I are travelling to CHINA; a long train ride. There are women attendants on the train and we have to stop and recite the "constitution"; we arrive at 3 or 4 AM and see a view of the mountains.... Later Frank and I are standing in a SUNLIT SQUARE and try to decide where to eat dinner; We meet an old friend from M. City (Sylvia R.) and she looks a lot like a school chum from Vienna....Sylvia invites us to eat near where she lives, but I have to go home, or to our hotel to change clothes; I can't find my clothes and somehow fall asleep; The next thing I know Frank has returned, having had dinner with Sylvia alone; He brings me a taste of something from their meal......
