I found myself walking to a class with one of my former professors, a man in his late thirties or early forties. He was explaining that his class was being held in a large auditorium and that he was having some trouble with snakes in the room. We reached the building and I stood in the background while he opened the side door to see if the snakes were still there. At first nothing happened, but gradually snakes began appearing in increasing size and number. The next thing I remember, I was jumping from one table to another trying to escape snakes of all sizes, a good many of them very large. They were coming very close but apparently never reached me as I awakened with no particular feeling of anxiety. The only question left in my mind was how I got away.
