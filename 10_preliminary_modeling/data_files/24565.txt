I was at school, and we were getting told what we were for the play, but he did it weird, and he asked people what they wanted to be. He asked Tina. She said she wanted to be Wild Prairie Rose (that's the part I want). I was worried that Ray wouldn't pick again. Setting: At school, in Ray's room. Characters: My classmates, Tina, Charlene, Ray, me. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I was worried that I wouldn't get the part I wanted.
