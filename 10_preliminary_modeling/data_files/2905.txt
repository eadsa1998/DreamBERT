I am a manager of a baseball team and I want the star player to go out and greet the audience, which is in a brick building. He is shy and unwilling and I am very forceful. I grab him by his arms and lean into him and speak loudly. I strongly encourage him to go out and do it. A man is watching and is impressed with me. I tell the player the audience will love him. I point to the building and say, "They will go crazy with applause." I then push the player out to the field and I hear the crowd screaming and cheering.
