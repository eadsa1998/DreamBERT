I was at the old house with Mom out the back. I saw cats in the pool and I saw a cat around and I asked "is that Tigger?". She and Mittens were both out there. Dad had given them to an old lady nearby. They had on those things they put over their heads but they were huge. They came to me and I gave them a cuddle. I cried because I missed Tigger. Mom said Darren had said he might've taken one of them but had decided not to take either of them. Then I was at home and Mom, Dad, some others and I were going to some place. We drove there and there was a lot of traffic so people were walking on the street. There were lots of people. We decided to walk too. I had to go back home. I was in the kitchen. I saw a reflection of a girl in Mom's doorway and it was my friend, Jamie. I thought she was possessed as the dog growled. I left the house with Mom and Ezra. Ezra got a call and I said if it was Jamie, to tell her that we can't get her. It was her and he made up a bad lie. We went to the train station and Dad said I'd be ok since I had a SmartRider and I said I didn't bring it. He yelled at me and I said 'why would I bring it if I didn't think I needed it?'. We went through but to get a ticket you had to climb this tower and it had this plastic plate thing. You pull it out and climb up on them. I was worried I was going to fall because it wasn't very stable. I got a score of 850 and got a $10 ticket or something. It was enough to get where we wanted to go. Then I had to go back and get my SmartRider while I was there. I had a little dog.
