Connie Hutchinson was in this dream, but I remember few of the details.  The relationship between us was one of warmth, with possibly some anxiety mixed in from some source.  I don't remember any physical contact between us, and most of the time I think there were other people around.  At one point, at someone's house, she sat on top of a cabinet or refrigerator, with her legs apart.  She was wearing a dress, and I kept stealing glances at her, afraid someone else would notice.  Later on, she undressed completely in my presence as she was getting ready to go somewhere.
