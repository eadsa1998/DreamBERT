In my dream someone tells me that my brother, age 19, is on his way home and is planning to drop in on us unexpectedly. My mother, age 47, sister, age 19, and I decide to surprise him and be at the station to meet him. When we arrive, we see my brother and his boyfriend, age 19, also enlisted in the U. S. Army. They seem to see us, but pass right by. My brother then turns around, takes out a flashbulb camera and takes our picture. I then remember my mother embracing my brother and crying. I run up to my brother, hug him and with tears welling up into my eyes keep repeating that I am so glad he has finally come home. J remember that as I was hugging him, a little voice within me kept saying: "See, you didn't have to worry about how you'd act when you saw ____._."
