I'm in a plane. I notice the pilot and co-pilot have passed out and we're going to crash. I stand up and ask, "Shouldn't someone try to fly the plane?" No one responds. I go up and try. We land in a country that looks like the Soviet Union. I say, "This is the second time I've been in a plane that landed somewhere unplanned." We get out. I walk down a street. I realize it is Czechoslovakia. I see a fancy limo convertible car go by with war officers in it. I'm in the back of a bus with the others from the place. The officer and I catch eye and I say, "Uh oh! We've made eye contact and now we're in trouble. He's noticed us." We go into a hotel to hide. I pick up a New Testament and replace it and pick up my old Bible my parents gave me at birth, and a new prayer book (Episcopalian). I think I should re-read it and I get some interesting info that matches the messages I read in other stuff. I go into a bedroom of the hotel. Lots of double beds and the orphaned children live there.
