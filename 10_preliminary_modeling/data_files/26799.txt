 I'm with my friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos. We get, make, or have very large sandwiches with meat on them. We go into an elevator on a building. We go upstairs, where I go into a room. It's my uncle Rusty Redding and cousin Rich Redding's office. They are both lying down. Rusty is on the couch without a shirt on, halfway covered up. I feel uncomfortable here with Rusty, which is unusual for me around him.
