I am shopping (with Mary?) and we are going from store to store, looking for things to buy. In this part of the dream, I believe there is a fire -- or fires -- and that one, or several, buildings are burning. We return from shopping and enter a large room where a lot of things seem to be going on. Also there are other people in this room. I see a little girl and call her over. It is Maria. She's about 2 years old. I kneel down and cradle her in my arms. I hug and kiss her, and tell her I love her. She tells me she loves me, and asks if I'm her daddy. Then she starts telling me "things" that she's picked up from watching "soap operas" on TV. She is very cute and charming. Suddenly I see Mary, who is busy moving about and doing things. I manage to catch her attention and tell her of all the cute things that Maria had said. Mary snaps at me, and asks, "Why are you concerned?" I tell her, "I'm not concerned about anything. I'm just trying to share with you the cute things Maria said." In this room I suddenly discover small fires burning on tables and on low cabinets. It appears as though a jar of peanuts had exploded, which resulted in small fires breaking out there and there throughout the room. I pick up one of the peanuts (from one of the fires) and taste it. Some man -- he looks like a black man -- chides me for doing this. I see a glass (it looks like a  tall sherbet glass) standing on a counter or table top. I pick it up and pour water into it from a glass jar that I have in my other hand. I want a drink of water because I'm thirsty. Mary appears, and takes the glass of water from me.
