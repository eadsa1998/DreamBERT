I was on a cruise. Well, actually when it started, Samantha and Derek were here and it was a Sunday, I can remember, and I can remember thinking that it was the only day that I was going to be totally free and not have a lot of stuff to do. And we were, this thing was going to be gone all day and it was going to eat up my one day that I didn't have a whole lot to do. And I was thinking how I needed to get stuff done, and I was at the monitor doing my paperwork and stuff. And the car with Samantha and Derek and Mom and Dad pulled away and I thought to myself, "Okay, they're gone," but I was still kind of waffling in my mind as to whether I wanted to go or not, and the man from the cruise line company kind of talked me into going, I guess. And so I don't know how I got there, but next thing I knew, I had caught up with them and was at the dock and we were walking down the gang plank for this great big boat, which was all wood. It was like a wooden boardwalk that you walk on, like when you're at a nature park. It had all the railings and everything. And actually when I was on the boat, next thing I was looking out and I was seeing like all these mountains and things and seagulls flying around in the mountains. And I turned to somebody next to me and I was like, "Where are we?" And they said, "We're in Australia." And I was flabbergasted. And they said that we were going to go to Africa and see animals there. And I'm trying to think -- I don't really remember interacting that much with Samantha and Derek or Mom and Dad. I just remember there were these things where, you know, there were these certain moments when they advised everybody to go and strap down because the boat was going to be rocking, kind of like they do on an airplane when they're going to be taking off and landing. But there were times you could kind of walk around or lay down on one of those benches or something like that. And that's all I can remember.
