I had my passport and Traveler's Checks and now I can't find them. I'm looking through all the bags and feeling frustrated. I hold Fluffy and comment on the beautiful blue and black colors of her fur. The blue is startling. I am trying to tidy up the things and I start to paint the inside of the bag black. I have a tiny bottle with a brush applicator like typing correction fluid. I realize it will take a long time. The stuff is thick and hard to spread. One square wooden doll house room I decide to do in white. It's for my mother and I feel sad.
