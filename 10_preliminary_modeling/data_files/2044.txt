I'm in a house and must rush to shut the doors because the killer bees that got my brother Jake are coming for me. I don't want to see Jake because it would look horrible. I see the outline of the angry horde of bees in the metal door. They are literally pushing straight through the metal. I run for outside, realizing that's stupid; they'll find me easier. So I decide to fly. I go way up and realize it's very, very bitterly cold. I could freeze to death. I see a door to a room and Jerome is in there. So I decide to dive to warmer air, but the winds are hurricane force and buffer me around terribly. I struggle. Also I'm driving through clouds and can't see anything, so I don't know where the land is and could crash any moment. I pull the cord on my parachute. Bad mistake! The winds drag me all around. I feel with my hand for trees and mountains and crash very painfully into trees.
