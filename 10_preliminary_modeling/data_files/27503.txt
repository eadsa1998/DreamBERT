I was in my calculus class. I went up to my professor and asked him when I could make up a test that I had missed because of my illness. He said that I could make it up right then. He handed out the test and it was in the form of a newspaper where the questions were hidden among the articles. The first problem was one that we had had on the previous test. The other three were not difficult and I handed my paper in. Suddenly I was in S______ H______ standing by a bus stop. I discovered three more problems on the test that had been hidden. I tried to get on the bus but there was a large crowd getting off and they kept pushing me back. I noticed that I had left my books and pocketbook at school and that I had to get back to school before 5:30 and it was already 5:15.
