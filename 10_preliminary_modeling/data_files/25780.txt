 I'm driving from Forkville to northwest Montana or North Dakota. The drive takes a long time. My classmate Sarah Miller is with me. I'm drinking orange soda. Someone is building a canoe with scrap wood. People can dig through wood. Students do something first, and then citizens. This might be building a canoe.
