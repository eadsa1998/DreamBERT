When we would come home from school, on the way we would play with frisky little monkeys. They would try to be very ferocious, but we could control them. One day, one of the girls was playing with an extra ferocious monkey. He got mad, grabbed the girl, and rushed down the street. Some man grabbed the monkey's tail, and also was carried down the street. He was trying to protect the terrified girl. We all thought it was a big joke until we saw that the man had caught his tie in a washing machine, and couldn't get loose. The girl in the meantime was having a bad way with the monkey. I rushed to the washing machine and tried to find the handle to turn it off, but this was difficult because of the great deal of newspaper that were covering the machine. The man looked very sick, but he found the handle and turned it off. At this point, my alarm went off.
