I was on Facebook liking various pages for Eric (True Blood). One of them involved people answering phones and pulling pranks saying "we like Eric". Darren put a cigarette into something [I can't read it, but apparently it shocked me]. Mom went to see Matthieu and he text her asking if the kids were coming because 'she still hadn't shaken off a bad feeling' so I opted not to go, though she dropped me off somewhere first. I was watching Inception and Tom Hardy sacrificed himself and fell through a window. It was in slow motion and it fell onto the road and splattered. Everyone died at the end. There was a bit with Michelle Forbes and some others on a lounge. She had a little coffee with sprinkles etc. She eavesdropped on a phone conversation on a recorder. I asked for a coffee but then saw Coke so asked for that instead because I don't like coffee. Rover was there.
