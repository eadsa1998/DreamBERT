I was working in the flowerbeds in the front of my townhome. I was standing, bending over and pulling weeds. not the way I normally weed my flowerbeds. One or two of the employees from the community office were walking up the sidewalk. I think they were going to talk to my next-door neighbor. As they were walking someone asked them about getting something in their home repaired. They seemed to be further away from me but they were loud enough that I couldn't help but hear everything very clearly. The employees were saying that they were going to take care of it and explained something about being very busy or taking care of one family at a time. or both. When the employees were gone I turned around and was going to say something to the person who asked them the question, thinking that it was my next-door neighbor. As soon as I turned around I realized that it wasn't. I saw a white woman with short black hair. She was doing something outside with her two children. They may have been carrying groceries into their house. At first glance I thought I knew who it was but as I looked more closely I wasn't sure. I debated whether or not to say anything now and decided against it. Then I thought about knocking on my next-door neighbor's door and chatting with her. to see if the employees resolved her problem, or problems.
