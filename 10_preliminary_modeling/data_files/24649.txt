I was at this house and there were three other people. I'm not sure, but I think the other people were bad except for a girl that I know. I don't really remember the dream, except in one part I had to write down something in a notebook that I didn't have, so I pretended. Someone named Lois was in charge and told me I could not wear pants. Setting: In a house I have seen in a dream before. Characters: There was a girl named Barb that is on my swim team; the two people from Lois and Clark; and another guy that I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, hate. I don't remember. (I hated, and I was angry at, the other people other than Barb.)
