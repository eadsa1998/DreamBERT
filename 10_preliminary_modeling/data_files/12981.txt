I was reading a book, but was seeing it. It was set in an office place and there was a killer. This guy was in the elevator and the door started opening. He pressed the close button but then the top was opening and then the side and he kept pressing all the close buttons. He got out and went to go outside. He heard a voice. A cop person told him not to go any further but he did and he got killed by some invisible thing. Earlier, the same thing had happened to a lady. It reminded me of Se7en and it also had '7' written on the bottom. I started writing a book. It started off about some woman snuggling in bed with her husband. Whatever I wrote was really well written though. I was thinking of calling the husband Eugene and basing it on Eugene. Mom and Darren were at the table (at Mom's house). It was in a different area and a house around the corner was on fire. I was watching something of these actors and stuff. There was a clip of Mika and "how nice he is". There were these goat/zebra things. He tried to hug it. Then he tried to hug these actors, but they didn't want him to hug them. Hugh Laurie was singing and he had piercings and I was like "Yuck!".
