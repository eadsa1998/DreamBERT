I dreamt of driving to the town my university's in.  There were pathways and flyovers everywhere, and it was very confusing.  Somehow I managed to take the correct turnoffs.  There were some little kids.  I went to the carnival.  The fortuneteller.  It was like a corpse on the table.  It told of health.  I put a six-pronged ball into a chute and 'won'.  I had my choice of little figures, a pig, Frankenstein, or many others.
