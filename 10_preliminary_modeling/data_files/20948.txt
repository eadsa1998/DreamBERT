I was in the basement and a fire was going. Water from a valve was running to the fire and circling around the drain sewer, but it was not taking it all and the water was putting out the coals. I shut the valve a little more and it slowed down. My dad had a long piece of bacon cut in strips and I was to take one. I tried to turn the bacon over and it was kind of awkward in the long hooked up strips.
