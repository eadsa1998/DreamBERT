I was sitting in a 2nd class railway carriage in either Prance of Switzerland. A friend, whom I can't identify was sitting next to me. The window was open, and we were talking to a man who was standing on the station platform, the father of my friend. He was discussing money matters and allowance with his son, and trying to comfort me. It seems that he brought me tidings of an untimely death of a friend of mine Ellyn Margolis.
