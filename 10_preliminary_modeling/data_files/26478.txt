 I'm talking with my grade school friend Patrick Bergman. We talk about sex and about December 2nd, when I lost my virginity. I ask if he also had sex for the first time on December 2nd. He says December 2nd wasn't the first time for him, but he did have sex that night, and the woman is now pregnant because of it. He talks nonsense. I can tell he is a typical white-trash man from Wilmerton. His logic is absent, while ignorance and stupidity are rampant.
