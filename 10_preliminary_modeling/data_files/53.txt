I'm on a residential street - I've come from the next street over, through the houses, and I'm looking for an address. These are not family homes but sort of semi-apartments, maybe duplexes or four-plexes, upscale, newish. I go a house or two down the street and look at one, then enter up a few steps to an entry of sorts - seems like different apartments open off the landing. There are people about, but no one to take any notice of me, they're sort of talking amongst themselves like a Sunday afternoon barbecue or something. I'm not trying to hide but I'm not anxious for anyone to take any notice of me, either. I look to my left on the landing; someone (male, dark shirt and casual trousers) is just going in a door, where there seems to be a bit of traffic. I duck back out of any line of sight, being cautious (my familiar way) of being seen. I do, however, have business here.
