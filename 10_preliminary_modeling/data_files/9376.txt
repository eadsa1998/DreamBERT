We are standing in front of a hotel at a resort and we have to take a boat to another beach where it is 'calm,' but there is a big storm with breakers out at sea and there are French doors closing off the exit from the boat house to the sea. I remember holding the doors closed against the onslaught of the breakers. Later everyone has to leave the boat house and then, in a few minutes, a huge wave tears the boat house away and whips it out to sea. Only the boatman and a few stragglers remain and they are eventually saved. We must stay at a hotel.
