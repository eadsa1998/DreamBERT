This fellow in the co-op, B.M., was sitting at the kitchen table drinking either milk or coffee. He didn't appear to have anything to go with his drink, so he asked me if he could have some of my graham crackers. I consented. I went out of the kitchen, and when I later returned, I found him eating the graham crackers plus some cookies that he had of his own. I thought to myself, "here he has cookies and cake of his own, and yet he had the nerve to ask me for my graham crackers."
