I am getting a hair cut. The barber (apparently my regular barber on R.I. Ave.) suggests the desirability of having the hair cut once per week. Says he keeps his shop so sanitary and attractive (witness several men washing their hands, brushing hair, etc. -- i.e., almost a public toilet room) that he loses $50,000 per year. In lathering my face for a shave, the barber pays particular attention to a small spot or area on left side of lower lip -- rubs and rubs and rubs it. He then begins to shave, using my Gillette safety razor. I then recall having shaved myself that morning.
