I dreamed that I was Ariel from The Little Mermaid. I was swimming all over the place in the lake. People were on a ship telling secrets and I wanted to know what they were saying so badly. But I couldn't climb up onto the ships. But I couldn't climb up. Anyway, then I was in the dining hall, sitting at the senior boys' table. Ed was there. We went outside and walked around and talked about love. When we got inside, all the senior boys were doing some sort of race on the ramp. I went to go watch and Lou was up. After he went, he grabbed my hand and yanked me away from the crowd. My mother had booked a makeover for me, but I didn't really want one. Then I woke up.
