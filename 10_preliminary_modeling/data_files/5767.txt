[1997-06-22] I was in a dorm room at college and was just getting my stuff unpacked and then this other guy appeared, just appeared and there were 3 people in the room instead of 2. I was really concerned, I didn't know if I liked the guy. I didn't know if all my clothes were going to fit, I started to put my clothes away in the closet and I said: "Are your clothes way over here on the right hand side?" He said "No, mine are all the way over on the left." So I moved everything over to the left and started to hang my clothes up. There was a knock at the door and I went to open the door and there was somebody's guide dog there instead of a person and I thought that was strange, I wonder how it knocked. It came in and I patted it a little bit and I closed the door and I was thinking, I wonder how I'm going to find out who this thing belongs to.
