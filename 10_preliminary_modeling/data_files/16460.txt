Samantha and Derek were in town and Sandra and Lee were going to be coming real soon. I think me and Samantha were going to go to the beach or something, and I was trying to record something and Samantha was kind of messing it all up on purpose as a joke, and not only messing it all up, but making it obvious to everybody else what I was doing. And Derek was just kind of sitting there like, "bleah." I think we were in the bedroom. Oh no, Samantha and another girl and me and probably Derek were up in the bedroom up here, and we had the twin beds, like we had in the old days. I had the notion that Dad was picking up Sandra and Lee from the airport. He called home from the cell phone to say that he was coming soon, but our land line rang with the same ring tone that our cell phone rings with, and that was really weird because I was all confused. What else? Oh, in this dream I had this feeling like even though Samantha played the joke with me, I felt closer to her and Derek than I did to Sandra and Lee. And I think it's because she's so distant and she hardly ever calls or writes or anything. She's kind of like estranging herself from the family somehow because she thinks we're not going to accept her for who she is. And she's having all these problems and she wants to hide them from us because we're going to say, "We told you so." So that's why in this dream I got the feeling like I wasn't really as close to them, but on that regard, I kind of feel a little hurt at times because I'm her sister and she can't even talk to me about it because she knows that I'm connected to her father and she thinks I might tell him. She never said any of this, but it's just obvious. And I don't remember anything more.
