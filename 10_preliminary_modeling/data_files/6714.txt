I was to buy a ticket. The clerk, B.W. told me the papers were ready to sign and to come into the other room. It was very dark, just a wide streak of light across. I said I would have to wait until I could see to read the papers. Then I missed my handbag, and in looking for it decided to take off my hat to fix my hair. In taking off my hat, I remove my sleepshade and that makes me wake up.
