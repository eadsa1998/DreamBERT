I am in a place that is a cross between our old apartment and the Idlewoods Avenue flat. The bedroom is similar to the Treefrog address and the hall and bathroom are like the Idlewoods address. I am putting on my shorts. They are torn in the crotch. Somehow I pin it up, but it's not a good "repair" job. I remove the pin(s) and go into the bedroom. Mary is standing there. She appears as she had as a young woman. She is not wearing makeup and her hair is down. I think she is wearing a housedress. When I see her I know she is dead, so I drink in with my eyes all I can see of her. She doesn't know she' dead, so I know I must enjoy every moment I have with her because soon she won't be with me. So I carry on as though this was very normal, and I did not let on to her that she is dead. There is a very serious and thoughtful expression on Mary's face. I tell her about the trouble I am having with my shorts and she agrees to pin this up correctly. But firstly, she wants to know if we still have the two-tone black &amp; silver flatware set. I tell her that I think we still have a couple of these sets in our garage and that I will go and look for them. Mary says she can get 10 dollars for each set from "Cardinal's" (?). I don't think that is much money for them, but I don't object. If she wants to sell them at that price, it's OK with me. Before I can go to the garage, I have to go to the bathroom. I look down the hall in the direction of the bathroom and see a woman seated on the toilet. The bathroom door is open, but the woman's face is somewhat hidden. Then I think I catch a glimpse of her face. It is either Bonnie or Mrs. B (a tenant who had rented a flat in my parents' home a long, long time ago).
