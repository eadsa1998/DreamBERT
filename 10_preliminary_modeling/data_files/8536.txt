I was at NTNS. Jane H and Janet S had both been fired. I'm watching the members try to run the shop themselves and walking around looking at what they've done with the shop. I'm in the back talking to Janet S, who is processing donations. We're talking about the changes and how difficult it has been for her. Jane H comes in and puts her things in a small square locker. It's her first day back to work. Janet S is standing off to my left. I'm talking mostly to Jane H now, about the changes and about coming back, but we're including Janet S in the conversation. I'm helping them a little bit, to process some of the big items to the floor so they have a little more room to work. The backroom is so full of stuff you can hardly move. There are about six bicycles, at least three of them are adult bikes. We move them out to the sales floor. One of the adult bikes is mine. It's in really sad shape but I thought someone might want it as a cheap fix-up bike. I didn't tell anyone it was mine because they were talking about how sad it looked and the fact that the tires were flat. I just said that someone might want it anyway - it might just need to have the tires inflated or even if they had to buy new tires it would still save them a lot of money from buying a brand new one. I also suggest Jane H price a wooden jewelry box. It's fairly large - yet sits on a piece of furniture, upright, wooden, with glass windows. It has quite a few pieces of jewelry in it. She prices it to be sold with the jewelry. I take it out front to the jewelry counter and move something over to make room for it. I set another thing or two on the bench behind the counter so they can put those things wherever they want.
