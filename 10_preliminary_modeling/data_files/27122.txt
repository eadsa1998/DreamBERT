I was sitting in a corner of my room which is on the fourth floor of a dormitory here at school. A boy was perched on my window sill. This boy is about 23 years old and is the brother of a boy my age whom I dated two or three times my senior year in high school. On the tennis courts which are below my window, a group of people were playing volley ball. Someone hit the ball quite hard causing it to come up to my window. The boy caught it and instead of throwing it down, he jumped. from the window with it. I ran to the window and watched him fall to the ground. very, very slowly. He hit the ground so hard that his head split open and I could see the blood spurt out.
