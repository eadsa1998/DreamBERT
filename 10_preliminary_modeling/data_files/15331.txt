I was watching Glee. Rachel sang a song that I thought was catchy. Quinn was pregnant again but had slept with two guys. She and Rachel had sex with a guy. It was Rachel's first time and she was annoyed afterwards because she didn't like the guy. There was something on TV about Bobby Vinton and Blue Moon. I was like 'oh I love this song!'.
