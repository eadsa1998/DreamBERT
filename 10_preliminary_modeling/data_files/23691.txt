First the assistant fire crew boss is taking the crew through the USFS compound.  Houses are older, SF style and others, stylish, but running down and abandoned.  Then I am coming to a home - not mine.  I go inside and there's a housekeeper - male - he looks like the maintenance ranger at The Maze or that guy on Star Trek.  He is rather weird - quiet, over-polite, but it's like when he gets alone he is laughing at us.  I feel sorry for him.  He has a sort of power.  Scene of me running around old buildings / houses, up and down steps, through passages.  Scene in apartment, preparing to or taking a bath.  Boyfriend there?  Him cleaning up after my spill - food?  Something about unpacking a suitcase.
