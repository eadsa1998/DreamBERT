Ezra and Roland were hanging in my room. I went on Ezra's computer and played World of Warcraft. It was dark and I was near some water with a house next to it. I completed a quest and got chased by a guy and animal into the water. I went back to my room and they were asleep on the floor. I told them to get out. They didn't want to move. I told Mom. They also were saving money for something but couldn't get it, so Ezra was going give Dad $176 for a buoy.
