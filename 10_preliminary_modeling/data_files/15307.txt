I was out with some people who were my friends. We went to Dome and I thought it was closed, but it was open [last night we went to Dome but it was closed]. People were ordering sponge cakes and mudcakes. I felt like a sponge cake. There were cakes on display. Someone I was with thought they were old. It was pink and moist and soft. I took a bite and ate it. I told them to go pay for it. We left and it was night. We walked towards a dark subway and saw a group of dark people coming and then saw some others so I started backing off, but more came and they surrounded us and asked for 'jewellery, money and phones'. I freaked out and didn't want to give up my phone, so I hid behind something. Then it was a weird movie and I got caught and sent down a drain. I hid my phone in a nook and a guy's head popped out of a sprinkler system. A young girl and her father were there and I asked them to get him out. There was a place with insects. I went back to the past to change the future and some were cut off so I cut years with scissors to continue.
