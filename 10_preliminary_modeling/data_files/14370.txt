I was with a friend who did stuff on the radio sometimes. He was trying to pick up girls. He was talking to this girl for a bit. She was quite pretty and nice. He was walking to a bedroom and saw two 'hot' women on a bed in another room so he decided to go to them. He pretended he was with the radio and they became interested in him. The nice girl came in and saw them and was upset. She talked to some guy later and I told him she was interested and gave him her number. I said "that's her [something] number if she teleports to France," and he said "why France?". Later, it was night. I was at a computer shop with Ezra. He wanted to steal something and was using a quote from The Big Bang Theory and he said he had watched the last episode. We got to the counter but I kept laughing. Then we were spies or something and we were with a guy. We were sitting down and listening to something. He had his arm around me and I rested my head on his arm. I overheard a conversation, which sounded Arabic, and realized that the people were waiting near our car to kill us. We were thinking that we'd have to walk away and that it was far. It was spooky and dark outside. There were stairs leading down underground where our cars were.
