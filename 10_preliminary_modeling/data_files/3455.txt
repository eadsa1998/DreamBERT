I am in a wheelchair and now have a small Volkswagen bug. I have had the front driver's seat removed and am trying to position my power wheelchair there. Now I want to remodel the chair. Why can't it be compact? New technology in batteries can make that part small and lightweight. It can be like a regular chair with small wheels and a tiny foot pedal thing. I go to a place and try to get them to build it for me. There are problems, but slowly the chair is built.
