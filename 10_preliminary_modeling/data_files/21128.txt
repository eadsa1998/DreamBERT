Ray Kucera was getting married. I was an usher for him. A man was loading an automatic gun to shoot on the celebration. I had a red hankie that I blew my hose in and a kid remarked to me. Some girl insulted Anna and she didn't want to be a bridesmaid. I talked to her and she was a pop bottle. Louie Ohio furniture Store tried to sell us a hot water tank. It was rusty and was supposed to be new, not used yet. The groom was batting ball and I tried to catch one, but my judgment was bad and I couldn't get one. John Tesar was at the wedding and he had a squirt gun (water gun) and monkeyed with it as he does. I had a shawl I was to put around my neck, but I couldn't get it just right so that the white side would come on top. I found a lot of money in change, pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters.
