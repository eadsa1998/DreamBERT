It was summer, and a beautiful day. We were out at a lake on a picnic. I was swimming and had been doing some diving. It must have been early in the season because I remember seeing a girl with a beautiful tan and wishing that I had one as dark. Then suddenly I was standing in line, but I didn't know why. One of my girlfriends (a redhead age 19) was in back of me, and we began talking. Again the scene changed and I was in a beautiful castle, or mansion. There was very little light, but I wasn't alone. The last thing I remember was going upstairs.
