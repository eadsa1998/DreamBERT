Merrilee was over and Mom and I and Dad were watching this movie, and it was some kind of old-fashioned movie about a girl in a bell tower trying to help a boy and stuff. And for whatever reason it made Dad cry and he went in the other room and came back and put on this sheet (?) thing like to go in a construction site.
