I was reading a book which was online. People were voting for the comedian who had the funniest quotes. Rik Mayall was number one at the moment. Chris Barrie and Will Arnett were on the list as well. Will's joke was "the only way to inhibit a dwarf is with a club" which was really funny. Chris' picture was disco like and he was wearing glasses.
