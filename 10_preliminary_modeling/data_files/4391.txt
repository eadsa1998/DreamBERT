["Refusing the love of a married man."] Jack Lemmon, in perhaps his 40's or 50's comes into the room. He is attracted to me and wants to have an affair. He sits in a wingback chair and invites me to sit with him. I do, laying my head on his shoulder and cuddling. He asks me to have an affair with him and I say no. He says is it because I am married to my seventh wife? I say, it is because you are married. It's not right. He sighs as he knows this is true and he loves me and wants me. I feel sad because I want him too.
