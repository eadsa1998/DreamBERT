I was getting on an elevator in the agency building when I saw Throm Weirton getting on another one.  At first I thought it would be easier just to ignore him, but then I decided to be friendly, so I got on the one he was getting on, and spoke to him when we were inside.  He seemed surprised and pleased to see me, but not as much as I expected.  He had a short beard, and I commented on it.  I asked him what he was doing, and he said he was investigating me.  He seemed halfway serious, and I wondered if it had something to do with Kathy and me.  I thought about my badge about then, and looked down to see it hanging there around my neck, to my surprise.
