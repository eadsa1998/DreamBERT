Will and Bryan are telling us in horrid and grotesque detail of a riot they witnessed. Will in particular tells me about a body he saw which was slashed from the tailbone to the base of his neck. He tells me about it and I visualize it in all its bloody hideousness. It is so revolting I wake the hell up.
