Apparently J----, a very good friend of mine had just been married. There was a great gathering in what seemed to be the basement of a church. (Mine at home.) We were all waiting for the wedding party to arrive. Two tables had been set up and decorated with flowers. One table, for the wedding party and close friends, was very large. The other was quite small. I was there with a mutual friend of J--'s and mine (a girl). I was very much surprised to see a boy friend of my brothers come in and I went over to talk to him. (He is 2 yrs younger than I.) When the time came to sit down to supper this girl friend of mine and I sat down at the small table with him. Then the bride's mother asked J-- and I to come over to the other table. I was very anxious to go over to that table but when we were seated over there I felt so guilty about leaving the boy. I kept looking back to see how he was getting on all the time because he didn't know the other people. I felt sort of like a heel walking out on him. The wedding party never did show up and everyone went on eating.
