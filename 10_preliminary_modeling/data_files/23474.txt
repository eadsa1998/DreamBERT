I'm in a big rambling house -- it seems to be the ashram where I live but it's much more wide and open, kind of like a barn or a warehouse. I am busy going from person to person setting them up with e-mail. When I am through with that, I go to wrap a present in my room. There are pieces of old Christmas wrapping paper all over the floor and I am trying to piece it together to get my present wrapped.
