I was at some, I was performing in some organ concert, and it was kind of a big deal. I felt like it was the Halloween dinner at Christ Methodist, because they had their little step going up to the organ. And I was playing one of my great big giant pieces. I don't know if it was either my Hindemith pieces, or maybe it was the Bach Prelude in C Minor. It could have even been the Buxtehude Passacaglia that I'm working on right now. But I was playing a piece that had multiple sections. And I got up there and I just had no clue what I was doing, and I got to the middle section and I got to where I wasn't playing the notes any more; I was just making stuff up and it was hard to just play and make it sound consonant and plausible. And then I just sort of ended it on a, just resolved it to a major chord and thought, "I need to just stop all of this." And normally, if I were playing something like that in church, nobody would be the wiser and I would kind of be off the hook. But here we were at the AGO concert, so Mr. Dawson and everybody and their brother was there and I was extremely embarrassed because I just totally didn't practice or anything. I just totally went up there and made a complete fool of myself. And I'm trying to remember how the conversation went with him. I can't really remember the words, but the idea was, I think he was just a little bit taken aback at how unprepared I was and trying hard to be nice about it. And that's all there was to it.
