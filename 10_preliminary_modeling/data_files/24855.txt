I went to a play, where I could not see the screen for the whole first act. I the second act I suddenly realized that there was another screen (the play was now a movie) that I could watch. All I can remember about the play is that it was about a princess. Setting: In a theatre. Characters: My aunt, my cousin, and my sister. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. Anxious. I'm not sure what my dream means, but it was fun!
