I was making a telephone call on a Sunday morning. I dialed the wrong number (I don't know whom I really intended to call) and the phone was answered by the daughter-in-law of a friend of my mother's. She (the daughter-in-law) is about 23 years old and has been married 1-1/2 years. She answered by saying, "This is Buddy's wife and it's 8:30 in the morning" in a very belligerent, cold manner. I hung up. She and I are, in real life, friendly but not good friends. It's more of a big-little sister friendship. I don't see her too often.
