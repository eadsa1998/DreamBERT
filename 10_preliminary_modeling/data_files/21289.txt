We bought the old home back on E. 68th Street. I looked it over, inspected it and it was left in good condition. I told Ann, "See, I dreamed we were back in this home about three times and now here we are." I was thinking of the other home in Parma and Ann said, "This one will only cost us or the payments will be about 15 in Slovak." We were near the car barns and there was a small woods which was loaded with big squirrel. A salesman came over and wanted a couple cans of stardust. It was some kind of a mixture in a can. I saw the name on the can label. The boys were taking oil out of small gallon cans and the name on the can was Ray Oil and it was for Ray to use. We were planning on going to the Charleston track. Carl Fisher and I were walking thru a field. We took our privates out. I walked with it out without holding it and I urinated in the field.
