I was in water. There were these different tornado things, which had personalities or something. The worst one would "maul your face" as someone said. The tornados were people, sort of. I was talking to the 'mauler'. Some guy managed to get past it. I was then somewhere else and tornados were coming. Dad, Ezra and I left the house and I think we were going to get Mom. We drove to this other city and stopped at a petrol station to get petrol.
