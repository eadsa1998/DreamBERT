There is a large, rectangular water tank, 10 or 12 feet long, 4 or 5 feet wide, and about 4 feet deep in the public square in my hometown. The tank is not quite level, its left end being a little higher. The inlet pipe is at right end, and the control screw about middle. There is another hand screw on same pipe with control screw. The water comes into tank from inlet pipe with a great rush, raising a lot of froth. the tank fills so rapidly that I am unable to cut off the water before it starts dripping over right hand end. However, only a little is lot. This is where I wash, bathe, comb my hair, shave (there is a bit of cracked mirror somewhere around) and I feel that these primitive arrangements are decidedly not so satisfactory as the city bath room.
