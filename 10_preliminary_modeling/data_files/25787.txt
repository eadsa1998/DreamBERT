 I'm in a lounge. My friend from high school Tina Totts is in the kitchen next door. I'm horny, and I think of having sex with her because she has sex with everyone and it would be easy. I ask her how her trip to Mexico was. She says it was shitty. They got stuck with some crappy tours. She looks different. She is shorter and has a wide mouth with lipstick on. She has a big smile. She has short, wavy hair, like the woman Krista that my friend Hank Anderson was dating a few weeks.
