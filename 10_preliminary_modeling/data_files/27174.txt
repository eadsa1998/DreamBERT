I was walking down town and it was raining very hard. But I have no recollection that I was getting wet. I was with my sister, who is five years my senior, and married. We went in and out of stores and came out of each store with our hands full. Yet before we went into the next store, our arms were again empty, where we left the stuff I have no idea. After doing this for it seemed hours, I recall we were driving along a very narrow tunnel and every once in awhile we would pass some one we knew but we never said anything to them. All the time we were driving along I also had the sensation of going up, as if in an elevator. The next thing I remember was being in swimming in a river with millions of people, because I recall they were all yelling to me to take off my hat and shoes. I was laughing and I don't think I paid any attention to them. Then I remember getting out, and I was home in bed. At that moment the alarm went off, and I remember how surprised I was to find myself actually in bed.
