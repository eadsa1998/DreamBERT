I think I had a dream about walking into outer space last time, but I'm not really for certain. I'm not sure if it was a real plane or a Disneyland ride, but it was something that I was flying in, like some kind of tour or something. And we were like shooting up, you know how that goes. And there was like this tour guide that was talking and saying something about how we go up into the atmosphere and we're in this dark realm where we can see the planets and things, and then we go up further and we actually escape the earth's gravitational force. And it's like, this doesn't make sense, man, if you can see the earth and you're out of its gravitational force, but I guess it's the orbit that I'm thinking of. We could be in orbit and see the planet, but still be in its gravity and then shoot way far out in the middle of nowhere and then be out of orbit and just spinning free. So that was a messed up dream with nothing to it, I guess.
