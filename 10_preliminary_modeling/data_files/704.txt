I was chewing a huge sticky, grainy wad of gum and 5 or 6 teeth fell out into the wad of gum. I was horrified. I peeled the sticky mess out of my mouth and remarked that my teeth must be rotten and pointed to the huge spaces with a part of one remaining, showing how it was rotten. Fade. I had to burn my dulcimer and fiddle to be warm. It was an important decision. I didn't want to.
