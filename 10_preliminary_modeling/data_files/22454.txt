My dream was fuzzy and unclear. I just felt that I was riding on a horse, although I don't know how I got there or when I mounted on it. I only felt the sensation of galloping and running. I couldn't see my hand or the reins or anything else around me. It was cloudy. My impression lasted only for an instant and I don't remember any more. The rest was not a dream for me since I don't remember any more after that impression. The sensation of galloping was pleasant, but it was over fast.
