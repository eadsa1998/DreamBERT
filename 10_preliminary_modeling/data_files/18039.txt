One day I was with [our family friend] Lynne [four years older than Melissa] and we went out to the park, just me and Lynne, and we brought Bonnie [Melissa's dog] with us and I let go of Bonnie so she went down the sidewalk and I caught her. Then me and Lynne by ourselves went to the toy store with Bonnie and Lynne found this pretty blue skirt with pink roses on it and I asked Lynne if there was anymore and she said no so I just went to a Barbie section and got a Barbie. Well then we went to the pet store and I bought a dog. When we got home the dog died, but I still had Bonnie so I was lucky that I still had a dog. Then we saw another dog that was a bull dog and he barked and barked at me. I didn't like that at all.
