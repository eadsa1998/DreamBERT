[1997-05-21] I'm at work, I'm not sure where, but I'm stopping off where a conversation is taking place in. I think the third floor hallway of our wing I think. There were some people, but the only person who was speaking to me at the time was, I think, one of the other counselors named M. And he said, "You know, you don't have to be blind to learn things too" and I said "What did you say?", he repeated it and I said, "I know that."
