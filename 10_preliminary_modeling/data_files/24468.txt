I am with a group of excited soldiers in a foreign country, Palestine or Israel. We are in large, open but fortified area with many steps and rooms. Everyone is armed, waiting to assault or be attacked. I speak with the leader, a very important man, but can only obtain a .38 pistol and some ammunition. I am not afraid to go out like this.
