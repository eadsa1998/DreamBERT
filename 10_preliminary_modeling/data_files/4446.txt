["Playing beautiful music."] A woman wants to learn to play the piano. She asks my father to teach her. She practices the exact notes and is progressing slowly. I am also learning piano from my father. He shows me a song. I learn to do it slowly also. Then he encourages me to improvise. I start to guess where the next note should be. I make some errors at first, but as I practice, I get better and better until I am playing incredibly complex jazz improvisations in infinite varieties flawlessly. My father is very pleased sat my ability and I am filled with joy at the beautiful music I can make.
