I was at a fair thing. There was a little shop and it had Monty Python and the Holy Grail figurines and I was looking for one of Galahad and I complained because there wasn't one, but there was. The fair was scary, really dark and spooky. Mom and I were in some weird town place and we had met a famous person, I think it was Michael Palin, at a little coffee shop on a corner. Also, at this fair was a little supermarket. I lost Mom and there were these aisles with Green Day poster things everywhere and then it was outside and I went on a water ride slide thing and there was another girl and Terry Jones and Michael Palin were in a car in a show and it kept changing.
