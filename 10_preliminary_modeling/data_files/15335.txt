I was playing World of Warcraft. I saw a character called Jef Costello and I got excited. There was an event on and I clicked to join it but the connection lagged and it didn't work. I found out that it was Alyssa. Her favourite movie was a random Arrested Development movie that I'd just seen. I was at work with Mom. There were lots of rooms to clean. She and Ezra were going to Africa some time.
