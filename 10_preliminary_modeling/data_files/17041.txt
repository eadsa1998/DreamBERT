I was in the passenger seat of my family's old mini-van. My older brother was driving. I asked him when was a good time to schedule to stay for a few weeks with him in his new home town. He had invited me to visit in the spring, after my graduation. He gave me a guilty but upset, as though imposed-upon look, and replied that maybe I could visit in the fall instead. I got really upset, and told him that I had been planning to visit him as my graduation present for months and he didn't even reply to my emails. Plus we both knew that he wouldn't even be there next fall. His look demonstrated his admission, though it was obvious my visiting would be an inconvenience.
