["Relax and sleep."] I have a job to do, something about dreams and computers. Maybe my dream program. I walk into the area or gym like room where Steve B. is already starting the work meeting with the other guys. I sit quite tired on his right, He is in a chair and I am sitting on the ramp I was walking on as though I had just sunk down to the floor from sleepiness. My head is near his hand and he moves it to cradle my head. Then I snuggle in a bit and he strokes my back in a strong and gentle comforting way. He is strong and hairy, but gentle and wants to help me be relaxed and get my sleep. I relax into that even though I hear the men talking and I want to do my teaching part as I am supposed to for my job. But it feels good to be cared for this way and relax. I see Charla and ask her if the director had talked to her about what lines to work on and is she doing that? She says yes. It's all worked out. I don't have to worry about it. Steve continues to pet me.
