I had a dream about school that was sort of confused. I had gotten my class assignments and a whole several sheets of mimeographed things about various classes, and I had gone into a new building to find one of these classes. It doesn't seem like a class that I was signed up for because it was some sort of a music course, and I went into the room and found a seat. It was a pretty big lecture hall and the music instructor, this man, came in and started telling us about the various courses that were on this sheet and also asking us questions about material, real involved questions about all sort of odds and ends of material, things about the economic situation, history, music and movies, all sorts of strange questions he was asking, but most of the questions he asked people who had been in his classes previously. He asked me one. He asked me who on the other side of the room knew the answer to the question and the question that he asked me and I told him from what I thought I knew because we also had a seating chart of everybody in the room too. He didn't say whether that was right or wrong, but just made a little notation on his log sheet. It was sort of a confused dream.
