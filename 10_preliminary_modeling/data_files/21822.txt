Tals the store I patronize were killing people by giving them shots by the needle, and were using traps to kill them. I saw this done and they tried to kill me, but I was alert and they were out of luck to get me. One of the boys tried to run me down with a bus, but I got away. They finally gave up trying to kill me and they changed their ways and we became friends. They tried to bribe me with money, but I wouldn't bite. My dad was going to watch or baby-sit with Judy and my mother was going to sit with him. I looked at the mileage on someone's car and it was 66,000.
