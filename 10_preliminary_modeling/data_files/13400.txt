I was at school. I went to my normal class and my exam was at 1pm to 4pm. Dad was watching a movie about some guy who was in a TV show and his name was a Greek symbol. I went to the exam place. Jeremiah was there. I was looking for a toilet but I couldn't find any. Ms Pascal said "give you a pushbike". I asked if anyone had the exam timetable. There was a cute thing in this tree. I tried to take a photo of it. I text Mom to ask what time the exam was. Ms Pascal saw me and I told her I was just finding out when the exam was. Calvin had tried to get a photo of the cute thing. There was an echidna on the grass. This crow was being scary.
