I was checking my emails and I had heaps. I had an email from a social networking site, saying "Eugene Pritchard has added you as a friend". I got excited and checked his profile. He had photos up but they were bad quality. One of them he was holding a blue toothbrush in a strange pose and I was thinking 'who takes pictures like that' and I noticed that the toothbrush was the same as Dad's. I noticed he had these necklaces on and I was thinking 'damn, I thought you were perfect!'. I didn't know if I wanted to see more, but I did anyway. There were photos with him wearing earrings too and I was deeply upset and his turns on were listed as "braininess, piercings, tattoos" etc. I was annoyed about this.
