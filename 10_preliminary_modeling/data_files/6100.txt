This dream I had was on a beach where I supposedly owned land. I was with my friends and two cousins down by the water. We were right on the edge and just got settled when big tidal waves began forming and got bigger with each crash. So we started to pack up but it was so hard. We managed to get most of our stuff. We were lucky because our video camera and radio were waterproof. Next we were inside and realized my tapes were gone and my friend's boyfriend lost his class ring.
