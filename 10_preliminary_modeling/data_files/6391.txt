I had a school dream last night. It was actually kind of frustrating. I wanted to get my classes changed, but first, I wanted to get my geometry class changed back to Mr. St's. I suppose I was at someone else's house, and Mr. St called, to check on this person, to see if they were cutting class. I connected Mr. St to the parents of the household, and as I hung up, I commented: "You know, Mr. St *does* sound like Rush Limbaugh over the phone." <br/
