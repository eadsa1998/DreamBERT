I was walking with 'friends'. We went to the Midvale Leisure centre and it was open for another half hour. We went in and went in the pool. I went in with my phone. I got out when I realized but it was still ok. I was telling the guy that worked there that I'd been stabbed in the shoulder and was going to use the gym to help it.
