I was driving on a freeway with my boyfriend and then suddenly I was at home feeling tense because I was listening to the messages on my answering machine and there was one from my father, wondering where I was because I was supposed to meet him. It was Easter Sunday and I was supposed to go and visit my parents. I had other things to do and couldn't go, and I was upset because I didn't want to have to explain my actions to my father. So I ended up yelling at my father over the phone because he didn't understand my position. Then all of a sudden I was in an apartment with all the female cast of "Mad About You." I was watching Helen Hunt (Jamie) running around looking for something, and her sister-in-law on the show found a gun in a cabinet and all the women in the room turn on Helen Hunt (Jamie), telling her she was a bad mother for keeping a gun around her newborn baby. Then Helen went outside and stood in the front of her apartment building in the dark, when a man came up to her to see what she was doing.
