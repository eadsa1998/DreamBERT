I was at a shop and getting food and snacks. They kept disappearing and I thought it must be because I kept forgetting them. I put them in a bag. I was in the electronics section and this guy was there and he was checking this girl's bag and they were giggling. As I was leaving, there was someone from school I didn't like and she was surrounded by her friends. She called me and I kept walking. Then she said "fine". She gave me this purple watch. I was then at this men's wear section and there were lots of girls there. Then I went to this food hall part. There was a guy nearby doing these family tree things. I had bought two books earlier and they were in a shopping bag.
