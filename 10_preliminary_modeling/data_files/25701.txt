 I'm going fishing with my buddy Matt Yams at Many Fish Lake. It is night or very early morning, and is dark. I call him, and he asks me about the battery. I have forgotten to charge it, and quickly put the battery charger on it for a bit. My friend's mother, Sharon Kasper, whose name is pronounced "Shorn", calls for me. My mom gives me the message that she wants me to pick up her son Jerry and his friend in Beetville tonight. They are in Beetville without a ride home. I don't call Sharon back. I don't want to pick them up: I'm busy going fishing. My mom says I should call her, so I go and pick up the phone. There is no dial tone. I say hello. It is Jerry's father Myron. I say to him that I just picked up the phone and even without a dial tone he was there! I feel guilty, but I tell him that I'm going fishing at Many Fish and I can't pick up Jerry tonight. I tell him where the lake is. He wanted to go out with his wife and needed someone to pick up Jerry. We get dressed for the cold. My brother Wally, and sister Ramona are going too. I wear a red ski mask with the face cut out and a blue scarf. We leave. <br/
