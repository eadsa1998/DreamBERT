I am walking with Barry. He and I like each other, but he is involved with another woman. So we walk down some stairs and around, he wants to show me a place to sit where not many people are around. We are talking. We come around a corner and find a laundromat. A woman Barry knows is there and they exchange greetings, I am vaguely aware of embarrassment, caught, but maybe she won't notice. A lovely black and white dog recognizes me and is surprised and pleased to see me. She/he raises his paw to shake my hand. I say, "Weren't you a horse, before?" He says yes. I say, "But now you've decided to stay on the farm." He says yes. I say, "Isn't a bit of a comeuppance for you? (or a step down)." He says, "It depends on your point of view." I smile, realizing I had been prejudicial. "Oh yeah," I say. We chat. I smile again at the dog, sort of absentmindedly, and he automatically jumps up and raises his paw to be shaken again. Then Barry sees a male friend of his in a beret hat. They greet. Barry asks him, "How are you?" He says, "Fine." They talk. Then Barry asks about particulars and he says he lives with ____, a man. Barry says, "Oh, roommates," like he's remembering his girlfriend guiltily. I now am walking with the man and listening to him talk. "Are you still in elementary education?" I ask. He says he is. I wonder if that's a good idea, him being gay and all. I hope nobody finds out or he'll be in trouble.
