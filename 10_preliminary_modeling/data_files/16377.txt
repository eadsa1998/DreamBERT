I had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad night because Mom wasn't there; she was out with Uncle Larry. But people were still fussing around. Aunt Christine was at the kitchen table, putting packing tape and newspapers in a box, so you can imagine what that sounded like. And then there was all kinds of other stuff going on. And while all that was going on, I kind of fell asleep for maybe ten minutes and I had a dream that Aunt Christine and Mom were going to drive me over to Grandma's house so that I could find a place to sleep. And so we got in her truck and we were driving, and we got there and it was turned into like a store. There were like racks of stuff there and her old carpet and things were still there, but it was all opened up and there was like this store and they were like selling like tourist gifts. And Grammy was there and she was like directing people around, and, of course, fussing like her usual self does. And there were no bedrooms there any more. And I think suddenly I was home in my room, and I had a feeling that it wasn't really real, but I went up to my bed and I laid down and I turned on my unit that's by my bed there, and it was so quiet that I had to bring it onto the bed next to me and like lay there and just it was okay. And I'm imagining this, but I just had the feeling that it wasn't real, that none of this was real. And so then I knew I had to get back to Aunt Christine's house, but I don't know what, even though I was kind of going to sleep in my dream, I had to get back to Aunt Christine's house. And I was just getting up and getting ready to go back there and then I woke up.
