I was in the country. I was going to cross a field, but there was a bull in it. When I got near the fence, the bull pushed the lose fence wire and got my close to me. I moved further back and he pushed the fence more and I had to move more. Then later on the other side of the field the bull did the very same thing as before. He seemed to be jammed against the fence.
