["Volcanos"]  I am looking at an image on a wall. It is a volcano erupting on the East Coast. Near New York City. I watch as the melting lava area gets larger and larger. I realize New York City has been totally covered and it is still getting bigger. Now it is clear that the entire world will be covered. I see the land all barren and rocky. No vegetation, nothing. I am aware that only a few people survived this catastrophe. They live in rocky caves. Now I look in front of me and see a huge long phallic looking outcropping of rock which is the core plug from the original site of the eruption. A woman is in a hot air balloon floating above it. She, another woman and a man are descending down the ropes to explore this rock. They precariously go down the ropes looking like they could fall to their death at any moment. The rock is surrounded by a deep open abyss. Now the woman looks past me. I turn and look and see a rooster. I am surprised and glad to see there are animals left. I then see two nanny goats. The woman wonders and hopes there is a male goat as well. I see a quail. There is hope for survival on this decimated planet.
