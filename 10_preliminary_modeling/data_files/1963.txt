I'm sitting on the sidewalk near the gutter and say to myself, "Wow. I'm in the gutter, literally." I feel unbalanced, like the sidewalk leans uphill. Then I look up in the sky and see a huge, square aircraft and three planes hovering near it. It's a fueling craft. I am amazed at how low they are! The noise is very loud. A man wonders if he should protect himself by putting his arms over his head and ducking. I go inside. A man is going to teach me something. He says he'll be the drummer and I'll improve a role. I go to a table and pick up a pair of banjos and start playing a rhythm. He has a single round drum with some feather design on the skin. He puts his drum away as I am now the drummer. I play intricate sounds and dance around. Then I stop and describe the planes I saw to my parents who seem interested but look bored. I tell what the man said and how close they were. "I could even read the writing on it, it was so low," I say.
