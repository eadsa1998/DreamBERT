I saw where some treasure was buried and then saw it being taken out and put into a bank. My dad wanted $20 more to go into the $2000 that was taken out of the treasure and I took out some bills. My dad was taking a $25 bill which I was surprised because I didn't know there was a $25 bill. I took it out of his hand gave him a $20 bill. There were some rowdies around and I noticed they were getting ready to go into action about that money because they were paid up to dig it up.
