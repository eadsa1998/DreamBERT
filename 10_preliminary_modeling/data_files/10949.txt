A group of girls who live in my dormitory were standing in the hall outside of my room. I was with them and we were all busily admiring the baby of one of these girls. The girl is not one of my best friends and is not married. Her baby was darling, but it was only a few months old, but was the size of an infant of 2 or 3 years. I wanted to hold the baby, so she gave it to me, but held onto it since it was so heavy. The baby kissed my cheek and I turned to my bedroom door where a high school teacher, a man about 45, was standing. I went over to him and asked him if he wanted to hold the baby. He smiled and took the child.
