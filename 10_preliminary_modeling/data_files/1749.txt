Someone chases my boyfriend. A young woman gives me the name of a man she thinks would be good for me to have as a boyfriend. I try to guess and say, "Is it Randy?" She laughs and says, "Oh! He's too young for you. I hope you are not insulted when you see who I've chosen." I feel a little curious and hurt.
