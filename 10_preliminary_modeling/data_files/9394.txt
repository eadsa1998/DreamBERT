There is war but we are in the Hills in a motel that is 'safe.' I am looking down toward the water and see a bomb land but it does not explode! I see Edward crawl through sewer pipes to figure out scheme to defuse the bombs. Suddenly a brilliant flash. An A-bomb explosion where he set it off. But I am safe with my brother, crouching on a bed of pine needles. Aghast that Edward did that, but not that he is dead. We all celebrate that we are safe. Shift: Edward reappears. I have a feeling of shock and guilty knowledge. Everyone is asking "Who did it?' Edward is handed a piece of paper with hieroglyphics that are a code for the detonation. He airily pretends that it is just a doodle and that he did not do it.
