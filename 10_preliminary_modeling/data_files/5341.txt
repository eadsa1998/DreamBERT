I dreamed that Jay was trying to get me drunk, but he was really sick. I brought him home. I was afraid my mother and father would be mad that I had brought a boy home, but they weren't since I was just trying to help him. They brought me on a trip and we had to wait in the airport for a long time before we traveled somewhere on the beach. I walked by Jay and he was so white. I was embarrassed in my bikini. Them I went back home and got on AIM, which is all I remember.
