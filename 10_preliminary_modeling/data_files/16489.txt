I had a wedding planned to a guy that I didn't even know hardly. He was somebody that I expected to get to know and we expected to hit it off really well. And Dad was like, "Well, you should set up a wedding. You should get ready. You should have everything all set _____ the way you wanted to." And so we set up so that we could have a reception at the Hilton, and then about a little while later he reminded that it was still set up and that it couldn't be cancelled because I wasn't really starting to get to know him, like he wasn't returning my calls and stuff. And he reminded me that time was running out to get to know him, and I just said, "Okay, enough of this." I ___________, but in my dream I did a bunch of crying and then finally I went to them and said, "Look, I'll give you the money that it takes to cancel the thing, but I want you to cancel it." And then he was like, "Well, you were the one that set it up," and this and that, and I was thinking, "No, I didn't. You were the one that made me." And I think there was something else. I think Mom had found this really small premie baby and picked it up, sort of like you pick up a hurt bird and take it home and take care of it. So she sort of picked it up, it was abandoned, and she brought it home, and then we had a baby in the house, plus all this other stuff going on. And, oh yeah, one other additional part to this dream: I dreamt that I was at some kind of class that was teaching me how to do something technical. I think I was at a thing that was sort of a cross between a CC TV and a computer, and I don't remember what I was doing, but she was trying to get a feel for how much I knew. I was working with this lady, and I was kind of going off and thinking about my own thing, and I wasn't able to do what I was supposed to do. And I was too preoccupied by this heavy stuff about this stupid wedding. And then I think I woke up.
