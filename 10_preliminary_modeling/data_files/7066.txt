Hunting for the manuscript of the research I had started I'd handed it to L. Now I could find only fragments and couldn't carry it on. LK came to help. I should have handed it to him; wasn't he here when I started the research? ... In a schoolroom. She was shutting windows. I say it'll be too warm. If the draft is too much for her, why doesn't she move? But she won't. A young blonde girl comes in and sits down in the first front corner seat. I say, "I think that was mine." She starts to move but I tell her it's all right to keep the seat.
