I was watching a movie. There was a couple and they had a kid when she was 19. It was a cartoon sometimes.  There was a flashback and the guy was like 'trailer trash'. He said he hoped she was going to run off to college and she said she was but she got pregnant and didn't. She was then at a party which a guy who looked like a young Anthony Perkins, who was her 'rich' date. She left him for the poor guy. When she was older she slept with some guy and the guy and her daughter caught her.
