Mine and Polly's family were to stay at this big wooden cabin. We knew it was a scary movie, but we put it in the VCR anyway. All of a sudden we were all in the movie and we knew we would be, but played the movie anyway. It was like Funny Farm because we kept looking at the full moon. Then I was sitting on a stool by the stairs and Jason Bateman was filming a movie, but they had to stop because I was sitting there. They told me to move and I did. I went back and everyone was mad at me. Just as Polly's and my family were about to leave (we were waiting for the creepy people in the house to do something freaky) me and Polly went to get our Converse and stuff. We were going upstairs with the creepy old lady (Polly first, her second, and me last) and the lady said, "I'm the person, so you can walk in front of me." I knew what she was referring to. She was going to kill us when we were packing. So I told her, "That's okay, I'll stay behind." I walked in the room quickly and ran. I left Polly with the lady and I felt scared for her. All the creepy people were saying, "Get her," and as I was running for the door, this lady was out the door. This lady was about to shoot mine and Polly's family car, but she almost shot me because I stepped out right when she was about to shoot. I remembered everyone was scared I would get shot, so they said, "Watch out," and all had their mouths open. We all escaped and saw tons of cars, actors, friends and other people leaving, so we went to register and were about to go back into the house because my dad forgot his wallet.
