I was at a park. I met a boy who was crying. I was taking care of kids at My school - the ones I take care of in junior coaching. I calmed a little kid down. His big brother stepped out and was some movie star. I don't remember which one. For some reason we were immediately at the boardwalk (the movie star and me). We were really good friends and walking along. He bought himself about 12 chocolate bars. Then we walked out of the boardwalk. Setting: In a park, at the boardwalk. Characters: A crying boy; some kids I take care of; the crying boy's big brother, a movie star; myself. Feelings and Thoughts: (not filled out)
