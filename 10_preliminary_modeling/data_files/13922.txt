I was watching a movie with Ezra. I had seen it before. Leland Orser was in it and he lived in this huge house. I remembered he had died and become psycho or something, but after that (he got killed by a ghost) it was real and I was there. I had met him before and he decided to leave his stuff to me. I went there and saw him sitting on the stairs. He said hello and he asked "You're dead?" and I said "You're alive?". He said that ghosts could make things happen (turn lights on and off etc). I went to bed there and he staying with me for some reason. He got in the bed and I went to lock up. I went back and he said something to me and I turned on the lamp and said "ow".
