["A good screw and Howard in a crib."] There is some kind of attention between me and the leader, some guy, partially a sexual tension of attraction. I need to go out, and I go out and we're sort of in Alaska. In lots of snow. I am with some guy and he gives me a pair of earrings. They are sort of temporary. I say, I haven't worn any for awhile. We go out, we are sort of spies or soldiers and we go out and do our thing and come back. He says go ahead and keep the earrings on. So I'm coming in the lead and I stumble a bit as I come in. I then see the male leader is in a crib, naked, and he looks like Howard. He is lying on one side and is in shadow. I'm starting to take the earrings out. The same man is now there, dressed and not in a crib. He says you can keep the earrings on. I hesitate and then keep them in. I see he is trying to be nice to me, and so I say well, it was kind of nice to have them in again. It was a good screw.
