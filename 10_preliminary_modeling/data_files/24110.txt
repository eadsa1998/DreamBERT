In the dream I had just woken up to get ready for class and I was in my dorm room. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom. In the bathroom there was a bed with my friend Nancy, who is 20, and her mother on it. It wasn't her real life mom. It was the actress from the TV. The mom kept trying to tell me something but I can't remember what it was. I just kept on wondering who this woman was because I knew that Nancy's mom didn't look like that. I eventually left the bathroom and was eventually in a hall where a lot of people from my floor had all congregated. Then I realized I had to go to class in the dream and I was late. That's when I woke up and realized that I actually overslept.
