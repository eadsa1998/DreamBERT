My friend Reece is throwing a big party - like a stag do, but not a traditional one, because there are girls there. Initially it's a proper late night house party with everyone getting drunk. Then people start decorating the house. One girl (who may have been at my school) has put a lot of effort into creating a shrine to Elvis Presley in Reece's bedroom. It is very strange. Friends Ralph and terry are very pally in the dream, like a comedy duo. I'm floating around on the edge of the activity and socialising. The next day we are all in a public place. There are clothes shops and a large park or football field all in what seems like a closed community. We are based in Reece's house near by. During the afternoon there is a game to see who can dress in the most ridiculous way. Next we are at another friend Toby's house. This could have been last night's party venue rather than Reece's house. Toby seems a bit hungover. I venture upstairs to his bedroom and find an assortment of ridiculous looking sports clothes - like over-the-top hip hop street-ware - hats, tracksuits etc. I select an outfit and mix it with some crazy retro clothes and boots I find in a shop. We reconvene at the park where the others are dressed up too, and drinking starts again. Reece, Terry and Ralph are already getting drunk.
