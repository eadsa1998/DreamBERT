 My mom is gone. I have a party at our house. We are in the garage, and the big old garage door must still be in place because my friends and I walk out of the garage and into the front of my neighbors, the Stein's, yard. Others and I drink beer and smoke marijuana. My sister Heather is there and she is watching me to see if I do anything so bad that she can tell my mom about. I go in the house through the garage door and Heather goes out and ask my friends if I have drank beer or smoked marijuana. She finds out that I did. My friends Stephen Ramos and Emerald Reinhold are there, with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, and schoolmates John Gregor and Kevin Salt. We are on the sidewalk in front of our house having foot races. We race a boy against a girl. I think I may race Annie. I keep track of the names on a small board: who raced and who won. My writing is very messy, like I am in kindergarten. John's mother picks him up in a truck. She pulls into the front driveway. The police are at my house, and we are in the garage. They ask me questions about my truck. They ask about the accident I was in, and the insurance and repairs. I tell them that I bought the bumper from my neighbor for $10 and paid some guy $40 to weld it on. The police go after this lead I gave them. The police are in my kitchen. I ask them if they have a search warrant, and they show one to me. They are searching for hallucinogenic mushrooms. I have gotten rid of nearly everything. They search my room. They'll find the aquarium and plexiglass and spray bottle. I think I'll be okay: they won't be able to pin any crime on me. I don't have any mushrooms. I need to warn my friend Tiny. My mom was the one who called the police. She tells me as the police are searching. I call Tiny. His younger brother Matt answers, and says Tiny is gone. I tell Matt what Tiny and I have been doing, where Tiny's aquarium is, and to find the seven bags of mushrooms and get rid of them, because the police are coming!
