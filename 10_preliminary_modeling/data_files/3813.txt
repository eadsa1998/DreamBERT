["In bed with Howard, again."] I am in bed with Howard. He lies on my left side and he wants to make love. I feel uncomfortable but I don't move away. I am naked and lying on my back. He is cautious and asks me frequently if this is all right. I feel the old feelings of frustration, because it is like it was when we were married. He is trying to manipulate me into feeling sexy so I will consent to making love. I feel sad.
