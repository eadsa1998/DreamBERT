Mom, Ezra and I were in an outside area, like a park, but there was a path and everything else was bushy. We were at a table. We were meeting some bad guys. It was Tricia Helfer. There was good waiting for us and I was eating some. Another time we were waiting, we had a food fight and when she came there was no food left for her. Sometimes it was a guy that came. I gave them some of my cake. Another time, Mom told me to go chill for a bit. I had a skateboard/bike thing and a rode it up the path, up a hill. I was thinking maybe there was a car waiting (incase we tried to escape) but there wasn't, so I left, but then I saw one coming. It started coming down the path and trying to run me over. I got back to the table and Mom realized what was happening. We ended up in a car with me and Mom in the front and Tricia Helfer driving. I thought she was going to jump out and I told Mom to be ready to close the door if she did and then she did. I was driving the car and then handed it over to Mom and we were getting chased through the traffic. Then me, Ezra and Jayson ended up on a bus. It was really old and full and had compartments with doors inside. We pressed the button to get off at the next stop but it went past it. I yelled out "excuse me, you missed our stop!". He missed the next one too and said that he was picking up 'Cassandra'. We got to a house and it was Alia Shawkat but she was older and pretty. We got off at Northtown and I text Mom to meet us at "Brumby's". We waited near the bottle shop. There were pictures on a wall of us and one's of Darius and Eugene. Mom said that Dad's house needed to be vacated.
