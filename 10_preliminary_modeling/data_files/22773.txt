It is hard to point out the time of day in which my dream occurred. I don't really remember. I think it was rather late because it was cold. What I do remember is that I saw a boy of about 12 or 13, with tanned skin, dark brown hair and blue eyes. He looked extremely poor, I think he was a beggar. He was running with a small package in his hands and he wanted to put it down somewhere. I realized that it was a package of garbage. When I saw him, there was an old lady behind him who looked like a witch. It seems there was some relation between them. I told him to run faster and I was afraid of the old woman, so both of us ran. But before, when It old him to run faster, he answered something to the effect that she moved very slowly, but we moved fast, so we shouldn't worry. We kept on running until we got to a corner. It was a corner I knew because it was and is part of the neighborhood where I used to live, which I don't like. Well, when we got there, I crossed over to the other street, but very briefly saw a face that smiled in the strangest way; I think it was a homosexual. I didn't see the kid any more. I think I kept on running. I had never seen the old woman or the kid or the homosexual. I am not sure, but I think that in this dream I saw a small cat, with a light fur, but I can't say at what point I saw it.
