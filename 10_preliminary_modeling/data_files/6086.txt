I was at the beach with this Harvard student and this Brazilian guy. And suddenly behind me there was a huge wave coming on to me. The two guys got through the wave which was blue. When I tried to go through it, I couldn't because even though the wave became clear, there was something strong that wouldn't let me follow the two guys.
