I dreamt I was at home with two little girls of about 10 or 12, but I don't know them, and that a mad woman wanted to get into the house. And I was scared, and the two girls and I were trying to keep her out, but the mad woman stuck her head through an open window. And also at one point the main door and the garage door were open and she wanted to get in, but couldn't do it because I told my mother to close it and she was able to do it.
