I am captured from my home planet by a powerful sort of wonder woman. I am afraid and miss my boyfriend Tex very much. I am weak. She's coming up at me from a manhole. She's huge and powerful and scares me nearly motionless. Then I somehow realize she is so big she has to be fake, and in fear my fear had flapped my arms and discovered that I could fly. I became powerful. I called out to the women in the planet to fight for their freedom. They were lethargic and didn't know what freedom was. Whenever I felt strong, she would talk about Tex. I would become homesick for him and lose my strength.
