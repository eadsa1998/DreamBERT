We were friendly with these aliens. One of them was called Jenny Broomer (which was just spelt with Greek symbol). She was actually Callie and was with George (both from Grey's Anatomy). She had to eat cockroaches before she'd be with him. She was in our spa. I didn't like her but was trying to be friendly and gave her lollies. I went out there at one point and she was gone.
