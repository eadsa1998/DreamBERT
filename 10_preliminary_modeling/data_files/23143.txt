I was staying in a cabin with a lot of people.  It was nighttime, and they all decided to pile into a convertible and go somewhere.  I was the only one who chose not to go, and they were sort of surprised by my decision.  Later, the cabin I was staying in, sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag, became one of the departments in a department store, and I was embarrassed to be lying in the middle of it while people were trying to shop.
