I had become famous and I went to retreat, to hide really, from all the attention, to take a break from life.  I went far away to someone's house I knew, a relaxing house away from things.  I lay down on a bench that seemed hammock-like.  The telephone rang and my host said it was for me.  We were both surprised because no one was supposed to know I was there.  I was wondering how they'd found me.  Someone important called me because I was famous, he wanted me to give advice to the President.  First he asked, how is your arm doing?  [In my sleep I was laying on one side and crushing my arm and the shoulder hurt, it really felt crushed.]  He had meant that they knew about some accident in which my arm was supposedly hurt.  I answered, well you know I seem to have crushed it by thinking that it would happen, or making it happen psychically (some physical manifestation of thoughts).  Then he asked did I know the current Secretary of Health, he said you know the guy who used to be President of France.  I answered, oh you mean Mitterand? and I pronounced it as in French, like Mih-teh-hhran with the guttural R.  And he thought this very funny, that I would pronounce it in correct French, he even laughed at me, and repeated it back the way I had pronounced it, saying, "oh you say it: Mih-teh-hhran".  I was somewhat annoyed, here they were calling me for advice, and laughing at me.
