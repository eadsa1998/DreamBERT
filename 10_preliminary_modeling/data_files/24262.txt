Had another dream, but I don't remember it. The vibes of it, though, remind me of a dream I had in the past where I was floating -- or trying to get around -- in this very Southern California-like place that had concrete-bottomed inner-city rivers, like lion country safari water park wild rivers in the city where I was born. I was in a meeting, trying to climb a tree off in a park area a little ways away from the network of rivers that were abused by the public. My bike was laying down under one of the trees. The concrete rivers were far ranging, but in many parts, hazardous and drained with hazards like shopping carts in them. I wanted to jump across and play, but felt inhibited, like I was being watched. Someone came up to me as I was under the tree. There were red berries there -- firm, and poisonous, like the kind behind my neighbor's house when I lived in the city where I was born as a kid.
