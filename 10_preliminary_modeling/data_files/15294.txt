I was at this building that was usually used for something completely different (concerts maybe), but had some event going on for The Room. Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero and 'Steven' were there. Wiseau was wandering around and was lonely. First I was outside and I was going in with Dad and Ezra. There was a huge, empty basketball court. I took a photo and said it was going to be very busy in a few hours. People eventually started to come. We got in and bought a ticket for a photo with Sestero, and got the photo taken. I asked Mom if I'd shown her the 'hi doggy' scene and she said she had watched the whole movie. There was an alternate scene of Lisa in the red dress, it was pulled up over her bum and she was walking weirdly. She walked backwards at one point and was flirting with some guys. I ended up befriending Sestero and he said he paid for a photo with 'Steven' and he got one too. It was like $60 for a photo. 'Steven' was actually an Asian and had a Mohawk and earrings in each ear. There were only three people in his line. I think he bent down and picked me up and could just carry my weight, but struggled and I had to put my hand on the floor to help. Then he left. I looked at the pics and I was cut out of them and the rest were all stupid. I complained to this lady and asked for a refund because I didn't know where he had gone. A black guy had just sat down for a photo and Sestero was going to pay for it. We got scratchies and hung them up and got them later.
