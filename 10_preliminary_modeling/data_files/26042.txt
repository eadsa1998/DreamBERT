 I'm with my girlfriend, who is a weightlifter. I am spotting her as she does reverse dumbbell curls. I kiss her forearms as she curls the weights. I rub my growing erection up against her calf as I kneel to spot her. I'm eating an apple, salivating profusely. I'm really sexually aroused, and want to have a sexual encounter with her right now! She says to me, "Stop digesting my food." I am taken back, because this is a light reprimand. I say, "Okay", meekly. I sit in a chair and read a magazine. In the magazine there is supposed to be an article on Montana fishing, on page 80. This is the September issue. I turn to read the article but there aren't 80 pages in the magazine.
