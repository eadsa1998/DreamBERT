We were in the arctic. We traveled by hanging on to a rope that trailed from a helicopter. We were new. We were told to go out to the snow fields and pick up yellow cards. We figured, "That's easy. We'll be close to the base so we won't take our jackets." After we got out there, walking, my partner fell and started to become frozen to the ground. I ran for my 3rd partner and said, "Call for help." We waved our found yellow cards at camp. A signal person saw us and said, "I think they're in trouble." Another person said, "Nah! If they were in trouble, they'd light a signal fire." I thought, "We would but we stupidly left our jackets and gear behind." I really hoped they'd figure out we needed them. The signal person fired a flare and they sent out a helicopter. They went to go pick up our frozen friend who is a yellow card now. The rescuer warmed up the edges with his fingers saying, "O.K., we missed the eyes, the ears are O.K." Then my partner and I helped him on the rope as we flew back to camp. A grandmother came out as we landed. Someone said, "What's it like out there today?" She said, "There's fire on the desert and daises, like that's dangerous." I said, "Ya, we saw the fire, burning in the snow, no fuel." We all went in. Now our frozen friend was a cat. A black cat ran over and licked him lovingly to help unfreeze him. We watched and commented on the caring.
