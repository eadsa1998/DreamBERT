I was trying to catch a train. Thought, "It's a good thing it leaves so late for my coat won't be too warm." Start to put it on. Trying to get all my bags together. Hear train on second track. Well it stops several minutes. See yellow baggage cars passing. I must get in the other end. Then I see four baggage cars detached and being pulled by a horse.
