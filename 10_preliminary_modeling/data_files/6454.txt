I'm in the desert, having a conversation with a couple of German people. The conversation is moving along smoothly, until I can't remember the word for 'battery'. "Ist es 'batt-err-ee'?" I ask. I get laughter. I hem and haw for a while. "Ich weiss dass!" I turn to one of them. "Wie sagt man "battery" auf Deutsch?" <br/
