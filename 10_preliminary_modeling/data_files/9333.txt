I was walking near the city auditorium and church. It is twilight. a police car comes by with large 8 foot by 8 foot board on it with curved edges--like plywood with holes in it, curved as with steam to make it bend into wings. I looked up in the sky and the same piece is sailing upwards where it hovers like a martin, kite, or prehistoric flying monster half a mile up. I assumed it took off when cops came around the corner too fast and an updraft lifted it like a glider. Then it swoops down with a graceful parabolic curve, just clearing my head, and it enters a house ... and I know it is a steel sheet. It goes right through the wall of the house, parallel with porch, through the picture window where I see people playing cards. It travels at table-top level and I assume came to rest beyond the house in an alley. I do not go in, knowing the dead bodies and ugly destruction. I don't want to be a gaping curiosity-seeker. Later I read in a paper where five people killed, when it caught them playing cards in the early evening.
