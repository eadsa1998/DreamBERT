Audrey made a fire and some lumber on a streetcar was burning. I went for the hose. I got in my car and it rolled out into the street and against the streetcar. The car gave it a push and it ran into a post and smashed up. There was a fire in Rivertown and I went for a hose, but couldn't put it on this faucet because it was a junk faucet. I rode on a streetcar. I saw a high peak in Rivertown. I said, "I don't remember seeing this before." I looked up at it and it was steep and high. There were trees on top. We were going to go thru a cow field. I said, "No, you will get chased by a bull." Someone went into the field, then ran back. A bull rushed the fence and came thru it. We ran away. I had a #11 on my back. I was nominated as representative. I saw two wood piles. We were along the lake and then went into a pool to swim. Men were wading thru the lake. People were swimming in the lake. I was in a cap and hat store. I told the proprietor how come he didn't wear a hat or cap if he wanted someone to wear them. I saw a red-haired toupee. Steve T. had his head bandaged.
