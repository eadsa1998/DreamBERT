Samantha comes out to ask me kindly to come in with everyone. I say, "I can't. My right leg is like in a cast." I'm seated on a bench on the sidewalk. Or they would even carry me. I tell her it would hurt too much and refuse firmly. I then see Doug driving up in his 18 wheeler truck. Lydia is in the passenger side. A man hops in and kisses her on the cheek. He's a red neck type. They circle around my bench, stop and get out. I get up and Doug and I walk to a square outdoor cafe table. Lydia follows. Doug is bragging and talking and I'm bored and uptight. I'm sorry to be there listening to him.
