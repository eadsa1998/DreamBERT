I went to 'school'. No-one I knew was there. This guy had a crane and was making this blow-up dude dance in a tree. This guy who looked like David Anders and this other guy had met earlier. The other guy was going out with this other guy but he was telling the David Anders look-alike that he was in love with him. They fought and David fell off the edge of this cliff type of thing and the guy grabbed him and there was a shiny thing on his back. He turned robot like and saved the guy (he was a robot). Dad was using the crane later. The Spice Girls were using the crane for a show. Baby Spice had pigtails and this girl commented on them.
