I was going to my car at night and an attorney was with me. I said, "Your son is in my car and I saw other men with him," so I said for him to go back and get a gun, which he did. As I got nearer, I saw the men get out of the car and I went to the side where they couldn't see me. One had a rifle. I ducked on the ground behind the earth. I thought he was going to shoot my way. Then I got away and flew up near them and they were in our house. I sneaked near the window. Then I got into the house. Two of them came into the room They seemed to be drunk. I hit one and he went down. The other one fell, but was going to get up. I hit him also. One pulled a gun out of his pocket, was pointing it at me. I took the gun and searched their pockets. Ann came in and said they were alright. I noticed she was not afraid or nervous. We went by Tony Marolt's at night. It seemed closing time because the tables were dirty, so I put something on the table and we sat beside one. We had a party, some people from our old neighborhood were there. We drank up all the whiskey. I was driving and someone said Carter passed me up. I wanted to catch him, so I stepped on the gas. I stood up and went ahead without holding the wheel. It dawned on me, so I got hold of the steering wheel. I seemed to be going thru a tunnel or thru something I can't recall now.
