 I'm with my friend Kevin Simpson in his truck. I go into a liquor store to get a case of Bull Ice 40's. I buy it and go back out to the truck where we discover that one of the bottles is missing a cap. The caps are small and white. I go back in to get a new case. They are all out of cases of 40's, so I try to just get one bottle to replace the one without the cap. The man can't find the key to the refrigerator or cabinet where the 40's, so he gives me the spare key. I can't find the place where the 40's are kept, though I look. I go out to the truck to get Kevin, because I know he has the main key to where the 40's are. I ask him where the key is. He shows me it's on his key chain. I tell him to come back in and return the key! We go in. The man is preparing a cooler and a box of beer to appease us. It is filled with large 20 or 30-ounce cans of beer. There is a hole in the wall, where the concrete is broken to see if there were any 40's, but there are none, only other beer. Kevin and I take the cooler and the box of beer and put it in the bed of the truck. Kevin has a flat spare tire in the bed. At first when I see the tire I think it's great that he has finally gotten a spare tire, but it doesn't do much good when it is flat. We are on a road trip. I am in a car with my friend Matt Yams, his brother Jasper, and Kevin. We drive by a large building with large stone walls. This is the Great Wall, and is a landmark and sight seeing destination, which seems to be in the vicinity of Quarryville. Kevin wants to turn in and visit since we're on a road trip, and we're supposed to have fun. Jasper is going to college and tells us that when he leaves for college he will be picked up next to Superhighway 100. he has to go by the side of the highway and wait.
