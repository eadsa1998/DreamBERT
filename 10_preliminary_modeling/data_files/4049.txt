["Loving connection and Nyquil"]  I am a young innocent woman, living with my family. A young man, Roger, from an old soap opera, loves me. I am attracted to him, but so innocent I am unawakened, sexually. He gives me a drink of Nyquill. We talk. He stands very close to me and I enjoy the feeling of being close to him. He gives me another drink of Nyquill. Now he kisses me. It is sensuous, delicious. I warm up to him. We are standing up, leaning against a wall and each other. We continue kissing and it keeps getting more seriously loving and sensual. This is an innocent age and I have now crossed the line of propriety in a relationship. So we decide, still drinking the Nyquill, to run away together. We sneak out of the house, carrying two cocooned babies. I open a small hole in the cocoon and reveal the red Nyquill they need to grow on. We leave to live a life together with our babies.
