I'm in a school (college-setting), there is a party going on. I am told to report to the gym where the teacher looks at me and has me do some weightlifting stuff. I labor through it but when I'm done he tells me I would be a perfect boxing candidate. He says I'd make a good wrestler too. I get out of there and end up in the swimming pool area where I see comedy/film stars Steve Martin, Martin Short and John Candy, hamming it up for a movie. I leave there and run outside where the party is, only to run into my co-worker (Tom), who asks me to dance a slow dance with him. I'm a little surprised since I know he's married. When we start to dance, he kisses me and though I'm strongly attracted to him, I push away. He says he wants me, then says he really gets turned on by women who "look like sluts." I see he is very drunk. I run away when other guys around us say, "Tom, here comes your wife." He is stumbling trying to chase me. I run back into the gym where the gym teacher says, "You absolutely have to be a boxer, you'd be great!" I'm dressed in a clingy lilac long silk gown looking very shapely and buff. I tell him there's no way, I couldn't take the punches because I'm pregnant! And I much prefer riding horses. In the gym I see a girl suited up in red jacket and riding breeches pulling her riding helmet from her locker. I tell the gym coach that's what I'd rather be doing. At one point while I'm dancing with Tom, he asks me, "Do you know what it's like not to have sex for year?"
