My wife and I had decided to buy a house in the city where I go to graduate school . We looked in the paper and now went out to look at the first place that was advertised. We went into the place and looked around. It had several bedrooms and was an older frame house, but it was fairly nice. It had about an acre and a half of land (unable to understand). There was a factory in back at the end of the yard. It didn't go with the house. There were a couple of garages that did go with the house. They had second stories that were filled with supplies and waste products from this factory. I thought it would be nice to have the garages. The man who owned the house went over and talked to the man who owned the factory, and he said they would have them torn down so they wouldn't interfere with the view. I didn't like the idea of losing the garages, but the man convinced me that they were so rickety that it wouldn't be a good idea to use them and they couldn't be moved in their present condition. So we went back into the house. The man showed me a copy of the form I would have to sign to buy it. I read it over. Then I handed it to my wife to read. It suddenly occurred to me as I was reading it over that whether it was a good buy or not, we couldn't possibly afford the purchase price of this house, which was $30,000. I said so to my wife and the man seemed disappointed, since it seemed before we were actually going to buy it. I became very firm about it. Actually we didn't have any money and where could we get $30,000? We couldn't pay more than $25 per month and at that rate it would take us 61 years to pay off the house. So we told the man we'd think about it, but we didn't think we'd be able to. We drove off looking at the address of the 2nd house we wanted to look at and hoping it was a smaller place. We really didn't need three bedrooms and things like that.
