Anastasia asked a friend about a job for me and brought a menu with my name on it to say that I got it. I called her friend to confirm (her name was Julie) but she was busy. I went to the restaurant and the guy there welcomed me and he was weird. He stared at me and said "you're beautiful" and stuff like that and I was confused. The others didn't seem to react. Grady and other people I knew were there. He plugged in a microphone and started singing Dear God and we laughed. He wrote down that we laughed and seemed upset. I said I'd laughed because I liked the song. Someone told me that he was not the actual boss and brought in to be like this as a test. I then got to do a trial and wore a trainee badge. I followed one of the girls. She served some customers and had to put sauce on a pizza. There was a lot of it and she had to do it slowly and carefully to draw a pattern. The John Cleese show was at 9pm and I took off without saying anything to get there in time. Mom picked me up and I realised I should've said something. I called to explain. My battery was almost empty.
