I am in a garage, having my car worked on - something to do with the wheels, or rotating the tires. I'm chatting with the mechanics, I've seen them before, though not to work on my car, I think. We're casual friends, and this is a friendly sort of little neighborhood garage. The burlier guy says it'll be $89.95 to do the work. I roll my eyes and say, fine, ok, at least it isn't any more than that, all the other work I've had done lately has been a lot more, this isn't so bad. I'm feeling pretty lively, strutting around in my new black motorcycle boots and jeans. The other mechanic is noticing, and points at my boots to the other one, a sort of elbow-in-the-ribs look. I think I look spiffy.
