I got up after my boyfriend Jeremy left for work and started cooking an egg.  I went out on the balcony to talk to Jeremy before he drove away, but when I came back in there was a black woman in the apartment.  I finally got her to leave and went back to the egg.  I realized the door was missing from the refrigerator.  I decided the super must have come, but thought it was strange that I didn't notice it the night before.  I was worried about the food because it was Saturday, and the handyman wouldn't be back to finish the work until Monday.  More people started coming.  One woman was convinced she had just rented the apartment.  Someone's kids had climbed out their window to the balcony that seemed to be shared with the neighboring apartment, and got inside that way.  I finally found out they were looking for a toy they lost, so we went out to a different section where they could get on the roof.  I was trying to get everyone to leave, and I was just about to close the door, but it was another two feet away, and several more people came in.
