We lived at the Stermes' house, or so it seemed.  The house didn't look exactly like theirs, but the Skinners' house was in exactly the same position relative to it.  While walking from the garage to the house, I saw two girls in the Skinners' yard.  I wondered if I had anything on.  I found I had on a purple bathing suit and a light purple shirt.   Later in the evening I went up to the Skinners'.  They had two girls about my age, and one especially was pretty cute.  I didn't remember having met her, but she kept holding my hand, and they both seemed to like me.  They also had a couple of brothers, one of them about my age.  He shook hands with me as I left.  I thought it was strange that the girl was the second girlfriend I had had from this same house.  When I got back to our house (i.e., the Stermes'), it was pretty late, and there was a party going on.  When I came in I saw a lot of people-dancing, etc.  There was a jukebox with about the same selection of songs as the one at Hangout's on Madison Ave.  There was also a cigarette vending machine.  I saw one man I thought was Leon Witherstone.  When he saw me, he shook hands with me and joyfully said how glad he was to see me.  I was horrified at his appearance-he looked much older, with very white hair a wrinkled face, and a peg leg for his left leg.  But he was very happy to see me.
