I saw or heard Foolish Heart. I heard Po Po or Poe Poe. I heard someone calling for help, help, help. I went into the company store in Rivertown and opened the front door and motioned the manager to come. He came with a friend and his wife. I introduced myself to his friends. We went into the store. I was going to the races. It was the first day or opening day. Little Johnnie fell off the bed.
