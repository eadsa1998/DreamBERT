I'm in a swimming pool. There are seals and an octopus in there. At first, I'm a little afraid of the octopus, but they all come to me and I learn to love them. They are sweet, loving creatures who look at me mutely with soft, big, moist eyes just radiating love and need for love. I stroke them on the head and pet them. They love it and need it. I get out of the pool and one creature follows me. He is tiny and so needy. His name is Tom. He curls up on me and I pet him and soothe him. He's so small and needy. At one point he's lying on my thumb and gets absorbed into my skin. At first I am concerned, but then I realize he needs that nourishment from my body. He later comes back out, large and more happy. Now I'm a teacher in a rural, small, one room high school. It is graduation day. My class is seated on the bleachers and I stand before them. I am touched by their beauty, intelligence, loving natures and creativeness. I give them a speech. I say, "I know you are feeling sad at leaving your dear friends of four years. I too am feeling sad, for never have I seen such a loving, creative, intelligent, beautiful group of students. If you are the typical graduating class, then this world will be blessed and things will change. You go out each of you, melded with your friends. A piece of them lives in you now. So, bless you, and good luck." I begin crying. Someone shuts the door on them as soon as they are out, but I open the door again and continue my grieving of their departure. Then I stop crying and feel peaceful and loved.
