I remember the part where I was supposed to go through the haunted house. A girl led me around a little stand (with my eyes open) until I reached the talking bears. When I started playing with one a crowd of kids gathered around me. Setting: At my school in the ballroom. Characters: The girl that led me around was an alumni, and the kids that gathered around, I don't know. Feelings and Thoughts: Stupid. I felt kind of stupid in the "haunted house" and playing with the bear.
