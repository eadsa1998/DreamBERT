We are living in a different place: it very MESSY and cluttered: in the kitchen there is wool and coal in a bin, and there are books lying about everywhere. WALLY returns and is very hungry; I run to fix him food in the kitchen and it is all cleaned up!! I can move freely and am very happy to fix a meal for Wally.
