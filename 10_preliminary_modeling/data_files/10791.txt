I dreamed of my last year's English teacher. In real life she is a good friend of mine, in my dream she was a good friend of mine, out of a blue sky she could do nothing but look at me with disdain; not a word passed between us. It was my birthday and I was having a small party. My teacher was there along with a few or my girlfriends. I was opening gifts and had showed the teacher one of them, but there was such a cold lack of response, I showed her no more. When it was time for my guests to leave, I thanked the teacher for coming, but her answer as again only a look of disgust. Later I remarked to my best girlfriend (the only other person whom I recognized (in my dream) that I didn't know what I had done or said, and hence couldn't understand Mis blank's behavior. The only thing I could remember was that once I had said she was rather an odd person.
