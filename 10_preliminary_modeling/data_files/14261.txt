I was at school and in the office because I was doing a private study thing there with Ms Pascal. It was night. There were other people in there. Someone joked about how clean it was, but I didn't get it so just went "ok...". Then someone went "ew, gross!" and there were three huge cockroaches on the ceiling. I remembered this happening before and the school had set on fire so I didn't unpack my stuff. I thought that maybe I should get Eugene. The biggest cockroach kept following me around. This boy on the net had ways to get rid of them (I think). Then I was at Mom's in the dining room. There was a small TV in the lounge room, but in front of the wall closest to the back of the house. Darren and Mom were there. Thank God You're Here was on and they were about to 'announce' the next person and I said "Hamish Blake!" and it was and for the next one I said "Shaun Micallef!" and I was right again. I had guessed them because they were two of my favourites.
