I saw my old obnoxious dorm roommate Chelsea in the bathroom, and we ignored each other.  Someone came in and asked me if we'd caused trouble.  I explained how we just ignored each other.  Then, it was a long walk to a performance.  We were in the living room.  We were supposed to get naked.  Three to a group.  I practiced with one person.  Chelsea was the other.  She coordinated her black underwear so as not to go naked.  She put on a collar.  I wanted to wear underwear too.  With the collar we were going to choreograph for her to bite me like a vampire.
