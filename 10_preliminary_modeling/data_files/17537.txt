I was trying to check my mail so I could get the $75 gift certificate I was expecting.  I had to run back, but was still trying to catch the bus.  Somehow it looked like I could still make it.  I ran, trying to get halfway around campus.  I saw my old high school friend Bryan, just standing there.  Then I realized my car was across the way, so we didn't have to get the bus.  My mother was there, but Bryan drove.  We arrived in my hometown.  They decided to keep on going to something else, but seeing three women in the junipers with stuff scattered all over, I got out to check.  Was it a bad accident?  I went into the house- the front door was open.  As I walked through, a man walked into me.  We were being robbed!  I fought and got a hold of him, trying to remember what he looked like in case he got away.  He was bald with a long black ponytail.  Somehow I managed to grab hold of the two of them, and called the police.  They parked in front of the refrigerator.  I went into my room to see what was missing, and laying on the bed, I thought, was my boyfriend Jeremy's coat.  I looked strangely at it and noticed no...it was another robber.  I grabbed him and took him out.  I wasn't sure if it was one of the same ones from before or not.
