Two dreams also which caried over into wakefulness: I thought I was in a hotel with my youngest sister and wondered if in the dark I could find the way to the bathroom. I started to it, found it, and then realized I was in my own room alone. In the other I looked for my eldest sister, awoke and realized she was in Philadelphia and I in my own room.
