 I'm in the parking lot in back of the building where my friend Sarah Reed's mother works. I'm with Sarah and our friend Kari Otis. We're there for Sarah to get a procedure called a ____ (AFDS?), or something. It is a spin procedure, so Sarah will be spun around in a g-force machine really fast. This will be painful. Sarah is drugged. She is in a black sport utility vehicle, like a Chevrolet suburban or blazer. Kari gets out and puts on white latex gloves. Kari usually administers this procedure. I have short hair: about _ long. I'm wearing all white. This is the usual procedure. I will help this time.
