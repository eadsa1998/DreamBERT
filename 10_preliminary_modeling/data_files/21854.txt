I looked out into the back yard and there was a red wheelbarrow turned upside down. It was a full size wheelbarrow for Judy. Ann said, "Wait till Dad sees the legs on it." I came close and I noticed that the two legs on the wheelbarrow were short and loose, which I would have to brace up. I was trying to stick a big pad on the rug, but it would not adhere. I went to the drugstore and asked for a loaf of bread, and the lady said, "We have none." I looked at a cherry pie which was about 4 inches thick and was about half eaten by the girl. She would go by it and take off a piece o fit with her finger and eat it. I was walking by some people and my generating organ was rigid. I looked at my pants to see if they protruded too much to be noticeable, but they were not too noticeable. I was looking at my tomato plants in the garden and they were kind of wilted.
