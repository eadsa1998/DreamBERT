Mom, Ezra and I were driving, but we were in Dad's car. I was with Dad at first, but it changed to Mom. There were deodorant cans or something on the road. This creepy, dirty guy was standing in the middle of the road and he put this yellow bin in the middle of our lane. The car was high enough to miss it, but we were like 'what the hell was he doing?'. We had to leave the car and we were walking through this swampy looking place. Mom and Ezra had been hurt and were looking for a hospital. There was some brown/green water, which was also bubbly. We had to cross it to get any further. There were some signs and one had stuff spelt wrong. Mom and Ezra went in it and started swimming, so I followed them. The next obstacle was below us (it was dug-out, like a pool, but with sand on the side and no water). We had to jump into it, but so that we would slide across this little slid-y bit on the bottom of it. Mom did that but she didn't slide and Ezra went and slid into her. I just climbed down the side of the 'hole'. The last thing was this trampoline and you had to get into this "air swing", which Mom said people had sex in. Ezra got into that and we had to get somewhere else. We finished it and Mom was like "Why don't you want to have sex with the guy?" and I was like "Huh?!". The guy came out and he was blonde and odd looking but he was pretty hot. Seamus was there playing a DS and I said "Shiggan! You're still alive! We thought you'd been raped and killed". He laughed. The guy was gay. Then Ezra was Seth Green and we weren't there. There was a fat girl there too. The guy said he wanted to keep Seth, but the girl was "manlier". She was crying and I was like "What the flip? You're girly!". Then it was us again. I was telling the guy that the guy with the bin reminded me of the Winkie's scene in Mulholland Dr. I went home and Ezra was going to stay with the guy. Then Dad got a text that Ezra was coming home.
