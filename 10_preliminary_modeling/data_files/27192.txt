I dreamed that my brother-in-law &amp; I were walking down town in C____. We met this friend who turned to me and said that his daughter wanted to see me. I looked down E____ Ave. &amp; she was in their car waiting for me and at the same time, she was holding up traffic. Drivers behind her were getting impatient &amp; were blowing their horns. As I crossed the street to get into the car, I was conscious of wearing my bedroom slippers as I realized they looked a little conspicuous in downtown C____.
