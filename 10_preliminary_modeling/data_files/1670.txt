A man comes to the door and says "Where's the Party?" I say "Oh! Are we having a party?" I call out to Millie, "Are we having a party?" She says, "Yes." I take the guy out to the back yard. He's the first one here. He gives me the sack he brought. I pour out forks, knives, and spoons. "Good idea," I say. There is also chicken and other meats. I nibble on a piece of chicken.
