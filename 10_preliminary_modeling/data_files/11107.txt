A friend was going to Germany and my aunt was very interested in obtaining some original figurines from Germany. Shortly after this friend left for her journey abroad, my aunt and uncle went to New York and my aunt was so afraid that she would not get her figurines that my uncle wanted to go to Germany and get them for her, but my aunt was worried that they would not have enough clothes for such a long trip.
