I was a prisoner with some other people held by a gangster. One of the prisoners called the police and the leader found out he came with a gun. I hid in a clothes closet. He saw me there and thought the prisoner who called the police was in behind the clothes with me. He emptied his gun into the clothes and when he did, I grabbed him, took his gun and hit him on the head a few times, knocking him down. His right-hand man was coming. I looked around and found an automatic piston. I told him to stick them up, but he wouldn't. I pulled the trigger and the safety was on. I took off the safety and pulled the trigger and a sort of fire or flash came out of the gun. This is what the man couldn't stand. He dropped to the floor and curled up. Then he got up and ran behind a wall and got away. We got out of imprisonment but were fugitives of the gangster. I was approached by one of the gang and was tried to be fooled and be captured by the gangster, but I was wise to him and didn't fall for his plans. I was flying in the country. I worked my hands and legs like swimming and I moved thru the air. A sailboat with a high mast came down the road. It wobbled back and forth. I thought it would tip over. There was a cow eating grass. She was talking with the farmer. It was in Gotches' house eating potatoes. I was full and then they brought in some meat, but I couldn't eat any. I saw a winner. It was $29 or $.95. I can't recall the name. Bill Grove was normal and was transformed into a small boy. He was dropped on the floor and bounced on his rump.
