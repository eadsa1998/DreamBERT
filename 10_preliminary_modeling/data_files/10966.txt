I dreamed that I was in an antique store. It was similar to one that I am familiar with--dark and dusty as these places often are. The store was divided into two partitions--a front room and a back. I was in the other or front room and the proprietress of the shop was showing me various antique articles in which I had no particular interest. I know the proprietress quite well. She exists in real life--a middle aged woman who has gray hair and is somewhat deaf. In my dream either I specifically asked for or she volunteered the information that she had some very fine antique jewelry for which I really have a passion. Garnet jewelry is my special weakness. In my dream I asked eagerly to see it and she conducted me to the inner or back room. The only furnishing I recall was an antique desk with a great many pigeon holes and small drawers. She then left me alone and I heard her shut the door. I pulled open a little drawer and a vast quantity of jewelry--necklaces, bracelets, earrings and brooches--tumbled out. They were all of garnets set in antique gold and I coveted them more than anything else I ever saw. I fondled them greedily and I decided that, since I was alone in the room, I would take them. I was about to put them in my pocket when I experienced a definite feeling of wrong doing. I felt that the Virgin was looking down and disapproved. (I am no Catholic.) I put the jewelry back in the drawer and as I did so I noticed that the stones had undergone a radical change. The deep red of the garnets had become gray--colorless--lusterless. They were nothing but granite pebbles set in gold. Even before I woke up I felt that I had passed a sort of religious temptation test.
