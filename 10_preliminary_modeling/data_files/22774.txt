I was in a church where Mass was being said. I was in one of the front rows; it was about noon. Suddenly, when I turned around, I saw a priest friend of mine. He was with another lady, not very young, and with a stern expression. He made a gesture like asking me what had happened, what I had done till now. I felt ashamed, but didn't let it show. I just looked at him and turned around. The priest who was saying Mass stopped it and said that the next part would continue later on and he invited us to go somewhere, I don't remember where, but suddenly I was in a house where they had a birthday party for a relative of my priest friend. I saw myself surrounded by girlfriends, and we were making jokes. I saw a friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. She is tall and thin, has green eyes and long hair. We were talking, and I think we ate something, I don't remember what it was. Note: The priest friend of mine is 28 years old, he is a professor, but he never taught me. He gave me the chance to transfer to the university where he teaches, and I got in, but later on I got out and never discussed this with him, because I didn't see him. The friend I describe was one of the best friends I had in school.
