It was a rainy night and I was on patrol with the police department. The roads were flooded because it was raining so hard. We were patrolling the east side of town when we came across two people who looked as if they were breking into the car. My partner put on the highbeams and the "take-down lights." The person on my side took out a semi-automatic gun and began to shoot at us. Both my partner and I were hit. When I looked over at him, he looked dead. As the people kept shooting, I crawled to the edge of a hill and slid down to the bottom. Then I floated down a street where I reached up and grabbed a pay phone and dialed 911.
