I dreamed that I was taking Ancient Civilizations again with Mr. Bailey. I was re-writing an essay and I kept trying to email it to him, but it just wouldn't work. I kept getting the email returned to me. Frustrated, I went back to Bundy to see Hannah. It was snowing and all the heaters had broken up, so Katie and I huddled under our comforters, reading. We talked for a while before going to the main building to get dinner. On the way, I saw Matthew. I really wanted to talk to him, but was too shy. Hannah told me to just go up to him and say "hi," so I did and he picked me up and twirled me around. He laughed, put me down, and started walking away. Hannah yelled across the hallway, "See, Bea! It's so easy to talk to guys! I told you!" I was embarrassed, but luckily Matthew didn't her. Julian, however, did. He began to laugh, but he didn't care. We went to the dining hall and saw Caroline and Sue. They were getting rice and singing the Goo Goo Dolls. Then I woke up.
