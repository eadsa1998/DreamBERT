I don't know what the charge was. Bob was in jail. I helped him to escape for a day and then he went back. One of the prison guards wanted a half dollar so Bob said, "Let him Indian wrestle you for it." So I did. I pushed his arm down, almost touched it, then he pushed mine about _ down, then I pushed his all the way down and then he didn't get the dollar. I was walking with the girl from Dill's with the big busts. She joked, "Someone will think I am chasing you," and I said, "So what if you are. It's nobody's business." We were working at White's.
