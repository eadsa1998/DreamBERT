A big 4x4 truck was chasing after me on freeway 1 south. I ran into a Chinese restaurant and went to use the restroom. There I fixed myself up and went toward the cashier's desk. I was wearing my favorite brown jacket. There were people dining in the restroom, but I don't know who. I picked up my to go food when Joe, the host, kissed me on the cheek and asked if he'll ever see me again. I replied "I don't know." It felt good when he kissed me. My heart was racing. I met Joe at a Chinese restaurant, he works there. He's about 26-28 years old. I was attracted to him. After he kissed me I left the restaurant, and the truck continued to chase after me. Inside the restaurant the light was dim and it looked romantic. The minute I stepped outside, there was daylight outside.
