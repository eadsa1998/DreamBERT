 I'm at my friend Kevin Simpson's old apartment in Wilmerton. Kevin and his roommate George Packer are moving. I look around at things on the table, including mail and papers. George gets mad at me for snooping around. I think he's mad because I'm looking at his stuff, but he seems to be madder that I'm not helping them move. I start to help them move. I'm in the bathroom. I need to urinate. There is a toilet, and a urinal is to the right of it. I go to the urinal. The urinal is then a small movable plastic toilet. I urinate partially in a shower curtain-type thing, which is cloth and not plastic, and it gets wet. I urinate all over, and urine gets on the floor. When I'm finished I set the small toilet back and put a white plastic chair behind it. I wipe up all the urine on the floor and start to walk out of the bathroom. I man walks in the bathroom. He has long, straight stringy dark hair. I say that he must be Lowell, another roommate, to which he says yes. I go to shake his hand and then realize I should wash my hands first. When I go out of the bathroom there are more people there. Kevin is there with his girlfriend. I joke about having butt sex with him. My friend Tiny Combs is there with his girlfriend. A single woman with blond hair is there, as well as a woman with brown hair who has a baby. The blond woman is not really attractive. I talk to Tiny about the Detroit Lions game. I ask him if he saw the game. He says yes. I compare him to Barry Sanders because in the commentary of the game John Madden said Barry Sanders squatted 580 pounds, and I know Tiny can squat that much! I ask Tiny how class is. He says he is failing two classes. I ask him if his scored are really that low. His classes must be hard.
