Mom had gotten me a puppy and a grey kitten the night before. I hadn't named them yet. I had the kitten in a litter tray and the puppy was in a birdcage (the tall one we used to have out the back) temporarily so it didn't run off. I gave them fresh food and water. Later I was at school, which was different for graduation. I was limping. There was a video of it, which showed Eugene and afterwards with his parents. We had to give a gift to the school and we had to read out a bit of a story along with a recording in the background saying the speech. Mine had lots of pauses in it. Only three of us did it and it was to show that without practice you will make mistakes. As I was leaving this guy who was doing MIS was there and I had to help him do something, but I left. I couldn't find Mom and it was 3.24pm. I saw Bradley eating. Mom came and Granma was there too and she was doing something with drugs. Someone had a daughter (maybe me? I don't remember).
