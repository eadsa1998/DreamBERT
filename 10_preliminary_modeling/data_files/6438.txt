I'm downtown, on C. street, standing on the sidewalk. Across the way is the used book store; the parking lot is behind me. Laura walks up with an old friend of hers, Katy. They talk for a while. Earl and Hannah talk for a while. Suddenly I realize that I'm very wet. I'm dripping with water. So I bid my friends farewell and walk down the street. <br/
