Flooding.  We're in my childhood house - middle sister, Mom and I.  Waves getting higher up the street, rising water.  We knew it was the ocean flooding the whole country.  It stopped at the floor of our house.  There was a doll in the water.  I pulled it out - a Chinese doll - obviously from China.  At first I had thought it was from Africa.  I was happy because it meant that cultures and people were coming together.  Also Mom, middle sister and I were amazed that because of the flooding this item could float over and connect us to other continents.  Next scene - a small group of us were on an island or desert.  We were an independent group.  Maybe exploring or looking for a place to set up a new society.  We looked up and saw guys in a jeep approaching.  They four-wheeled down a steep hill.  We knew they were bad but we didn't leave.  They came up to us and took us with them.  Next - we were in an area that had been a ruin but was now being used by the group (jeep guys) to start a new society.  It was dark, cave-like in areas, sandy.  The ruin walls were adobe and went up and down several stories.  This group wanted a society with which we didn't agree but we didn't object.  They took our friend who was like Chewbacca and were going to kill him.  At first we tried to free him.  But we were afraid for our own lives if we objected to it.  There was a racial reason for killing him.  They took us to a lake beach or seashore.  We were playing.  Although we had been trying to free our friend so hard, we now forgot about him.  As we were leaving the beach we looked at our watch and noticed we had missed the time our friend had been killed.  We were sad because we had not even been concerned.  At one point we were told to eat in a cafeteria with the other warriors/ residents.  It was in one of the cave-like areas.  We chose food, but there was something about the colors of the food that had to do with gangs.
