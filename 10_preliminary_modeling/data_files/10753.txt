I was in a car with a date unknown to me, but I have a strong feeling it was my fiance. (I'm not sure as I do not want it to be him.) We were driving along, not speaking. I was cold and uninterested in my surroundings and company. I saw a huge obstacle loom in front of us but was not moved? (C.S.H.) to warn my companion who was driving and who did not see it. There was a crash and he was struck down dead. I merely brushed his body aside and slipped under the driver's wheel and started on, oblivious of the limp body beside me.
