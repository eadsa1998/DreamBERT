I heard someone calling Nemoween. I thought it was my wife calling and I said, "What?" George G. was around with his truck. He had orders in it. One of the parties was Thorn and he said it was like a name of a track. I said the name was Hawthorn. I was on a ladder near the top of the house. I was thinking of my sister Mary. She was supposed to be pregnant. we had a baby. I was playing with it.
