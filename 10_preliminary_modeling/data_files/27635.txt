I dreamed that my whole family was killed in a train accident. I was stunned when I read in the newspapers of the great tragedy. On the front page there was a picture of me in a state of sorrow. I received many calls from people who wanted to help me and the whole city was in sympathy with me. Everyone was feeling sorry for me, including the people whom I didn't particularly like.
