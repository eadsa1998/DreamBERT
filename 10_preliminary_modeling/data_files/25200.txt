 I'm at home. There is a lot of cold lemon water in the refrigerator. Annie is there. We each take some water. She is sick to her stomach. I am really horny, and want to have sex. I go upstairs to my room and sit on my bed, leaving the lights off. She walks upstairs and goes into my sister Ramona's room, where her mother Tamara and her sister Tina are. I see that my house is on fire! I see it through the two small windows in the upper corner of my room. I grab the cordless phone and call 911. I press the wrong button and can't dial at first. Finally, I get through. I tell them half of my house is on fire! It is the southwest half. They say they are sending help. I call them back and they get my phone number. I can see the flames outside. I try to close the little window, but I end up just shutting the doors to the window. I have to decide what I want to take and what I should leave in the burning house. I know that I can't take everything. I take sandals, thinking that it is summertime. I realize my feet might get cold. I leave the house, going out the back door. It is snowing. My brother Wally and his friends Mryle Madden and Mel, and my schoolmate Aaron Hadley are in the back yard. Mel is in the back seat of a convertible holding dog. I tell them our house is on fire! They say no, it was just the spark plug. I look around and at the roof. It is snowing, and there is snow on the roof. There are few, if any burn marks.
