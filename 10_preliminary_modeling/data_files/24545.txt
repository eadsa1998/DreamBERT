There's a man on a bus in the driver's seat who has taken a little boy hostage. He has a knife to the boy's throat. I volunteer to take the boy's place. When I go up to the man, he is now docile. In this moment I have to decide what to do. I take the man's hand. I lead him out of the bus. We will walk toward another man named Ali, who I call out to, and who will make things right. I tell the hostage-taking man everything will be OK. The neighborhood we are passing through resembles the area where my mother once had a store. As we walk, my brother passes by and says something to me. The hostage-taking man lets my hand go and begins to drift away from where we are headed. I wake up.
