 I'm with my girlfriend Annie and we're going up to the roof of Franklin Hall dormitory, above the 5th floor. We are in high school. We're going to make out and have fun. We get up to the 5th floor. Down the hall I see the guy from Franklin's fourth floor that gambles a lot. He is talking to someone. We quickly go into the room where the door to the roof is. Annie is working on Physical Geoglophy (spelled this way). She is doing page SAAA in her book. There is a map of the USA in it. <br/
