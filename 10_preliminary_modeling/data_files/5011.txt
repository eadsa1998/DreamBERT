I am swimming in calm waters and doing very well. I swim toward a rock at the deep end. As I near the rock, I realize I'm getting tired out and need to hang on. I reach for the rock and become aware of evil things lurking under the rock. I slide around the rock and discover I'm in the rough ocean side and feel like I might not make it. I struggle and finally get back to the calm waters and feel safer. [BL]
