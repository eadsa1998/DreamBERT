My sister, Lauren, my mother and myself were at some sort of graduation exercise outdoors. We were driving there and we parked alongside a steep hill. I looked out my window, and I could see the caps and gowns below. For some reason we didn't get out of the car. We noticed a brown station wagon parked behind us. There were two men in the car. They appeared to be packaging drugs and putting them in the trunk. My mother and sister were in the front seat and were staring at them in the rear view mirrors. The guys saw them looking. They jumped out of the car and ran over to us with guns. I yelled, "Duck!" and they shattered our windows. My mother screeched away and they hopped in their car and followed us. We finally lost them. Next thing I knew we're at home and the doorbell rang. The driver of the station wagon came in. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and army pants. He had tattoos all over his arms. I pretended to like him and told him I wasn't interested in going to the police. I told him I was very attracted to him and I wanted to be his girlfriend. He believed me. He kissed me. He was gross. Then I woke up.
