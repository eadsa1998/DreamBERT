I was in a large house with my mother. I put in some storm windows in the basement windows, but I replaced the windows outside instead of inside the storm windows. The walls were thick. I hoped my mother would not notice the way I put the windows in. She didn't. A large furnace was in the basement. Later I distinguished a material from an abstract object.
