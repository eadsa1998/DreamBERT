I was driving with Mom and Ezra. We went to McDonald's. I think we were outside. We ordered a new ice-cream each plus one old one to share. There was music playing, which was all stuff from my playlist except Mama (Genesis) was in it. Ezra complained about the music and I said "I chose this!". Some guy was talking to Mom about ice-skating. I checked my downloads and I had a movie called Ficur Ng which was about talking monkeys that only say "ficus" [Watched Kiss Kiss Bang Bang yesterday]. I also had a Marx brother's movie and other stuff. I had 110 movies downloading in one day. Then I was in the car with Dad. He was going to go through a drive thru but it was full and every time we came back it was a huge line. One day he parked on the side of the road and it was getting dark and the guy at the gate went out to get food, so we couldn't get in. We went back to the car but this guy put something on it to say it couldn't be driven. He said the guy at the gate had paid him to. Then this fitness couple, who were Mario and Lisa from Big Brother UK, plus this old guy and a young girl, who was Stephanie from Big Brother UK were training to escape from some place. They pretended the guy was a part of the team but they knew he was a bad guy and had a secret plan. Lisa was pregnant. The place was really creepy and had lots of dry plants.
