I was at this beautiful very large house. We were outside. The dad was there and I think five children. One child was going up the sidewalk to go in the house. Daddy told him to pick something up and take it with him. He ignored him at first then went back and got it. There was another child playing with some balls in the yard. He threw two of them and they rolled down the hill and pretty far away so he had to go after them. The others were laughing about and I told them they could go help him but hey didn't. One of the balls was a basketball. When I was inside the house, I was badly sunburned. I especially remember how badly my feet were burnt. But also my chest. Bob F said something to me about it. I was going to take a shower and Matthew said he had to be ready to go in a little more than an hour. I let him shower first but I said something to him about how he always does that, tries to squeeze in the shower right when I am ready to do so. I was little miffed at him over it. There were these people there talking about how I dressed and how I should dress more attractively. This one couple came up and were dressed in these very elaborate colorful clothing. They were obviously in love, playing and having fun with each other. I went to my room and pulled out a short satin robe to put on. I wondered if I should put something on under it while waiting for the shower. Or if I should just wear it as is.
