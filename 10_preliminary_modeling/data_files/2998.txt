Jake is driving. We are in the M City back roads area and probably going to his house. He's all locked in and driving fast and I say, "Hey, come on. If you want to commit suicide go ahead, but don't take us with you." He gets mad at me and yells, "Leave me alone. I just don't want to talk about it." He's very angry and teary. I feel very touched by his pain. I try to be honest and share that it's been years since I've been in relationship. No one wants me. Maybe I'm ugly, or too hard to live with or maybe it's the disability, I don't know, but it's lonely. I empathize with his feelings right now. We have a heart-to-heart talk. It is intense and I'm touched by his powerful pain and loneliness.
