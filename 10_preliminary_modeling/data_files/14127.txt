I had been staying at Eugene's and going back there at like 2am. I was sleeping in his room but in another bed. The bedspread was Indiana Jones themed, but it wasn't the 'real' Indiana Jones. The guy would talk to himself and talk to a Family Guy post on the wall, which voted for a different Indiana Jones. Later we had graduation. We all got crowded into some building and didn't know where to go. Ezra was there. He came back to Eugene's too. Eugene got bad results -- he got 3% for two subjects. There was a video of him and some Spanish joke about 'Kevin's county'. There was a girl who looked like Colleen. Cuddles was in a school and she was doing well at math and was "inquisitive". Mom was there as well.
