Put everything you got on it. I heard that, then I was half asleep and half awake as I lay in bed about 7:30 a.m. I saw Loddie and 2 other men and they were redheads. I looked at my Bob and he was redheaded. I saw guards walking into a building with their hands up and a policeman got in line with them and he had his gun in his holster while the others had no guns. I told Loddie that the three redheads were triplets, and he said no. I coughed and kind of forced it a little, then I spit and it was blood. It kind of excited me. During the day it dawned on me that the power was going off and on and the lights were going off and on. I was thinking of the clock shutting off and on and he time would be incorrect.
