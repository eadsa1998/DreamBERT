We have to leave the place where we are (sort of anticipating leaving the Retreat Center) Everyone is being loaded onto carts and I am designated to go with a group of people labeled "x"; (unknowns). The driver looks like my Geology teacher at my alma mater, and he gives me an A+ ++ ++++ (in a rhythm).
