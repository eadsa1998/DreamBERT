I was getting married. It seems that we were in a elementary school building. I was going into the girls restroom to get dressed. My fiance came in wondering where he was supposed to get dressed. I pointed him towards the boys restroom. I don't know if he said something or if he just looked at me odd. There was some kind of communication or understanding that it was odd or not the ideal place to be dressing for our wedding. Maybe a bit uncomfortable. But it was, in fact, the area that we needed to get dressed.
