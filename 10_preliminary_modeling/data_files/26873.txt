 I'm in a house. My aunt Paulette Redding is there, talking to her two sons, Phil and Kyle Jessen. She says that she's going to work ten hours today. I think it's good she's working ten hours: she needs the money. She had the day off yesterday. She also says that her husband has to go back to work today. I see him lying in bed. It's about 8:00am. He gets up. I have just gotten up and am lounging around. He is a tall (6'6") pale white man with a belly and not much body hair. Eventually we shake hands and meet, but we're both standoffish at first. There are two men in their 20's there. They're the grandsons of a Mrs. Johnson. I meet them and shake their hands. <br/
