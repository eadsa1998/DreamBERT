I dreamed that I was watching a group of my fraternity brothers playing a game of baseball. They were quite a distance from me, and rather than a game, some sort of batting practice seemed to be in progress. Every once in a while a baseball would come out as far as the place I was standing (or kneeling?). Each time I would get a ball I would keep it. I soon had three. Looking at the balls closely I noticed that none was very hard and that they were quite irregular in shape, though they did retain the size, and approximate shape of an ordinary baseball.
