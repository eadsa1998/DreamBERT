I'm at the CAS office. I'm working on Bill C's computer. I think I may be working on my own as well. Because he's upset that his computer isn't working well, I'm doing some housekeeping to maintain it. I open the internet options on the tools menu of his internet browser. I'm debating about whether or not to clear his cache and temporary internet files. I feel that some of this stuff needs to be done and will help but I also realize that he's been aggravated with his computer for some time even though his computer is probably not even a year old.
