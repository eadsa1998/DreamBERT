There was some sort of investigation game.  We stopped at a gas station briefly.  Then we went back to 'home base' and looked into what we had to do.  We would have to use a knife to jimmy the two doors south of us open.  We did that, and there was a door off to the left.  I sat down a small laptop and hooked it up.  It mapped out the room in front of us with several red dots throughout.  Those were some sort of sensors that had to be shut off, and I ran a program to find the number key to do so for each one.  I was having fun, but my mother came and walked into the room before I could disable the code.  She said it didn't matter, but I was disappointed- she ruined the game.
