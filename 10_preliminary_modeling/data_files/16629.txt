It was something to do with the fact that I was planning to walk downtown to some kind of concert festival thing. I think it was supposed to be the crawfish festival that they had that I've never really been to because we're always so busy at that time of the year, but I've always wanted to go. In this dream it was a lot of thought, and not that much action, and I was just sort of thinking how if I really wanted to go, I was just going to have to walk. And then when I get there I was just going to have to figure out what was where, all by myself.
