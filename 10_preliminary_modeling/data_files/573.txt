Something about going to the school where I went as a kid. I am outside in the playground and want to get in, I am also in a house and a child is sick. I am going to get an aspirin and then the child falls past me and hits her head on the basement floor. I am going to take her to a hospital but test her first. Her eyes can track and she can see one and two fingers correctly. I say this is very good. We are going to leave when I wake up.
