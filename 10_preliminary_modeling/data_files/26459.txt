 I'm on a basketball court with a team warming up for a game. I take long, strong strides. I run around the court by myself. The other team is warming up as well. I take off my outermost layer of clothing, and still have on a warm up top and a jersey. I feel smooth, strong, and confident: like I am a good player and I know it. At some point, I realize that I'm dreaming.
