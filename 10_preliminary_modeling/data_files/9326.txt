I was at the college looking at the Greek and Roman statues of warriors. There seemed to be about six of them, white marble, life size or a bit larger, all complete from sword and shield to high helmet. About a dozen people like me walked among them. Suddenly, the statues got off their pedestals and walked about, ignoring us but sword-fighting with each other--half playful, half serious like fencers. Three of them went to the rear of a statue of General Grant--or some Civil War general, in real clothes. They rammed their swords in to emasculate him, he crumbled like a statue and fell like a man. I saw it from both sides, looking down the thin wall dividing a room, the general in an open alcove to be viewed from both sides. Then they started in my direction. I wondered why, since no mortals had been attacked. I looked down and I was naked white marble. I escaped their swords by rising to the ceiling--no wings, but Will--and I felt my shoulders nestling against it like a balloon. Then I descended also by merely wishing to. I was thrilled by this. In the dream I asked if I was dreaming. I knelt on the parquet floor and felt my knees on it. I felt the floor and went through several proofs that I wasn't dreaming. I wondered why people around me didn't notice and praise me. Suddenly, a call for all statues to go into an auditorium. I felt something dreadful to happen to them. I was not one of them even though I was still white as marble. I rose above them once more. I felt my ability weakening, but I still had it when the last one went thru the door and out of sight.
