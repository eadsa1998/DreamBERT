I am helping to teach mentally retarded people. In a classroom, they are all seated in a single row around the edges of the wall (see drawing in dream book). I have lots of things on the board and I'm trying to get them to understand. Then it's time to go and there's a bus and we're high up on a mountain and it's a long, curvy road back down.
