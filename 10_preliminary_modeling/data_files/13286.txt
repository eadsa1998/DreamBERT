Venus was supposedly going to die tonight at about 9 or 10pm and fall into Earth. Dad and Ezra went to the movies. There were these fairy things underground and they had something to do with it. Two years earlier, I managed to save them all, last year I saved some of them. This year, I didn't bother doing anything. I was hiding underneath something in the games room. Dad and Ezra were hiding under a table in the family room. People came in and found and shot Dad and Ezra, then they found me and shot me and we all died. Somehow, I remembered this and so was locking the doors and windows and turned off the lights. I checked on the fairies but they wouldn't answer. I went out the front and Ezra and Dad were coming back. These two old dudes were with them. They were like "What's it supposed to be?". Dad said a meteorite and he figured that nothing was going to happen, saying something about how you tell people about meteorites and they freak out. Then I saw it racing across the sky and it sounded like something was burning. Someone asked what it was and then "Oh, it's the planet". Then it came towards us and it was getting bigger. I was thinking of Eugene and that I should have told Calvin that I liked Eugene. An image of Eugene, which was orange, was 'etched' as I died (and I also woke up).
