Jane Hearne, a good friend, and I were on a larger boat--similar to a pirate ship, up in the icy waters of the Arctic. We were sailing towards a large, large iceberg and finally crashed into it, being unable to avoid it. I jumped out of the boat and Jane stayed in the boat and sailed it away. I kept screaming fro her to come back and pick m up, but she wouldn't. The iceberg I was on was gradually sinking and the icy waters surrounded me. The dream ended.
