I am in a play and acting well. We are two sisters and a dolly in a crib and we have our backs to the audience. At one point, I turn the dolly so she faces the audience and suddenly I am aware of them. We turn to face the audience and I now see their faces. They are very happy about the fact that we are including them. They now don't have to work so hard to get the words. But as soon as I'm aware of them, I feel a spurt of adrenalin and break my concentration. I become afraid I will forget my dialogue, and with the fear comes the knowing that I will. I don't know what to do; I feel panic. Later, I am preparing a picture of the scenery for a play. I draw in a toilet and a bathtub. I show this to the director and he points out I didn't need to do that because there already was a toilet and a bathtub. Feeling frustrated that I went to extra work for nothing, I agree to cut out the new addition. I ask the director how we are to hang up the pictures on stage. I see wires and clothes pins to hang them on. Now I'm rehearsing, worried I'll forget my lines and knowing I must really concentrate for 1 and 1/2 hours or so on my lines, but not wanting to do all that work. I go to the director who's back stage behind a counter top caged area (like in PE room). He asks how I'm doing and I sigh, "I'll try to work up to your standards, but I'm not good enough." He is surprised and concerned. This is not a good attitude for an actress to have before a performance. I walk away and lie down on a bench and cry out, "I'm sick. I'm sick." I feel tired and very bad. I don't want to perform.
