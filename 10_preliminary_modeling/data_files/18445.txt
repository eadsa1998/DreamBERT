A later dream, the final dream of the night, which I recall poorly, dealt with being underground and knowing that a superior race, dwelling secretly among us, had a space port in this public building I and others were in. I knew approximately where the hidden entrance was. Interpretation: I have been very open the past few days, and filled with love for my wife. I would rather not analyze this dream, but accept its feeling tone and symbolism as a sign of encouragement and be thankful for it.
