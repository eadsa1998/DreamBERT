I was in a department store. Later I was on the grounds of a hospital which resembled the one across the street from one of the houses I lived in when we lived in St. Louis, Missouri. There was a wall about ten feet high from the sidewalk to the hospital grounds. The ground level of the hospital grounds was about two feet lower than the wall. (As a child I once tried to climb that wall to get to an injured robin. I think I succeeded in doing so.) In this dream I was on the grounds, and I was wishing I could climb down to get away from the hospital. I told someone that I chased a pig. I related how I caught it and it struggled. (Yesterday I read that though scientists can study the origin of life by tracing human life down to atoms, they cannot reverse the analysis and retrace their steps. Only the tracing of atoms to electrons can be reversed. This may have suggested the return to a childhood scene.) This time I was trying to get away from the hospital instead of onto the hospital grounds.
