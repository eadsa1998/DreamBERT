My friend Alice and I are in a house that is directly on dark black water. She has a job with a circus and has to go to work soon but wants to swim. She is in the water and I kick something of hers off the dock by accident. I think it is a shoe but don't know for sure. I am hoping whatever it was was mind and not hers. She doesn't seem too upset. Also a pair of her panties, white, sheer bikinis, blows off and sinks and she is not upset about that either. A lot of people are swimming in this dark back water and we don't know what the bottom is like. I remain on the dock.
