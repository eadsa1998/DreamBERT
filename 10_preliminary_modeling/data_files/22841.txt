I am traveling through the countryside, on the outskirts of a very small town.  I see Mr. Mathers in front of a house quite a ways off the highway.  We stop and I go in; whoever is with me waits outside.  I meet Mr. Mathers' wife and his mother.  His wife is pretty sick and doesn't look very good, but everyone seems pretty cheerful.
