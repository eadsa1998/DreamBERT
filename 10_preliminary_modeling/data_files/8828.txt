Matthew and I were shopping at CVS. We were trying to straighten the products on one of the shelves. We started talking with the store manager and he asked Matthew if he wanted to work there part time. Matthew said sure so he was going to start immediately. I was walking through the store with the manager having a conversation. He was a tall man, medium build, about my age, with thick, wavy, black hair. I told him that I used to manage a CVS store. As I said it I realized that this was the store I had managed, but I didn't tell him that. The manager told Matthew he could borrow his red Porsche to take me home. We were both shocked that he would trust him to drive it. I was hesitant but wanted to trust Matthew. Matthew didn't seem to hesitate except to make sure that he was serious. After we agreed, I wondered if it was an automatic since Matthew doesn't know how to drive a stick-shift. I also thought I could drive my own car back then. But I don't know how we got there to begin with if I didn't have a car there or why I would need to come back. It is now evening and I am in the Porsche with the store manager. He is driving. We notice what appears to be a parade of cars. Each one has a flag on it representing a country and they are different on each car. Then we see a limo with several flags on it. We realize that it is the U.S. President. We were surprised that he was here.
