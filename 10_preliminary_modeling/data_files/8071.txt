WNA, where I live, was either having a sale or giving away decorative grasses. I'm not sure which. It was for residents that wanted them to decorate their patios. There was a wide variety available. My initial reaction is that I was kind of excited about it, and thought it was cool that they were doing this. I have wished I had the space to use decorative grasses, but the flowerbeds on my patio are simply too small. I decided not to take advantage of the offer.
