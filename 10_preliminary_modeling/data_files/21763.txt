Judy was trying on Ed, the coal miner's cap and it was so big she wrapped it twice around her head. He was leaving it for someone to come and try it on. There were headlights on a bridge. It was night when the lights hit the bridge from an approaching car. The headlights on the bridge would go on. I was looking at entries or something like that or results. I saw fire with a circle around it like I have. There were other horses circled or marked like that, but I can't recall them now.
