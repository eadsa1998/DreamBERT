[recurring] I was on a bus with Ezra and Mom. I fell asleep and when I woke up I was the only one left on the bus. I got out and ended up in this abandoned town thing. I then ended up in this monster park thing. These monsters chased me and my friend. They ended up changing into one. There was a Target and Woolworths. There were lots of doors. I got out and got back to abandoned town. [Sometimes I'm by myself, sometimes I had a friend].
