After two days of not dreaming, today I've had a dream and it seems incredible to me. The story is about my grandmother who has an obsession and a fantasy which causes her to need the services of a psychiatrist. The dream pointed to her as being responsible for the failure of the marriage of a couple who have been married for 20 years. And just thinking about it, I haven't been able to coordinate my thoughts. Excuse me.
