Skiing on a lake covered in algae; Chuck's (my water ski instructor) lake, but years overgrown and un-maintained. I remember fearing the alligators. There were so many alligators there now. They hadn't been kept under control. I was glad to get back up to the dock and on the little cliff looking down into the lake.
