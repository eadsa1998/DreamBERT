I'm exploring an ancient tomb with a friend. We'll call him Bob. This tomb is supposed to be quite ancient and archaelogically important: these are the bones and the dirt of people talked about in the Bible. It's supposed to be an old tomb, but it really resembles the dried-out dusty area under cellarless houses. In the very center we find a set of steel lockers. These lockers contain ancient books. At this point I have a typical thought: "While I'm down here, I might as well get a book." I open the lockers and riffle through them. Bob looks inside the lockers too, but there's nothing he wants. Then, of all people, a Hillside library patron whom I know walks in. He is an Indian man with some very interesting experiences described in the note below. Alan strides in, and says: "Too bad about the rats mon. With the dead people." I look on the ground and there are all these disgusting little bright red rats. Instead of noses there are long red needles. I think he meant it was too bad because of the important corpses to be found there. Later, I'm in the doctor's office because a very unusual event is occurring. Unusual -- for me, a male. I'm menstruating. To cheer me up, Laura quotes from a book about how much parents suck.
