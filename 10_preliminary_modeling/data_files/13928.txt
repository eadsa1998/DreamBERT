I had been staying at this person's house pretending to be someone else. I had brought my Wii there. Mom and Ezra came over and she pretended she was my driving instructor and I was packing my stuff together and Ezra and Mom helped me get the stuff into the car. Then some others and I were on the run. People on these boats were shooting at us (we were at like a park). This girl and I ended up swimming under this bridge. We swam to the next city. There was something about Cloverfield. Then I was at school, but it was different. I was outside and there were stalls around and it was all on a big field (no buildings were in sight). Elijah and Autumn were there. Elijah was giggling. Some guy asked Autumn if she remembered him, but she didn't. They had slept together. She had slept with Elijah too. I went to the canteen and there was a Twix, which I really wanted but it was $8, so I decided not to get it. Then Mom bought me one from a drive thru.
