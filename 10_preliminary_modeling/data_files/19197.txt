Between 12 and 12:30 I had another dream which was almost like a daydream. I dreamed I was receiving a large sum of money and I don't know whether the dream lasted any more than five minutes and the entire action consisted of not of the dispersal of this money, but of my receiving this money. It was a very ceremonious affair where great sums of money were being handed over to me with a great deal of legal matters being transferred. Anyway, it was almost like a funeral, so ceremonious. There were a lot of people there. I was very happy about it, very cheerful. Although I was very cheerful about the transfer of this money, it really wasn't a happy dream. I can't say that I woke in great cheer or anything. It seemed to have the same pall that the second dream had.
