I lived somewhere else. Someone, maybe me, ran across these train tracks. I was then in the house and my parents were strict. My sister was a Farrah look-alike and I saw her go into a room. She met with this guy who looked like Carson. For some reason, I forgot to look around and I went into my secret room to meet with a guy who I think was Calvin. Farrah caught me, but I had already caught her.
