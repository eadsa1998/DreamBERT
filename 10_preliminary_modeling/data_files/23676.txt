[I was dictating, speaking out loud the following while waking up]: "The young men and women have each walked up to their grandfathers and grandmothers.  This is the word for overcome.  The litany..."  [Dreamed as I was falling asleep, visions really, not like dreams]:  1) The incident with the guy in university library when I was in high school, coming away from that and crying as if it were rape.  2) Delivering a baby, midwife telling me it should be no problem, it will go smooth, let it out, and then seeing vision of an ear of corn and pulling husks down exposing ear.  Like - giving birth to corn.
