A terrible dream. The world around me had become extremely dangerous and chaotic. Law and order seemed to have disappeared. There is a city - but it seems very old - parts of it are medieval and the rest 20th century (but a few decades old) and in a bad state of repair. I'm there in a hotel or rented apartment for a reason I do not know. There are others from my family here too - my brother and my farther. There are some relatives from my father's side of the family here too. Maybe we're there for a funeral. My accommodation has no front door. I can see straight through a hole in the wooden bathroom  door straight out to the street. Two dodgy characters outside see me and start heading across the street to invade my property. A confrontation is imminent - but it is diverted by either my father or my brother. They are scared off. But I get the feeling that they haven't gone far. I have a terrible feeling of security - it feels like I'm going to be attacked  at any time by burglars or murders. I go for a walk with my brother and my cousins. The streets are dark, empty. There is dog shit everywhere - it's almost impossible to avoid stepping in it. A piece of shit hits my uncle  on his bald head. He stoically wipes it off. I look up - there are large birds - like crows - flying about the turrets of the town walls or castle we are walking past. But these birds shit stinking dog shit. It's really disgusting. We take cover under a bridge or in a tunnel. There are steps that lead up an enormous tunnel-like slope. I have the strong feeling that at the other end of the tunnel we will meet a horrible violent death.
