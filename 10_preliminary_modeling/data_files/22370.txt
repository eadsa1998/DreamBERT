I only remember images. I see myself with a girlfriend and I get the impression that I start some sexual foreplay as a prelude to making love. The latter doesn't seem to come about. The situation is completely pleasurable, until we decide to go up to a room. When we get there, we hear the voice of a woman who we think is mad and we take flight. However, while we run, I remember the pleasurable scenes. Both our running and the surprise arrival of the "mad woman" take place through some stairs, which are not very high nor very low. When we come running down, there are some boxes at its bottom that we have to jump over.
