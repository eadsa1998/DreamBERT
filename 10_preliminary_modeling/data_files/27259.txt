I was at a circus one day. This circus had red and white tents. I was fascinated by the elephants and lions. They were all doing such cute tricks. While this was going on I was in the audience. The feature act was on next and I entered the wing in my gorgeous net costume. I took three bows and then proceeded to swing back and forth. The audience was enraptured but accidentally my foot didn't get hold of the lion rod, and I fell into the net. Here the dream ended.
