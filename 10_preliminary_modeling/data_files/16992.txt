In this dream I'm with an artist who is a combination of two people from real life - one is someone I've worked with called Lou (who is a technical person) and the other is a friend of a friend called Josh (who is an artist in real life - but not a very accomplished one). We are wandering around a large school field - it's as if we are on break at school. It seems there is an enormous art fair in the school field. The artist produces very accomplished work, and it appears he can turn his hand to a variety of techniques. I'm rather jealous, and I can feel a welling up of competitive spirit. I hide it, and remain friendly and casual. I follow his around the fair and remain quiet.
