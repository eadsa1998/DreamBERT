With woman analyst in C. City (Amanda Feingold). I forgot my dreams and rush out and take the car to go home to find my dreams; return and ask her which dream first? She then uses an elaborate ritual with incantations, playing cards, silken threads to decide which dream to select. Finally she puts one pile on the right over the thread, and another on the table to her left. But in the end she wants me to decide which one to read. I say I know the content by the shape of the paper. Shift: Pick up a toy bear and find it comes apart into shining silk threads.
