I was in a football stadium with my daughter Christina.  We kept climbing higher and higher, sometimes up steps with no railings, and I was always afraid Christina would fall, so I held her hand tightly.  At the top, apparently, was a wide grassy area where Johnny Unitas was warming up with another player, throwing a football back and forth.  I wondered if Unitas had been traded, because it seemed that Baltimore was not one of the teams playing that day.  Once, the ball they were throwing got away and bounced over to me.  I was still holding on to Christina, afraid to let go, so I couldn't field it as smoothly as I wanted to.  And when I tried to throw it back, wanting very badly to throw an impressive pass, I couldn't get a good grip on the ball (even though it was very much under inflated), and it slipped out of my hand when I threw it.  I was surprised, therefore, when one of the guys threw me two different balls later on, and I threw good, sharp spirals back to him.  The stadium may have been -- probably was -- my alma mater's stadium, especially because of the flat grassy area above one end zone grandstand.
