Now I am the injured person from the previous dream and go outside. I see a flying machine and I am in a helicopter thing. We fly around but have to be careful not to hit the telephone wires. There are wires everywhere, this being city blocks. Then we move on down the street and I see a huge expanse of blue sky. It feels freeing and we joyfully head on out. Now I see a person who, when her feet hit the ground and lift up for the next step, daisies and other pretty wild flowers grow up instantly. I realize she is the healing person I've been needing and looking for. I follow her inside and she lays her hands on my head (the left side as I am facing her, so it's really the right side). I am cured and feel great. Now there is a cute baby girl following me and wants to play. We sing songs together. I sing wonderful harmony to "Hush little baby, don't you cry." Some woman behind me and behind a glass wall partition watches and is pleased. I am happy I have pleased her. Now the baby wants her medicine and doesn't want the regular stuff, but the special elixir I got from this place.
