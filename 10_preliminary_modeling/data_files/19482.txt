[Had a long walk evening of 24th and didn't go to bed till nearly 12. Slept very soundly, with only 1 very faint dream.]  This dream had to do with the genera Hylobius, Pachylobius, and certain genera of Anthonominal. All of them were mixed together, but I removed the Anthonomine genera and placed them in a box by themselves.
