I am in the hospital in my hometown where my children were born having a baby. My friend, Alice, her cousin, Roger and others are there. Someone else is going to have a baby like a demo for a class. I have pains and the baby is about to be born. I tell Roger I don't know where it came from. Is this the Immaculate Conception? I've had a hysterectomy. I wake up with pains in my stomach.
