I was at St. Joe. I don't know who I was or who I was with. We had started some kind of a carnival I think. We were selling tickets from the kitchen. This is very odd. It's as though we were at the old house in the kitchen, sitting at the table selling tickets. Yet, it is as though it was outside as well. People would come up and hand us their money and then go on to the carnival. It seems that maybe it was a penny a person to enter. I don't anything about the carnival or anything like that. When we first set up to start selling the ticket. We had a money tray with rolls of coins. At the last minute I thought we should have two trays so I was quickly trying to divide the money for another tray. We were only doing this for a couple of hours in the evening. We had decided that we would quit selling tickets at 8 o'clock. I looked at the clock the last time and it was 8:39 and I was cleaning up. I was wondering where everyone had gone. I guess there were members of the family that should have been there helping me. I just kept busy cleaning up. I was imagining someone saying something to me and I would respond, well, there was stuff to do so I was keeping busy. There was something about something sitting there that needed to be cleaned up. It had been sitting there for a long time. I was at the kitchen sink and doing dishes or rinsing out things that had a lot of food or something leftover in them.
