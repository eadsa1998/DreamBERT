There were zombies or like zombies, vampires and stuff or something. At first it was Torchwood. I ran to this place that was on fire. It was night. It was near a body of water.  Owen and Jack had been in the building. Owen was dead. Jack got back up. I saw something floating in the water and I thought it was Ianto. I went over and then it got up and it was this freaky pink fish thing and it started chasing me. Jack started running too and he dived in the water, so it would chase him, and I ran around. I ran through the gates to exit the property, and there were more of them outside. One was yellow. We both ran through. I don't know what happened. Then Dad, Ezra and I found this pizza shop. We were going to stay in the fridge. I had parked my car up at the front door so the passenger side was at the door. I saw people coming and I locked the door of the car and moved out. They tried to get in. We ran out the back. It was farm like. There had been a horse. Someone killed it for fun and I think there had been other people with us before but they had died. I jumped the fence and ran along the side of the road. There were a few cars. At one point, I was with Dad and someone else, I think, and it was night. Some areas were pitch black (we were outside). Some guy told us not to go on the path. We ran through this grass area which had some trees and bushes. I saw a path in the distance and there was a girl and two guys on there (it was lit up). They pushed people onto the ground and the guys would put something through their head. The girl suddenly started listening carefully and we fell to the ground so she didn't see us, but she heard us. We started to run and we jumped over this small ledge and there was a creature like Gollum (Lord of the Rings) near a campfire. She came looking for us and we hide under the ledge. This girl saw my toe sticking out and helped us.
