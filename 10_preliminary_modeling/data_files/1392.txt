Ellie and I are out in the wilderness. A river in a canyon. A man, maybe my father, is sleeping on the ground. I suggest we find smooth, round pebbles for him to sleep on. It would make it better for him. Ellie drives a jeep backward up a waterfall. I am concerned, then she drives down the river. Suddenly the jeep explodes, killing family members. I am appalled and rush to look. It is discovered that the pebbles for Dad were jagged and rough and actually killed him. I am filled with guilt. I was doing it for good reasons, but I killed him.
