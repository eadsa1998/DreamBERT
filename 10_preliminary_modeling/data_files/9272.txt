I was working on some kind of items, that were not food. They were about eight and a half by eleven in size. They were all different, yet very similar. Some of them I needed to filet. It's as if I would go through all of them and then go back through them in the opposite order. I finally said to someone that if I got the research money this would all be worth it.
