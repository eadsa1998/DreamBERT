 I'm at a high school in the inner part of a big city. It's the last day of school. I'm going to lift weights, but I can't for some reason. I leave but forget my cap and bag. I go back to get them. The track team is practicing outside. I interrupt the practice when I walk through. I hump over a fence to get my stuff. My friend Stephen is there.
