I was with Frederick, who I was dating, and he'd been offered this weird job and all he had to do was live in this cave for 8 weeks. The cave was on the beach and we were walking down there to see it and discuss the details. It was spooky and I reached for his hand and we held hands as we walked down. We made a joke about it being haunted, and the person said it was. When we got to it, it was really creepy and I said we should just go, but they kind of forced us inside and then we couldn't leave. It was some 'devil' cage or something and after the 8 weeks, one of us had to be sacrificed. I think we managed to escape, but I don't remember anything else.
