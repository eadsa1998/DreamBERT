I was at university and Eugene and Autumn were doing the MUPC. I wondered why Eugene was there. The teacher was saying that those who did well were offered an earlier exam. I said to Michael (on accident) that it was lame and he said it was probably like it was going to be on the "14th instead of the 18th". We were doing some math revision and I didn't remember any of it. There was an episode of Supernatural. This lady was in a house in the lounge room and her son was watching TV on the floor. Behind her the lounge moved. She looked and nothing happened but then it moved again and she asked her kid if the lounge had just moved and he said "apparently so". The TV moved too and she ran. It was night. She ran to a crime scene and asked Autumn (Supernatural) for a lawyer. I can't read the next bit but there's something to do with a Sakata chip.
