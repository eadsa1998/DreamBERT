I was in a big room with tons of people. We were all discussing something. It felt like when you watch the national debates. I don't remember what we were debating but it was important in the dream. It was about something like fruit. We had that fruit. I don't think it was real. It was a cross between blueberries, raspberries and peaches. Setting: A big room. Characters: There were many people but I don't know them and can't describe them. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, annoyed. I was annoyed because we were debating. The fruit was good.
