A friend (25, m), an unidentified person, and I went to the back door of a nightclub. After descending a flight of stairs in darkness we entered a large room. It seemed that a party was going on, but only a few couples were there. They were dancing near the door which we had come in. On the other side of the room was a raised platform with chairs arranged in a semicircle for a symphony orchestra. A few of the chairs were occupied. My friend began to play classical music on the piano picking out each note slowly. I was surprised because he had never played classics before. At the foot of the piano was a basket filled with uncooked pieces of meat. I began picking up hams and roasts and then putting them back in the basket.
