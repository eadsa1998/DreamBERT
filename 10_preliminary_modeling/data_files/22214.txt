I dreamed I had gone to a lake, sad and disconsolate, with a loneliness which overpowered me. I started to swim, and felt I drowned, but was able to float just in time, until finally I found a whirlpool which pulled me. I saw I was hopelessly lost and finally let myself be dragged, but I knew I still had strength and could get out, but I let myself be led by the sensation I felt which undoubtedly I liked very much.
