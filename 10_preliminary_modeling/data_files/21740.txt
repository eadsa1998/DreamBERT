I was walking by #E105 St. by a nice girl. She was watching the men go by and commented of their physical looks. When I went by, she said, "Wow, there's a slim, tall, handsome fellow. I have a husband like that." This flattered me. There was a big tree and a squirrel was up there. Then somehow I was in the tree and coming down imitating the squirrel. A man was down on the ground and was going to show how he could throw the squirrel or me over his shoulder. He got hold of me and swung me down as he did, so he had a third leg in the center of his body. I got hold of the center leg and he couldn't throw me over his shoulder. He had three legs. He was a freak. I was in our garden in Rivertown and went to the back gate which was a block of concrete like a block of sidewalk. As I got near it, it came down on me and was under it in the snow and got excited if I could breathe. I could, but I couldn't lift the stone and get out.
