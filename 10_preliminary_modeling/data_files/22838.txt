Mother and I had gone somewhere in the car.  We are coming back and night and stop along a sort of levee road that has a severe drop on one side and an embankment on the other.  My sister Nancy and another little girl were there.  There is a car mashed head on into the embankment, with a person it and another car nearby.  I know they have been drag racing, and I am very mad when I found out Nancy was in one of the cars while they were racing.  I put my hand on the windowsill of one of the cars and it has blood on it, which gets on my hand.  On the way back we pass a house about 40 feet off the street.  It is the Ottos' house, and I see Robinette Otto lying under the window.  We stop and find out that a magician had been showing his tricks, had wrapped a cord around Robinette's neck, the end of the cord had broken off and it was too short to unwrap, and she had choked to death.  I am very shocked, and I want to cry but can't for some reason.  When we get home, the Ottos' house is still near outs, and as I pass it I see Mr. &amp; Mrs. Otto and Laurie.  I ask them if there is anything I can do, and Laurie says they would like to have some Scotch tape.  I go home and find we don't have any, so I am going to go to the drugstore but they change their mind.  I try to comfort Laurie, but none of them shows any emotion of any kind.  I am halfway convinced that I am dreaming, but it seems very real.  I am very sad.
