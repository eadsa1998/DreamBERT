I'm going up to the S Beach Hotel without a reservation, hoping a room is open for me. The cat (Pablito) is in the car. I'm in the passenger side. I go in and open a door. Someone, a bald man, is already in there. I apologize and try another room. An elderly couple is in there. I realize I'll probably be put in the dorm room as the conference starts Sat. night. So I at least will have a room but I am disappointed. [BL]
