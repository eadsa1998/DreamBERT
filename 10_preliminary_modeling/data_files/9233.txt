I went to a meeting at church. When I walked into the room I was surprised to see Richard R there. He saw me and I said, I didn't know you were a member of this parish. He smiled slightly and looked away. He was standing facing one of the tables and had just laid down a notepad or some such. As he looked away he also turned his body away. This bothered me as it seemed like a chilly response.
