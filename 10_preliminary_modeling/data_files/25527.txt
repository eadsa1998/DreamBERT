 I'm in a game. Willard Scott is there, as well as another man. I throw balls, trying to hit people. They try to hit me with balls. The game is played on different levels. I scramble down from a top level through two square holes in the floors to the bottom level. I scrape my back as I climb down. I am beating the other people at the game: kicking ass! Willard is in a lower level. He helps me as I scramble through maze-like conditions. I throw a ball and hit someone. Other balls are lying around to be picked up.
