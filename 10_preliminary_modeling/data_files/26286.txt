 I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and his brother Jose by Scott Junior High in Wilmerton. We're shooting our shotguns down toward a corner of the building. We're sighting in our guns and taking practice shots. My gun is pointed backwards. I aim by looking down the stock, while the barrel is pointed back at Stephen and Jose. It is difficult to pump because I have to use the reverse motion and the gun is upside down. We shoot around people, not at them. Our bullets ricochet. This is dangerous: we hear the shots whiz through the air. I say I'm going to stop shooting now because I'm using up all of my good slugs.
