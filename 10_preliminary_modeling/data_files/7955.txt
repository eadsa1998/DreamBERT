I was doing a group meeting or lecture in the living room of my birth home. Most of the people in the group were black. I was talking about the power of the subconscious mind and I gave a couple of examples from my own experience. I was really strongly emphasizing that the foundation of it all has to be unconditional faith- that whatever you are wishing for, whatever you are hoping for, whatever you are trying to manifest has to have a strong foundation of faith that it will happen. And I actually used the words you have to have the faith that God loves me, God wants the very best for me, he wants me to be happy, and he will bring this to me. As I was talking, this one lady kept talking to someone else. I asked her a couple of times to please wait until I finished. She would go on. I would ask her again and finally she did stop. Then when I finished I turned to her and I said okay now if you would share. She said, No, I don't want to now. I said, well, that's pretty childish but okay. The people in the group were pretty amazed at the examples I gave them. They left.
