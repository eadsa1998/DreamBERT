There were zombies and they had taken over and there weren't many people left. There weren't really any laws anymore, ie people drove however they wanted to. There was a family of three women, one of which had refused to move in a few days. The other one got angry and sent her to her room. They didn't keep their door locked and one locked it and then an alarm for zombies sounded and they bolted out this other door into a hall, with other units and ran to a carpark and into a caravan they had. Also, Mom and Darren had bought a caravan. Then it had been me living there and I ended up at this place where they housed lots of people. I had a room under a bunk. Calvin visited once. There was a guy pretending to be a different nationality because certain nationalities weren't allowed. I was hoping that Eugene would turn up. I had gone back to the house and there were zombies everywhere so I was killing a few. I was then in a dark alley with Ezra and it was sometimes GTA 4. I couldn't spawn a car and there were zombies around, who were starting to get anxious.
