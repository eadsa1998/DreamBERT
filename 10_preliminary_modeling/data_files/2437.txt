Tyler is being very tender toward me. I watch as an old priest and Tyler are standing with a renegade priest (Richard Burton) between them. Richard has been very bad and so Tyler and the old priest have to kill him. They are sad. They don't want to do it, but they must. The old priest holds Richard by the ankles over the edge of the cliff. Far down below is a rocky river edge and a river. Richard is terrified, but knows it must be. They let go and he falls, screaming. He lands in the river and splashes around. He calls up to the old priest, "I'll just swim upriver to drown myself." This is a courtesy to the priest, so he won't have to watch him die, but it's also a course of action to connive his way into extending his own life. The priest shakes his head and says, "No! Go downriver." Richard looks. Down the river are rocky rapids. It's sure death. He gulps and agrees, starting to slowly swim down the rapids. As we watch, he realizes the rapids are merely pools of water between big rocks. It's no danger and he smiles warmly back at the old priest. He will live after all. Later, Tyler is looking at Bonnie's back. She was hurt. He is gentle. I watch as he stands behind her and looks. Then he asks to look at my back. It's bent forward from sitting in the wheelchair so much. Then he gently turns me around and gives me "the colors." He presses his hand into my forehead, which forces me to lay back on his arm and a counter top. This causes me to see colors, but I only see a little bit. He says, "I'm sorry." I reassure him that I did see some colors.
