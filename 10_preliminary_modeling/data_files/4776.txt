["Flying."] I am in an airplane. I am the pilot and alone. I love flying. I love being in the sky and looking all around at the beauty. I fly until I run out of gas and have to land. A man, the mechanic and fuel dispenser man comes to the window to convince me to stay on land for awhile and hang out with him. I am not interested. I want to be back in the sky flying. I am annoyed he is taking so much time when I could be in the sky flying.
