I'm in my power chair, but the left side is gone and it needs fixing. I go to this industrial building to find a genius engineer to revamp my chair so its like a manual but fast and powerful. I can't get through a barrier so I move two bikes out of the way. They keep sliding down from the wall and I get frustrated putting them back up. I go in and see a group of men, one in a huge chair. The rest are standing. I pass up the chair guy and ask for Jim Short, the engineer. The man is not helpful, but finally agrees to show me where he is. I had to convince him I knew what I was talking about. He gets into a cart with toys in it and we go down a tunnel that is cement and dark. He goes slow and I say in exasperation, "I can go faster than this."
