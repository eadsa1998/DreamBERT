["Broken car."] I am trying to get into the driver's seat of a car. The seat is wide and far back from the steering wheel. A woman sits where I should be sitting to drive. We exchange seats. There is a handle on a long mechanical arm like my joystick mechanism laying on the left, not attached. I try and get it to be where it belongs. I see now I have to drive up a steep embankment to get to the road, which is narrow and lots of parked cars along it. It's more like a driveway. I hit the gas and roar up the embankment leaning forward in case we tip over. But we make it just fine. Now I am trying to turn around so we can leave but the brakes aren't working hardly at all. I press hard but we keep rolling. I hit something. A passenger from the back says it's OK. You didn't do much damage. Let's go. I say no, I have to talk with the owner of that object first. The passenger says it's not a problem. They won't care. I say, Even so, I must talk with a grown up about it before I leave.
