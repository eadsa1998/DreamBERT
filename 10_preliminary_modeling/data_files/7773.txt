It was a wedding. The men in the wedding party had on blue plaid shirts and vests with no ties. I was checking their neckline as they proceeded in. I tried to straighten Bob F's out as he went in. The wedding took place in a room that was kind of like a small meeting room. I don't remember the wedding itself. I don't even know who was getting married. After the wedding was over, we opened the door to let the other guests in. there wasn't really room for them because there were dining tables set up that took up the whole room. We told them it was standing room only. We had to eat in shifts. There is dancing in the room. The tables were gone. We had some chairs set up around the perimeter of the room I was trying to make as much room as I could and have seats for people. There was bunch of junk in the room. Like tables along the wall with stuff piled on them. We were dancing and having a good time but not many people would come in. I don't know why but it seems that Alan K was there because I don't remember seeing him or anything. I just have this sense that he was in it. It also seems like there were two separate wedding dreams. At another one, the room setting was very similar but I went in and Uncle H and Aunt R were sitting there eating. There was a woman and an empty seat between them. I thought that maybe she could move over one so there would be two seats together but I don't think I actually said this. It might have been this one that I remember something about the women in the wedding party. The colors were pink, white, and black. Just one of the bridesmaids had a black bow in her hair. They all had pink or white dresses on with opposite color bows in their hair. One of the bridesmaids was Phoebe.
