A. man is lost at sea. I help to rescue him. In a strange place we listen and attempt to accompany sophisticated percussion music. There is war. I am hit with shrapnel in the back. Bao Ninh tends to me in hospital. He is clearly in charge of himself and the matter at hand. Like a Zen master he is deliberate and clear in all he does. I complain and grow anxious, become uncooperative. Bao Ninh ignores or engages me depending on my awareness of what is correct. At one point he appears to give up, though recollection is unclear. I wake up still much moved by the force of his personality. It is not unlike that of David B.
