 I walk east on 2nd Street in Oak Valley. I think I see my friend Gino Teavor near the Partridge's house. I get closer as I walk by and see it is my high school classmate Emilio Kluck. He is hiding in a cornfield-like area. I don't pursue him. I come to the Jefferson School tennis courts. I meet my friend Stephen Ramos. We hug. I have missed him. We jokingly have fake sex. I am cautious to retain my personal space. My grade schoolmates Ray and Hal Jackson are there. Ray has a red sports car with door that open upwards. The car has only 50,000 miles on it. Ray has some handguns there, for him. I think this is inappropriate: what will he need a gun for? We begin to walk. Ray urinates in front of cars as we walk. This embarrasses me. I'm at a building that is for a Preppy Printers. There are stacks of pallets being moved around. The number of pallets is implied by someone to be the number of kids that a couple has. This number is greater than the number of times the couple has had sex, the person says! I argue that isn't possible. Henry Jackson produces a double-barreled shotgun that is a handgun with a scope! It is high-tech. Others, including Ray, have guns hidden, in cases. I ask why they need all the guns. They reply that their own family has shot them at: relatives! I haul in grocery carts that are sunk completely in mud. It is a cold, cloudy day. The ground is muddy brown. There is a man overseeing work. Henry and the man want to get as many carts stored away in different places as possible, to save space in the main room for a stock of carts. I talk with Ray about my wages, being critical of what I earn. Ray says we're all paid well. While this is true when we were young, it was because we were young: grunt workers. I know Ray and Hal get paid very well by their father, so Ray is biased in his opinion of the wages. I'm working odds and ends, like at Preppy Printers: shit jobs. I move and organize shoes, cleaning up.
