["Quick marriages."] I am teaching in an elementary school. The principal is going to be married to a woman. I am going to be married to another man. But for no apparent reason, we decide we like each others man better and swap. We marry on the instant the last day of school. He and I are walking no from the school building to meet a cousin Viola. She comes up and I introduce my husband explaining the swap. She is very surprised. I also explain my daughter suddenly got married. There are at least three of us couples that just instantly married someone we hardly knew. My man gently supports me to a small platform with an organ on it. It is his organ. But as I play the key, I hear it is a piano and see another platform with an organ on it. That is the real one my husband owns. My cousin disapproves. I feel fine about it. Kind of new and interesting.
