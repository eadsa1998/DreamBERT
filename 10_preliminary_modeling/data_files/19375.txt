I can't really recall the setting of the dream, though I do know it was in a fairly grand building -- Greek-like design -- and that I don't know the place. I'm surrounded by people of all different types, male and female, black and white, differently colored clothing. I recall a woman, approximately my age, who I felt a very strong attachment to. We spoke, off and on, though I can't recall what we spoke of, and we kissed. Everything was very very real feeling. I can't remember any of the faces I saw or the conversations I had, but I do remember vividly the emotional stages throughout the dream. Too real to be true, too good to be real.
