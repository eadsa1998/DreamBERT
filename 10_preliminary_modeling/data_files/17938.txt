Aunt Fiona left her bra and a knife in the rumpus room.  I saw the cedar box our cat Buster's ashes are in sitting on the mantle.  My boyfriend Jeremy and I were to drive somewhere.  I got in the car and expected Jeremy to get into the passenger side.  He didn't, though, and got into a large green soup bowl behind me.  He was supposed to give directions, but now I was stuck in front, not sure how to get where we were going.  As I drove I passed Orange Tree Street that I passed at work the other day.
