I am telling a classroom full of people that the fire alarm is ringing and they must vacate the room. They sit and look at me, a few leave, but a bunch in the back just sit there. I keep repeating my message, getting stronger voiced and more sarcastic by the moment. We are locked in a power struggle. I realize this and know that I'm creating it, so I back off after I struggle with the feeling that that is bad for me to lose face. I reflect a casual comment to one person. He gets up to leave and the rest follow. Outside I say to Bonnie, "I almost blew it there! I created a power struggle."
