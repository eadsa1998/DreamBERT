I was at the science fair at My school. I went into the gym and two of my friends were in there. There was a mattress on the floor with blankets and pillows on it. It was getting dark, so my mom, my friends and I decided to leave. There was a gate on one side of the gym, and it automatically closed. There was a man there that said he was watching the little kids. Setting: It took place in the gym at My school. Characters: There were people in my dream, I knew some of them. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, strange. I was happy but I thought the gym was really strange.
