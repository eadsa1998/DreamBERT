 I'm going into a Perkins restaurant with my family. We're following a police officer in. When we get inside, it is a Greasepit burger joint with a Rax Restaurant shape. My mom pays for everyone, even the employees. My friend Matt Yams is there working, along with another kid and a woman. They order a lot of food: two burgers each, fries, soda, and pies. It costs a lot. My friend Kevin Simpson works there. He gives me a bad glass of Pepsi. I think I asked for a Mountain Dew and a Dr. Pepper. The Pepsi is either too sweet or not sweet enough. The kid is punching up the till to find our order. The till breaks down. I tell him to add it up by hand. He can't do it, and gets mad.
