I was at school, which was different, and I was in Year 11. I had art first in Room D9. I had to go in through a hidden door and down these steps. There was a carousel. My teacher was Debbie (Queer as Folk US) I then had S+E. I was late there. There were people I didn't like in the class. Everyone was spread out. The desks were in levels. Dmitri came late too. I then had art again but Calvin was in my class so I asked the teacher, who was different, if I could change classes. I had to go to the front office to see some Henry guy who was actually Hugh Grant (because, as I put it, it was an all-star cast). On the way there I was debating which class I should go to.
