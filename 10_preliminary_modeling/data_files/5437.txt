I had an orgasm in my dream last night, and I'm pretty sure I had one in real life too. I was lying on a beach and some guy, I don't know who, was touching me. We weren't having sex; he was just touching me. He was kneeling over me and holding onto this sword. Whenever he pushed his sword deeper into the sand, he touched me a little deeper. The phallic imagery is pretty obvious, but we weren't actually having sex. Anyway, it kept going like this until I had an orgasm and woke up from it. My god!
