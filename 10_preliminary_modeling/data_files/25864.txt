 I'm in Woodland. I'm riding my red Huffy childhood bicycle holding a bag of apricots. It's the day before I am to move into the Whitman house. I have my stuff in a room on campus. I ride past the Brimson Crew Team boathouse. The house is on a lake, which is south of Brimson. I ride over the boats, which are on trailers. I see a woman jogging with a cast on her broken foot. She hops on one leg. I go past a house that is a place you can buy blue jeans. A lot of blue jeans are stacked around the sidewalk and yard. I ride past a golf coach and his high school golf team. One left-handed kid makes a long putt. I clap for him. His coach is jubilant and encouraging. The kid downplays his great putt, as if he has been struggling playing lately. I go by the Whitman house. It looks trashy because of the people that have lived there during the summer. There is a teal or dark turquoise mini van parked on the front lawn. The front lawn is smaller than usual. I go through the next yard where there is a lady with a gun. I turn around. Something happens with the lady and blueberries. I'm riding my bicycle singing an oldies song, with my bag of apricots. I drop apricots, and pick them up. As I head back to campus I wonder who will be there to talk with. There is a door leading to school. I try to open the door while still on the bicycle, and drop apricots. I pick them up and try to open the door again. I sing and try to open the door to school.
