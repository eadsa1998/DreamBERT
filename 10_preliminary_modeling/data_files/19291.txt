I was at school and this guy that I've had a crush on for about eight years wouldn't talk to me. I was walking down a hall where I see him everyday. I said "hello" to him. He just turned his back and started walking away. I shouted at him down the hall asking, "What happened? What did I do." He just looked at me and said, "I can't." It was really unpleasant because it was when I didn't think he wanted to see or talk to me anymore.
