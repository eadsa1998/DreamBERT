A letter came to our house. My father took it out of the mail box. The letter was for me. My father called me for I was across the street at my boyfriend's house. I ran across the street and opened the letter. It was from Western Reserve Medical School. It was an acceptance. I kissed my father and jumped with joy. I was so very, very happy that I started to dance around. I then awoke.
