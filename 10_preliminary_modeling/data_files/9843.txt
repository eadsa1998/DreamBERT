Lying close to Marissa Camden and then helping her pick up some of their dishes and garbage; very close dream of walking to Church: as we arrive I see a procession of priests, not Father Andrew, with the host bowing low before the people; we stand high on a parapet: "What a lucky coincidence," I say; -- A-- D-- (person from Church) helps me out and comes to our house; helps put on dinner.
