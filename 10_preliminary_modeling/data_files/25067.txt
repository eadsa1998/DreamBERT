 I'm with a bunch of people at a place that seems like the Veterans Administration building in Wilmerton. Among the people are my friends from high school Nate Nelling, Emily Zates, Wynette Black, Jerome Michaels, and Sam Kingsley. There is some sort of a contest or game going on. It involves couples. There is a movie theatre-like board on which couples' names are posted. Two couples play against each other at a time. I think I'm with my girlfriend Annie. It's getting down to the end: there are only 6 couples left. When the names are put up on the screen, the couples go around the side of the theatre into a shower-like area. I'm sitting at a table with a bunch of people. Jerome is talking technology. Sam is talking about something similar to that. The names of people that are in the contest are nicknames; comical. They might be dancing or singing/performing in the contest.
