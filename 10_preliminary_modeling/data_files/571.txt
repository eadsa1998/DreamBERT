A couple from my neighborhood are in the cafe where I worked as a teenager. The woman is actually Indonesian. In the dream an Indonesian citizen is entertaining in the cafe. Upon a certain signal he shoots someone. I knew this was going to happen. I try to talk to him but am not sure what I am trying to accomplish with the conversation. I realize I am in danger. Next we are in my aunt's house. I keep trying to dial 911 but can't. I wake up.
