I had a dream last night, and me and my friends Josh, Derrick, Mattie, Jackie and Kara were on a big trampoline, a really, really big one, and then Jackie turned into a giant, a giant Jackie. And she took the trampoline and she made a, she threw it up and made a big wave out of it, and we all flew up in the air. And when we came back down, we bounced really high. And then Derrick almost fell off, so I grabbed his wrist, and then Josh fell off and I didn't really care about that. And then someone came in and said that we had to clean up everything that we did, so we cleaned up the Legos and then we put away the trampoline.
