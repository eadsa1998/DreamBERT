I was with my real mom and she was driving me somewhere. When we came back home, there was a big commotion. My brother, who hated our step-uncle, was selling all of our step-uncle's possessions vigorously. He was selling them for money that didn't exist and he didn't care until my dad talked to him. My step-uncle came home and he was in big trouble. Setting: In the hallway, kitchen and garage of my house presently. Characters: My supposed brother was an enemy from school. I was me with my mom and dad. Our step-uncle was some classic cool guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, worried. We're studying cashless society in school so that's where "money that doesn't exist" comes from, but I don't know about the rest. We don't have a step-uncle!
