Earlier, my sister and her friend were driving a boat. They weren't paying attention. Almost hit the wall as we went through the arch. I jumped off before it collided. had camera in pocket of swim shorts. Took the battery out, hoped it would dry. I didn't want to say I told you so about letting them drive.
