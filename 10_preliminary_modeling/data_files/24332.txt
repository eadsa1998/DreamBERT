Dreamed that I was in the newsroom of the newspaper where I now work, near my desk. I was facing the wall, however. And I was stressing working on a series of stories. Professor Betsy Childers came up and said I had cashed an $80 check in her name, and wanted to check up on it. I logged into my computer and checked my bank account. Jeff Harr and Bob Traux (former editors) came over and chatted. Jeff asked me to pull up my list of stories. There was a long list. I thought that it wasn't quantity that mattered, but Jeff seemed to think so. He was impressed, however. I was on a research boat or something like it along this deep part of the Amazon. I wanted to get a canoe with a friend to go down and help with the water lettus cleanup, but really, just wanted to venture out away from the camp -- which was like a swamp-like version of my desk. My place in the swamp eventually turned into my work area at the newspaper where I now work. I was writing that story, and there were pictures of nude girls in a long row in the file leading down. They were part inspiration, part topic for the story. Emily (intern who I'd made out with and was flirting with) was IMing me via google chat.
