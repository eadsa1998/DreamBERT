I remember having a cat- I don't know where I got it. It was actually a little kitten. I was holding it and I loved it. It was the cutest kitten- it reminded me of my grandfather's cat Doc a year ago. I took him outside with me, and I was holding it and petting it all the time. I remember not wanting the kitten to grow up- I thought I noticed a personality change (it didn't want me to hold it all the time anymore). But he was still acting like a kitten, anyway. I was thinking I shouldn't feel so bad about the kitten growing up because, "Well, I can get another kitten someday and do this all over again
