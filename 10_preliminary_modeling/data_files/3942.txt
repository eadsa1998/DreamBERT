["Babies and Fleischman wants me back."]  I am ill and lying on a hospital bed. I have a small baby with me. Dr. Fleischman, of Northern Exposure, used to be my lover and he wants to get us together again. He lies down on the bed with me and the baby. He is pretending to pay attention to the baby, but he is really trying to get close to me. I have one breast exposed because I'd been feeding the baby. Fleischman lays his head down by my breast. He desires me sexually. I am vaguely aware of this and passively lie there waiting. I realize I must reach out in some way to respond to him if I want him. I contemplate doing that, still filled with a soft resistance.
