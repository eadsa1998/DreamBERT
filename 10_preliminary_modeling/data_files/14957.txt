I was at a petrol station with Mom. It was night. I drove there and Mom went in. I decided to drive off and I drove to the exit, then I turned around. Mom came back, looking angry. She said she would drive and we drove off and she said that everyone saw, including the police but she didn't tell me that. Later they stopped us and gave us a fine. I said that I accidentally put my foot on the accelerator.
