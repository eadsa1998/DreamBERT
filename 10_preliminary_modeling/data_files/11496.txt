We were walking down a path in a big forest when all of a sudden a huge bird, a hawk of some kind, came down and picked up my younger brother and carried him off to a nest. My other brother and I stood there spellbound. We ran back to our tent and got our .22 rifle which we had brought along just for target practice. We then ran to where the nest was and started to creep up on it when all of a sudden the bird took off with my younger brother. He started to fly low out over a body of water. I felt this would be the last time we would see him so I took my rifle and shot at the bird. It let go of my brother and he fell into the lake. He swam to the shore. The bird fell into the water dead. This is where my dream ended.
