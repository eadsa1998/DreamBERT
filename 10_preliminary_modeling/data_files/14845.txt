I had to go back to university to finish off the course. I changed into a 6 year old boy to do one subject and the teacher said I could have the day off since I didn't know anyone. A psychologist there was annoyed because I hadn't done an assignment for that class and I said the teacher gave me an extra day. I was outside. Some girl was giving out awards and a celebrity got one and then walked off. An old lady that was from the church was there. I had invited her there and was talking to her. Then some guy was cleaning up a store and it was dark inside and night. He was washing the windows.
