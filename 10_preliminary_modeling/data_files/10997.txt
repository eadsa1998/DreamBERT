I dreamed I was on a streetcar on Euclid Ave. The car was going towards the city. A boy I know got on the car with a dog. I knew he shouldn't have, but he said it would be all right. The conductor opened the doors at a stop and the dog jumped off and ran down the street. I was worried about the dog and this boy and I got off of the streetcar. We found the dog on the sidewalk outside of a store. I knew the dog was sick and dying. He appeared to be flat against the sidewalk. He was trying to move but he couldn't. I told the boy to get the dog to a doctor but he thought the dog was all right.
