Dreamt about a boy I knew in high school (saw him briefly for about 5 minutes last night-driving past the house and hit our dog). We were out on a date--was wearing jeans and a shirt--discussed where we could go in jeans. He suggested place to eat. Picked up a number of other people all of whom were very strange--didn't know them. Greater part of them were children. We stopped and I had to get out of the car for while--was afraid of seeing someone that knew me, for it was a Friday night and inasmuch as my father is orthodox in his religion, I was not supposed to be riding. Had argument with someone about discrimination and the segregation of the Negro and the Jews. Something came in about stunt night. Seems the boy I asked told me he was able to go. Rest of the dream vague and all mixed up.
