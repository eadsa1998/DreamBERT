I wanted to go out and watch TV or play a game by myself, so I went outside and took the TV and a blanket with me. The place was on the edge of a park. It was very much like a park in the city where I work. benches. many people out, even in the evening. There were trees and grass. I took everything into the park. But it started to rain. It was raining for real that night, and I got caught in the downpour. I left the TV , but grabbed my blanket and ran back inside. I was in my boxers, which is why I brought the blanket and sheet to cover up and keep warm. I hoped nobody would steal the TV. I went back inside.
