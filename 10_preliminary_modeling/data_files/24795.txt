First I was talking to my grandma, then we were trying to find a seat in this huge lecture hall. Then I sat down in the first row next to my cousin. Then this lady came with a tray and gave me a cup of orange juice and a cup of soda. I was holding both and I couldn't balance myself at all. I finally got the cups under my seat. Then I was kind of nowhere but my cousin was telling me her family was going with mine to the shopping center. Setting: A large lecture house (it kept getting bigger as curtains went up and revealed new stages). Characters: My grandma, my cousin Alice, a drink lady (no knowledge). Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared, worried. I thought it was pretty weird. It was typical of my cousin though, and grandma.
