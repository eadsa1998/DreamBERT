The school was having a prom. This rich kid's birthday was on the same day, so his father did the birthday party, which doubled as the prom. The kid was Classmate-M-22. The song Sadie Pritchard Dance was playing. This guy who looked like Christopher Gorham was there and he had an engagement ring on and said some other guy did too. I had been downloading a video of the party before it happened. My hard drive was screwy though and I had to press down on it a bit because it was bent. Darren, Ezra and Mom were at a house because Ezra had to get something. I had this photo from school and Isabel was in it. Gossip Girl got cancelled and it was showing the way the new season would've started and all the characters morphed into the next one and it looked really cool. The only person I recognized was Leighton Meester.
