There was a sale at the grocery store. A different kind of cereal every day of the week. I stopped at night in the rain at a Winn Dixie. A man was waiting for his little league baseball team to join him at the grocery store and got some of the cereal. There was a path off the room like the swampy Everglades, but more deciduous trees. Animals roamed wild. I walked with my mother down the dark path. She pointed out the silhouette of a deer far away. I stayed between my mother and the dangerous edge of the road. We ended back at a room in the hospital. I was in the room above. A man. It was after closing time. The doors were locked at a neighborhood store. In my bare room (a TV and a couch) the TV was on. An evil man busted in the door on the premise of watching the baseball game, but he started twisting my fingers as far as he could. He grabbed me and tried to choke me and the phone was dead. It was after closing. He applied more and more pressure. I was gasping for my last breaths and almost died. He was trying to kill me, and just in time my hands and mouth came open, and I got some more air. I noticed 3 people through the glass door. I tried to get them to see the message, "HELP." They broke the door.
