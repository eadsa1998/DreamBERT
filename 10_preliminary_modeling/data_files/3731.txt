I am feeling very ill. My daughter Ellie had been very ill with the flu. I guess it was my turn now. I am semi-lying in an overstuffed chair. I look down and see both my legs are in one leg hole of a huge man's briefs. I am embarrassed. I notice my fat belly. I am naked, but the flu and the fever is so bad I can barely move. Ellie comes over to me and leans close. I feel her take something in her mouth and put it in me somehow. It is a hard lump of something I can feel and move around in my belly. It is very uncomfortable. I get up with difficulty and try to walk. I had seen a woman that looks like a witch woman and I need to go to her. Now I am on a toy train and it has rubber tires and as I drive it around the narrow wooden structure, the wooden gates are too low and I have to think my way through. I finally arrive where the witch woman is. Lots of people are sick. I find her lying on her face in a kind of trance as she works with someone else. I tell her my daughter put this horrible thing in me and I am sick. She works with me and gets it out for me. I get back on the train for a ride.
