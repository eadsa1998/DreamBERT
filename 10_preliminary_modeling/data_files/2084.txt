I am in a pickup and camper parked on the sand next to the ocean. I am looking for a small green rowboat that is coming in over the surf. I think, "That could be dangerous." I see one, but it's not the one. I look out and see the ocean tide rising and approaching my truck. I say to my father, "It's nearly up to the wheel. We'll have to move." I start to back up, but some one right behind me has opened up a brown box in the sand, sort of like an engine cover and he's fixing something. I say, "Hey, could you wait a minute on that so I can get by?" He just stares at me and then continues. So I go around him, realizing I could have done that anyway. I didn't have to ask him to move. I go to a house. I walk up a flight of stairs and at the landing, I see a bedroom. I go in and look. It's not for the guests. It is the owner's private room. I see a comfy bed and a fire going in the fireplace. I say, "How nice!" I see hundreds of books on shelves all over the walls. There's a mesh screen nailed over them with wooden strips to keep people from taking the books. I look at how they did that. Then I leave the room to continue up the next flight of stairs, only I'm called back downstairs by a flaming redheaded girl child. I approach her. She's outside looking in. She says, "Come downstairs and look. Quick!" I look at the long set of stairs and say, "No thanks! This is hard enough." Now I am going to my son's second grade class to see how he's doing at his new school. I fervently hope he doesn't have to sit next to the redhead. I am relieved to see he's not. The male, young teacher has me sit with three other parents who are also observing. He says, "I'll bet you'll feel better after seeing the actual situation your son is in." I agree. There is a box of audio tapes another parent (couple) has brought in. I choose some to borrow that deal with self-awareness and growth. I put the rest back in.
