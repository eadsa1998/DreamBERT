My friend Roxeanne died, I don't know how. I kept trying to call Jack because he didn't know. I couldn't get through. I was so frustrated because I wasn't even sure it was true. Then I had a guilty moment of being happy, relieved because her death made me free to move on. There was another woman who I've never seen that I wanted to be with.
