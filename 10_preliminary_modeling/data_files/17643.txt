My deceased maternal grandpa Gerald was in my dream last night.  As usual I hugged him, and I told him how much "I miss you guys" (Guys referring also to the rest of my family, who's still alive). His response was something about, "well, come September...oh but we're not allowed to talk about that." The feeling I got from his message was that something would happen in September to change that, my impression being that I would die and then I wouldn't miss him anymore. The referral to not being allowed to talk about that would be some rule from God about divulging the future.
