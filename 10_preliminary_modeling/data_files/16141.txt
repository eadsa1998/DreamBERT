I was in school and that I was drawing a picture, and for some reason when I was done drawing the picture, I got up on Frank's (?) desk and I perched and I did something really sick. And I kept doing that and doing that and doing that for almost like fifteen minutes, and everybody around me was staring at me, but in my dream I just didn't care. I don't know what it was about the picture I was drawing, or anything, but oh, it was so embarrassing. I woke up relieved, but when I woke up, I didn't remember my dream until I got to school and I sat down at my desk. Every so often I'll have a dream like that, because the dreams tell the truth about your subconscious.
