I tried a cigarette.  I was surprised that I didn't start coughing.  I felt the heat in my throat as I inhaled.  I think I liked the novelty of smoking.  I had a stash of 5 or so cigarettes in a drawer.  I wasn't a smoker, but I had had a cigarette on rare occasion. I think someone offered me a cigarette and I said I didn't smoke.  Then I remembered back to earlier in the dream and realized that truthfully I couldn't say that.  I think there was something about driving.
