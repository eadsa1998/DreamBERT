I can't remember how but there was a maggot tornado. The maggots were quite big (a couple inches long and fat) and would stick their heads into things and stay there or bury themselves inside. They hit a fan and got flung around. Most of them landed well away from me and I hid under my blanket but some landed in my bed. I was squealing and disgusted and someone else helped squeeze them out and throwing them away and I tried to squeeze the area around them because I didn't want to touch them.
