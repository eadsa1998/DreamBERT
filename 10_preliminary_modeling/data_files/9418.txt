I am riding through a large, strange town looking for a new therapist. I get to see a pleasant man who was recommended and wait while he sees a little boy. Also go to see a woman therapist who is very stern, not pleasant. I want to return to the man and three times open the door and stick my head inside while he is with another patient. Finally I get to tell him my story while he reads the summary that Smith had sent him. (Vivid image of name "Smith" on letterhead).
