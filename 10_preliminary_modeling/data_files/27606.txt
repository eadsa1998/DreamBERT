I was driving a shully-four foot cabin cruiser in a large lake. The water was calm and the air was slightly chilly. There was no one else on the boat; I was completely alone. Soon I landed the boat at the dock end went up to a cottage, where evidently I lived. There was a tennis court in back of the house and I began playing tennis with someone whom I didn't really know. The dream ended with my trying to hit the ball.
