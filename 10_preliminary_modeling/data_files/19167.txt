I dreamed I was over at Jackson, and I was with Phyllis. She's a girl at school, one of my lab partners. We were downstairs. We were walking around somewhere, I forgot where, but we came back. We went to get a coke down at the coke machine or 7-Up. It looked like it was downstairs somewhere in Jackson. I opened the machine. I put a dime in the machine. I opened the machine and it was full of, it had a lot of other stuff in there. It had old whiskey bottles and flasks and apparently some of the orderlies were using it for their repositories, illicit liquor and the sort. Anyway, I found a big bottle of 7-Up that they were using for a mixer. So I took that instead of the small bottles. Hall: Sam remembers pouring in glasses the 7-Up for Phyllis and having one himself.
