I've had this crazy dream. The kids were in the house. I was packing. Water emptied from leaks in the roof and elsewhere. I got on my blanket and clothes. I got in the pick up. Snow, deep on the ground. I was in a parking lot. I narrowly missed several cars. I parked next to a red car, jeep. A man was in it. The kids and I got in back. We went down the street. Passed school buses, slushy roads. I thought, "What will he say when he sees them gone?" Down a steep hill. In a house. I had to give man (cousin Abner or Nate) a shot. A two-pronged needle with red liquid. I know it will hurt him. I didn't want to but I had to. He yelled in pain. He turned on the bed, writhed around, and threw himself around. I snuck up and finished the dosage. He yelled in mock anger. He grabbed me. We tumbled to the floor. He started to make love, wildly, lovingly. Later at the table, an ugly woman with horrible eyes, glazed, hazy, and blue, came in. Said to him, "So there's the louse." I gave her a straight look. I said, "Just leave him alone!" Anger. She steadily looked at me. Another woman, possibly my mother watched the tense scene.
