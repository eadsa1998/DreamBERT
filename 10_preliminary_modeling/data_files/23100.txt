I was in the army, and was being transferred to a new duty station or going off active duty.  They had shipped me some things I had left behind, and I picked them up at some kind of express office.  My car's "boot" bag, for example, but it contained only a few baseball bats, no boot.  Also a box or sack containing several large hunks of cheese, some of which were quite soft and moist, but all of which were moldy.  After some indecision, I threw all of them away.
