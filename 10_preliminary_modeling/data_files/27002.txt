I dreamed that I was watching a group of boys in a large gym preparing for some game. In the center stood a boy whom I date quite a bit. I tried to wave at him but couldn't get his attention. From there the scene moved to a pool where a game was in progress. The object of the game was to jump in the water and pop balloons with a hammer. After watching this I dove into the pool. Shortly afterwards I noticed the pool was empty. The next time I went in there was water in it. Then I took a long run along the side and was in the air over the pool when I noticed it had been drained again. I righted myself and landed on my feet. I remember some feeling of embarrassment for having gone into an empty pool. As I was climbing out I started fussing with an ice cream push cart which had several bowls of sauces at one end. Somehow I upset the whole thing and several of us hurried out with it before the gym teacher came and found the mess. We took the cart outside once and tried to fix things up. The rest of the dream is quite hazy.
