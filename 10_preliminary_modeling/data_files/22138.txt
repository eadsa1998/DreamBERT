I was in a car race. I was running ahead of everybody so I confidently stopped at a highway restaurant. I had a drink and went out and then I found several of my friends and there were lots of people who hadn't been there when I went in. Everybody was running at the side of the road in order to see the cars go by. I shouted with everybody else and forgot about the race. Several cars went by and then I went into the bar to have a beer. There were several of us, but none of them was familiar. We were drinking to my success in the race. We were drinking a lot and then on the radio we could hear someone screaming, "Goal!" A point had been made by my favorite team and I was happy. Then I awoke.
