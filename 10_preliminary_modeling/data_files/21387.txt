I was in Rivertown. I was flying and having a good time. I told someone I was the only person in the world that could fly. Then I said in my sleep. I flew under icicles that were hanging from the school roof and then I dive-bombed at one of my friends. He had a long piece of stiff wire and it got me on time. I got ahold of it and didn't dive at him any more. I was by Grandma's and one of the eaves were higher on one side than the other. I was planning with Steve how to level it and I gave him some suggestions on doing it.
