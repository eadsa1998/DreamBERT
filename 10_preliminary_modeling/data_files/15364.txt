I was out somewhere with Mom. She had decided to take Rover for a walk at the park there. We had my car, Dad's van and Ezra's car. Then Dad took his van. Mom wanted me to take Ezra's car. We went for a drive to find the way to get back without any speed bumps. I was like 'you left Rover alone there, now I have to drive you back and then pick you up'. I ended up at this place where highschoolers were doing yearbook stuff. There were shelves and one was made of cardboard. Ezra was there. Rover and Sam (Supernatural) were there and I was telling Ezra that Mom left Rover behind earlier and Ezra said to the other Rover that Rover was our dog and that he was named after him. The cardboard shelf fell apart. Later, I was at the old house. Ezra was there. There was this thing where something would come to your house if you won a competition and it was saying 'sex'. It was night. He ran out front and a group of people came to the driveway. Our cars were on the lawn. I thought something seemed dodgy. There were people with antlers and some were on the roof. It was hard to see because it was dark. Someone across the street turned a light on and saw them and a girl screamed. I realised some were inside and I went in. They could turn into puddles. I realised they were evil and they turned into puddles on the lino and lit them on fire with a lighter. Another one looked like Spaceman and I set it on fire and there was a note saying 'real pet'. I reset it and burned the other one instead but it didn't work. It turned into a person and wanted to make a deal that it would do something if I let it live and I agreed. I was then somewhere else, inside. Then it was like a movie and a girl went into a bathroom and in the mirror, it reflected this big 'pirate' head (it was like a mask) and it was the leader trying to trick us.
