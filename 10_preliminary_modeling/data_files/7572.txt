A friend of mine came to see me complaining that she had not received her annual pay raise this year and wondered if I could help. I went to see her boss thinking I could talk the boss into giving my friend a raise in pay. When I got to the office, I was surprised to find that my friend's boss was Mary. When I told her why I was there she told me that my friend was lucky to have her job. Even Mary did not get her annual raise. The business had not been doing well for a long time and might close down. Everyone working was lucky to have a job, let alone get a raise in pay.
