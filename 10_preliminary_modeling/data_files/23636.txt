I'm going into the outback. There is a group. It is known that the most important experiences are in the dark, in the unknown. Then there is someone who heads up another group and he just breaks into the unknown a world of constant change. Ruthless. In the beginning I think it is all wrong. Not good. But later it appears that they respect that. That he has found his way through. And that they want something from the concentration of the other world to deal with themselves.
