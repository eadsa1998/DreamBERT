I was standing in a clearing with some woods and a large windowed room in the background. I was standing with some friends who said that there were several of the enemy in the woods and in the room. (I think the enemy was Nazis or some nationalistically bound group.) We all had cutlasses in our hands. Some enemy approached, and I was told I must kill them or be killed. I started hacking at one with my cutlass. The enemy was a block of wood 10" x 2" x 5'. My blows were very violent, but rather inaccurate. None penetrated more than an inch or two. I finally killed the enemy but was afraid that his companions would kill me. Suddenly a young man dressed in a Tyrolian alpine costume appeared from the room and led me away to safety.
