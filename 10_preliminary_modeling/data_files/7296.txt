Holding the change, I hurry to the front of the church but there was no plate for offerings there. Going out the side door I tried without result to use a chamber pot pushing it out of sight. I returned by the outer aisle to my pew. Fellow worshipper asked if I was all right now. I was glad she thought I'd left because I felt ill.
