 I'm on an airplane that doesn't have a "big plane" feel. I'm with a woman and man, both my age or younger. We're then in a very modern building with fancy cars in it. The man and I are following the woman. It's as if she's going to teach us something. She seems to be a unique person, almost a prodigy in some way. The woman says her family of three (parents and she) has four cars. We're in a subtle, nonchalant race-like situation, to beat others. The race is to get the strongest, most pungent, sharp Romano cheese! People come in doors below us, on a lower level, also in the race. [Note: Rat race?] We all go towards the cheese, though we never see it or actually know where it is. I know that this girl lives a comfortable life, financial and otherwise. We near the top floor of the building and the people are close behind us, getting near the top floor and coming down the hallway, of what is now Carter School. I go into the bathroom near the north end of the hallway. The man I'm with goes too. We agree this is the best place to be. We walk in. There is a bluish-yellow pillow in the urinal. This is the place. It is a semi-enjoyable feeling to be in this nonchalant race led by the woman, with others close behind us.
