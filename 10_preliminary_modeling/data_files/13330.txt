I went to some place with Mom, which was usually a theater. We went to see a movie. Our seat was right at the back so we moved to the second row. We realized we had no water, so I sent Mom to go get some. Someone sat in her spot so I got up and found more. I was next to a little girl who was waiting for her mother. Her mother came and we moved again. Something happened to the movie and it skipped to the end. People in astronaut like suits came in and they shut the doors. We thought that they were going to gas us. They had to give us something so we could breathe. Then we had to line up in order of last name. Mariana was there. I saw Eugene. Poppa came and squished us. I said "You're going to break my nose, Poppa!".
