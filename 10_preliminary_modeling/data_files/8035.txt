All of my family was at Kidwell's. Uncle J's house. We were walking around and we walked down to the trampoline. We talked about how much we used to enjoy playing on the trampoline. There were three of them. they put Rachel S on one with me. I was having a hard time keeping her away from the sides. I don't know if I was taking too long on one of them or what, but everyone else either left or started using the other two.
