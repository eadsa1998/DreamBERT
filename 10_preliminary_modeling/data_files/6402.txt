I dreamed that I was in some kind of medieval landscape, laying in the base of a cylindrical tower with my enemy. Guess it was a dungeon. We conversed for a while, very politely and pleasantly, but then, it suddenly came to him that I was after him and after a brief struggle, I leapt out of the dungeon-hole, knowing that he was superior. Everything melted, and the next thing I knew, I was in a supermarket. I see these four painted canvases of cavemen, in the Flintstones leopard-skins that hang on one shoulder, looking very strong, with the legend, "Christian Soldiers Unite!" written across them. Suddenly, all the canvasses of cavemen are lowered, and I see that they're being held up by two bare-chested boys and two bare-chested girls. But, as I get closer, I realize that they are all girls, as one of the older ones takes off her shirt. I find the Christian leader eventually, who's a middle aged man, and I ask him about the girls. He mumbles something, and I beat him up. My friend Bonnie sees this and she tells me that she is very impressed.
