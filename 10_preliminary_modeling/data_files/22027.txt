I dreamt that I and my whole family had moved to another house. It was a rather commercial house. On the inside one could see lots of stairs. The rooms were huge and did not let the daylight in. Looking through the windows, one could see white marble stairs. We had a huge receiving room for visitors with crystal decorations. I went to the main gate, which was made of iron and could be lifted like the ones in stores. I was waiting for a truck which would bring merchandise to sell. Around me I saw counters and toys, many toys. I saw my stepfather looking at and fixing up the toys, one by one. I was putting price tags on all the items that arrived.
