["Silly doctor makes a pass."] I am in a building with a good looking man. He's a Doctor. He is trying to hide from this obnoxious boy. I scurry him into the elevator and press the button for basement. The doors shut and down we go. Then I quickly push the button for the 2nd floor. I am trying to trick the boy. I remember that we might stop at the first floor, thereby revealing us to the boy but thankfully, the elevator goes straight to the 2nd floor. We get out and quickly run down the hall into an empty examining room. We shut the door. Happy that we escaped the boy. The Doctor puts on a doctors jacket and wants me to wear a patient gown. He tries to hug me and kiss me. I push him away, attracted but I also don't like him. He is too silly.
