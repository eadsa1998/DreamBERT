 I'm on the phone with my friend Tiny Combs in my brother Wally's room at home. Something is wrong, but I don't hear or miss when Tiny first says it. He is telling me the details. I ask him what he is referring to. He says his father died. I'm at the Whitman house. There is a message on the answering machine from Tiny and Matt Combs and their mother. It says that their father and husband has died. The funeral is at 9:00am tomorrow. My mom says I can borrow her car to drive to Wilmerton; I'm in Woodland now. My mom may go with, as well as Wally. I'm outside a building with my dad. We're gathering before the funeral. My dad makes very sexual comments, including one about me being with virgins. This seems indecent and it makes me uncomfortable. We wait for my cousins Anna and Bertha Strange to arrive. They do. I'm inside a building, which may be a church, at a funeral. People march in, carrying the coffin, and everyone files into pews. I sit in a pew with the Redding family, including grandma, Sherry and Joanne Redding, and others. It's very crowded so I move back one pew and sit by myself. The funeral service that takes place is a Jewish service, and it is happening before the service that I am there to attend, for the Comb's father. Grandma Redding offers me some hallucinogenic mushrooms. I decline them. Sherry speaks: she is slow and shaky, like Grandma. My dad is sitting next to me. People walk up and take hosts for communion from a basket. My dad takes many hosts, and gives me one, which looks egg-like because it seems to have a yolk.
