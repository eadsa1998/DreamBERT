This is a dream I had while I was lying here just before I got up. I was in the library at school, University of Miami, with a friend of mine, and we were sitting there joking around. We weren't studying very hard, and we were looking at all the girls and laughing. We decided to read the paper. So we read the school paper, and we were both reading the sports section. In the sports section there was a cartoon about this friend of ours, that we knew. We didn't know him too well, but we just knew him to say hello. Anyway this friend was in reality very short and very fat. He was about five feet and he weighed about 200 lbs. But in the cartoon it made him look very handsome and in the caption of the cartoon it showed him in a basketball uniform and his name is Richard Fife. It said under the cartoon Richard Fife is a tall man with the girls. So we saw this cartoon and we really began to laugh because this kid is so ugly. He's not ugly, but he's just short and fat. So we were sitting there laughing about that and we continued reading the paper and watching people walk around. I looked at a photograph and it was supposedly of a basketball game, but all the players had dark uniforms on, and I think it was Purdue, the school that the University of Miami was playing. A few of the players while they were playing basketball, they had footballs in their hands--about three of them. About three more had basketballs. It was just a picture, but it looked like they were playing with these balls. The dream ended when I was looking at these pictures and talking to my friend.
