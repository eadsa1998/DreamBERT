I locked in some of my friends in a barn and then I set fire to the barn and I let them trapped inside to die. But to my surprise they got out and were after me. I was in flight from them. I sure was afraid they would kill me. I was trying to dream what horse was going to win at Cranwood today and I saw PP 7 around the 6th or 7th race at Cranwood. I was almost sure it was race 7.
