[1997-06-18] We were having a bad thunderstorm. The thunder was banging quite loudly, in fact it sounded like an explosion. During the dream I thought that that I had awakened, and to my horror I found that I no longer had a quilt on my bed. My guide dog is afraid of thunder and I thought she had chewed the whole quilt. When I first brought her home from the Guiding Dogs, she had licked a leash and quietly chewed it apart and I thought she had done the same thing to my quilt and would become sick When I awoke for real, I discovered it was thundering and raining.
