We were all this party, and Dad and Mom and I were holding hands with a bunch of other people in their 40s, and we were all kind of marching around the trampoline and singing a variation of one of the songs that we normally wouldn't even sing to. The real song goes, "Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!" And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, "Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done." I can't explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with Mom and we were like at Six Flags or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn't because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and Mom told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing Mom things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn't go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn't even like taking one. So then I was showing Mom the elevator, and she didn't have a key, but she could put $5 in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody's key is - oh, what's the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, "I have never noticed that," and she said, "That's because you're never sick."
