I remember I went to the soccer stadium (South American sport which is practiced in Peru) to watch a game. At the time I went, there were only a few people spread on the stands. We waited for a long time and the game didn't start and, therefore, I decided to go down into the grassy field and watch the stadium from there. The place was calm, though a bit cloudy and dark. I felt a pleasant sensation when I contemplated the architectural spectacle of our national stadium. I turned around several times, without moving from the spot where I was watching it, without going anywhere, until I got tired.
