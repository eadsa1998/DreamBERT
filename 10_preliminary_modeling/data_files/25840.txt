 I hear from my coworker Sean Williams that my bosses Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills are dissatisfied with my work. Mike later asks me numerous questions, which basically concern my efficiency as an employee. He says I slack off, and he has been watching me. I argue back at him, offering explanations for all of his accusations. The man from the Conkle party, customers at Fishing Haven, comes up to us while we're talking. The man likes me. We joke around, he says women like me. He licks my ear with food in his mouth. I get offended, and I punch and beat the man. Mike asks me about drinking alcohol on the job. I honestly deny it. I say to Mike that I am an efficient worker.
