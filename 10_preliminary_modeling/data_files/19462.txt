Second dream had to do with the organization of young black men for athletic purposes (chiefly golf). I questioned one member just outside south entrance of Internal Revenue Bldg., asking him if teams had been organized. While I talked a guard was busy raising a flag -- he went in and out of door a couple of times. The black man tried to answer, but wasn't sure of anything. A bag of golf clubs lay on the ground. Place of interview with second black man not remembered, but same negative results obtained.
