I was walking outdoors, I think along a road or railroad. I was quite depressed and upset about most everything in my life but began specifically thinking about my finances. I recalled a prayer that I had read once and tried to recite as much of it as I could recall. As I did so a very bright light appeared from behind. It was too bright for me to tell what its source was. Along with it was a very, very loud noise - I couldn't even hear myself. It seems that the earth began to shake as well. I became extremely frightened and panicked and started praying as though my life depended on it. I was asking God to protect me or to make whatever this was stop, but I also almost seemed at a loss for words for prayer - or maybe didn't even know what to pray for. I had a feeling that this light was from God. Maybe it was an affirmation of the prayer I was saying earlier about my finances.
