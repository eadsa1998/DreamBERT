 I'm going to an airport with a group of people. There is a tunnel to the airport that we go through. Then we are in a bar in the airport. My friend Jimmy Youngman is there. My friend's older brother, Moe Thurman, asks me if I want a drink. I say okay, then he cards me: he is a bouncer. I am surprised and confused, and say, "What?!" A neighbor kid, Andy Jones, is there. He is really drunk and is shouting racial slurs. My classmate Lance Drift, who is black (while the rest of us are white), tells him to keep quiet. There are a group of "gangsters" that are going to shoot Andy for making the slurs. Lance tries to stop them. Jimmy is drinking straight Vodka and chasing it with beer. He vomits.
