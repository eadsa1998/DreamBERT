I dreamt I was riding in a field on a very sunny day and on a very beautiful snow-white horse, a remarkable horse. In the distance I saw a friend of mine approaching on an ugly, ill-fed, black horse. I invited him to ride with me and suddenly we found ourselves in a very big city, resembling New York, but we were no longer on horseback, but instead in a beautiful red convertible sports car. We went around some very nice places and suddenly we were dancing in a night club. The name of it, "The Bug," was very much impressed on me. Then they woke me up and I didn't dream any more.
