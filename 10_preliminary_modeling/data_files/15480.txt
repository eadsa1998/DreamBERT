I was driving home and went past Kingsway shops and there were police. When I got to the traffic lights, all the power went out and it was pitch black. An ambulance was coming down Hepburn Ave and I figured something was happening there. The lights were out the rest of the way home. Then I was walking and it was dark and spooky. There was a laundromat at the back end of some shops and this guy walked out. He followed me and asked me where I was doing and I said 'just up there'. He seemed dodgy so I started walking the other way towards this female hospital which had lights on. I told him and he was like 'oh, that's clever'. They had a big bus and he had a knife and threatened to kill us all (there were more than 50 people there). We crowded into the bus and he was like 'do you feel safe up high on something that collapse at any second?'. And this girl said 'I know who he is, his last name's McArthur'. He was the son of some guy who had died and a girl had taken his building and left it, but the stuff was old and collapsing. He fought to take it and restore it/knock it down. We got there and we lay on top of these shelves. There were magazines like silk. This lady offered me a collar and lead for a dog which was from some houses I'd applied for.
