I was staying at this hotel and there are all these cougars and panthers there. Then I was at my old house with my friends Tina and Heidi... or people who looked like them. My Dad kept throwing balls up in the air and whoever caught them would get some chocolate. All of a sudden, me and Tina were being chased by Heidi because we wouldn't tell her something. Then my house turned into a big hotel with endless stairs and a lot of chalk painted bodies like what they do when there's deaths. Me and Tina ran up the stairs through elevators which we didn't know where they'd stop. Heidi ran after us. We were escaping, but then we separated and went into a big room with a lot of chalk on the floor. A lot of my friends and a group of black guys went in. Then they all ganged up with me so we could protect each other. Then Heidi came in with a fork and everyone protected me. We talked and she felt better. Then a bunch of black guys started shooting at the other group of black guys. Everyone was killed except for me, my friend Polly and some other guy. We escaped because someone knocked down a gate.
