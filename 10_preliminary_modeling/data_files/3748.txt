I am giving a lecture at a conference which was very successful. Now I am walking across campus to go to another meeting room. I am accompanied by male colleagues and dignitaries. I turn to my right and see a male angel in a green surgical gown and a surgical net hat on who is carrying a bouquet of flowers to bring to me. He is in harness like fliers on stage. I receive the flowers and say, "Thanks." We arrive at the meeting room. I step through the door and stop suddenly. There is a small platform and then a huge room, ill kept, paint peeling, not swept, hardly any chairs. I see some children already seated on the floor and warmly greet them. More are coming in.
