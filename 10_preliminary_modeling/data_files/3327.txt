Another person and I take a shortcut across the lawn. The grass is filled with fallen apples, very pretty. I worry a bit about getting caught, leaving wheel tracks across this beautiful lawn. We go downstairs to make Xerox copies of words and letters, the alphabet and so on from some long document. Then I look on the wall to see where the copies are being kept. I find the right hole and take out the copies to examine them, wanting to make sure that when I put in the letter "c," I also go the capital version as well. I did. There is something about time travel and magic.
