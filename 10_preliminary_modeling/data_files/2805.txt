I'm going to meet Fox for a bit of lovely flying venture. I go flying, but he's not there. I circle and spiral and fly and float. It's very beautiful and I miss Fox being there. I notice a fish and air bubbles and think I've landed in an ocean and am swimming. Then I'm alone in the air again. Then I hear an airplane and realize I could crash into them. One comes through a brown, thick cloud wall and I narrowly escape a collision. I then dive for earth and land. I see Fox and he's coming to me with a girl and I realize that girl is me, in a younger time. Her hair is brown, mine is blonde. Fox can see me, but she can't. The three of us shower together. I wash her back and Fox says, "Easy. Don't hurt her." I guess I was a bit jealous. I lovingly wash his back.
