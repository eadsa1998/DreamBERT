Grandma had a little baby in her lap. She squeezed its nose and it would wiggle its nose. I squeezed it a little and said, "Don't squeeze it like that." I was way up north. I saw a string of pistols, rocket guns also for protection of our border. Dick Tracy went to sleep. I gave him a bell to swallow. He did and when he moved, the bell would ring. I saw a long fence that was lying down on the ground. It was old and dilapidated. Some boys built a fire near new homes and we bawled them out.
