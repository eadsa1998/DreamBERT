 I'm in a swimming pool with others. I'm masturbating. I lie down in six to eight inches of water. I stop masturbating and fall asleep. I awake later and everyone is gone. The lights are off and the pool is empty. I have been left behind. There is a shower knob. I reach for it, but my hand goes through it. I'm not really in the place that I am seeing.
