I'm in (my?) apartment, upstairs, at the end of a walkway with an open railing - either I'm just moving in or out, or we're doing a big spring cleaning - me and my roommate. The door is standing open, it's nice outside, bright sunshine. I step out the door briefly and see two guys at the end of the walkway, facing away from me - one's leaning on the rail, but one's got Alleycat in a jar - it's a great big round jar with a huge mouth, and he had just crawled in there out of curiosity, as cats do. (I may have put the cork in myself - playing with him.) I don't know how this guy got Alleycat, but I'm scared and worried - I know (somehow) that they're bad guys, and they're planning to break in here and rob us. I could just close the door - I duck back inside - but I've got to be careful of Alleycat. I don't want him to get hurt. Actually it might be okay if he just dropped the jar - it would probably break, and then Alleycat could run off - but that would be a gamble, and he might get hurt. I'd better get the bad guy to put him down. I'm not sure what I should do, but I've got to do something; I'm angry, too, and I want to fight... I do something to attract their attention, and they come in after us. [I think my roommate has been inside the whole time and is acting with me.] I grab a stick - a broomstick maybe, about that size, and start fighting with the one that had Alleycat. [I don't know what's happened to him.] I try to swing at him, but it seems like I'm just not hitting very hard - I'm not making much of a dent (no pun intended). I'm getting frustrated and feeling a little desperate. Why can't I do anything here? I really want to at least hold my own, but I seem to be too weak.
