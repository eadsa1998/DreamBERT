Checked into a by-the-hour motel with the Hoffman sisters, whom I know as friends. The guy at the counter was busy, so he really didn't care about keeping track of the time. "Just get out by tomorrow," he said. I checked the place out, but Katrina Hoffman was tired and crashed on the sheets, which I warned were probably not clean. Rebecca Hoffman was being flirty, even though I was seeing her sister. A voice came on telling me my mud turtle buried itself in the mud under a rock and probably died. I was in denial, because the turtle burrowed under there itself and turtles can live in hibernation for months. When I lifted the rock in the muddy enclosure to find out, lots of other bright-eyed geckos and other animals came out, in addition to my gecko.
