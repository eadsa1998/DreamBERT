More dreams. I was in a chair. 2 chair carriers, "Curly" and "Nigel" carried me to my new place of residence. They were warm and understanding. I was at the University. The administrator had chosen my new place. They carried me several narrow flights of stairs down to a basement. A door opened on my new room. It was fitted with MR's, CP's, and "Cripples." I asked the name of the residence hall. They said it was the "Handicapped and Cripples Home." I refused to go in. I said, "I've got a brace and a limp, but I won't be shoved away like they are." I insisted they take me to the administrator. He was terribly busy. I persisted. Curly and Nigel brought student support people. I demanded to be heard. I said, "It's not right. Some of these people can't get out of there into the sunshine."
