I was on the top of a mountain top looking down at every little thing there was to see from up high. There was someone there with me who just appeared. She was dressed in a long flowing white gown and had a bright light shining around her. She looked at me and smiled. She stood around for a while then floated off into the air. I stood and watched her as she hovered like a bee. She started flowing down. She got a little lower and looked at me. She smiled at me. I smiled back and walked over the edge. I was floating with her. Flying around and over the green below us and having fun.
