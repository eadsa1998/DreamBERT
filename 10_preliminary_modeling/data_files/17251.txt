I was going to some ocean place with Shawn, the annoying boy from 7th grade who scratched my watch.  I don't fully remember, but something went wrong, and we were wading waist deep in water by a rocky cliff.  We needed green stickers to board the plane to get back home.  Mine drifted off in the waves, and I had to trust Shawn to let me use one of his.  When it came down to it, important, I could trust him.
