I was standing in front of the librarian's desk in the hall of T-- Library. I had filled out the necessary slips for journals I needed to use in order to get information for a term paper. I handed her one slip after another; each time, she handed the slip back after looking on some shelves or in some card file with the report that that journal was in use or couldn't be located. I gave her about 12 slips in all. I felt like crying. I turned away from the desk in utter despair, all choked up.
