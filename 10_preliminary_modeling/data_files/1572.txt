I am in a car made for one person. It is very tiny. It has an umbrella-like roof to put on to protect form the rain. I get in it and zip up the roof. I cautiously move out into traffic and make for the right lane. I realize if I'm the only small car like this, others will probably not see me and run over me. I create more little cars like me so that people are more on the alert. I go pretty slow at first and then speed up. I fly over the cars going slower than me. Once I think that I'd better look back and see if anyone's flying over me first so there won't be a crash.
