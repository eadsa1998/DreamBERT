Someone takes us up a mountain and it is very steep. It's a ski race. It goes very, very fast. I see the best young skier I know do it first. First you go down an escalator. That gives you speed. Then you're propelled onto the course and it is extremely icy. I decide not to do it. My son and daughter are there. I see somebody jump and fly in free-fall, with somebody else. They keep on falling. It is very high. I decide to walk down together with the ski instructor. We walk down the stairs and get to the bottom station. A lot of people. I want to walk back up and say good-bye. I walk back up because I still have my jacket up there. The stairs are very old and they begin to collapse and I try to go farther up and then the whole wall falls down. It's all rotten wood and it falls out to the side. I go to the person at the ticket counter and say, "The wall just fell down." He says, "All at your own risk. No refunds." I say, "No, that's not what I mean. I want to say that the wall fell down." He says, "Okay, we'll paper it up." Before this we'd had a discussion if I had to pay now that the wall fell down. I say, "No, it's an international principle of law. They should be happy that I'm not suing them. It's not my responsibility that it's all rotten." And then I see my daughter in the long line of people that weaves through the bottom station. She is going to go up again and get my coat. Then she'll come down with it.
