Uncle Gabriel had made this big garden. There were coins and he had made a garden from a coin. We were somewhere with this family. The father looked like John Schneider. He had a lump on his leg and it was shaped like a shark head. The mother wanted a photo of the family in the pool. The father was going to show me some 80's thing which had something to do with the coins. The house looked like Mom's house and Mom was there too. Ezra was listening to Johnny Get Angry on the XBOX 360 and was dancing.
