I was at this university with halls and a park-like outdoors. In my dream I had a dream I saw my boyfriend kiss another girl and I was really upset. So I wanted to find him to go tell him about it. There was some festival going on and everyone was dressed up in costumes and others in picnic type clothes. I was looking through the crowd for my boyfriend and I saw him holding another girl's hands (one of his friends). I waved but they didn't see. I was still angry. I followed them through the crowd and lost them. , but I ended up outside in an amphitheater of some kind with shows and carnival rides below. I saw him sitting on the benches of the amphitheater next to all his friends. He was ignoring me, or didn't notice, and his friend was sitting on his lap. I was mad and told her to "get off my boyfriends lap!" She looked embarrassed but he didn't seem to care. The girl and I ended up going on a carnival ride, where you sit in a chair (2 people) and you fly around a center structure. We talked and I told her I didn't like that she was so physically close to my boyfriend and that I thought it was inappropriate. I was nice to her but when I woke up in real life I was still very upset and jealous.
