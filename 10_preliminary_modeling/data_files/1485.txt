I am a teacher. One of my high school students likes me and cuddles up, trying to persuade me to also be romantic with him. I smile and decline. I then am in a car. I see the bad guys on their property and sneak in. I see kids on drugs. I escape to my house. A detective partner of mine shows up. I look for my message written on a bulletin board-like thing.
