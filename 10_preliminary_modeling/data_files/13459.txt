I was at Nana's. I was typing up my dreams and Dad said I had three days to finish because of a deadline. He had recently sold his camera and other stuff (he was buying stuff and returning it). Then we were all chasing after this baby. People were holding it and we had to get it back. Micah (Heroes) got it and was running. He was on the good side. I ran after him to make sure no-one got it. I saw Theodore standing around and I asked him if he was good or bad. Micah was really fast. Ali Larter was there too. Micah through the baby to the main good people and they put it in this barn. I was thinking it wasn't real. Nana pointed out a plane in the sky which was going down and was surrounded with black smoke. Then she said that Ezra was upset and was having the day off school. Ezra was with us later and he explained why he wasn't going to school.
