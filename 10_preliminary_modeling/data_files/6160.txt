I was on the first floor of the big bookstore. I looked on huge shelves and had a strong feeling. Then I took one book out and was trying to look what it was about but I could not. Something, some kind of force, stopped me from doing that. Then, I turned my head and looked to the right. There was my mother holding my little brother. They were looking through some books and it seemed that they were trying to find a particular one. At first I couldn't move, then I managed to get closer to them and offered my help. They said that it was not necesary that I better go and do what I had to. And I knew. I had to do something, something in the air was telling me about that. But, I don't know why. I didn't do anything. I just could not, something was holding me and I couldn't break [illegible].
