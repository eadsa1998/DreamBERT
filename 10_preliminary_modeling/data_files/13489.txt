John Lennon was alive and we were friends. Only a few people knew that he was alive. Someone got suspicious and we had to get this lady to say something to get rid of them. Someone said "I thought you had a bee sting" (the wrong answer would have revealed that John was alive) and she said "Oh yeah, a bee stung me and I fell backwards into some honey" and I said "Oh yeah, that was funny". There was this messy place that people were turning into a shop.
