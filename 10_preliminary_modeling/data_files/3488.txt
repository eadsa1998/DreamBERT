Nightmare. I have red, white and blue poker chips and these black men are trying to take them from me. I run away and dive in the river. I swim just to the left of the other woman captive, only I am just under the surface of the water. I know it is a good, safe spot for me. They are looking for me. They will rape and hurt me if they find me, and take away my poker chips.
