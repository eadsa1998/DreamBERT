There was a picture of Dan Aykroyd in Ghostbusters and he was really young, but it wasn't actually him. I had a different car. I was driving and had a bad accident. I got out of my car and was dizzy etc. Mom called this person to get help and they asked what kind of car I had and Mom made a joke while explaining to them, that I had gotten the car that was more like a 'work car' model which was less safe, but didn't look as lame. They started joking and chatting with her. I was trying to take photos of the accident.
