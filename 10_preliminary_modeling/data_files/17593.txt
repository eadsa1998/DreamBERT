I dreamt of a sequence of events leading to my being with my boyfriend Jeremy.  When we couldn't go to a dance together, I tried going back and doing things over.  Then I met him at about age 15, but he didn't come in; some other tough guy did.  It felt strange.  This would be my future, but I remembered Jeremy and wanted that.
