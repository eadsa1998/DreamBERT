I don't remember the order, really.  I went into my maternal Grandma Jane's house with an old man- the president.  He was having medical problems.  We laid him out on the dining room table.  I don't know what they were doing but they asked for my help.  They told me to 'pop' it.  I wasn't looking, but was afraid they wanted me to pull off my own fingernail with tweezers- and I almost did.  We fixed whatever the problem was.  Then I was with my Tuvan teacher Jim Hale.  He'd left a little note on the table.  Twice as tall as me, he walked next to me.  We looked at all the stuff in my closet, Legos, and everything.  We were talking I guess about what I like to do.  Later on I found a violin sitting where the last note had been.  It came with a little card saying where Jim had gotten it.  So generous!  Then I saw him again, visiting us.  I showed the note about the violin to my mother and brother Stuart.  Jim made a topiary elephant standing on its trunk, with Christmas lights on our front porch.  Then he said he was going to out of state.  I felt sad because that meant he wouldn't really be playing in his band anymore, but at least maybe my good online friend Del could see him.  He left, and then I saw that he had many yahoo screen names that I could add to my buddy list.
