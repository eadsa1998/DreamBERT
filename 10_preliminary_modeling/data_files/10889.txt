I was talking on the telephone to the father of an old friend of mine (boy, 21 years old). We were discussing the party the Saturday night before to which I had invited his son as a guest. I asked him if his son had a good time at the party. He told me not to tell his son that he had told me, but that he had had a good time, except he was a little surprised that I had acted the way I did.
