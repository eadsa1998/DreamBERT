I was working on making a ball for Gary and Jen who were going to go away on a long boat ride. I cut out a circular piece of cardboard and glued a piece of green paper on it. It was going to have to stay dry though so I was going to fold it into a plastic bag. I went on to the boat and decided to take the trip with them. The ship was huge and as we were going out, Jen and I hung off the front of the boat. The water was super calm and almost looked dusty. There was a dusty film on top. We were holding onto the boat without any effort whatsoever. Our feet were resting on the water as if it was a floor. I looked ahead and saw a wave. The boat went up with the wave and then down and my legs got wet underwater. The waves got bigger and bigger - then absolutely huge. As one wave crashed into the boat I was underwater for a few seconds. <br/
