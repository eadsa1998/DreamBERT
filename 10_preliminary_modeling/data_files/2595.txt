I am looking at an ornate picture that Paulina has drawn. I say to Kenneth, "Look at this. There is something sweet about her drawing," (ability). Then I see she is tracing pictures. I look again at her pictures and reassure myself there is still some original creativity there because after she traces the form, she adds her own work inside it. I see the outline of a woman and a crude, but compelling face like my drawing in art class. I see another drawing of "Rose," a woman who looks like me, that Rochelle drew. Someone says, "Look, it looks like you in the face." Rochelle must have been thinking of me when she did it, perhaps unconsciously. I want to hold "Rose" and meditate for answers to what I'm doing to myself. I do so and I see a rolling muddy river with sticks in it. I laugh because I realize the symbols mean "she is beating herself up." The sticks then turn to turmoil and I know this means, "She is being shitty to herself, the trend."
