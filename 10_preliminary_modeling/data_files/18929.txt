I dreamed I was taking one of George Raff's tests in the histology lab at school (his subject, anatomy, has been over since January). I was writing the answers in a blue test booklet. There was one strange question that had two glass encased pictures with frames. One was filled with carbon dioxide and the other with air. The questions under these pictures were obscure. As I worked through the test I omitted one section which I returned to at the end of the exam. When I reviewed the question, I felt that I knew the answer, but I couldn't think because the class was making too much noise. I left the classroom and went into a room by myself that had one desk in it, and a lot of drapery covering the walls. I finished the test here and turned it in to Dr. Paff.
