All night long, Jared is drunk and talking in his incoherent, mumbly monotone. Finally, I have enough and I tell him off. I call him a boring bastard. Then I notice a baby girl standing inside a flaming fireplace. I go to her and say sympathetically, "You must be very hot and uncomfortable." She agrees. I pick her up and hold her, taking her away from the fire.
