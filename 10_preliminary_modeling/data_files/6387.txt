Heather and I were in the kitchen. She was sitting on the counter, speaking in Spanish. I tried to talk to her, but all that would come out was French. She jumped down and put her arms around me and kissed me, but we couldn't communicate. No matter how hard we tried, neither of us could understand what the other was saying, and for some reason, neither of us could force our lips to make English words.
