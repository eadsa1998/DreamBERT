It was about a book called "Troubling a Star." A girl was on an iceberg all alone in the sea. I was watching her, and I could see her doing the stuff she did in the book, but I couldn't talk to her. She was in Antarctica, and it seemed like she was protected by a layer of something clear. She was the way she was in the cover pictures. Setting: (On an iceberg.) Characters: (The girl in the book.) Feelings and Thoughts: (Not filled out.)
