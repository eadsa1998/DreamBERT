Dream then seemed to revert to near station, where I was driving my horse past where Marv was parked. Looked over towards his buggy or car, which ever it was. The horse had some association with the Hemways -- probably came from their farms. I was going someplace with 3 packages very insecurely wrapped in newspapers -- string hung loose. There were 2 larger, square, flat packages, and a smaller, oblong thicker package. I am kept busy tucking the paper wrapping back into place. Enter an elevator with the packages. 6 or 7 people get on elevator ahead of me. I am nearly trapped by the closing elevator door.
