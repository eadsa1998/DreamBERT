I am supposed to either wait for someone I wanted to see or go with Joe and Uncle Jack.  I do the latter.  Joe drives their old Plymouth.  We stop at a filling station and get gas.  On the way back we pass Benjamin Franklin School.  I had to drop someone off there, I think.  The door to the boys' dressing room is open and we see a rack of white sport coats.  Some boys are putting them on.  All are required to wear them.
