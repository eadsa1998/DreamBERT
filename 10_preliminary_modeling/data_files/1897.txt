I am walking through the halls of a school. A young girl (5th or 6th grade) really admires me and says, "I'll come to your office with you." I don't say anything, but I really don't want her with me. I want to be alone. She follows along behind me, very enthusiastic. I see Arvonne sleeping in the hall. She's wearing leathers and has a punk hair style. She lazily opens her eyes half way. I smile and signal hello. She smiles in recognition. I go upstairs. I look ahead and I see Arvonne standing in the hall. I point to my student and mouth to Arvonne, "Here is my student."
