I dreamt I was in a fancy Italian restaurant with my mother and maternal Grandma Jane.  Where we were sitting actually looked like the middle of a shoe aisle in a store.  I looked at the menu trying to find something vegetarian and appealing, but I didn't know what most of it was.  There were some Mexican items.  There was no waiter; my mother and Grandma Jane walked back to where the cooks were and ordered.  I sat there pondering what to get.  Then I was moving to my friend Deanna's apartment complex.  It seemed like the room we were unloading things into was a temporary.  I had a view of the pool and lowered the ladder (like from an attic).  It didn't go down all the way, and I was stuck in the middle of the pool on a pillar.  There was a sign that said the pool was for singers only, like for choir trips.  I was jealous.  There were two waterslides in the pool.  I had to get out somehow, so jumped into the water.  It was cold and had no chlorine- you're supposed to shower before getting in.  I called Deanna over to let her know I was in her complex.  She pulled the ladder down the rest of the way and we had to put all my stuffed animals and some peanut butter back into my room.  Some time later we were in the garage, which still looked out toward the pool- this time it was full of playing kids.  There was a gas buildup somewhere in the pipes, and eventually there was an explosion.
