I was at school in this underground area near the canteen (which was bigger). There was a desk thing and Eugene and two others were on there. I sat down another time. I had to sit behind Eugene and someone. I went into the office, which was different, and I had my iPod and Shake It was playing. There was a book with records of all the students and the guy had the page open to Eugene. He had done well in something and got 99.8 in it. I had biology and I saw Evelyn and said hello and asked what she had [talked to her for the first time since May yesterday].
