There are a bunch of tiny burros and we try to ride them. If we stay on long enough, we win a prize. The prize is permission to make love to a person of our choice, if they agree. Several men try to ride and don't make it. I manage to hang on and win. I am given a small container with birth control stuff in it. I like this one man and am shy and want to ask him, but am afraid to. I am on a bed area that belongs to my parents. Then I put a small kitten in a car where his puppy already is. I roll up the windows, being careful to position the special breathing section correctly so they can't hop out, but have holes in the glass for air to come in. I check all the windows and am closing the back trunk one when a man in a black car comes by. He wants me to go with him, but I don't. I get into the driver's seat of the car with the animals. I try to lock the door and have trouble. I try three times and get it firmly shut. I turn the key on. The gearshift is funny-looking, thick and angular. I've never driven before and am nervous. I go out into the street very carefully and slow. In the center of this dream was a part where I choose another man to make love to and get into a cubicle and we start to thump and bump when the man of my real choice is upset and tries to figure out a way to intervene. He does interrupt, maybe making a noise or sending someone in or slamming a door. I come out before the thing has gone to orgasm.
