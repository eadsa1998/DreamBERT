I apply for a sheriff's scholarship and I take a picture and in the cutline under the picture it says "surprisingly no frights occurred among kids or dogs." There are lots of kids and dogs in the picture. An older boy who had once tried to molest me when I was in my pre-teens is after me for something. He sends a man to the house with a chain saw threatening me. I call the cops and tell the operator to secretly send the police. I have a pet beaver and it is very loving. I am not allergic to it. I think maybe its fur is always wet and that is why I am not allergic to it. The beaver comes into the house often. The house is in the town where I grew up.
