I wait up in my house for Father Andrew, Marissa and Nevena (their daughter) to come over; they do not come, but lots of other people do; much confusion and children. In a new house, big room with blue drapes and couches. Outside there is snow. Father Andrew comes in, uninvited and he eats dinner with us. He admires a painting on the wall, of my cooking sukiyaki. It is like a dream. He is very friendly and jovial. I hold out butter for his slice of bread. Bright warm sunshine. Warm good feeling. Like a light turned on. Love.
