I am in some radio station sitting on bleacher style seats with other people. A man sits on my left and tries to sit too close to me. I feel uncomfortable. Lots of activities going on, people talking and so on. I need to have a piece of paper signed. I walk up some stairs to a room. I see a desk with drawers and open them. I decide to take and keep some of the things in there. I figure its OK because no one seems to be there that owns them. I go to another room and try to talk with some very busy people to get them to sign my paper. They hardly have a moment to even listen. I finally get one man to sign it. I return to the radio station. I can hear the broadcast. I find my desk and open a drawer, the middle one. Some teen kids are in trouble and I want to help them. I see lots of wedges of red cabbage and forks, knives and spoons. I worry I will not be able to eat all that cabbage and it will spoil. I feel guilty about taking the forks and so on. I decide to take some back to where I got it. I find a plastic sack with cards I had bought. I am upset with myself I had bought them. A waste of money, I do that too often. I am mad at myself. I pack up the utensils to take back, keeping a few for my own use.
