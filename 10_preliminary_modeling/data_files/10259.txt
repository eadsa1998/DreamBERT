I decide to go to the I CHING workshop and miss my Bible study with regret; it is 9:30 and it was to begin at 9 am; confusion;. I drive with some people from the Jung Assn. in bright sunshine and when we get to the workshop they are all sitting on the terrace eating lunch; small talk and someone runs round and round in circles.
