We (my family) were driving on the freeway in the middle of the night. My dad turned on the radio and this weird guy was telling people to call in and tell him any song from 1942, and he would play it. This lady called and said a song, but it wasn't from 1942. Then this man called and they played his song. I got mad at my dad, because he always plays weird music. Setting: In my car when it was on the freeway at night. Characters: Me, my dad, the person on the radio, the man who called, the woman who called. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry. I was sleeping. (The) alarm went off (the radio turns on). It was playing what was in my dream.
