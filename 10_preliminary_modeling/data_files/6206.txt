I was walking across the street and the light turned green. There was a car behind me that started to move and it hit me. It started to push me across the street. I was standing while being pushed and I could see the driver. It was an older woman with short dark hair and glasses. When I jumped away from the car I ran up to the lady's door and I started to yell at her. She drove away but kept looking back. Then she smashed into a parked car. The last thing I could remember was that I was running away from the car, after she hit.
