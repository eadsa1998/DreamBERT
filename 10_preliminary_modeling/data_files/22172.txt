Last night I had a terrible nightmare. I dreamt I was at home, standing in front of the refrigerator, and on top of it was a cat which then jumped on me and disfigured my face. This scene was repeated a number of times and each time that the cat disfigured me, I awoke and when I fell asleep again, I would keep dreaming the same thing.
