 I'm at Carter School near the southeast door where the equipment room is. There is a photograph I have seen of four prom couples. I'm not attracted to any of the women in the photograph. The women in the photograph may show up and look much better in real life! I have a business card stuck below my lower lip. I think my third grade teacher Liza Minikel may be there. I leave to deliver something. My grade school friends Jerry Kasper and Patrick Bergman are there. My mom's station wagon is parked by the bowling alley. We go by there. There may be others with us that go in or near the bowling alley. We may be delivering a pizza.
