It was early morning and I was disturbed too son in my sleep. (fact) but that I'd straighten up a bit and go back to bed. Place embroidered pillow on a small trunk near door, undo packages. Furniture near door disarranged on account of bringing in new bookcase. Finally finish and return to bed but first look at time 9:45. That will be too late for breakfast so might sleep some more. Start to lie down. One of the men had not gone and he stretches out on bed by me and closes his eyes. I am startled and ask what he is doing here, tell him to dress and get out. He makes love to me but I struggle and make him leave, emphatically expressing my opinion. Men from rooms on our hall (Dr. I a red haired thin man and Capt. C.) offer their services if he troubles me again. A girl with the red haired man explains who he is. I wonder how they knew. Then I'm outdoors and the man joins me again saying, "I never thought much about religion until I saw you this morning. May I come and talk about it with you?" I see it's almost 10:30 and say, "Why don't you go to church as I am going then?" thinking he will want to go too. He continues walking besides me and hints his real desire is to make love. I grab his shoulder and turn him around and tell him to first show me his trustworthiness. A lot of women see, understand and talk it over. One says that I will be the center of discussion. Another tells me he got zero in Boy Scout score. Mrs. C. tells of his attempts on children. Mrs. Mc. calls Betty to warn her of him. I yearn after him all the same and get sick about it. Rush to their toilet to spit up clots of blood etc.
