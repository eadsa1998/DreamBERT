I'm with Ginny. She's driving. I comment that I recognize the road. It's a dirt trail uphill. We are going to a person's house to buy something for the child. I have to walk up the front steps. A woman takes us in to show us around. I see a window and look. I see a family at leisure down in the family room. I go down there. I notice a lovely babbling brook going through the room and comment on it. She is pleased as it is unique and beautiful. She takes me to another building to see the clothes. As I enter, I see it's a restaurant. It's a surprise party for "Kathy" who isn't there, one of the family members but I don't remember which one. I keep asking where's Kathy. No one really knows. I eat chocolate chip cookies that are mushy and undercooked. I leave to go find the university. I see one across the street. I walk uphill and go in a building. I see Jerome. I ask a man the name of the university. He smiles and says, "Yale." I am surprised and impressed. "Yale," I said. It's not the university I was looking for.
