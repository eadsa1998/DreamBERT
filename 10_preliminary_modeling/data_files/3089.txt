Ellie and I are using someone's apartment to receive important mail, but without their permission. Ellie hired a taxi driver to park and wait for us, then she put on a fake gray beard, a long one, and went up to get the mail (like Social Security checks or something). She comes out and she pays the taxi driver who held the parking spot for her. The next time, we go up together. We are in the apartment when unexpectedly the family returns. We are embarrassed and worried and try to leave as quickly as we can. They don't seem to care or notice anything is unusual about strangers being in their apartment. We leave quickly before they figure it out. I go to an elevator, and Ellie says they are only displays. They don't really work. They are like snack vending machines. Now we have to go down the stairs and there are 66 flights of stairs. We start going down. It's a long and difficult walk.
