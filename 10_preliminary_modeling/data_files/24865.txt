I was in the war hospital running around trying to take care of patients, but I was running out of time or something. Then some other nurses came (Lt. Bfjik, and General Camand) and told me to take a break. The weird thing was that I knew that I was the one running around, caring for patients, but I didn't look like myself at all. The two nurses were my friends, Nina and Hilary, but they didn't look how they look now, either! Setting: In a war hospital, somewhere in Asia, I think. Characters: There were two other nurses, Lt. Bfjik and General Camand. They were my friends Nina and Hilary, but they didn't look like them. There were also tons of war patients I didn't know, too. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, frantic. I thought it was weird because the night before I had this dream, I was reading a book about a nurse stationed in Vietnam. It was a strange dream.
