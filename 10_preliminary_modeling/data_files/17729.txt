I was with a girl, shopping in England.  It was interesting to watch her try on clothes because she would try to hide in the corner- apparently, England did not have any fitting rooms.  I saw my high school classmate Raya at some point.  Finally I decided to try on something- a white shirt with blue skirt and a black flowered coat.  I took it into a closet/bathroom and changed in a grey tub, which someone later told me was a urinal.  The outfit didn't work and I continued to follow the other girl around.
