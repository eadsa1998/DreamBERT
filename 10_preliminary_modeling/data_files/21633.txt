I was working at White's in the flats. I saw Mox Harter (deceased) helping to loosen up some sharps. They were moving them out again. I then helped to take some apart. Andy Palander put some boxes on top of loaded freight cars. I looked at them and said, "You have them stacked too high. They will fall off the cars when the freight starts rolling." Then my brother Steve and I were lying on top of a freight car and it was running fast. We had a sheet and were hanging onto it. I was nervous because I was afraid we would fall off. Then we were off. A lady dressed in a G string and a bobby cover was standing off aways and she was showing us her body sex organs. She put her hand by the G string and pulled it apart so we could see a bit of her vagina. The women that were with us said, "What a filthy woman." Then she was coming towards our cottage and the women were in front of the door. She gave them a piece of ice about 12 by 6. They took the ice and didn't want the woman to come in. We took a bird out. He was blue. I let him go as a wild bird. The male bluebirds were after her and she was a little afraid. I climbed up to get her, but she moved to where I couldn't see her. Later I found out someone shot her. I bawled out some man for it. I was walking over big piles of socks that salesmen had piled on the ground. I followed Carter up a steep road and went to the top which went over and steep down on the other side. I didn't go over the top. We went to see some army maneuvers. We watched the soldiers shoot down decoy planes. I went into a clothes closet and I looked for my pants. I found a pair like mine, but when I put them next to mine, they matched, but were bright new colored, not faded like the ones I have. I looked thru a window where I thought someone was holding my brother Steve. I saw a man on the bed, but it wasn't Steve because he saw me and didn't wave at me. I looked inside and saw respeak, kind of blurred, but I made it out as respeak.
