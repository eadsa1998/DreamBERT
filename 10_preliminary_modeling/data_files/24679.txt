I was trying to find someone. I was walking down the halls in a hospital, when out of the blue I saw supermas (sic?) walk out of one of the door(s) for the sick people. We started talking and I asked him why he was here. Then when we had finished talking, I got scared of him and I started to run. (There were tons of people on the streets. I didn't know any one of them. By the end of my dream, all of them looked scary.) He chased me. Then he started to be the bad guy and I started to be the good guy. Then he started to spread his wings. He finally caught (me) (and) took me away. Then I woke up. Setting: In the hospital halls and on the city streets. These streets for some reason scared me. Characters: People. There were tons of people I don't know in my dream, and superman. Feelings and Thoughts: Sad, scared, worried. I was sad at the beginning because I missed my family. Then I was scared and worried when I was running away from superman and the people on the street.
