I was at a petrol station filling up my car. It leaked a bit and I said to someone nearby "I've only been driving alone for a while". Elijah was behind me and he said that he had just got his P plates. My car had a retractable roof. I got in and got onto Newtown Drive. Later I was doing sport at University. Ezra was there and I noticed that his hair was short. Eugene was there too. This Asian guy was with Mom and they threw a rock and the Asian broke his hand. Everyone left. I let him in and tried to work out a way to take him to the hospital.
