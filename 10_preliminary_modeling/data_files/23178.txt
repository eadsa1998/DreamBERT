I was lying in bed in a school when I remembered that I had invited Carl Scheibe to come and speak to my class.  I quickly got up and went to my classroom, where I found him already speaking to the class.  Most of the class seemed to be Chinese.  I was embarrassed about being late, but glad to see he had taken over without me.  I lay down in another bed which was in the classroom, my eyes heavy with sleep.  After a few minutes I realized that it was horribly inappropriate for me to be in bed half asleep while he conducted the class.  I started to get up, and realized that I was wearing only boxer shorts and a short t-shirt.  I didn't know whether it was worse to stay in bed, to get up in front of the class dressed that way, or to leave again to go get something else to put on, thus calling attention to the way I was dressed..  I was just anxious for the class to end.  When he was finished with his presentation, I hoped that the class would ask him questions to fill up the rest of the time.  It was 10:10, and the class ended at 10:20.  There were a couple of questions, but they didn't fill up the time, and I worried about what to do, since I had nothing prepared, and I didn't know what he had been talking about.  I wondered if it was all right to let them go 5 minutes early.  I didn't think so, since it was a public school about high school or junior high level, not college.  When he ended, though, he was talking about a ramshackle house which was in the classroom-something about its history.  Desperately trying to find something to fill the time, I looked in and saw a cloth clothespin bag on the end of a pole.  I took it out and asked the students if they knew what it was for.
