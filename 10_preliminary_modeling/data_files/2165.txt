I'm in a foreign country, Jamaica or India, and I hear a man say, "Oh Dear! This is terrible. I saw a sign and now I must go home and tell my wife and she must kill herself and then I won't get any dinner." I laugh at his odd religion. I am meeting an older woman friend and I have a gift for her. She has a man she wants to introduce to me. He follows along behind us. I am all involved in getting the gift from the sack I'm carrying and pay no attention. He's attracted and watches me. It's sort of like we're both destined to meet and have relationship but we haven't noticed each other yet. I go to the library, walking through the streets thinking, "I can write a story about a country I've never been in! I can do it." I go in the library to reserve a room to do my research. The librarian leaves, is busy. I call up and reserve a room for Sunday, very pleased with myself because the librarian said there weren't any available. I start to write it into her reservation book and realize I'll get in trouble, so I wait until she returns and fess up to using her phone, etc. She asks me what I called and I realize I'd called a library in another city (New York maybe), so I'm out of luck. I feel very frustrated and defeated. The man is leaving a group of his friends and is about to enter the room I'm in and we will meet.
