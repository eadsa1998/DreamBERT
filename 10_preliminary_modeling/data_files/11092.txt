I was at home and looking out of the window at the street. Suddenly I spotted my dog lying out in the street several houses down. Evidently he had been killed by a car. But he was in four sections. I was horrified and quite broken up about it. Also I didn't know how to tell my sister as I had to tell her several years ago of the death of another dog of ours. While I was pondering on this, a dog that looked just like ours walked in. But I was sure that it wasn't ours. The remainder of the dream was concerned with trying to decide whether or not the dog that was alive or the dead one on the street was ours as they both looked alike.
