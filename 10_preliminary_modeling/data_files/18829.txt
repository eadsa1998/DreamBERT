I dreamt I was skydiving (parachuting). I jumped out of the plane and my legs got caught in the lines. I was fighting it and got my main chute partially opened. There were other jumpers all around shouting at me. I couldn't hear what they were saying. That's where the dream ended.  I felt afraid and excited.
