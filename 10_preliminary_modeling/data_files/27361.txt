I dreamed that my home was a huge mansion, composed of five floors. My room was on the third floor, and was very small. I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago. I was very jealous of my sister's room, and I thought it was horribly unfair of my mother not to let me have the room. I thought she should let us alternate using the room. This much is all I can remember.
