I have a new sports car and keep it in a garage where apparently I told the owner he could borrow it. Arrive at garage one morning and note the owner's mechanics are testing it with all kinds of modern equipment. I realize ruefully that he would probably never have done that for me, but is doing it since he intends to borrow it. However, I drive the car out and am heading toward a traffic light when two trucks roar by me, one on each side, and the one on the left cuts over in front of me. I am incensed at their beating me to the light and I wish they were not there. As I do so, they both start to roll backward to another traffic light and I arrive at the second light and am happy I am in front and they are back and waiting at the previous light. As I am waiting alone at the second light for it to change, all of a sudden the concrete highway under me begins to move backwards and under me like a treadmill and I say, "Oh! they're changing the road again," as though this was a normal everyday thing.
