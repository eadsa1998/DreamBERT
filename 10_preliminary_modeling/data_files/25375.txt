 I'm carrying a colorful tent uphill, following my friend Jack Thigpen. It is winter. There is a clamp for a battery lying on the ground. It has broken off something. I pick it up. We go into a big, spacious room with a high ceiling. It is a dreamy room. There is big bed in the room. My sister Heather is in the bed. Upon seeing us she reacts in her characteristic negative way to something about us arriving. I hug her. She reacts negatively again.
