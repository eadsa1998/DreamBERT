I have been asleep and have to dress to go somewhere. I walk along the hall and can only stagger as the walls seem to move in a very rough sea. I fall once, but I know it's only because I'm sleepy. Something has passed that's not clear. I turn back the leaves of the book to read it again to get the thought. She would be impressed by the diatribe her father is giving. I am in a garden. We start down a path. Eu ( a nephew) is standing about level with my shoulder on muddy bank near deep path. He is about to jump. I ask him if I shall help him to jump down slowly and start to do so. He becomes frightened, flies into a tantrum and seizes my chin into his mouth biting. I tell him I won't make him jump if he'll only let go. As I'm waking I think "Oh, I've been asleep that's why Eu. seemed so small."
