We were at the Gold Coast. Dad and I were at this space thing where you jump through this thing (like that thing that guy walks through when he is leaving Magneto's room in X2) to get into the room. It broke after I went through. Some guy came and fixed it. In the proper room, there were pictures of planets everywhere. I said I wanted to pay attention because we were learning about them at school. There was a room with chairs. There was a game where you pick a room number and you have to find the right chair. Shannon from Lost was there and she was a lesbian. The next day at school there was an excursion to the Great Escape, then we were going bowling with Mr Gutenberg and he had kittens.
