I am choosing a gift for my "grandma." I carry lots of packages up to her room. She is a young woman and she's not feeling well. She's grumpy. She gets up out of bed, grumbling. I follow her. She goes down some stairs to a beach. There is no ocean, just a stage with a bamboo curtain. Actors come on and ask for a volunteer from the audience. She (my grandma) say, "Don't choose me!" which causes them to choose her. She groans and tells me to watch her two kids. I blow up and say, "Hey, no way," and get up and leave. I walk up the stairs and go to a room. It's a band. All the members are midgets. I play the trombone and ask if a tall person can audition. They agree. I go to the center of the band and start to play. At first I'm too breathy and struggle. One of the guys (now regular height) jostles me and I push him back. Now he respects me. I play really excellent! Jazzy and everyone is impressed. They applaud and cheer after my solo at the end.
