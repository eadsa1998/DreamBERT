In this dream I was going to my home and I don't know where I'd been. I know I was going to my house and it was getting dark, and I wanted to take a short cut, so I took a short cut. It was a little, winding, narrow, wooded road and I had a big flashlight in front of me. And I just kept running down this road, just kept running and running and running down this road. It was kind of hilly. And when I got to the top of this hill, I was pretty tired out.
