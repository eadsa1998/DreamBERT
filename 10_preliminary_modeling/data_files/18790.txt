I was riding my bike not too far from an elementary school that I had attended, a few blocks from where we now live, and I was riding through this residential section and I saw these two boys fighting and one was older and bigger and was picking on the small one trying to provoke him to fight. I thought that I should break it up, but then I thought that it was probably none of my business and I should just stay out of it. Then as I went over to break up the fight, I remember my little brother standing there saying not to break it up. I remember stopping myself and instead of breaking up the fight, I said a cutting remark to the older boy who was fighting the smaller one, and apparently when I said it, he must have felt ashamed of himself because he quit fighting. I then remember getting on my bicycle and starting to ride away when a sports car pulled up with a girl and a boy in it. This boy was a boy I had seen around the neighborhood before who lived about two blocks away from our house and who I knew only casually but not closely. I remember seeing this girl and boy pull up in this sports and I remember telling .. I remember seeing also a friend of my younger brother's standing there. I remember telling him to watch the girl as she got out of the car to see if she was good-looking and to tell me when they came over to our house ... to tell me when he came over to our house.
