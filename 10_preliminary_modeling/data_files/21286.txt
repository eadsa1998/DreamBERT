I was watching kids skating and some had sleds and they were coasting down a hill. The first thing I knew, I was sliding down the hill sitting in a rocking chair. I went all the way down and then I made little movements and I was sliding along on the street. This was in Fairchance, PA. I had intimation with Barbara by mistake or by accident, and she was supposed to be my sister. I was to marry her. I was talking to a young woman up on the third floor. I was on the ground and she was on the porch. I was looking up at her. She was beautiful. I was watching a high derrick; one of the big chains ran thru our house. There were holes in the house and we were standing and watching the chains move back and forth as the derrick worked.
