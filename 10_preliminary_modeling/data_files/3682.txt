There's the same little man as the previous dream. It's the next day. A friend of mine, like Marti S, is very upset with him. He had made some public remarks that indicate she isn't authentic or wasn't accurate. We go to his class again. I sit back in the room, wondering if he will see me and remember me. The room is very crowded. He comes in, prancing with energy. Marti raises her hand and he calls on her and she goes on and on, not making much sense, challenging him. He takes the challenge well, and appoints a row of students to help him test her and judge how she did. She says some words and he will check them out. Then he sees me and comes over by me. I see a picture of his two adorable children and his wife. He says, or I realize, that he is a wheelchair man. He loves women who are in wheelchairs. I am attracted to him, but don't want to disturb his family. He is attracted to me too. Now he is showing a film as educational evidence. I move to sit on a big double bed with a blue chenille bedspread. I walk over there, noticing I am walking pretty good. I sit. Later I feel the bed bouncing as he wiggles his way over next to me on the right side. He lays on his back, half slid off the bed, looking up at me. I see children in the movie. I wonder if they are his. I hear his voice doing the narration.
