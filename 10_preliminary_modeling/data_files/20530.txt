I was in a place with other people. There was a toilet bowl that was about four feet deep to the bottom. Some towels were down there. I flushed the toilet and they moved. I regretted flushing it without removing the towels first. I tried to reach them. I reached one, and I put it where it belonged. I could see the other towels, but I could not reach them. (Yesterday I read that dreaming of flushing a toilet symbolizes the embryo's attempt to flush out of the womb the unwanted fetus that had been stillborn before its own conception.
