 I'm in the Big Resort Area with my friend Kevin Simpson and my housemate Jack Thigpen. We're on Eagle Lake near the short Evergreen Lake portage where the river flows. We walk in the water, which goes from hip, to waist, to chest, to neck deep. It's time to get into our canoes. We have two canoes. I climb upon a floating diving raft. Kevin capsizes one canoe. He hangs onto it with his feet and goes underwater, then he emerges explosively from the water and thrusts the canoe up out of the water, flipping it over in the air. I hop in the canoe and start paddling towards Picnic Point. There is a group of women camping at the picnic point campsite, and they're playing in the water. I paddle towards the women, leaving Jack and Kevin behind, but I want them to hurry and start after me. I lose my paddle and I ask some of the women to grab it for me, which they do. We start to paddle. One of the women, who has red hair and braces, says to me, "You don't recognize me do you?" I realize that she is my friend from high school Holly Ball. She says I should stop over some time. I nod, but say nothing because I don't really want to stop over, and I know I won't. Three motorized scooter-like vehicles being ridden by handicapped men come down a waterfall and out onto Eagle Lake from Evergreen River. Someone says that there are a lot of there around the Big Resort Area now. I'm on some sort of scooter in the water, moving towards Round Island. My scooter loses power first, it has a low battery, and I may paddle. I don't know how it stays afloat: it is big and heavy and seems to be moving slowly. We are in a Big Resort Area museum in a city. We run through the museum laughing and joking. We go to leave. My hat, mittens, and keys are on a small table in the lobby.
