Again I was in the agency building without a badge.  This time all I had to do was just walk right in -- there were no guards or anything -- but I stood outside hesitating because I knew badges were still required, and I couldn't decide whether it was worth it to risk getting caught inside.  I finally did go in, but I felt so much like a stranger there, even among people I knew.
