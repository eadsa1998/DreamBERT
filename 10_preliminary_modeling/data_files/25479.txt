 I'm at Brimson. I'm supposed to meet my friend Queen Billman at 2:00. I think we're meeting in my room. She thinks we're meeting in her room. She comes to my room a little after 2:00. I have a wet face and wet hair. I rub my cheek on hers. It is a way of flirting, in which I can show I'm attracted to her without going so far as a kiss, which may be going too far.
