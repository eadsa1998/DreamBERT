Father Andrew takes me into his confidence and tells me that he has adopted a BABY whose mother has died; he tells me what to tell others and how to care for the baby; I am nervous and afraid I will give away the secret; See the real father come in wearing rough clothes; he is not interested in the baby; I am relieved that Father Andrew took me into his confidence.
