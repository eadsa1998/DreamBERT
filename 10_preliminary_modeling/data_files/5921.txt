Some women are in the cellar of our house and I go down and walk into a back area where it seems to be very dusty. Here I see some babies sleeping in cradles and cribs of different sizes. I go up to the women and tell them it is too dirty and point out "tumbleweeds" of dust on floor. They say something about it being safer there and I don't understand what they mean.
