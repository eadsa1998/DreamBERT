I was with two guy friends and I liked one of them and thought he liked me too. We took a photo together. They took my clothes and left me with this formal dress, which I put on. Mom asked why I was wearing a dress and I explained. I chased after them. There was a mannequin wearing clothes and I took a plaid jacket. The other guy was joking about it, but being mean, then he said he wanted to have sex. Then it was a movie. Beckett (Castle) was me and he shot her and she ran off. She walked through this door and said to the police "I'm shot" twice. Then someone walked up and it was the beginning of the movie and they asked these people about it. At some point, Rover was eating pumpkin soup. There was a place with a bathroom with something soapy.
