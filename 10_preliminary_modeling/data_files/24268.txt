Reluctantly going into the national geographic store. Walking in I wondered how the whole entrance/exit procedure worked. The sales girl made a personal case of me as I looked at the tiny cameras. Why couldn't I just say, "I don't plan on buying anything." She followed me and vowed to herself to sell something. She held up a lens for me to sight. I had to choose from a white or green set of rotating coordinates. "Like a pilot's coordinates" The manager was there and said, "we're sorry, we don't think you have serious enough skills. You wouldn't know what to do. You don't know the proper technology. What are you talking about?
