Father Andrew comes by a place where we are waiting around before Church; he complains about people calling him away from an evening with his wife; I say "This happens all the time to me... e.g. whether to go to a party with Frank or to church. We walk around in a circle and he says, "Oh I did not realize. Now I understand." Then he leaves for Church and I go to get ready for Church, but cannot find the proper clothes. I walk up without shoes. I hear Frank and Reynaldo and Al Milgrom walking up. I am very angry. I explain to crowd what I believe, accuse them of fostering his unbelief. An old man has a big German Bible. He says he will read the text for the day in German. Words of "Wichtigheit" (importance) and "Macht" (power) stand out, also admonishment to worship God. I leave very perturbed. I cannot find my clothes. It is late. Water is on high mark on the bridge, but as I approach I see people smiling and singing "Ayos, Ayos... and hear music from Church. I enter Church. Very happy.
