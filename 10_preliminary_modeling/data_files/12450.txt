I was at some place with Mom and Ezra. These kids went on this bus, as did I. Mom was angry with me for going. I got bored on there, so I got off, as did Mariyam and Adele. There were these stalls everywhere and one had all this white stuff and magnets. There was some really odd guy. I was telling Dad that the kid thing was boring. He said "Told ya".
