 I go into my uncles Nelson and Vev Redding's room at the Redding farm. It's where I'm going to stay. I'm nervous and uncomfortable about staying here because I've never been comfortable in this room: it gives me the creeps. There are two beds: one in the far left corner low to the ground, and another closer to the door and higher off the ground. I feel claustrophobic and contaminated. I see that there is another bed up against the other wall close to the door. It appears someone is sleeping there. This makes me glad, because now I don't have to worry about being stuck in the small bed in the corner low to the ground with someone sleeping on the bed next to me higher up. I think Vev is the person staying in the room. I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona at a campground. We drive to a place away from occupied campsites. It's nearly dark. There is a lot of gear at the site: some huge fluffy sleeping bags and more. I think of staying the night here instead of where I would stay.
