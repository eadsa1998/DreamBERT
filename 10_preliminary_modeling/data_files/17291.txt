Dreamt of playing a computer game, one of two versions.  In one, you direct the character up and over many obstacles.  Just get him over the course or survive the time limit, it was difficult.  After I finished a level, surprising myself, I was at a picnic.  My old school friend Bryan was there.  I was hurt when he left without allowing me to hug him.
