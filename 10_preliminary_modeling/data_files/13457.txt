There was an evil me who could heal and turn into a mini, fast tornado. It turned into the tornado and was chasing me. There were two Mom's as well. One was in the pickup and the other in the car. I got into the car and told her to go but she lagged so I went to the Mighty. I came back later but she still lagged. Then Dad and Ezra were there and he said he'd go [wherever I was going] but then Mom said she will. So Dad left and then Mom took off the street and pulled into a house. I got into the Mighty and drove up there (I didn't know what I was doing though) and finally managed it. I knocked on the door and a lady answered. I went in and saw Mom sitting down. The house was really nice and had a neat, modern style but was mostly white. Then Calvin and I were in this queue to get some sort of animal. He was ahead of me in the line. Some guy had a toad. He was going through his order "cranberry, apples, cinnamon, pecan, nut, date nut" then I said "lemon poppy seed muffin!" and called Calvin. He came and saw. As we were leaving all these cats were on the steps and some were in cages. They all looked like Gizmo.
