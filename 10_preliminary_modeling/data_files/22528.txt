Last night I first dreamed about a neighbor who in real life has traveled to the United States a few days ago. In my dream I saw that the day after learning of her trip, I came back home, when I saw her going into her house. Then I thought that she had just pretended to take a trip. This made me very curious and I thought to myself that since she was rather stuck up always, she was now pretending to take a trip and had hid somewhere and now she was coming home, thinking that nobody would see her.
