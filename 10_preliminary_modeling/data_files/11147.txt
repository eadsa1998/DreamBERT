Once more I was swimming, this time in the pond in front of my grandmother's house. It's a fairly large sized pond, but no one hardly ever swims in it due to the numerous cattails and seaweed growths. It is known to have no bottom because of its base of muck. Well, on with the dream. It wasn't an especially different dream, not even exciting. Tom and I were simply swimming around. I remember remarking what a good tan he had. Oh yes, once as I was getting out of the water, the top of my bathing suit came down. Tom didn't seem to notice it, though, so I fixed it and we went on swimming as before. Pretty soon three boys came up. I believe they were supposed to be cousins from Pennsylvania. I recognized one named Mickey, but the faces weren't familiar. I introduced them all to Tom who by the way is my boyfriend. The next thing I remember is being at someone's house, but I don't remember where or who was there.
