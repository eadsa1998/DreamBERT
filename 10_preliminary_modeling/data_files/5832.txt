My mother and father in law and Mary and I went up to our friend C who lives in Arlington Mass. So we brought him down here and he had some business cards that went into a notebook. I could feel that one part of the business card was raised so that it looked like a separate little part, but it was raised like a little book and you could flip some lose parts of that card, and it went onto the ring of the notebook. Sitting there, and it took no time to get from his house to our house over on H drive. My father in law was helping C get these cards into this book. During this time, my mother in law called the Hs, J and G and asked them to come over and have some coffee with us. I woke up after the phone call, never found out if they came or not. Why C would have business cards, and a business card holder like the one that Mary gave me for my little wedding thing. I don't know.
