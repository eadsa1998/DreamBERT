With Margaret and Patrick living in a large house with a group working on a PEACE project. I paint a face with a green hat and it is praised as a good beginning; I go to the bathroom which is very clean and gleaming white; wonder how Margaret can keep her house so clean and lead the workshop; she is friendly, but tells me I may have to drop out because I can't keep up; I leave sadly.
