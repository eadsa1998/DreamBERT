 I'm outside a bank. I'm trying to change the lock from the inside of the door to the outside. I'm using a screwdriver to turn in a screw, which goes almost all the way in. There is a window in the door and I see a man walk down the stairs in the bank. He is the bank manager. He comes out and catches me changing the lock. I have four things: a screwdriver, a hammer, a deck of cards, and a vinyl envelope. He takes the hammer and the envelope. I tell him to give me the hammer. He say no, because I was using it to break in. I said I wasn't, but he doesn't believe me. <br/
