 I'm on a journey with my friends Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, Norman Noman, and others. Two of these people and I hike up a really steep grass-covered hill. There is a road going up the hill. A car drives past us going up the hill. We walk towards the road. We see a coyote on a grassy mound on top of the hill. We notice it because it howls. There are stairs where the road was, and we take the stairs up. We get to the top of the hill. There is farmland on the other side of the hill. Farmers are singing in a foreign language as they drive a big 8-wheel machine over a field of hay. The farmers leave. Norman, I, and others go into town, where we will wait for Nat and someone else that have gotten a late start on their way up the hill. I go into a store and buy a bottle of Clearly Canadian. I look at water in bottles, and notice it is expensive. Another group of college students is there. The farmers were actually foreign people, and may be part of the group. The group seems older than us. People are outside smoking. I go outside with my Clearly Canadian and pretend to play the "air drums". It is raining. I have a white Styrofoam cup. When I open the bottle of Clearly Canadian it foams and sprays out. I put my mouth over the top of the bottle, sucking on the foam spraying out, until the pressure is released. I am having a pretty good time with my Clearly Canadian out in the rain pretending to play the air drums. There is a skateboarder in the road. He is going fast down the middle of the road.
