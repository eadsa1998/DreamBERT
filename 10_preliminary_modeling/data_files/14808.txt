I was at a train station and I had to put baggage into this hole because I was a girl. Giovanni was there and he was allowed to go on as normal. It took a long time for mine to get through. I gave up. I went outside and I think Mom picked me up. There were lots of lizards and snakes and insects around. I saw something and I said "what is that?!" and Mom said "a turtle?". It had weird spiky arms. She dropped me back off later to pick up my stuff. It was near Dad's new place. I was like 'why would you want to live near the beach with all these things around?'.
