Betsy helped move me in her car. She got upset because I spilled noodles on her car in the trunk. Moved to new house. Trying to move things in, dulcimer and fiddle. It was dark. I suddenly get nervous because I have no car. I have no way to get to school. I note a grocery store on the corner.  I feel relieved but worry about money to buy food. My parents come by and ask if I need any money. A red house. I like it.
