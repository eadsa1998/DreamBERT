I was on the forum and a thread derailed and Benjamin posted about how he had a folder about how his future wives should look like, called 'Wives'. He said they were all sizes 10-12 and 12-14. He said he planned on trying others and the next one was the 'fat one from The Spice Girls'. It turned out he meant Sporty Spice and I said she wasn't fat and that she was ugly.
