I was at school. Someone got scared by a snake. Niels from Physics was at our bench, but it wasn't actually our bench. I was thinking 'What the hell is he doing there?'. I opened my bag and there was a snake. We all freaked out and ran. Samantha was in front of me and I got stuck at a tree and fell behind. Mr Norris stopped me and told me off for running. Everyone calmed down and Samantha was talking about Burke (Grey's Anatomy) and I heard "so hot!". She saw me and started talking about Eugene. She was saying how much I liked him and I was like "What the flip?". Calvin was being gay.
