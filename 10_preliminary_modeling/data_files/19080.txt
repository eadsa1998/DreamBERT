I was in my apartment with a girl whom I know and I was going to play a record on the record player. So I went over to the cabinet where I have components set up, my own components, and I noticed there was a wire loose from the amplifier and a spark jumped from the wire to the chassis of the amplifier, a couple of inches. I watched and then it jumped again after several seconds, so I was a little worried about that, of course, I kind of stood back to think of what to do. I didn't want that electricity flying around the room. All of a sudden it jumped across the room, perhaps 7, 8, 10 feet to a screwdriver that I have on a desk. So that really got me worried to see a big spark fly all the way cross the room. After another second or two, it flew again, perhaps a larger spark. I could kind of smell ozone in the air, and I thought to myself at the time that the spark must be ionizing the air and this must be creating a vacuum, and that a big vacuum was being created in the room. I threw the screwdriver over by the amplifier, thinking that perhaps the spark would now jump from the amplifier to the screwdriver, a short distance, but by now the spark was just jumping across the room by itself, large. So as I said, I thought about this making a vacuum in the room, so I started to run for the door. Then I thought just as I was reaching for the door, that if I open the door and run away, the spark will obviously get larger and larger out the door and will begin ionizing larger areas, the whole atmosphere, and the whole atmosphere will become a vacuum. But in any case, I thought that, but I still stood at the door and was about to open it when there was a giant implosion. That is, the room had become a vacuum and everything evidently, I guess it passed through my mind at the moment, had blown in from the pressure. Of course, that was the end of the dream. I woke up then or that's as far as I can remember.
