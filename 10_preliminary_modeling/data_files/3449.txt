Robert Redford has been out drinking. He comes in late at night and I am already in the hide-a-bed. I am not asleep, but pretend to be. He stumbles in and decides to lay down by me on the bed. He is married, but we are attracted to each other. He lays down across my belly, mumbling to himself. I feel him begin to have an erection. He is sexually excited about being close to me. He is upset with himself for feeling this. "Damn," he mumbles. "Usually, when this happens, I dance. But maybe she doesn't want me to dance. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea." He is whispering to himself and then he curls up around me and gently, softly kisses my shoulder, chest area. Then he begins to gently kiss the chin bone and jaw, moving up to the lips, and I am consumed with a raging, pleasurable sexual desire. I wake up startled, like I'd somehow bailed out too soon, out of automatic response.
