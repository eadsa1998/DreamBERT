We were going deep sea fishing. I was suppose to be moving to a different cabin but I'd rather be fishing. The boat was very late getting there. Over 4 hours late and when it got there we were surprised it hadn't sunk it was SO RICKETY. An old man was suppose to have saved my black old shoes, men's, but he had lost them instead of putting them in a cardboard box. Finally the boat left but we were running 4 hours behind schedule and had to bail out the water that was filling up in the boat. Finally, finally we got to fish and the salty old bearded man was grumpy. Me and Dora got our fishing lines all tangled up and he made us stand in line twice. Once to get untangled and once for bait. 2 hooks were on a line and a safety pin hook at the bottom, because some fish preferred to big safety pins. Squid was bait, but sliced up small. There wasn't much bait in the bucket. When we ran out of bait, me and Dora had to get into somebody's lunch to find something we could use for bait. It was all wrapped up, the tuna fish sandwich with lettuce on a roll, in white paper and a very small paper bag. They'd eaten the first half. It was sliced in half. I tore the bag in excitement and we scooped out tuna fish from the center with our index fingers and baited the bottom hook with tuna, the top hook with lettuce. I caught an inflatable black toy pig about 9" in length. It had alphabet letters, random, on it. Mary Susan Smith, a sissy girl, caught a swordfish.
