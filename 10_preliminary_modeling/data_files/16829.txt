There was a huge graduation party. Eliza was standing on a balcony throwing condoms down to the masses of students as if they were confetti. I grabbed a handful and threw them down. I was drunk and feeling playful, but Eliza was in a very serious mood. She asked me to help her and I said, "Yeah, sure, what do you want me to do?" She said, "Forget it, never mind." I said, "No, please tell me." She asked me to get some paper towels. I asked her what for and she said for the bathroom floor. I said, "Oh fun" and went off to get them. Then I was worried that maybe she thought I didn't want to help. I looked around for her but I couldn't find her. Then I was hanging upside down from a railing and it was a huge drop into the room below. I called out for Eliza to help me. For anyone to help me. No one came. I was afraid I was going to fall and that I didn't have the strength to lift myself up. I managed to pull myself to safety.
