Merle and I are talking about the IBM floppies that I loaned him. At the same time as I'm listening to him, I am interested in reading a 25-page letter of introduction on this woman that I find interesting. It is hard to concentrate on two things at once. Merle is explaining how a man lent him some floppies and I said, "I'd like to copy them." He said, "The man wouldn't approve." I say, "Hey, he doesn't mind getting mine, but he minds sharing his?" I don't like it. I see trees in the yard out the window behind Merle. Meanwhile, I am reading backwards from page 25 to 1 of this woman's history. I am surprised to learn she is from a black family, as she looks completely white. But there is a picture of all her relatives and they are all black. One of them, an Aunt Ana, is surrounded by police. Some notoriety is attached to her. Merle says, "Don't feel bad. Even though she's written a lot, only one book has been published and it's only sold 22 books," (20 of them to her Aunt). I see her book collection and I'm pleased. We have the same reading taste (Jr. Classic books from V. shelf). I wonder if she is a lesbian.
