I can't actually see Mary, but I know she's alive and I know she's going to die sometime in the near future. I am in a bathroom, which has a large shower stall. I know that Mary has just finished using this stall. I am alone and thinking that I should go to Mary and hug her so that I can always have this memory of holding her close, after she's gone. There are other people in this large house and much activity, but I don't remember who the people are or what's going on.
