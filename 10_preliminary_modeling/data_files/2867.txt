I see flood waters in the city street and see three houses floating and "dancing" in the water. I become aware that I am dreaming and feel interested. I think to myself that I can change something and wonder what to change. I say, "Let it be beautiful." I feel myself rising in the air and flying. I see a cartoon-like house with square window eyes, the eyes like headlights of a car, with light coming out of them.
