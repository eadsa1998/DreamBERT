["Discrimination and Talk Show Hosts."] I am in a room and Oprah is there. So is another talk show host, named Rosie (but she is a Mexican American woman, not Rosie O'Donnell) I want to be a talk show host too and I point out to Rosie that I heard a French woman once say that the comment "My hair is rolled or coiled up) is a discriminatory remark about French Women. Rosie is surprised and feels badly. She says I didn't know that. I say well, there are lots of ways we discriminate and we don't even know it.
