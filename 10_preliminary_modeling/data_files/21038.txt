Pearl's brothers came to her house and beat up one of her brothers who was weak-witted. I told them that was not a very nice thing to do. I was upstairs and opened a window and said I was going to get those three and beat them up. Hilts and Don Delatt laughed at me. I caught up with them and one ran away, so I flew at him and caught him. He turned out to be Pearl. So I bawled her out and I slapped her face twice and told that if she just as much as thought evil of me, I would know and she would get more. I met the boys that were tough later and looked them in the eyes. They turned their gaze away meekly. Chipka was walking by me. I had a piece of wire in my hand, so I put it between his cheeks and he walked away with it that way.
