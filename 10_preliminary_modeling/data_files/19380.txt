I was sitting at the kitchen counter drinking red Kool-Aid, and suddenly all the lights went out and it was very dark, and I could hear my girl friend calling me from outside (at the start of the dream it was morning, now it's night), but I can't get out of the house, or yell to her, and then I can hear her start to cry, but she still calls out my name.
