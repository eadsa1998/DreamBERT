I was at university and part of one of my subjects was to this group discussion. There was about 20 of us sitting in a circle at a desk and were chatting about the questions the teacher asked us. We did a second one with different people. The teacher lady asked us all to say some stuff and I was annoyed I had to do it twice. Alejandro and Rodney were there. I wondered which group Eugene was in. We all got symbols and mine was a lion, so I got a plastic figure of a lion but it looked like a jaguar. Evelyn was then next to me and Calvin was on my other side. Evelyn said "what do I say?" and I said "... hello?" and then I sat back down and ignored her. We had to draw something and get the person next to us to hold the pencil. Evelyn drew a house and I held the pencil. Then I ended up somewhere else and I was quoting "I fed up with this wurhld!" and make a red button (which was a thing from The Room) and put it in the front of my desk and it bounced. I said "Thank you Quentin Tarantino!". Then it was a movie and this guy escaped from somewhere. A guy found him and asked him to tell him secrets and he got him into college. Someone asked him "Princeton?" and he answered "San Francisco".
