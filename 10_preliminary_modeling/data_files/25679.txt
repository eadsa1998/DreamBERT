 I'm at Grandpa and Grandma Redding's farm. My uncle Dannie Redding is there with my grandparents. There is a cow or a goat that gets loose in the house because of me. It bites an old blue blanket in Grandma's bedroom. I get bitten and scratched by it. It runs out to the plant room and jumps through a window. I had gone to the plant room earlier to study. There are cows or goats in the door or window that seem to want to get in. I don't want people to know the window is broken. I'll probably have to pay for it. I tell them about my cut, bite, and scratched hand.
