I had this little thing which I held onto in water and it would go really fast. Sometimes it looked like an iPod. Dad and I had to share a bed somewhere. He was moving and I realized he was masturbating and he finished and then realized I was awake. Later I was at a restaurant. There was a girl called Izzy Riss and she was a real 'goody-goody'. Then the next day I saw her at some place with a rock group and she was acting wild and she didn't recognize me. Then it changed to college band and she told me she could manipulate the environment. I had a scratchie and won $200 on it.
