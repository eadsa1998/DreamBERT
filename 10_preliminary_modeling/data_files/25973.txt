 I'm a good-sized black bear. It is night. I'm near a tree. I lie on my back and scrape my paws together. I'm going somewhere to get something. I think that no other bears will "interrupt" my space: that I will get my spot back when I return. By the back door of my (human) home in Oak Valley I see a grizzly bear! I am scared. I turn and go slowly away from the bear, and then I run. I am human. I run around to the garage. There is a man and a woman there. One of us has a gun. We are afraid of the grizzly bear outside the back door, which is my ex-roommate Sean Williams. I take the weapon, which is like a prodder, and tell the others to take rakes. Sean is wearing a yellow construction hat. The bear is still there. Bears are hungry this time of year! Black bears usually won't bother you, but a grizzly bear is frightening!
