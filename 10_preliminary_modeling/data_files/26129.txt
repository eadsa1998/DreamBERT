 I'm at a party in a house with several stories. The party gets broken up early and the police confiscate all the beer. There were three kegs and many cases of beer. People help the police haul the beer outside, for the police to take. My high school friend Nelson Eastman is there. As we help carry the beer out I say to Nelson that we should stash this beer: hide it for us later. We're in the basement of the house with a police officer. There are metal fragments, shavings around the room, which is made of cinder blocks and sand.
