I was in the foyer of my high school, only I didn't think it was my high school. I was standing there with some slightly older man, my two brothers and I. The older man started to open the bathroom door and I heard a toilet flush. He said, "There wasn't anyone in the bathroom!?" I turned away from the bathroom and started to run. Everyone followed. We dove around the corner of the wall. Right then, the bathroom exploded, sending flames all throughout the area we had just been standing. I had barely saved our lives. Later on I told my brother and the man, "I can't believe that I didn't say 'Run!'." I was lucky they followed. The next thing I knew, we were on a plane flying past a beautiful sunset. I said, "This is why we lived", out loud. My older brother got mad and said he was still shaken up from the explosion. I put my arm around his shoulder. Two tears started streaming down my cheeks as I watched the awe-filling sunset. My brother said, "Wait until the memorial service, then you'll be crying," in a guilt-provoking tone.
