I was at an amusement park with my girlfriend. We stopped at one of the booths and I threw darts at balloons. With three darts I burst three balloons. A lot of people were gathered around me and praising me. A group of men put me on their shoulders and we paraded around the park. Everyone was cheering and clapping.
