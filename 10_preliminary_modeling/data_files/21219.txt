I was making a bet at a bookie. I played the 4th and 5th races and I won in the fifth. The horse paid $15 and I had 2 and 1 on the winner. I came home and there was a man sitting there. He was to have bawled out my wife and seemed to be a distant relative of hers. I started to bawl him out and I laid down the law to him. I told him if he opened up his mouth again I would throw him out on his ear. I threatened him and I was angry. Then there was a woman there later and I threatened her also. I bawled her out like I did the man. I picked up my overcoat and was going to hang it up and it split on the collar from old and weakness of material. I went down to Gordon Park and there were streams of water overflowing and running down the ditches and brooks. The water was heavy and high after a storm. Then later it came down to normal. We went swimming. A girl took a dive and she hit a wall with her head and was under water dazed and going deeper. I jumped in and got hold of her and brought her on top. The water was deep, up to my nose. I waded and took the girl ashore. I saved her life. I was swimming upstream, floating like, and I was going fast by my easy strokes. I dreamed the horse I played in the fifth won, and he did.
