Ezra and I stayed at Granny's. It was Christmas the next day. We were cleaning some dirty cutlery. The next morning she gave me a math revision package, but it was all really easy stuff. The first question had a 4x4 square and people standing on the edge of each small square and you had to work out what number went in each square depending on how many body parts were touching each one. Some had their arm, hand or something else. Some Girls was playing.
