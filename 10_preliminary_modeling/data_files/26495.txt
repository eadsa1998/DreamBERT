 I'm in a bed with my friend Melanie McDyss, one of her female friends, and my friend Stephen Ramos. We talk about being tan and having a good body. I look pasty white, soft, and flabby: fat. Melanie asks me, "Don't you work out?" I reply no, and indicate that it's not too important to me. I slur my speech because I have a retainer in.
