I was at a shop. I went to go in one of the shops inside, but the lady closed the gates on us. We went in another way. I was with Calvin. We snuck around trying to avoid the staff. We went to hide and there was a box of Nintendo 64 games. I grabbed Banjo Kazooie. This guy started following us and we pretended we were looking at TV's. He made us leave and closed the gate. I still had the game and banged on the gate and the price said it was $3.20 and I gave him a $5 note and he said he'd still tell on me, so I gave him another $3 and he left. The inside of the cartridge looked all screwy, but it played ok. Mom said it might not be ok though. I went back and replaced it with a better one and put it in a female friend's bag. Then we went out and it was raining. We ran down this slope. I was insulting one of the lady's that worked there and then realized she was eating at the table behind me. It was almost time for Mom to pick Ezra up, but I text her saying I was at Centerville shops and needed to be picked up. Later, she, Ezra and I were in the car. She was at a deli getting us a hamburger. It was going to take ages.
