Coming home a large truck crowded me to one side of the road. It was standing still and I asked the driver, whom I could not see, to remain still so he wouldn't shove me off. It was a dark red truck, looked almost like a shack without windows. Then I cut across a green lawn and saw two dogs lying on the grass. Hoped they would stay asleep but they didn't, barked and cam towards me. I told them I had a right there and the black dog recognized me. I wanted him to tell the buff dog I was ok but the latter kept on barking and coming at me. I wondered why I was not afraid. I could see the large white house which was my home just beyond.
