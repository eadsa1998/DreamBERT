A desperate scream from a child shook me up. Immediately I worried over where the terrible cry came from. I searched and searched, but couldn't find it, until at one point I saw that a boy had been crushed by an enormous truck. His brains, mixed with the hot red blood, were stuck to the ground, his arm could not be replaced because they had crushed it. His legs were a knot of flesh and bone. Later, nothing seemed strange to me, all the rest was of no concern.
