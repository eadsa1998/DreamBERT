I had a dream I went to a store and when I came out I saw some teenage boys in the lot. They were running around the cars like they were wild animals. All of a sudden two of them ran across my car from the hood to the trunk. My hood had a huge dent in it and they cracked my moonroof. I ran after them and they came and saw the damage they had caused to my car. While they were at my car a police car drove by. I told them to come over and they did. They told the boys they should pay for what they had done. The boys agreed to setup a payment plan with me to pay for the damage. I can remember putting a trash bag over the moonroof to prevent leaking of rain into the car. I called the boys to ask them when they would give me the money. Then I woke up.
