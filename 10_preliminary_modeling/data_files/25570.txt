 I'm riding a bicycle down High Avenue with my friends Kevin Simpson and Tom Napper. They are riding on the right side of my bicycle. Then one of them switches to the left side, so there is one person on each side. We coast down a big hill. Kevin and Tom steer the bicycle. We come to a circular road, like the roundabouts in Australia. My classmate Seth Voss is there. Someone says that they are giving him "five minutes to get home and have a sausage on the table." This may be said to me, I'm not sure. It takes five minutes to get home from where we are. I am at a castle with Kevin and Tom. It is a white castle with black metal bars as window or doors. I climb the castle first, and make it to the tower. I sip water from a mug in the tower without picking up the mug. I don't want to make any noise.
