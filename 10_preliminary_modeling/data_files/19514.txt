[I had 2 detailed dreams, but though partially awake several times I seemed unable to rouse myself sufficiently (in a sort of stupor) to jot down the main outlines, only fragments are remembered] My mother, 2 sisters, Mary and Faye, and myself were sleeping in the living room of 11 Hill Road. I was awakened by terrific bus exhaust noises. The room was dark but I was able to see that the east door (opening to the porch) was open. It occurred to me that my folks preferred to endure the noise and dirt of the traffic, rather than cut off some of the air supply.
