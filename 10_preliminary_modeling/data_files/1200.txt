I am wearing a copper suit of armor. It has fat bulges and fat legs. I say, "Hum... no wonder it doesn't fit, it's my father's suit." I then see another suit. It's slimmer and it's mine. I exchange them and wear mine. The helmet face piece keeps going up and down, occasionally. Then my co-worker in a store comes to me and says, "We had to use your other name for a sale 'B. B.'" I didn't like it, but it was already done, and besides it was only temporary and wouldn't hurt anything. I see a dress, turquoise, slinky and beautiful.
