["Telling the truth can be dangerous."] I am in a class. Ex-president Bill Clinton is the teacher. I ask him a question which he has trouble answering. He hems and hahs and searches through books and papers. I have put him on the spot, embarrassed him. Later, I am searching through the box to find my pills. There are a number of them but not enough of the right kind. (coumadin 2.5's) I sigh and feel worried. Then Bill asks a question of a woman student who didn't know the answer. I realize it is a trick question calculated to embarrass her. Revenge. I answer for her and quietly but with firm intent I respond to something he said with "Obviously, it is better not to tell the truth or you will get attacked."
