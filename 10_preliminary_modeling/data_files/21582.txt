I was walking along a new highway with some people and there were a lot of girls making fools of men. They sucked them in and then got a lot of money from them. I was in Rivertown my boyhood town. It was being built up. I said, "I remember where I used to pasture cows, there were homes built now." Ann said she was going to die and leave me. I was looking at Rivertown and I said what a beautiful town. It was full of trees just like a forest. I was working at White's. Joe Grabar let me look at one tool Bill Kotnik ground. I looked at it and commented how he ground it because it looked like no grind I saw before. I saw a town horse winner.
