I am at a place which looks like the Great Sand Dunes National Monument. I am with my husband and other people, mostly men, are there. A male co-worker gets stuck in a Model A on one of the dunes and some man says "he's going to have to stay there until winter." I say he can't because then I will have to do all the work.
