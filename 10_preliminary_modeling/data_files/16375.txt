First of all, I was back home and I was back at Westport High School, but then again I had the feeling that I really wasn't supposed to be there, but I had the feeling that it was extra. And Mr. Jameson, my boring PE teacher, was having me do this report, and in the locker room there were these little match books with people's names and numbers on them, like famous people. And he would give you a number of a person he would want you to do a report on, and you would go to these match books in the locker room and find the correct number of the person, and _____ the match book with some references that you go to, I guess. And he was going to give me this person to do that was #42, but he wanted me to wait and come back the next day and ask him what number it was. And so the next day I slept in until 9:45, and I had to skip school in order to give this gift back to the radio station and I had gotten some gifts from somebody in my dream that was like a little address book that I couldn't really see that well, and some pencils and some other little diddly things, and I was going to put it in a basket and donate to the radio station, I guess, to sell in a fundraiser or something, or like a _____ gift, I guess. I was going to skip school so that I could go do that. Well, I was laying in bed listening to Lionel Richie on the bedroom machine, and Cooper, Aunt Christine's big dog, was there, and I was ______ I was laying with him and I was holding onto him like he was a person, and he was like laying his head on my shoulder and like kind of licking my ear or something. [laugh] And I knew I had to get up, but I really didn't want to. And then I looked out the window and I saw Dad in the back yard and I was a little embarrassed. And then I woke up.
