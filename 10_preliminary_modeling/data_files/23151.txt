I was preparing for a faculty meeting at my former campus.  I was supposed to make some kind of presentation at the beginning of the meeting.  But there was to be a party after the meeting, too, and I was making some kind of orange pudding.  It was only a powder to be mixed with water, and I mixed it in a sink.  After stirring it up, I found that there was a layer of water on top of it, and I had to find a measuring cup to dip it off and not throw away pudding in the process.  That was kind of tedious.  It was time for the meeting to start, and I was still skimming water off, and then I had to find a bowl to put it in, because I didn't want to leave it in the sink.  I was desperately looking in cabinets for a bowl large enough to hold it.  While I was looking, Tran and Alai were also searching for bowls, and Tran told me that the meeting was starting.  Again I was filled with frustration and anxiety.  Carl Scheibe came to the front door-it was a temporary building something like the building my department is in at my former place of work.  His hair was in a big black Afro, and he was asking if anyone had seen Mo Cloward.  It was the second time he had been by asking for someone.  I told him, "Carl, you never seem to get enough, because you are always asking for Mo."  He just smiled.
