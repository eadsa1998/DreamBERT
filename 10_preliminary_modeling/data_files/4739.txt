["Flying bird and dinosaur's."] I am a flying bird. A paradactal. I am high above the lush forests. I see dinosaurs standing and eating and ranging. Another bird and I soar over the forests until the other bird is stopped by the tall long necked dinosaurs. He's trying to eat the bird. I fly in to distract the dinosaur. I try hard to rise above the level of his head and it is very hard. I distract the dinosaur and he comes after me. Then my bird friend escapes.
