 The Brimson College tradition of a snowball fight over High Avenue is ensuing. My roommate Jens Nils is there, as is Nellie Hammer, from my economics class. I toss a crusty snowball and it lands in the road, harmless. I feel dumb because I missed the actual game. There is a line of people by Billings Hall, one of the dormitories. They are going to run towards High Avenue and fling snow. They do. There is a car accident or two, with some damage. Everyone runs. I run to the Franklin Hall door, my dormitory. I feel guilty.
