This dream was rather short and fragmentary. I was off in some strange land---the A-- or S--. Airplanes were roaring overhead and several soldiers in a foxhole surrounded by snow were reassuring me that these planes were not of the enemy. The enemy was a wicked old witch who was out to kill us, particularly me. I felt relieved at their reassurance. The next thing I knew, I was told the witch was pulled down into a whirlpool of snow and killed. I looked at the ground and saw the hole through which she sank.
