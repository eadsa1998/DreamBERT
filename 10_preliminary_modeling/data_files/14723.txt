I was in a car with Pacey (Dawson's Creek) and it was night. We were in this cornfield place and it was foggy. We were looking for proof of something and it made me do something without thinking. We got out and there was a construction site nearby. We heard a baby crying and then people came looking for the baby. I picked up some stuff and found a lady and she had been making the noises so people would find her. We went back to the cornfield and Mom said that Raquel had been in lots of advertisements lately and I said I had seen her saying something about that on Facebook. I was on my computer later and Ten O'Clock Postman only had like 60 plays.
