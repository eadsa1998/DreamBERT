Am on a tandem bike with someone in front of me, and ahead is a long, straight concrete road that I am not familiar with. It gets narrower as we continue and finally very narrow and rough with overhanging branches retarding progress. Then we see Jones Turnpike and I say, "Yes, I knew this was the right road." The rough road smoothes out and broadens and we are on the Turnpike and in familiar surroundings.
