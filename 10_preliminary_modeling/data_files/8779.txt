My whole family is together. We decide to go to Kentucky. We all seem to be rushing around getting ready to go. We're turning out the lights and such. I go to get one of the children and by the time I return realized that everyone else has left. They went without us. The child was a toddler but I don't know whose she was. It's storming and raining outside. I'm hurrying around the house trying to make sure all of the windows are closed and locked and that the back door is locked. I see Mike A outside. His face seems to have cuts or scratches on it - uncovered. He knows I am in here. I'm very concerned about this. I'm concerned that he is going to try to get in and come after me. I see him walking around the outside of the house and looking in the windows. I know he can see me in here. We make eye contact more than once, though I try to act like I don't know he's out there.
