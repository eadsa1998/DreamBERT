I was going somewhere on a streetcar. After I had been riding a while, a Negro friend of mine (M-25) got on the car and sat down beside me. We were talking about a class we had taken together. Then a tall, fat white man--a stranger about 50--came over and pointed a gun at my friend and forced him to get off the streetcar. The white man said it made him sick to see a negro talking to a white person. Then, as my friend was walking across the street, the man shot him in the back. I got off the car and ran over to him, but he was dead. I felt sad and I cried.
