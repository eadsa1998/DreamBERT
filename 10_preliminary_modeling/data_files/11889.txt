I was at "Nana's" for Christmas. Aunt Sally had 4 kids -- Bryson and Nathaniel and two girls, one was called Cheleka. I really hated Cheleka. The bloke from Collateral (Tom Cruise) was in this car with us and jumped off and onto train tracks. We got out and me and Collateral guy got hit by this train and flew off into a tree. The tree fell. We were going to sleep in tree and then we got romantic -- not "romantic". We were cuddling or something gay like that. Then I fell asleep. Some girl came along and they had sex? I woke up and she said something about "redhot tip"? And I said "What?" And she made some pathetic excuse up. I went back to sleep.
