Charla and Deirdre are both the same age, rambunctious children. They are being noisy and not minding and so I say to them they have to lay down in bed and be quiet for 10 minutes; then they can go play. They simply will not stop. They'd get out of bed or talk and giggle. I am furious. It's a power struggle. I go over and spank them each four times on the butt. This doesn't stop it. I start slapping them on the face, hitting them over and over and insisting they mind. They simply do not understand why I am being this way. I am stone cold angry. I have a point to prove. This is discipline. Mirabelle comes over and talks; she wants me to be lenient. I am angry at her for interfering. An old lady comes by and wants to talk. I am firm and almost rude to her demanding she leave as I have no time for her now. I relentlessly keep slapping the children and they irrepressibly keep disobeying. It's a horrible feeling of being caught in this ugly angry space for principle's sake.
