I was watching Entourage. Ari and his wife had a specialty shop each in a shopping centre. Hers was a general store. There was a new shop opening and Ari was giving his shop a facelift. He and his wife were competitors and they were getting people to run between them. He went over and realized and sobbed to someone saying "I've really made a mess haven't I?" and then they were trying to work it out. Zachary Levi had married this ugly woman and had twins.
