This dream took place in the back of this house. There were a couple of old cars back there, old junk cars, and I got into this one old truck just to see what it was like, just to sit in it. And I cranked up and started driving around and I didn't know how to stop the stupid thing. So I tried everything I knew how to stop it, and I was running into trees and everything at a real slow pace. And so I finally got the thing stopped, but now after having, I dreamt that my house was next door to this one, and my mother was yelling at me. And I was rather perturbed over the fact that she was yelling at me; I didn't like that at all. So I said something to the effect that of all the things that I had to do that day, listening to her particular problems wasn't one of the things that I wanted to do. She kept on yelling. <br/
