I was coming home from some busy kind of thing. And Dad had set me up with an interview at some pizza place, and it was mainly a job practice interview, and if I got the job, he made a comment like, "Well, I'll have more money to sit on," [laugh] because, you know, I'm just saving up now. And so I went into this, we were riding with Mom, he and I were on a tandem and we rode down to this pizza place and we sat ourselves down at a table and Dad had brought two tuxedos -- one with a straight like scoop neck and one with a flowery, flowery whoo neck. And both of these were like men's clothes that were like way too big for me, but I was supposed to wear one of them for the interview. And the person came for me before I had a chance to put them on, and we did the interview. She asked a couple questions. She asked more questions than I offered information. Usually when I've done interviews with the internship program, I try to offer information like so they don't have to ask everything and drag it out of me. But I let them drag it out of me this time. [laugh] And I had to sign a form, which is like signing a statement in court, but they said I had to assent to the fact that I had a disability and I had to sign a form to do that. And then she asked some more questions, and then I went into another room where I was supposed to fill out an application, and there were these people sitting at these tables and somebody had this long involved math problem, and I took out a pencil out of my bag and I just took a shot at trying to solve it. And then about two or three steps down the way I gave up, and then I woke up. I don't know if I got the job or not.
