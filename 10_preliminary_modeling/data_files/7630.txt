I was with Mike M. There was another woman with us as well. She was a much larger woman than I was. Mike M and I were kissing and cuddling and the other woman was not necessarily watching but it was as though she was waiting to be included. I did not want to include her because of her size. As Mike M and I became more intimate, I became very self-conscious of my own size. Mike M kissed my stomach a couple of times and then got up and walked away. We got into a discussion about my weight. He thought it should be very easy for me to lose weight. I tried to explain to him everything I have tried and just how difficult weight loss is for me. He didn't really seem to understand it. As I was having this discussion I seemed to be seeing these pictures of myself at the same time but I'm not sure exactly how. He didn't see them. In each of these pictures, however I was dressed very scantily and provocatively. In a final one, I am dressed in a different, yet similar outfit that really shows my excess tummy weight. I am thinking to myself that I can't believe I did that. I can't believe my sisters saw this and I realize how awful it looked. I also was very disappointed in Mike M because he has told me in waking life that he doesn't care how heavy a woman is as long as he can get his arms around her.
