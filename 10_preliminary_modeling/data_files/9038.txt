I was at a conference. I saw Tim W. As soon as he saw me he rushed over to me and bent down and gave me a big, tight hug and told me how nice it was to see me. It did that two more times. I had a huge smile on my face, telling him how nice it was to see him also. I was thinking how nice it was that he seemed so happy to see me. He had a group of employees with him, maybe eight or ten people. He was behaving in ways that were not like him, at least not like I knew him to be 16 years ago. While I don't recall the behaviors now, I recall that I was disappointed to see him behaving like this.
