I was supervising my first IGA. I kept losing my location stickers. I had to put S locations up next to the normal locations for checking purposes. Esther had started checking although people hadn't finished scanning. I had only put up 2 stickers and couldn't find my sheets. I kept getting pulled away for stuff and getting distracted. Everyone ended up finishing and sitting around doing nothing and I was panicking and running around looking for my sheets. Niles was there and looking smug and I was annoyed that he had to be there while things were going wrong.
