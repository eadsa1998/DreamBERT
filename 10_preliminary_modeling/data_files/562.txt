I am coming out of church and see a bone poking out of my neck. I pull it out and it is a very long bone, like a hip bone. I feel weird and confused and want to get to the emergency room and put it back in but I am having trouble finding my car. I tell a few women about it but they seem anxious to get going. I finally find the car and drive myself to the emergency room.
