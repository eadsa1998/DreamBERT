I was at the cinema and I saw a movie and when it finished I called Mom to get me and she said she was on her way. I was then waiting outside the cinema for Mom (although sometimes it was a school).  There was a very orange cat on the opposite side of the road. This guy came and stepped on its head, squishing it. I got upset, angry and scared. I climbed up this scaffolding thing (others were sitting around on it too) to get away. I sat there for a while but then I didn't know how to get down and I asked this girl near me. She said to just jump. I jumped down and then waited for Mom. In the movie, I think, I was walking in a forest. I think sometimes it was someone else and in the movie, sometimes it was me in real life. I was yelling to someone and they shouted back from a distance. In the background I could hear breathing. I found a clearing. This girl had a friend (a loner she had befriended) who wandered off into the bush all the time. There had been a nuclear bomb or something and I can't remember properly, but I think the loner had slipped and hit her head and this had turned her into a werewolf. There was a baby and I said "ugly baby". Mom said "Yeah that is an ugly baby". I was thinking I'd never heard her call a baby ugly. In the distance, I could see the city burning.
