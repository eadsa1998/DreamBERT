I'm a stunt car driver. I'm good. I hang on as the car roars around and seconds before it crashes and burns, I jump. I am surrounded by the dense black smoke of the fire and walk out of the cloud coughing and grasping for air. Someone clamps an oxygen mask on me and we walk up the stairs. I regain my strength. We go into the boss's office and I'm very aggressive and uppity. I know I'm good and he'd better pay me well or I'll walk out.
