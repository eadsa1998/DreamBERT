First I dreamt that Mom and I were going to take a boat out with Ms. Garland and her people, and have like a little parade through the channel. And we were at the park feeding pigeons at the pond and we got up and we went home and we went in the garage and we kind of, we had to climb up this ladder to get on the boat. And Mom started it up to make sure it had plenty of fuel, and we were just standing there watching it run, and I was kind of nervous. Then we shut it off and hitched it up to the car and driving down the street, and then before I knew it, we were in the parade. And I don't remember too much after that.
