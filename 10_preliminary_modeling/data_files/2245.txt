Tyler is getting into an elevator and I call out, "Wait, I'll go with you," and I push the button of the elevator, but even though I barely touched the button, the elevator moves quickly and too far. Tyler gets out and lectures me on how to do it properly. I feel embarrassed and angry. I defend myself, "I barely touched the button." He says, "You have to learn not to drag your finger."
