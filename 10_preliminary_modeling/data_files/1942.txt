Robin (Judith's daughter) asks me if I want a piece of pie. I say, "Yes." She brings me a huge plate filled with lots of baked fruits. I say, "I can't eat this much." My daughters are nearby, looking at photos. One brings me a picture and asks where it was taken. It was Ellie at 2 or 3 years and Dwight half-grown. I say to my mother, "Mom, where was this picture taken?" She says, "Hillsboro." I say, "How old is Dwight?" She says, "16." Then everyone has taken their photos and the only ones left are Ellie's. I give them to her. I then look around for a place to be alone, but we are having a party. There are lots of guests, only they are all ghosts. The main ghost is Blackbeard the pirate. The party is over, so they all disappear. Then a boy and a girl (teenage) see a boat. The pirate makes them fall into the ocean and swim to the boat. Their clothes are not wet. I'm now on the boat. I sit on a beam hanging over the sea for a somewhat long time. I get back on the ship and get in a hammock. It's a blue cloth and the tip covers my feet. A man scoffs at me. "How can you stand being in a hammock?" We insult each other. He's a sexist pig and we're stuck with each other. I go inside and look around at the mess and try to clean it up, only each time I pick up something and think it's a mess, it turns out to be logical or necessary, except for a basket full of lids, each one wrapped in a plastic wrap. "Hmm," I say and put it back on the stove where it had been.
