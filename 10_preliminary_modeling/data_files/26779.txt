 I'm at a home I know to be that of my friends the McDyss', in a room I've never seen before. The rooms are dimly lit, if lit at all, with old brass and copper artifacts: signs of salmon and trout fishing. It seems like a room of collectors' items. The McDyss' and I and maybe others are then eating dinner. We have fruit and vegetable salads. I don't think I'll get full, but I say nothing. Rob McDyss says we're having smoked salmon for dessert. I hope we do, so I eat some food with substance. I'm outside with a group. We see the sun and moon close together in the sky, low on the horizon. People scramble for their cameras to take a photograph of this. I get my camera. I walk forward to try to get a closer shot. Something obstructs my view. I can't see one of the heavenly bodies when I do this. I back up and see the bodies shining between branches and tree trunks. I try to get the full round bodies of both in the photograph. I take the photograph.
