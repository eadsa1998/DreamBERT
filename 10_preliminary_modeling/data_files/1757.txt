I live in a rural town, sort of old west. Townsmen come to destroy my family. I escape out the back door and crawl under the porch, hoping they'll think I ran fast and chase after me off into the woods. I am worried that I made the wrong decision. A man searches around the porch area. I wasn't so smart, but I am covered up and he doesn't find me. After they leave, I decide I will masquerade as a boy to be safe, then no one will rape me or hurt me. I move to another town and get a job at a newspaper as an apprentice. I hero-worship the editor, who at first is like Clark Gable and then is an older man. I cook for him also. I grow up and am walking home to my remote cabin when a teen girl from school comes up to me and says there's something girlish about me. I think about becoming a girl again. The editor offers me a job, but it's in the town where I had left. I am afraid but go there.
