I am at some work-related meeting and have discovered that some organization needs to be done. It had been done in the past and now it hasn't been done for a while. I decide to go ahead and do it right then and there and work up some name and address sheets and a newsletter and so on so things can get going again. It was pretty easy to do. Now I go home (not familiar). Bonnie is there and Angel is outside. I am organizing piles of things: candies, utensils, toothpicks, that were in purses. I go out to see how Angel is doing and see an island where a friend lives. There is wilderness all around the island, except for the part facing my house. I start to try and figure out how to get over there. I am stopped by a group of men who are now sitting around a circle, squatted, only they are suited gangster types. I whisper to Bonnie, "I'll bet they are gangsters." She says she'll bet a Real Lean Dollar and 5 cents that they aren't. One comes up to me and asks if I am one of the Simply Four, a gangster group. I laugh and say no, but somehow this proves they are of that group. I say I am B. They have heard of me. I am now on the island and notice it is very tiny, a sand spit really, with the tamest creek going around it and a stone walk to the almost park-like "wilderness " in the back. I am a bit disappointed.
