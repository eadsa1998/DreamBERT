I was at home and we were having this gathering with lots of people. Ezra, Roland and Mom were there. There were lots of other friends of Ezra there too. I went out to my car at one point and a CD deck had been stolen. There were some mice and Ezra pulled them out of something gently. They were all pregnant. One started giving birth and there were lots of little grey mice, some had no fluid on them and were already moving around. Others were dead. I was filming it. There were some that were brown and white, white and grey and black ones. Tigger came over and sniffed them and I shooed her away from them. They were walking in a line. I went into a room and my wallet was gone. I went to the car to put the video on some stereo, but it was gone too. I was angry and I saw a few dodgy people around.
