I am standing outside and I see a wall to my left. I walk up to it and notice that is a work of art, a piece of sculpture. It is painted blue and yellow, with parts decorated in a silvery metal. I examine it closely, marvelling at intricate carvings on its surface. "I wonder if it's real", I think to myself. "It's so detailed that this can't be a dream."
