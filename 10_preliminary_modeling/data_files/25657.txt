 I'm in a swimming pool. There are two diving boards. One is in the deep end of the pool. I walk around the pool to find a bench to put my towel and two decks of cards with red backs that I am holding. The bench and the floor are wet. I find a large air conditioning-like unit protruding from the wall several feet above the pool deck. The top of it is dry. I put my towel and the cards on it. I see the diving board in the shallow end of the pool. There is a young boy going off the board. I go down towards the deep end. On my way I stop at a hot tub. The tub is nice and warm, and I am sore. I flop into it. I soon get out and walk to the diving board at the deep end. My friend Holly Lapson is there. We are going to go off the diving board at the same time. I don't go off the board. She goes and stumbles at the end of the board. She falls off the side and hits her head on the edge of the pool. I go on the board. I stumble and fall when I try to dive at the end of the board. I over-rotate and splash. I go down to the bottom of the pool. People are laughing. I laugh also. I think I may run out of air because when I laughed I exhaled all my air. But I have enough air and can push off the bottom with my legs to propel myself to the surface.
