I am the substitute driver for the LTD Bus System. I have a full bus, very crowded. I don't know the route, and follow from one bus stop sign to the next, hoping I'm doing it right. My brakes aren't working well and I have a very difficult time stopping the bus. I stand on the brakes. I decide to call for directions to know my route. I pick up the phone and meanwhile some women are crowded onto the first seat. There is standing room only on this bus and they are boisterous and pushing up against me. I demand they back off. They don't really listen. I notice I am trying to stop the bus and end up crunching a small tree, bending it over as I plow into it because my brakes are so slow to work. The woman on the phone doesn't give me good information about my route and doesn't help me with the noisy passengers. I am frustrated.
