I had moved into an apartment with some people for university. There was a big room with four single beds. There were two other girls and Zach Braff. Then it was some time later and we were all fairly good friends. We were going to the beach. Zach and I were the last to leave and were getting ready. He joked "I'll draw a map so you can find your way back". We went to the carpark first to get some Vaseline out of his car. I put it on my legs. We went down to leave and we were in this cinema like place. There were confusing stairs. We walked across to the exit which led straight to the beach. I was putting sunglasses on. We got there and Sarah Chalke and Ezra were there. Sarah and this other girl were sunbathing. Someone looked at Sarah and she was sun burnt. We covered her with a blanket and took her to the shade. Now only one side of her face was burnt? We took her back out. Some dodgy guys were hanging around. They were ok looking for beach-y people. Inara (Firefly) was facing away from them and they wanted to see what she looked like. We went back into the cinema. Some of them were buying stuff. Ezra asked if I'd seen any good new movies lately and I said "In Bruges" and I said that I was annoyed because Colin Farrell was in it. Evelyn was there too and some guys were going to pretend they were interested in her.
