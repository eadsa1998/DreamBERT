We had an excursion. I had driven there and other cars had come to (people had been allowed to drive others there). I had a navigation thing. I don't remember what the excursion was but some people had to choose a girl and then they were all put into groups and they had to have kids with the men. Kristin Bell was in a group and I said "she's going to make some ugly babies!". There were four groups. Group one had some pretty girls in it. Will Arnett was one of the guys and another hot guy (don't remember who) was in it too. I had become friends with Martin Freeman and that whole day had been recorded and it went for 78 minutes. I went to drive back. The car was small. Some random people got in the car. I was trying to work out how to reverse the path for the navigation thing. I was reading the manual and trying all sorts of things and eventually everyone left the car. I finally worked it out but I was driving too fast. At the top of the screen was a police icon. I got pulled over, sometimes I was on a motorbike. The cop said he couldn't talk to us with something in my hand. There was a helmet. I explained to him about what happened. I had no information about the bike. He drove us back. The clock said it was 3:02pm.
