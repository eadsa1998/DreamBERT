I went out hiking with my father, my three siblings, and an uncle. We walked for a good while and then we started to climb a rather steep hill. My sister and I were in the back. About half-way up we heard a noise and then the earth started to shake. it was a strong tremor. My sister and I (holding hands) went down first and we got to a flat area and there was a house (which wasn't there when we went up). From there we saw the rest of them quickly going downhill. Due to the tremor, whose intensity had increased, and to the speed gathered from the descent, they weren't able to stop where we had. Lots of rocks were falling at their backs, but before these could harm them, I awoke. It was a frightening dream; the setting was not familiar.
