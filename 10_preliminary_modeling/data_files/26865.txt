 I'm with a group of young Asian adults, my age. They talk fast. I don't feel comfortable with them because I don't fit in. They talk about their dating relationships. We're under a bridge or overpass. I'm fitting a green coin-like disk to the underside of the overpass. There are two other coin-like disks there that are a different color. The purpose of the disk is to be antagonistic: there is a woman chasing us. The coin is a sign for her, it is a clue, as if I want to keep her on my trail. I'm outside of a building. I may have just parked a vehicle. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper pulls up in an old car, parking it next to the building. I'm inside a room in the building. The room appears to be empty. There are two closet-like openings in the room that have no doors. I look in them: things appear to be neatly stacked; I don't see any people. I think or sense that people are there. I say, "Guys, it's me!" and two groups of people emerge from hiding. I'm surprised because I didn't see any places to hide in the room. The people seemed to come out of the woodwork.
