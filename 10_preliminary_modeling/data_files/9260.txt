I was ITT, but I don't recall why. Talked with numerous people I knew. I was walking around outside and decided to lay down in the grass and relax for a little while. Just as I got to the ground, I saw Leon B just inside the front door. As he looked out, I waved and jumped up to go talk to him. We talked briefly and I told him I needed to get his new contact information so I could stay in touch with him.
