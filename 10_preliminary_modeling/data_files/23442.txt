I was "above" water that was clear enough to provide a clear view of granite rocks beneath it. Next dream segment, a group of peers (family members) agreed that just punishment for mean and unloving treatment by my husband would be self-castration, unless his behavior improved. He was "on probation." The water and rock were out in the open and light. The gathering of peers -- predominantly women -- was in a circle around a fire in a cave with sand on the ground. My husband was in the middle.
