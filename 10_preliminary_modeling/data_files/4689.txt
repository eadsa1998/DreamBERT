["Rowdy kids."] I am in my office, somewhere. I am organizing my papers. Sharon my helper took off. I am expecting her to be back at 4:30PM. There are three rowdy kids. A small toddler, a 9 year old boy and a young teen girl. I am frustrated as I can't keep them quiet. I get a phone call from a woman client. I can't understand her over the noisy talking and screaming of the kids. I force them out in the hall, but now they are bugging my co-workers. I apologize to my client and suggest she wait and call back. I realize this isn't good for the client who is having a crisis now. I feel guilty for not helping her right then. I am angry at Sharon as I realize she isn't showing up. In fact, I'm thinking I'm supposed to take the kids to her. The energy of the boy is somehow transferred to the teen. She sits on my lap and tries to manipulate my mind. She wants me to think of sex. I firmly fight it off. I have work to do.
