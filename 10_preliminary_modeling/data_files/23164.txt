My wife Anita and I went to church-a small Protestant church like First Christian.  In fact, John Ellis was there, but the church was not configured exactly like that one.  The congregation was on risers, or in bleachers.  I didn't know where Anita was seated, and I looked for a place for myself.  It was crowded, and there was hardly anyplace to sit.  I found one near the front, at the end of a row, and sat down, but then realized that I was sitting in the choir.  Embarrassed, I got up and moved back farther.  Of course, it was harder to get to them, because they were higher in the back.  When I finally got settled, I realized that, while everyone else was dressed up for church, I was wearing pajamas.  So I got out of my seat again, and went to a back room to find a place to change clothes.  There were other people in the back getting ready for the service, including the minister.  I thought the service had already started, but they didn't seem to be the least bit concerned.  Someone was in the bathroom, so I had to wait, and I continued to be embarrassed.  When I finally went back to the sanctuary, I spotted Anita and sat with her.
