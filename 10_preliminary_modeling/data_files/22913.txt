My division of the agency had been split into two parts and were fairly widely separated.  Both halves, I think, were taking a class of some kind.  But there was some strange sequence about my wanting to retrieve some of my personal belongings from the other half and not being able to locate them, and some woman having some furniture, including a bed, mixed up in it.  When I located the other people, they were crammed into a small space like a back porch or railroad caboose, and Dalen Winger was with them.
