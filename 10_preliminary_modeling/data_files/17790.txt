I was at Spirit Day at the high school, helping the freshmen out since they typically need it.  Somehow it sort of turned into a battle; someone was shooting arrows at me.  My only protection was the sheet I was holding up in front of me.  The arrows were small- maybe 6 inches long, max.  The sheet stopped most of them before they hit me.  I would pull them through and throw them like darts back at my attacker.  Some of them got farther through the sheet than I realized, and had pierced my stomach.  It didn't hurt at all.  One was in pretty far and I had trouble pulling it out- I barely got it, as it was attached to a thread, so I had something to pull.  I don't remember the wounds bleeding at all- maybe the arrows were poison-tipped, though, because I was dying.  My mother told me to stay lying where I was, but I wanted to defy the weakness and do something unexpected.  I snuck out of the room- there was a tyrannical woman bent on keeping me and two friends captive.  I made it to the balcony where my female friend was, but the woman heard a noise.  We didn't have anywhere to hide.  Somehow later on we ended up in a tall building, almost like a sort of funhouse, with elevators.  I was in a dark room with a lot of aquariums, and my father was there.  Someone was trying to suffocate one of the fish; there was very little water left.  Somehow I managed to help the fish.  I rode down an elevator and randomly stopped on a floor.  I ran into one of my male friend there.  A man was coming down the hall from the other direction, so we tried sliding open a window and climbing into the display case behind it to hide, but the guy had seen where we had gone.
