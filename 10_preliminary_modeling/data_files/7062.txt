R and I are by a window when R knocks a pillow out. It falls on the edge of a roof below. We can't reach it. I get a broom to push it off but it is still too far. I ask, "Are your arms longer?" R pushes it off. Then I see us on the ground below. "How did you get here?" ... I have a flask of juice. The other two are thirsty. I want to give them a taste. Pick up paper cups but they look mildewed inside. Turn to doll dishes. But the water already in the cups would dilute the juice. Use spoons and have trouble in not spilling. Give them tastes. My juice will be gone.
