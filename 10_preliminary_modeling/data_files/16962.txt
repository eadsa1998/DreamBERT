I'm walking through a town at night, when I notice an old woman falling over, because she is startled by a horse and rider who get very close to her. She falls to the pavement and bangs her head. Immediately several people surround her and help her up. I call for an ambulance. About a minute later, an ambulance man walks up the road with a clipboard, and starts asking questions and marking the answers in marker pen on a wipe-clean questionnaire on his clipboard. It seems to me that this isn't a real medical person, but a crazy man with a bizarre and macabre hobby. I leave the scene and go to the hospital to report him. It turns out I was wrong - he was real - which is very bizarre. Why was he asking questions and not getting the woman to hospital?
