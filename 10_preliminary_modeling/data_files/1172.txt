Saturday. Lots and lots of little cute fuzzy kittens are playing under my feet. I have to step very carefully so as not to hurt them. They belong to my mother. I ask her where my toothbrush is. She says, "I put it with mine." I go to her room slowly as the kitties pile under my feet. At first I can't find it. I break a pretty vase. Then I find the brushes in a box at the foot of her bed. My grandma Agnes asks me if I need help finishing my needle work projects. I say, "No," and start listing the projects. She says, "Don't forget to finish your name on your tummy." By the time I finish listing my projects, I regret not accepting her offered help.
