There were aliens at school. We all had guns and stuff, but we were shooting at each other. Some girl realized that I was good at killing people so she showed me where extra ammo was. Those honkey nut things were the ammo. They acted like a plunger and didn't work that well. Evelyn and this girl were together. Evelyn jumped out of this window then they both went under a car. I lifted the car to help them. Evelyn ran and she was fast but she fell over. We had to blow up some hotel and this room somewhere to kill all the aliens. These people in the hotel all had the same look and room and they had cats and hats.
