Someone and I went to this famous person's house. There was a band called Petrol Station who had made Snow Patrol famous. I walked down the road to the house and there was a big patch of grass. We went in and there were people walking around. There was food on the table and they let us eat. It was all lollies and sugary stuff. The guy we were here to see walked past and then we couldn't find him. We were in a lounge room. These guys came up to the door and I went to open it and then they were gone. They were coming back up the stairs and round a bend, so I ran to the door and screamed and it scared them. I locked the door. There were biscuits and chocolates in the fridge and took some.
