I was at a place that had some books; I think it was a library. There was a group of people, all ladies, wearing a few different clothes, but about 3-4 people were wearing the same outfit. There was a man, but he was a crazy retard guy. There was a bookcase next to him and I was trying to look, but his arm kept flapping. Somewhere else, Dad mentioned how he liked it when Ken (A Fish Called Wanda) yawned or something.
