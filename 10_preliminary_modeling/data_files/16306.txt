I was having a real problem. First I dreamt that I had like overslept, and the bus had come like too early and it was just going on ahead. And when I tried to look at the time when I thought that the bus was coming, the clock was like going crazy and just crazy stuff like that. I dreamt that I didn't understand natural logarithms at all, and whenever, and my calculator would act up too, and whenever I would enter in a natural logarithm, it would go, "Error function" and it would do something really screwy. And I think because of that, Melinda was trying to get me back into Ms. Forrest's class, who was my teacher last year, first semester. She wanted me to just be there while Ms. Forrest was reviewing something. But in order to be in Ms. Forrest's class I had to skip Ms. Marcos's class. That was just a dumb dream about math!
