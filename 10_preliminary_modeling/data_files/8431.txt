I had gone to a shopping mall. As I was driving through the parking lot I noticed how far away from the building some of the cars were parked. Then I realized that they belonged to employees. It was late in the afternoon. I was thinking that was a long way for employees to walk in the dark to get to their cars after the stores close. It was either kind or brave or both for them to park that far away so customers could park closer to the building. I wondered if the mall had a shuttle service to shuttle employees to their cars at night, to keep them safe. Then I remembered that a long time ago when I worked at the mall they didn't have such a service. I also didn't remember parking that far away or having to walk that far at night, which is when I usually worked.
