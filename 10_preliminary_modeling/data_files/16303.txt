Dad was one of the people who trained the people on American Dreams. He was really doing a lot of stuff with the City, but I dreamt that he was training these actors and actresses and he was part of the scenery. And I was asking him about what he does, and he didn't want to tell because he said he's sworn to secrecy and he doesn't want the word to get out. And I was thinking, "Man, that's a show that I really like, and I never knew that my dad was part of it until now?" And let's see, I know there was something else. And we were taking this walk, and he was kind of telling me something. And we were with Clark and Marilou and a couple other people. And I think I was in a hurry to get home because I knew Mrs. Dougherty was coming over, so then I tell him I'm going to break away from the crowd and I start running. And I'm almost home, and then I woke up.
