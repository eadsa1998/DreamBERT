My husband, my daughter, and I were taking a trip to the state where my husband's family is and we were all packed and everything. We drove up there. Then it seems it was the next day and I was in bed. We were supposed to still be in my husband's hometown and I had a little baby, another one. I had no idea in the world that I had had it. It was very strange and I figured they must have given me something really powerful, anesthesia or something, to make me completely not remember anything about it. I don't even know whether it was a little boy or girl, and it turned out that it was a little girl, which was sort of disappointing. And there was something strange about the whole thing. I hadn't been that pregnant or something and it shouldn't have happened. I shouldn't have had the baby, but at any rate there it was. It was as big as my daughter (now 18 months old). I was showing her the baby, and she was very happy with it, seemingly. My mother-in-law seemed happy with it. I think all of these dreams reflect the fact that I'm pregnant and also worried that I might have a miscarriage.
