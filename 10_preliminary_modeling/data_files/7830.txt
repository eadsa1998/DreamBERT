I was leaving this shopping center to go home and noticed that someone had built this very tall and very, very long blue fence. There was a subdivision on the other side but I didn't know how to get around the fence to get home as the fence seemed to be a mile or more long. I didn't see the end of the fence. Maybe that's why I though I couldn't get around it. I decided to just fly over the fence to get home. Even after I flew over the fence, I couldn't find my house. I was in this neighborhood and I was driving along these sidewalks between the houses-kind of like the sidewalks behind the apartments here. People and children were running to get out of my way. I didn't seem to think I was going to hit anyone.
