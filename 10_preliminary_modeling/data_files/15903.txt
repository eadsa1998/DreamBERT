I was outside on a road at night. I think it was Wanneroo Road. There was no-one driving on it, but there were cars in heaps everywhere and lots of trucks on their sides (lots of those fuel tank types). At one point they all started going up in flames and I was trying to run around them and get to safety. Later, there were zombies or something and we were trying to sneak around.
