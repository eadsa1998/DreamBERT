I was walking around outside a stadium. There was a woman's softball game going on inside. A woman went in and asked if she could join in the game. She was accepted. There were a bunch of people milling around. I noticed the heavyset man who looked kind of sad and was walking really slowly. I suddenly had the urge to show him I could fly. I made myself levitate 20-30 ft in the air then came back on the ground. The man stared at me in awe, then said, "Wow, that's amazing." I told him that he could fly too, that all he had to do was relax his mind and imagine the air pushing him up underneath his feet. He did and the two of us levitated above the stadium. We had an incredible view of the game and the ocean.
