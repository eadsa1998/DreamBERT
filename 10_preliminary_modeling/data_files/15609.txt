I was at the old house and the neighbours were across the road. I went into the study to see this fat, old, Native woman lying on the pouffe thing. I yelled 'what are you doing here? Get the hell out!' and she waddled out. The window in the lounge room was lifted up and there was no lock. A lady was trying to get in and failed and left. Two guys with uniforms on were at the door. I was suspicious and kept asking them questions. I went to get something and came back to see them trying to get in. I tried to hold the lock down but somehow it got pushed up. I'd grabbed a knife and I threatened them with it. I think I cut one guy and he pulled out a gun and I didn't know what to do.
