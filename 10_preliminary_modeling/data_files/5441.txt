I had a dream that I was dressed up in different Halloween costumes, except I was part of some Avatar world where people were trying to kill me. Bryson and I were running around trying to hide by putting different costumes on. Then I went back to school, where I weighed myself and realized I had gained 65 pounds over winter break. I was horrified and upset. Maybe it's just the costume that weighs so much, I thought, but I knew that it wasn't.
