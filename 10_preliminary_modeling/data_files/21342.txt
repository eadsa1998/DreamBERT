Loddie gave me a can. I thought it was water and I drank about half of it and he said it was castor oil. So for a counteractive, he gave me lubricating oil and I tasted it and couldn't drink it. I was by Dr. Conn's home on the street. I was working and the Jew next to us had some kind of shop. I did some of his work for him. I was cleaning out the machine and it seemed like ashes that were there. Bernice was sitting on the floor with her knees up and I looked down at her and I could see her vagina. I looked into a shoot and there was a pile of rags. I could see the black hair around her vagina.
