 I'm playing cards with my brother Wally and sister Ramona. We're on the hill of 2nd Street. We're waiting. We're playing 2-handed 500. There are three of us; I'm a partner with Ramona. I look at my cards. I almost have a straight flush in low spades. I bid nine spades. I get the joker, an ace, and a low spade in the kitty. I have a straight flush, then, luckily. There are two of some cards. I lead the joker, and draw out two low spades. I then lead a low spade. Wally plays the left bower, and Ramona plays the right bower. Ramona then takes the lead in an off suit. I play the ace of that suit, and Wally trumps it. He is short-suited. Wally has the next remaining highest trump, including the ace and king of spades. I have low trump, but they won't take tricks in this case. Wally sets us, because I don't have high enough trump, even though I have lots of low trump. We switch partners: I'm going to play against them. It seems to be spring, and we seem to be waiting for someone or something.
