I was watching an episode of a show like Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction. This girl was outside her house and her dog didn't let her come back inside or put her shoes. She had hurt her leg. She lived next to some bush area and she dragged herself down the track with the dog. It turned out there was a snake in her shoe and in the house and it would've killed her. It turned out to be a true story.
