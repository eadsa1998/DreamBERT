There was another season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it was season 9. Her mother was a bot, and I think Buffy was too. Her sister was a baby. Spike was over. All these robots came and, like vampires, had to be invited in, but they had some way around it. I was then Buffy and I was shooting them and giving weapons to others. One then got out this clock thing which we knew was dangerous and so activated this thing we had and ran and got sent into another world. We were at a school and Buffy was sitting at a table in a grassy section talking to a friend about slaying. Someone there fixed our device so we had more control over where we went with the device. In that world, people could change their names whenever they wanted. In the next world, her mother was still alive, but she wasn't. I was watching Smallville and Clark and his girlfriend, who was Mena Suvari, were going to have sex. He was lying naked on the bed and I thought that was odd for Smallville to have full frontal nudity. Lana was in the room too and she was a bot and was naked and lying on the ground.
