I am traveling on a mountain road and look out over the vista. I see cars going into two huge twin tunnels far off in the distance. I see a lake and beautiful mountains. I travel on with my group. Then we meet my cousin Abner on the road. I introduce him to a man in the group. Abner is uptight and unsure of himself and begins to shake and tremble. I remark that he has the "family" trait of fear around other people. He and I go off down the road without the group. We find ourselves in a deep hole with furniture in it. We climb up the huge dresser to the top of it and look out. We see lots of bunk beds in the woods, a camp of some kind. Abner jumps down to the ground and I am to follow, only it's a long jump and I am worried. He holds his arms out wide as if to catch me and grins. I then turn to go down; I hang on to the edge of the dresser top like I'm hanging off a cliff edge and then see handles and go down, using them as hand and foot holds. I didn't have to jump after all. I see the handles are on drawers and open one to see fleece pajama jeans for the campers. Now we go exploring and go around a corner to see a group of people singing religious songs. We turn and try to sneak away, realizing we've stumbled on a radical cult group. Now some are coming for us, one woman singing a fundamental hymn. We run back to the hole and get in. They are coming for us. I suggest we hide in a corner under a table, but they see us. This isn't good.
