I am jogging quite a long distance down city streets. I am slim, young and healthy. I am tiring my body out and looking forward to the creative writing I will do after this "mind emptying" meditation while I run. I get to the University and turn right. I find my dorm. I jog down a hall. The doors are very ornate, carved wood and pretty. I find my room. I will it to be a single room. I go in to see I need to clean it up. I will the bath room to be in a different place than it is. I get in the shower still partially clothed and lather up the soap. I spend lots of time rubbing soap all over me. I have shampoo lathered in my hair. I rinse the soap off and start to towel my hair. I realize the shampoo is still there. So I rinse my hair as well. I am very tired.
