We were at the lake--sort of like a big round fountain. People were around the outside of the lake like numbers on a clock. Dora was in a little room off to the side, watching TV with her legs crossed Indian style. She was picking up useless things one by one and dumping them in a trash can ??? then I tossed out some sour milk in a quart container I had. There was some half and half that had gone sour too. I looked at the calorie content as I tossed it away. We were waiting in a front room. I was wearing the Winnie the Pooh pants Evelyn gave me. An Asian guy with thick glasses and trendy hair was wearing Winnie the Pooh pants too. He rolled them up to show he had Dumbo the Elephant pants under those. He laughed real loud and said, "Wardrobe provided by Michael Ackerman." Dora drove the old blue station wagon over to Tom Haney's house. He was having band practice and there was a piano sitting out front. First I wanted to play . Then I knew I didn't have to play to show him. I knew and this was enough. So I didn't even though I had my music with me. I was wearing pants--blue jeans with paint all over them and a green shirt that said "Fort Moultrie where the pocket would've been. I was glad I was not dressed to try to impress him. A guy with long dark hair had his head down and I said, "Hi Pete," but it was not Pete at all. Me and Dora laughed that I had made a mistake and Tom was uncomfortable and he didn't know what to say. We went to Eileen's house. It was in the lower East Side. It was always Christmas there. A big white apartment, bright and airy. I was waiting for Eileen. She was getting ready behind the bedroom/bathroom door. We were talking through the door.
