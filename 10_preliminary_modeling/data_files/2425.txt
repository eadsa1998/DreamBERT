I'm in a room, large, a sink on one wall, so maybe its a kitchen. I like this man and he likes me. There is a child, a girl. We love her. Mirabelle comes in. She's upset because of her blindness. I talk about my feelings about disability. She's complaining that people always over-help her. I agree. The man gently asks if he ever did that. I tell him yes. When we first met, he did some of the usual things AB's do around disabled people. I don't want to hurt his feelings. I finish the dishes. Then Mary and I sit on a table which is on wheels and we accidentally roll over to where the man is sitting. He introduces us to his wife, a pretty young woman with brown eyes and a pageboy hair cut. She's partially deaf and I hear it in her voice. I am surprised and sad that he's married. I say hello to her and we talk.
