 A man walks in a tourist area where there are numerous whorehouses. People are playing chess in the area. A man talks on a microphone in the area, to the man walking. The speaker is half mocking the man, and half coercing him to do what he wants. The walking man is lower down in a parking ramp area, where he talks with the speaker. The speaker wants the walking man to falsify kissing and sexual acts. To appease the speaker, the walking man pretends to kiss him, but doesn't ever kiss him on the lips. This seems to be to demonstrate a purpose, for the public, to encourage or advertise somehow. There is a young Asian man and a woman there. The man seems to have just awakened, and the woman comments that he didn't put his hands in his pants nearly as much as she thought he would. At one point, the Asian man tells the woman to stop touching/arousing him because he'll get an erection. There is another white couple there.
