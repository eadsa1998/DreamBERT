 Grandma Redding comes up to me and starts to sit down next to me. She falls forward. She is weak and can't sit on the ground easily. I catch her and we talk. She tells me she is 41 years old. It's clear to me that she is dying. She is old, weak, and frail. She tells me she is going on vacation to the Bahamas. I think this is suspicious because of her weak condition. We're in a swimming pool. Grandma can't swim alone: she sinks if she tries to do this. My sisters Heather and Ramona and I help her stay afloat and swim. I climb the ladder out of the swimming pool supporting Grandma in front of me. This is difficult to do because she is heavy. I'm proud to do this myself. She reaches for a towel from someone in the pool and falls in. My brother Wally and I lift her out of the water. She is short: her body is at most three feet high. We lift her up onto the deck of the pool. She is like a baby: weak and helpless. This is a Redding family gathering, so the family is here.
