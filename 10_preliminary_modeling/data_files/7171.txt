I was to help a student study a test. It disturbed me that the beds were not made yet. Well mine had been made. The pink blanket had been pulled out at the foot when hunting for something. The data for the test was printed on a loose sheet. The girl asked if she could write notes on it. I told her no but that she might borrow the sheet but I wanted it returned. There were four points to be made. Name or purpose of test. I illustrate why the name is not always explicit. If it was called a test of selfishness and you did not want to acknowledge that you were selfish, you would not be honest in your answers. Then we were looking in a large pot of various flowers finding small yellow ones. Then we returned to the test. I asked her if she had studied Tests and Measurements. "No." The third point, administration or directions, is discussed. Validity next (But I woke then).
