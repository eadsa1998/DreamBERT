I went to the store to buy a newspaper, which cost three cents. Had a five dollar bill with me, but I needed the change. The person who waited on me apparently couldn't make change for he keep over charging me. I keep insisting that the paper was only three cents, that he wasn't giving my correct change. I was growing impatient as I was suppose to have an appointment at 8 o'clock. I don't remember who the appointment was with however. It was growing very late, and getting dark outside. I remember calling to another person, apparently the owner of the store to come over &amp; show this boy how to count. He told me the reason for the mistake was that you had to pay for the service besides the paper, and so it really wasn't a mistake at all. The last thing I remember is that I left the store without the paper, already late for my appointment and very upset.
