["Cleaning up."] I am outdoors at a university like setting. A man points out a device that landed on the lawn. I go with him to examine it out of curiosity. He wonders how it landed and I point out the small handkerchief sized parachute. I wonder how it got up there in the first place. I then see a bar with railings with string or something that had snapped at each rail indicating it was tied to some other device and rocketed up then broke free and landed. Dwight comes over and saws the bar in half. I am shocked and tell him how stupid to do that. It wasn't ours to mess with. He is frustrated and upset with himself and surely doesn't like me saying what he already knows. I call him stupid again. The man tells me I shouldn't say that. Now I am frustrated and upset with myself because I know it is wrong to do and doesn't help anything besides. Dwight walks away. I go into a Home Economics class. There dirty dishes piled in one of the three sinks lining the two walls. I feel helpful and decide I will wash them for however left them to soak. Now another woman is helping and I put the glasses and some bowls in her sink to wash. I wash the utensils. It feels good to be cleaning up for someone else.
