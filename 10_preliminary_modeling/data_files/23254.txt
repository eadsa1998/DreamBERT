I am in an office.  My desk faces the door, which is closed.  A woman is working at a desk to my left, against the wall, so that her back is to me.  She has an assistant, who has left.  The woman tells me, without turning her head, "If you ever want to examine me, you are welcome to do it."  I am a little surprised.  "Examine you?" I say.  "What do you mean, 'examine you'?  What part of you?"  "Any part you want to," she replies, and then I understand what she means.  I ask her if her assistant is coming back, and she says that she has left for the day.  I don't remember anything specific about what happens afterwards, but it is pleasant, and it becomes clear that her invitation was a euphemism for "Anything goes".
