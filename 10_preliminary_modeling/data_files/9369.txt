Marilyn Monroe is being interviewed. She loves drugs: "I like J&amp;B Scotch, uppers, downers, and cocaine." Then a photograph shows first from knees to navel--she's wearing a slight bikini bottom. As experts talk about her, one says, "She uses drugs like groceries." Then the photograph is full-length, and I look at her from waist up, as closely as a doctor looks at an X-ray. Her breasts are big and beautiful at a glance. But on a closer look, they are squarish and lumpy. Instead of a nipple, she has three, like end of a Norelco shaver, with each circle smaller but almost as flat. Not sexy at all. Her breastbone just below her neck is a triangular plate just below the skin--all the skin in the upper area from navel up is transparent, like glass or a film negative or a thick plastic where you can just barely see what it wraps. The plate with a button shape in each corner seems to be silver. Below all her skin I see blood vessels as faint blue and nerves as white wires.
