Ezra and I became door-to-door salesman for fences. A guy bought some from me. Some lady's husband had gotten leprosy from a friend who went crazy. He didn't recognize anything and was basically a vegetable. I had gotten famous for some reason. I had Twitter, and a tweet of mine was rated the 5th most popular tweet. I had lots of others in the list too. Dad had some too. There was this group of guys that would get people pregnant and then you would bring the baby's and they would rebirth it? I went to one place and Eric (True Blood) and two other vampires were there. They were holding someone, I think. The person they were holding was trying to convince them to let them turn him. I told them not to do it. Eric got angry and went close to me. He liked me though, I think, and he punched me in the face. Then I was Sookie (True Blood) and there was a close-up of her nose. Pam was there too and she said "it only takes a bit of blood" (to excite them). Sookie said "well, it's coming" (as in, her nose was going to bleed).
