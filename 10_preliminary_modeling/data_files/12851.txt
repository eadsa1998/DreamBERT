I was at a licensing place. Daryl was there and he had failed his test. Someone asked him how some pregnancy tests went. Dewey was there too. Then it was lunch at school. We were talking and he started dealing out cards. The game was really confusing. I went to the toilet. Then we were at Nana's, except it was home. Ezra and Dad were there. Poppa said no smoking and no kids in the room (games room). We had to go outside and I was complaining. I said "We can't change it" and Dad told me to "accept it" and I was like "What the hell?! I just said that!".
