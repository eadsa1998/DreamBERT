On a big playing field in my home state (though it looked like a professional baseball stadium), completing on-field obstacles with two other martial artist guys. I was bigger, faster and stronger, but they were more skilled at flips, tricks and techniques. We were completing tasks... The field turned into a house on campus. Morning was creeping upon us. Girls were there watching. I swung from a bar on the ceiling to kick in a curtain/screen. It was quite a distance, but I managed to cover it and kick the target. But my damage was minimal. I was going to run to get something to improve my flight... then, though, morning came. People were running to run. I was running to get somewhere. It felt so good just to run and not get tired. Like driving really fast on an open road, only with the satisfaction of knowing its all you. There was a field to my left, with a construction curtain thing on stakes. It was filled with huge, colorful toads. Then I went on to school.
