I asked a fellow what I should play and he said, "Fresh Up" and another one I can't recall now. I was walking by and I marked or started to write on a bulletin where a fellow was writing on. I marked Jim or started to do it and I did the same on another board with my pen. My pen kind of stuck and I didn't write Jim in full. I was digging or going to dig up roots that few after the plants were cut down and they interfered with the planting in the ground.
