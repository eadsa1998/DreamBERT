 I'm with a group of American students watching a bunch of television screens displaying the weather reports in different parts of the United States. We are in New South Wales. I see it is 91 degrees in Montana, and 95 degrees in New York. Grandma Redding and my mom are there. The news is on these screens. At this point it seems to be one larger screen. As the news ends we see grandpa Redding on the screen in the crowd behind the reporter. The news ends, and grandma goes to grandpa, who is then not in the crowd but there in real life. They hug each other and rub noses. My uncles Nelson and Vev Redding are there. I shake their hands. One of them hugs me from behind. I'm in a mall-like area with another man. Ambulances have come for many people: injured or victims, it seems. There are men who prepare the victims to be taken away by the ambulances. They come up to use and pull our sleeves down, altering our dress, and start to pull down my pants. I tell the man that I'm not hurt, and that if I have to have my pants down to let me take them down, and not to do it right now so I stand with my pants down waiting for the ambulance.
