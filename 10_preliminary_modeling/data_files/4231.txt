["Magnetic building."] I am in an old house. My mother and my father are around, other relatives and Aunt Marianne. I see on the floor small cute miniatures lined up. They nearly cover all the floor space. I start picking some up to get them out of harm's way since the relatives keep walking in and out of the house. I go to the door and look out across the deep canyon to the huge mansion across the way. I watch as a huge platform part of the roof opens up and the house turns like on a turntable. I am amazed. Aunt Marianne is behind me also watching. Then I feel a magnetic force pulling at my body. I struggle to remain where I am, but it increases in strength until I and then Marianne are pulled right off our porch and fly across the canyon and are deposited in the top floor of this mansion. Some clerk type person, very bored is there. I ask them where are we. He doesn't respond but pushes a lever and a door opens and we are propelled inside a tiny room like an elevator. Lovely wood paneling and floor. The elevator room moves down and opens. We walk out.
