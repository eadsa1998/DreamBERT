I lived with Stephen Merchant. He had a female friend visiting and staying with us for a bit. I was annoyed, but didn't voice this opinion. I was in my room and he had come back from the shop and was talking to the friend saying 'I know you love mangoes' and then something about 'Izzy likes these marshmallow Santa's' and I smiled and tried not to giggle because it sounded so ridiculous but was also happy that he knew I liked them. At some point I was somewhere with Analisa and she had a photo with David Tennant - I took it, so I also took a bit of video. She was really excited and happy about it. Later, there were these chairlifts (but like, a bus) and I got put on the female only one, which gave you less points. It was for reforming people? An old lady was on there and was whinging about how girls in her day worked and didn't do nasty things and I said something witty and cutting to her, and she responded back with something that made no sense and everyone cheered and clapped for her and I was like wtf is wrong with these people. But two seconds later we were just chatting as normal. We saw one of these lifts get struck by lightning, catch on fire and crash. It was very dark grey out there and everyone started freaking out. I was stuck somewhere with a couple of male friends. I had my Portal gun on me initially but it squirted water. I was messing around with it at a park. A guy came and wanted to play with it, but I was worried he'd break it and said no. He said he wanted one and I said it was pretty expensive, he said "$1500" and I said 'not that expensive'. One of my friends got into a fight with him later when he confronted us at night in this storage container. Later we were waiting in this shop and I bought some chips. They were really salty. I thought I'd lost my wallet earlier in the fight, but my other friend had it.
