I am at my parents'. I am packing some things from a trip. A man likes me. He's arrogant. We all get in a van. He and I sit in the seat behind my father, who drives. The man and I cuddle. We kiss. It's pleasant, but I am aware he is emotionally distant, kissing me to "show" my father who's boss. Later, I am shopping. I see a man with a yellow shoe. He has it on his hand and is tap dancing with it. I am pleased and put on a pair, yellow satin. I tap dance. The man comes by and tells me to stop. He forbids me to tap dance. I am upset with him. I follow him to my parents house, rich, yellow color. Soft, we live there with my parents. I resent this. My mother lays a beautiful white lace night gown on my bed and wants the man and me to make love on it so the blood spots will help someone have babies.
