I was working for my chiropractor, I think.  Was waiting for my paycheck to come through the email, but the mail system seemed to be down.  I left for a while and when I came back, it connected.  I got a couple emails about Mining and other things, and then I realized with horror that I'd forgotten completely about a geology class after the first meeting.  I'd missed the midterm on the 14th.  I was going to fail, and I wouldn't be able to graduate.  I went in the rumpus room to tell my mother.  She asked if she should get me a hamster, and complained that I hadn't taken care of the last one very well.  There was talk about it not being healthy when we got it- it had sweaty pits.
