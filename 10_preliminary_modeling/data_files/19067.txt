I was dreaming I was teaching my color guard. I remember it was during the daytime, and I can recall the color guard going down the field. I remember that I was teaching them a new drill, and it was near the end of the show. I remember that, telling one girl that she was to turn around and go back the other way, and then turn around and come back this way again. [Day residue: I am making changes in my drill on the color guard, and I've been doing a lot of discussing of it lately. In fact, today I was discussing over the phone about changes in drill and types of equipment we carry. I have been doing a lot of writing. However, this particular drill I visualized in my dream wasn't exactly the change I had in mind. I remember in the dream the guard was practicing during the daytime, but this is rare because in real life they practice at night.]
