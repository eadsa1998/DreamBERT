I was at school but I didn't know why I was there. I, along with some others, got invited to spend some time with Barack Obama. He was doing a speech to some Europeans. This lady had written down some notes for the speech but he couldn't read her writing. I had a quick look and got 'inertia'. Her writing was very long, straight and close together. They then gave some people cue cards instead. Two of the important people left and he couldn't start his speech, so he tried to stall it. Calvin was there too. Obama was giving people prizes. He handed around a cardboard box full of little stuff. There was a Star Wars action figure in there, I took a pencil thing. When he finished, we got sent to a class to wait. Lorelei was talking to some black kid and said "you're bi" and proceeded to say how bad it is being gay and as I walked past, I said 'idiot' under my breath. I called Mom and told her to get me. Izaiah was in the room and he asked if I'd done some thing with Ms Myzshka (don't remember how to spell it) and I said no and he said he'd told someone that I had added her as a friend on Facebook and so I hadn't been allowed to do whatever the thing was.
