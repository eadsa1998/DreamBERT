I was at a birthday party, and present were, as I remember, my girlfriend (20), my brother (29) and my sister-in-law (27). They sang "Happy Birthday" to me. There was a huge, decorated birthday cake in the center of the table. Ever time I counted the candles on the cake they increased in number. Amazed at this, I was told that when one reaches 21, the rest of his life passes quickly, and I shouldn't be surprised at this at all. Even in the dream this did not make sense to me but worried me intensely.
