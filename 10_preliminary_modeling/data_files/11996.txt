I was at someone's house and I was out the back with some people and they found a leech. I was scared of it and they were throwing it around trying to get rid of it. It landed on my thumb and latched on. I was screaming and we tried everything to get it off, flinging, pulling, burning, but nothing worked. Nana came out of the house telling me to shut up and she got it off.
