I was in the locker room at school- it was the first day and we were finding our lockers.  Interestingly they had our names on them rather than numbers.  The clothes I was putting on weren't mine, they were too big.  I guess after school I went to visit a young male Indian friend of mine, I guess who I'd met online.  He'd disappeared for a while and I was out front waiting when my father drove up and pulled me into the car.  My friend reappeared right as he started to drive off.  I told my father I wanted to stay but that didn't seem to matter.  I looked out the window and felt bad- my friend probably didn't know what was going on.  We met my mother at some sort of PTA meeting.  I think at some point I just walked out.  I was in a room with several Asian kids.  Someone said something about someone proposing to "her".  I don't know if that was me or one of the other girls in the room.  There was an Asian girl sitting on a chair and I was supposed to lick her stomach, for some reason.  In the next room was a younger friend of mine.  He asked me to sit on his "lap" (he was crouched on his knees).  So playfully I did, and I could start to feel his hardening penis poke me.  I teased him about it a little bit.  I don't know what happened after that but it sounded like someone was coming in through the door, and my best friend Emma pushed me to the ground right in front of the door.  I didn't have my bra on.  The parents came in, and surprisingly didn't say anything.  I scooted another few feet into the bathroom to get dressed.  There was blood in random spots on toilet paper rolls around the room and other people in the bathroom with me.  Once dressed I left the room- someone's parents owned a restaurant, but I couldn't figure out if it was Indian or Chinese.  The walls were dark red.  My mother was at one of the tables.
