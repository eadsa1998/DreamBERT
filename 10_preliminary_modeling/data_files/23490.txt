I am going to watch a famous baseball team play. My mother is explaining her years in Florida to me. She tells me about how she used to "rock" all the time -- all night long. I ask who the players are in a photo of the team. When I guess about one of their names, she corrects me. She tells me about the Cuban-Reggae-Gangsters (they might be players) on the team. The team sounds mean and rough and they look frightening old, big and tough.
