At our neighbors watching TV; I have much INDECISION -- what to wear; what I think of the TV show, etc. I put on a brassiere, a white dress and yellow men's shoes Then we go walking with Frank and WALLY -- up and down climbing steep and dangerous places; I see Wally grab a protrusion that barely holds; he combs down safely. I take an easier way.
