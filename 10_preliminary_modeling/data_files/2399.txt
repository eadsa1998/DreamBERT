I am the mother of Dwight, Jake and Ellie. I am very harried and frustrated. I'm trying to cook breakfast and I turn on a burner on the stove. I look again and see a pile of napkins on a burner starting to flame. I poke them and turn off the burner. I call out "Ellie" angrily. She left this mess. I see more flames and I see a bra burning in one deeply recessed burner. I try to get it out with a stick. The whole thing is a total mess. I then notice the stove is really a recliner chair, badly burned and charred. I turn to the sink to get a poached egg. There are egg shells floating in it, and filth is in the sink. I am disgusted and angry at my children. Jake is about to leave and I say to him, "If you don't put away the milk it will stay out and go bad and you won't have any for dinner." He ignores me and leaves. I feel angry and put upon.
