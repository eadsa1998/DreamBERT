We still lived at the old house. Something happened and Dad was dying and we thought it was supposed to today, but he was ok. The next morning, he was dead. I woke up (my room was the old office) and Ezra had posted all this stuff of us with Dad when we were little with RIP's. I left my room and discovered Ezra had left his body in bed and hadn't done anything about it yet. Mom came over and I started crying and she hugged me and said it would be ok and I said 'no it won't'.
