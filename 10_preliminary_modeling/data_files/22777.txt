I was with my mother in a taxi and we were going to a movie. We met a blonde and rather fat girl and since she was in a hurry, she started to drive herself. She knew the route very well, and the driver liked the idea and gave her his seat. We got to the movies. Next to it was a store. In it they sold stuff for hair care. I asked for a couple of things and put one of them in the bag I was carrying, without meaning to keep it, but the salesgirl didn't see it that way, I think. We went into the movie theater, which was very nice, and we sat in the front rows. In the movie I saw an actor I like very much and I don't remember any more.
