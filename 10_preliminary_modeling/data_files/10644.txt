I was on the beach and aliens were coming to invade my friends and family. When they arrived, we were all in a closed garage. The aliens could go right through the garage and did. They took everyone hostage except me, who they got information from. All of a sudden, I was riding down a dark and gloomy street and I saw one of my friends and asked him how it was being in the alien movie, but I didn't know or realize that I was also in the movie.
