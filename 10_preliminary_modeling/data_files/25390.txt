 I'm at Mason Cafeteria at Brimson with my roommate Stephen Ramos. There are two women standing on a table talking loudly to get everyone's attention. People leave. Stephen and I leave too. Everyone rushes to put his or her trays away where the deli used to be located. The people working at the cafeteria make everyone go back and site down. Everyone does. Stephen and I sit in a little booth for two people. We then return out trays and leave. I grab a handful of cookies on the way out. We walk out. It is dark out, and is early morning. It has snowed a little bit. The night is nearly over.
