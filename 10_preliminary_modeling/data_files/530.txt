I am in a Christmas program. I look above and see a big thing like a bale of hay that is going to come down on us. I know we are going to have to scatter the night of the play or be hit by it. The director comes back and hands a baby to the person next to me. I think my parents will be there and then I realize my father is dead. Someone named Dave is in the program. I talk to him about a story and ask who else I can interview. He says Shelly because she is a mother. I say that doesn't count. He says Frank is a butcher. I say that is a possibility.
