I was at a place. I don't remember it properly, but there was this game where you drag a barrel to this thing over the water and create points. It was then a Runescape skill and you could have different pets. I left there and we needed to pick something up. Someone called Ari (Entourage) to ask where he was (he was dropping something off) and he was driving. He said "Yeah, I'm on the runway!" (a joke). I was going somewhere and Mom was picking up the thing. I was almost home when I realized that I was driving alone. I had been going 120km/h as well. I called Mom but she was just like "it doesn't matter". When I turned onto our street I was walking. There was a really big truck on the street. This lady said it was nuclear. This fat guy was walking with me. I got home and these two guys were standing out the front. One of them was Christian Camargo. They had been there earlier that day too. I said "you guys are still here!" and unlocked the doors and went inside.  They came in too and the fat guy was following me around. Christian asked if he was supposed to still be around and I said no, so this guy there shouted "Austin! Go away!". Ezra was somewhere too. This guy had a board of who he was interested in lately. It said "Fergie, blood period" and Rihanna was there too, but she looked like Emilie de Ravin.
