I have a huge house and my parents are there somewhere. I have invited several women to stay a while and they and their sisters from a sorority are moving their stuff in. I had seen them on the sidewalk looking for a place to stay. I say to my mother, "Not all these women are staying." Meanwhile two men are moving in. They want to know where to put their cereal. I show them the shelves, "The bread here, the desserts there." My father is concerned there will be so many people there will be no room for us comfortably. I point out this is a big house. The women will live on the top floor. There is, I realize, another huge recreation room complete with kitchen down the hall, so our nuclear family setup won't be over run. I see an alcove and am looking for a place to set up mailbox, pigeon holes in a desk and a hutch. I open a drawer and see kids' toys. At first I try and hide them from Charla so she won't come mess them up and lose them. Then I tell everyone, "This is the playroom and everyone needs to be responsible and put away each game after they are done and be sure not to lose pieces." Then I feel OK about leaving them there, as several adults are there to supervise and I don't have to be responsible.
