Charley C. and I were watching a cow's rear end as she would pucker up her holes. Then they would open and the waste matter would come out. The holes seemed to be very big and she seemed to have more than two. At the shop the company had coats and pants furnished for us. I was working at the Richman Brother's clothes. My machines were down and I had other things to do that I couldn't finish them. Someone made dough for bunchakee. I picked it up and put on the floor. I drove my car and the choke came out of the dashboard, and I didn't have lights and it was dark. I couldn't find my clothes. There were old ones. I looked at a high pair of shoes or boots that were there. I helped to sweep the floor and then I went home. Our two children were sick and Ann said I looked at them. Our baby lay looking at me and I smiled at it and it smiled at me.
