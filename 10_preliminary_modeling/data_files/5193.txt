I dreamed that Alexis and I were in this cooking show like 30 years from now because everything was really high-tech and modern. We were cooking something and all of a sudden 100 male strippers jumped out and started stripping. It was really weird though because Alexis and I wanted to leave really badly so we started looking for the exit. The woman who directed the cooking show was mean and scary and wouldn't let us leave until we had shelved all the cans that were all over the ground. And then we had to organize them alphabetically. So we started. Then one of the guys came up to us and said he would let us out if we helped him make dinner. So we tried to help him make dinner, but we couldn't for some reason. Then the cooking studio turned into sand and flames, a beach bonfire in the middle of nowhere. Then I woke up.
