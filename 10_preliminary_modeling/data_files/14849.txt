I was on the highway with Mom and we were driving to a friend's house. They had a young son and daughter. The son said he had a girl's name (Marsha). She had brought up pizza and garlic bread like stuff. I had a little but I decided not to eat any more of it. I knew Nathan Fillion and we were good friends. There was a pool with a bunny in it. I can't read what I wrote but I can pick out the words 'trouble' and 'suburb'. Anyway, a friend of Dmitri's left a mat (it looks like it says mat) outside of his house and said to pretend that he was going and to wait for his best friend, who was the girl next door (it was apartment like). She liked him and this was all to freak her out. Later Dmitri and I were lying in bed and we joked about sex and his face was close to mine and he laughed and I was like 'ok...'. He quoted from the movie What Women Want and he was in it.
