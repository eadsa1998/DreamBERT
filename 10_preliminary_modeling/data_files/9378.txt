I am a queen: much admired. M. (lover) is at my side and service. Feeling of ultimate achievement. Shift: Mrs. Jones (professor and supervisor) has died. Mr. Jones is very bereft. I offer him help and services. Much ado about it all. The newspapers carry headlines and are tacked up all along the corridor of the psychology department. Bouquets of flowers sent. General feeling of sorrow. I am consulted by Mr. Jones about the funeral arrangements and then offer to go to live with him in his house as I am divorcing Edward (first husband).
