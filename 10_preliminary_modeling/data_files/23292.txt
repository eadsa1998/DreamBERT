I went to hear the Passion Music. There was a strange thing about the concert, every number was to be repeated by the audience unaccompanied and from memory. The results were discordant.... My father drove a nail through his hand.... I sat through a lecture by Doctor H. It must have been very dry for I busied myself in attacking a handsome new desk with a big chisel. When I had cut a hole in it more than a foot square I was overwhelmed with boyish fear and remorse and forthwith woke up.
