Since I am pregnant and the child is due in April, I can't plan to attend the Hawaii Academy of Science. I must explain that I was married but for a very short time. He died. But I couldn't have been married this summer when with H. on the other island. Yet I must have been if the baby is due in April. Miss W. will make a fuss.
