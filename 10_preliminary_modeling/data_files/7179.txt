[2nd dream] At home with crowd of guests. One woman is writing at a yellow table on whch is a white runner. I tell her to remove the cloth as it would be easier to write on the bare surface. She asks which woman here has the largest family. I point to Mother and say, "Your hostess. She had 8 children, 7 are still living and she has 35 great-grandchildren."
