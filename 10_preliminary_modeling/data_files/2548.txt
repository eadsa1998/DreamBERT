A man, Claude, is dancing ballet on stage with a group. I am watching from backstage. It all looks fun, cultural and nice, I keep moving around to see him better. I realize I'm sort of on stage at one point and move out of the way. After the dance, he comes over. We are shy, but like each other. I'm seated on a chair and he sits on the same chair. We are close and talking. Then he puts me on his lap. I hope I don't weight too much. I wish I'd lost some weight. We have coffee/tea, drink and chat, really enjoying each other's company. [BL]
