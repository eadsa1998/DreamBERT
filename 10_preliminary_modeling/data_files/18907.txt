I was sitting in an apartment with my fiancee. We were apparently married and this was our home. (I've never seen the apt. before.) We were sitting on the floor leaning back against the couch and someone knocked on the door. A married couple whom we know had come to visit us. I was very annoyed that they had come because I had wanted to be alone.
