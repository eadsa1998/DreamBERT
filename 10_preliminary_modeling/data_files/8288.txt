There was something going on in my home. There were two men who seemed to wander in and were wandering around the house. I asked them what they were doing there. I don't know if I heard the answer or if I just don't remember the answer. Maybe I got distracted right away because of whatever else was going on. Later I saw them again and asked them again. This time they said they were with the phone company so one of them picked up a phone like he was working on it. I was clearly aggravated and asked him if he had a supervisor that I could call. They said sure and handed me this thing that looked more like a calculator than a phone but I guess it had the supervisor's phone number in it. I walked away thinking that was ridiculous. They could have that set up for me to call anyone and the person on the other end could be in on whatever they are doing and just pretend to be a supervisor with the phone company. I decided to look the phone number up in the phone book and call the company that way to see if these men were who they said they were. I don't know why they were there even if they were with the phone company because I wasn't aware of having phone problems.
