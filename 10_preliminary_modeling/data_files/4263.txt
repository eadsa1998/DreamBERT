["Realize in dream 911 won't help."] A vicious man is trying to get into the house. I am afraid and trying to lock the door. Too late. He gets in. I think about calling 911 but I remember doing that never works in dreams. I resign myself to the upcoming rape. I try and relax and soften my feelings, to not be so upset about it. I think he backs down and merely threatens me.
