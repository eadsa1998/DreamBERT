I dreamed for a moment. It was nighttime and I was surrounded by people from the university, friends. A strange and erotic music could be heard (similar to the Brazilian music). We danced to that rhythm which became progressively faster. I wasn't able to continue and left the place, but as I was leaving, I felt that something had broken inside of me because I couldn't keep dancing. I knew I could no longer go back. That's all I remember dreaming.
