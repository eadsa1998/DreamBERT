I am very UPSET: I call the clinic where my B. City analyst, Dr. Smith works; I have trouble finding the telephone number and getting thru to his secretary. When I get an appointment, I find that I have a conflict of appointments, i.e. a class scheduled for that time slot. When I call back to make another appointment, they tell me that I am to see his assistant, who is a woman! I am FURIOUS. I say I need to see Smith. That morning I oversleep, and barely have time to get dressed and get to my appointment with Smith. (They somehow arranged it after all). However, it turns out that a young woman has an appointment with Smith at the same hour, so I say: "Why don't you come with me? You can sit in with me; you might learn something." "OK" Smith looks somewhat fatter and pink-cheeked and teases me and the young girl. It is OK with him if she sits in with me; we sit on cushions and the hour begins. I feel great. No longer upset.!....
