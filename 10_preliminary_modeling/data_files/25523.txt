 I'm at the Credit Union in Wilmerton with my dad and sister Ramona. We're playing poker: five-card stud. I get two pair, Ramona gets two pair, and my dad gets four queens! My dad shows us his hand prior to betting, in his, "Oh my gosh! Look at this!" manner. I say he would have won a lot of money had he not shown us his hand. I am trying to explain the game "guts", and then the game "in between". My sister Heather comes over to the table.
