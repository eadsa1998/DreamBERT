Merrilee was joining the United Nations ________ Center, and I think Merrilee turned into Cassandra later in this dream, but one of the ladies convinced Mom that I should join too, and they were going to this major convention at this hotel. And somehow I got separated from Mom and that neighbor, and I'm wandering around and I'm wandering around, and there's this big lobby with lots of stairs and lots of little side rooms and lots of people milling around. Everybody spoke English, but there were a lot of ethnic accents. And they were going to have this big banquet and the end goal of the whole dream was to get to the big banquet and meet up with Mom and Cassandra. So I went to the registration desk and I showed them my ID, and they said, "Who did you come with?" and I said, "Maggie Henderson." And they looked in their data base and they said, "Oh yes, we have you." And they gave me four choices of ______ to pay _____: fifty, twenty-five, fifteen or ten. So, of course, I paid the $10 because I didn't know what it was for. And then I went down this little hall, thinking I might find the banquet hall. And there was this room. By this time I met up with this lady who was helping kind of guide me along, and she was big and fat and a little rough, but she was kind and she sort of grabbed me by the arm and we were like walking around. She told me there was this private party going on in that room and I could hear an Irish jig going on. And then we went up a little couple of stairs and through a back hallway and go to this banquet hall that looked more like a restaurant. It had square wooden tables and we were sitting in wooden chairs. And there were no table cloths or anything on these tables, and Mom and Cassandra were sitting at a regular table, and they put Courtney and me at a little kids' table across the way. And it turns out that Mom and Cassandra and Courtney and everybody were getting fish fillets and vegetables, and all I got was a little piece of bread and half a cup of Shirley Temple in a Styrofoam cup. And I had only paid $10 to register, I was a junior member. And so then I woke up.
