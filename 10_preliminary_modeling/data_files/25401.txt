 I'm in a plane with a lot of other people. The plane lifts off very slowly, like there is trouble with the take off. The pilots try to roll the plane, and it crashes into a lake. We are floating in a lake. The pilot hands out life preservers. I get one, and so does the person next to me. The lake is at the end of the runway. The pilot's calculations were correct; he made no error. I tell him I think he is still a good pilot. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is in the back of the plane. I tell her to get a life preserver and help because she can swim well. The pilot's mother comes aboard the plane. She says the plane is one foot off the bottom of the lake. She flies the plane out of the lake.
