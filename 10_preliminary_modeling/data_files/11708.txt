I was friends with some popular girls and Farrah. We were somewhere weird, which had tunnels and you had to go into rooms and find clues. Everyone hides at some point and then this "monster" thing comes in and picks a hiding place. Whoever was hiding there leaves. They left me behind at the last room, but I was the one with the clue so I won.
