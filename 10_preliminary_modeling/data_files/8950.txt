I was going shopping with some of my family, Matthew, Mother, Bill F. I thought BJ was there at first but not later. We came outside and were standing on a landing that was 4-5 feet higher than the ground and had a wrought-iron railing. We were looking down at a car. I don't know whose it was. They said they didn't think it would be a good idea for them to drive because the car was small to begin with and then they also had a lot of stuff in it. I said that was fine and that we could take my car. Matthew was going to drive. I went to get in the front passenger seat. I came around the back of the car and just as I did I saw that Mother had gotten in there and Bill F was in the backseat behind her. So I went back around to get in the other side of the backseat. I'm driving and Mother is in the front seat with me. I went to pull out onto a very busy street. For the most part Mother is nervous about being in a car regardless of who is driving so I didn't let it bother me that she was nervous with me driving. I was going to pull out to the left. I looked both ways and started to pull out, thinking that she would tell me if I didn't see something coming from the right. By the time she said it was clear I was already out in the road. Immediately after I pulled out I noticed there was a lot of road construction ahead of me. Lots of rows of orange construction cones to keep cars from using parts of the road and others to designate where the temporary lanes where. I found this confusing and I was getting anxious. I wasn't sure where to go, especially when I approached a fork created by the cones. By the time Matthew told me which fork to take I had already taken the right one, but it was the wrong one. I said it didn't matter. I was going to go up to where I could pull off and let him take over driving.
