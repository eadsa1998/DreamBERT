I was in the car with Mom. Ezra called to ask if I wanted Clayton's sub from Subway for dinner (he didn't want it, and Dad had forgotten to get me one). I said no, and he told Dad I said no and Dad said to get Mom to get something for me. We were trying to find a Subway. We went to some shop in Innaloo which had a Subway. Mom got me roast chicken, but when I looked at it, it had only one 6-inch and bits of chicken and tomato and stuff on the plate. I complained to Mom and this lady went to put salt on it. I grabbed it away and complained that salt would make it worse. It had some sauce on it, which was actually pretty nice. The chicken was in strips. I went to this toilet. There was a big room and three doors -- one was the men's, one was the women's and one had a silhouette in the shape of the head of Frankenstein's monster. I tried to go into that one, but the door wouldn't budge. I was then at home, I think, watching something. Some guy had been the only one to survive this ride (it kept getting rigged by this dude so people would die). It was all filmed and I was watching it. He had been going down the slide and to his doom, but the dude who rigged it, had set up a box which told you how to survive it. He managed to survive, but then the guy went after his family and they all died. At the end of the slide, one of them was blindfolded and had to light all these sticks and once they were all lighted he could let go and live, but they started going out and he let go and died. Then Dad said the next one was "Eugene Pritchard" and I was like 'what?!'. I took it off him and it had all this information about him and baby photos. It said his birthday was January 11. I was reading some stuff about him doing well in science and I was crying. Ezra was asking me something and I was trying not to look at him.
