I was looking up. I saw something flying high up. Then I saw a dog come down. It landed on the ground and it floated up about six feet off the ground. I got hold of it and inside the glass I saw a bug. It was alive, crawling around. Then there was a horse's head with one eye. It had a frightened look. The other crossed. I then saw a bright spot on the left palm of my hand. The bug seemed to have gotten out of the glass and drove itself into my hand. I pressed it and puss came out and I could see one foot of the bug sticking out. I pressed it again and it wouldn't come out. One fellow said the horse was blind, but he would win.
