I was at my school and me and my friends got our lunches and went to the cafeteria. Me and my friend sat at the last empty table in the cafeteria. Right after we got our lunches the bullies of our school walked in the door. We always had to bring an extra 75 cents because if you didn't the bullies would pound you. The bullies worked their way around the cafeteria. We were the last table they stopped at. I forgot my money. The meanest bully hit me. Setting: First on or in the classrooms, then in the cafeteria at Crystal Springs Uplands. Characters: My friends Helen, Morrah, Marisa, Cara, and Sandy. I don't know who the rest of the people were. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared, embarrassed. I was really angry when the bullies collected the money. I was really embarrassed when I told them I didn't have it. I was scared about what they would do to me.
