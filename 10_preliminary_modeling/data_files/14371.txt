I was walking outside on the street behind North Midvale. There were lots of little kids behind me. The street was a lot wider. This kid who was younger than the others walked out onto the road and a car was coming and I grabbed her. Then a big, brown oil truck thing pulled up. The driver left. A female cop came and I was now with some other people. She wasn't wearing a uniform. The cop told us that we had to go in. There were bits moving inside everywhere. She said we had to tip the truck to move it so everything would click together. We refused. Charlie Day was there too. Mom was there as well but she was different. There were some photos on the wall; one was of Mom and Rob McElhenney and the other of me and Charlie Day. I was near the door and I leaned on it and there was a knock. I said it was "the driver". He said we were supposed to tip it, so some of us did. We made it go to one side and the furniture started clicking together. Then we turned it another way. Charlie was sitting on a lounge reading something and I called out to him and he realized what we were doing and was surprised. As we tipped down near him, I ruffled his hair and laughed.
