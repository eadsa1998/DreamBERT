I'm in my own apartment by myself and have to go outside for something - it's in an apartment complex more typical of the old place on N Street - regular white box. It's dark and gray and rainy outside, and I'm not anxious to get wet, but I have to do this - maybe while it's not raining hard but only dripping I can get out and back again. There isn't anybody around and I'm kind of apprehensive about it - the place is not exactly cheerful and gay on a good day, but now it's almost sinister. I'm blocked by the gutter runoffs to get into my apartment, and I don't much fancy trying to go round the long way. I wait for it to slack off so I can duck it, but I get pretty wet anyway. The door of my apartment is standing open (I didn't go far), and somehow I've got an idea there's somebody in here. I haven't seen a soul around and I wasn't out of sight of the door for very long but I've got this feeling anyway. I pause at the door and stick my head inside, looking around. (There really isn't any furniture in here to speak of - it looks a lot like I've just moved in, or maybe I'm getting ready to move out but I don't think so.) I think I call out - suppose it would be "Is anybody here?" And there's silence for a bit, then my cousin comes out of the hallway. (He looks healthier than usual - an enhanced my cousin, clearer, rounder, more cheerful and easy.) He's come to visit and I was expecting him but didn't know when - he's glad to see me and I'm relieved but still a bit paranoid.
