Cattling duck came to my mind as I lay in bed. I was in the screw dept. It was dark in there. I slowly reached for the switch box and put the lights on. When the lights went on, I saw Kochera and Farmer working on the hand machines. I asked Farmer if he knew who was going to win the derby and he said yes, but he told me a number 276. A truck pulled up. I opened three doors, then I was in and there was a nice girl with her head resting on the driver's shoulder. I stuck my head in and she pursed her lips. I kissed her and again for it was like real sweet and mellow. I was riding a bicycle at night. It had a dim headlight. The peddling was hard.
