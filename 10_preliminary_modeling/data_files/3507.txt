A heavyset man with a black beard, a "bear" of a man, is traveling by horse across a southwestern desert. His horse is carrying secret listening devices from the CIA to spy on him. He doesn't know they are there. Now I am a young woman in a long dress (1800's) on a horse and he is taking me across the desert. He had gotten off his horse and peed. I could see the shadow of his back and hear the water hit the ground. Then he sits to have a bowel movement. Then he realizes the CIA devices are on the horse and removes them. Now I am sick with fever or heat stroke. The man is now sort of Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford/Derek) and he takes off my many layers of socks, five or six he counts, and shakes his head because that is too stupid in this environment. He strips off my clothes and lays me on a blanket, naked, and covers me with another blanket. But now he is sexually aroused because I am pretty and naked. He takes all his clothes off and stands near me. I can't see his penis, but it's there. Then he lays down on me. I am on my tummy and our skins touch and it is soft and gentle, but I am very afraid. I beg him to please leave me alone. He is hot with desire and yet knows this is wrong to take advantage of me, so he just lays there wanting me and feeling our skins touch, but not doing much else. I don't know if he's going to be honorable and I beg and cry in fear. I feel the tip of his hard penis on my leg and then he stands up and leaves me alone. I fall into a fevered sleep. He takes care of me.
