I am living on a ISLAND, alone. I line in a square room with only a bed and few furniture; I see an old Church, baroque architecture, like in Vienna, and a huge LIGHTHOUSE that wobbles 180 degrees as a big STORM approaches.-- In a restaurant with others, talk about the storm and how well we slept and that now the sea is calm again. I want to get back to my room, but have to wait for a boat.
