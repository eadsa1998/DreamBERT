Krystal and I were going back and forth between her house to my house while Mom and Dad were out of town. First of all we were at her house and she had this beautiful little patio that turned out to be her front yard. And one time while we were running around her house she went in the back room, she did something, and the whole house started to tip on its side like the Titanic ship did. And I was holding on to the stair banister railing and my voice was gone and I couldn't yell for her. And she said that the guy living here was on drugs and that he was doing that. And then the next thing was that we were over at our house and I was setting up the Halloween game, and there was this one Halloween figure that I had forgotten about. And it was a witch with a little skeleton thing, and the skeleton twirled around and there was a man's voice that talked in this thing. [laugh]
