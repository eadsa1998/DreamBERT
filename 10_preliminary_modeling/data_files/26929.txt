 My housemate Stephen Ramos talks to our neighbor, the old Hispanic woman. He is firm in his words and says that if... (something), then we're going to... (something). This isn't really a threat, though it sounds like it. He is just being firm. We aren't going to let her frailty deter us excessively, beyond what is respecting her to what is patronizing her. She invites Stephen inside.
