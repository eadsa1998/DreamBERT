I was talking to Benjamin on an instant messenger. We were joking and flirting and knew each other in rea life and were possibly dating. I sent a message joking 'why did I sleep with you last night?' and figured he would send back a love heart. It showed that he hadn't read it yet, then he sent a love heart and I giggled. I was telling Mom later about his uncle who was rich and famous and had ties to royalty and had brought the Stonehenge to his wedding, but then they said it was the wrong one -- they had wanted a fake one, so had to send it back.
