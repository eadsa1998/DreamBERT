["Miracle meds."] I am starting back to work at the community college. I want to see an early morning workshop being presented on a miracle drug just coming out on the market. I wheelchair in. It is very crowded with many people older and disabled also interested in this topic. The pain is bad and I feel desperate. Someone is writing stock market information on the board. At first I think I'm in the wrong workshop. Then a small deformed midget in a wheelchair takes over as speaker. He does a number of circus tricks to get our attention. He has a fire hose all wrapped up on a roll and runs in front of it. It hits him in the butt and everyone laughs. Then he plugs it into the fire plug in and squirts the audience. He is talking a rapid salesman pitch. I hear the words prednisone and Risperdal. Now the presentation is over. I call him over and say I have to speak to him privately. He says go take the stairs and come on down to the floor and we'll talk. I need the meds NOW. I look for an elevator but there isn't one. I walk painfully down the stairs. I wonder how he does it with his wheelchair. I walk out of breath and in pain from chair to chair until I get to the circus sawdust floor area and the bleachers. I sit. He comes in and we talk. I tell him I need the meds now even though they are experimental and could cause problems for me. He says they are going through trials now. I comment on how terrible it is that the community college still hasn't got an elevator to the basement.
