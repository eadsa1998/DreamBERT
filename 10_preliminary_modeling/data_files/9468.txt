I almost marry Ali Mershman at the Greek Orthodox Church. I am preparing to marry Ali Mershman (an Indian or a Turk?) but he also is married to some one else; I go through the whole ritual; see pictures in prayer books, hear music, etc. At one point in the ceremony I see Frank who says: "I don't think you should do it, it would complicate matters." Then I decide not to go through with the marriage ceremony. Ali agrees and says he does not want to join "your sect." I want to pay the priests, but he says no. I say to the priest: "I believe it is the true Church because it made you see the Truth." I leave and kiss Ali on the mouth. Joking and relieved. See his wife; she is angry at him. "Whose ideas was this?" -- See Frank working at the RR, leaning over to drink some candy syrup - red and green, in vats, with some very vulgar guys. Walk along the stadium toward the University with Jules. I plan to write him about Ali when my watch falls out of its casing, but I find it and put it back... wake up.
