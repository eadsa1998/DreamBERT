My sister, a guy I know, and I are walking down this street -- a very quiet street with lots of trees on both sides. We're going to this bar we all know where it is, we've been there before. The bar is in an old Victorian house. We walk in, climb a flight of stairs and the guy goes to order a drink. My sister is nervous, she doesn't like all the curtains surrounding the booths. The guy is at the counter drinking from a glass and he's immediately very drunk. He's spilling his drink all down his chin and shirt and he looks like he's pouring it. My sister is disgusted. She tells me we have to run away from him so we start running. We both have on these huge, heavy, trendy shoes and we're making so much noise as we run down the stairs -- flights and flights of stairs. Now the guy is chasing us and we finally make it outside into this large parking lot. We're running but he's catching up and finally he grabs me and holds me and hugs me and it's wonderful! He tells me not to run because I know we're meant to be together and he tells me we're going to get married. I'm so glad he caught me. My heart is racing and I wish I didn't wake up.
