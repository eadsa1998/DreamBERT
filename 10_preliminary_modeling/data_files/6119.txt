I had a dream that I was babysitting. I hadn't met these people before. It was the first time I was babysitting for them. I went to their house with someone else, but I don't know who. I was standing in the kitchen and the couple walked in. The only thing was they were two guys. These two guys were the parents of the child I was going to babysit. Then I saw two women come in the kitchen, another two men and then another two women. All of these people lived in this house, but each couple had their own floor. They started asking me questions and all I could think about was, "These people are gay and lesbian." Then the dream suddenly switched to my meeting my friend Audrey and her boyfriend's new baby. She's not pregnant in real life, though. The baby was a normal size, but had the face of a grown man. He said to Audrey, "Hey, Mom!" And gave her a kiss on the cheek. Then I woke up.
