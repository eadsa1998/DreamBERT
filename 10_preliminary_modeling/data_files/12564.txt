I was at school. I was in form and Samantha, Silas, Evelyn and Eugene were there. Silas was doing some weird thing with his arm. Samantha was doing handstands and she asked me something about Dmitri and I didn't know what she was talking about. I thought I had science period one, but we had sport. I said that I loved jumpers? There was also a new guy there. I then had English, but exams were on, so we had to do sport again.
