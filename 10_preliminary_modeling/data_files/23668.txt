[my first year of college] Mother, my middle sister, and I were outside on a prairie.  There were 4 clouds (white, elliptical-shaped, and fluffy) moving slowly.  One descended and as it almost reached the ground, it separated and became frantic ostriches who flew quickly away.  The next cloud did the same.  Then I looked up and said, oh, this one above me must do the same.  As it descended over my head I reached up and touched, palm flat, the underside of the mass.  At once it frantically separated into ostriches.  I looked at my hand and saw that it was dirty and dusty, the entire palm.  (From the ostriches flying so long, they had picked up a lot of dirt.)  But this group of ostriches seemed confused, a few toppled.  I saw one ostrich in the distance fall from a great height, but as it hit, it merely settled softly like a feather puff.  Then a switch - it was a camp I think.  It wasn't clear who or what was going on, but somehow this ostrich was still there and it was very dangerous.  A man and a girl were there.  The girl became my oldest sister, and the guy became Ken [her college boyfriend.]  My oldest sister peeked out from behind a structure, and it looked (to the ostriches) like an ostrich was peeking out, so the white ostrich raced after her and killed her.  Then Ken was on his own.  I remember thinking: 'He would have to make it on his own.'  He became another person, perhaps me, and began to climb a steep hill, but couldn't make it up.  The ostrich became a person who was still after the Ken-guy.  The Ken-guy tried to pull himself up onto something which had a refrigerator door and handle, and the door kept opening.  Then it had 4 handles around it, like a cube.  He tried something else, I think he was hiding in a cubicle in a wall of earth - but someone else came on the scene, and then the killer (ostrich) guy realized he would have to stop.  He began talking to the Ken-guy about the situation, in a very open way.
