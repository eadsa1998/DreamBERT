My notes are messy and hard to read. We saw the people we got Rover from. There was a park nearby and we took him there. I was on World of Warcraft later. Two people came to talk to me with their kids. Something was a peach colour. A boy in real life came to me and I explained something. I was then at school and it was graduation. I was at a table with Autumn and others. We got called inside. I saw Eugene and he looked hot and was older. Dad and I were supposed to be seeing a Morrissey concert. He called me to tell me the tickets were fake.
