I dreamt I was married to a boy I am seeing quite a bit of but with whom I am not in love. In my dream I was very happy and very much in love. We had a son about two years old. We put him to bed and prepared for bed ourselves. Somehow I hadn't had marital relations with my husband at all except once years ago. I knew that tonight we would--I had no reason for not having slept with him until now, but we were certainly on good terms. Just as we got into bed I realized I hadn't taken my bath. I said I'd be right back &amp; not to go to sleep until I did come back. When I went to the bathroom another girl from an adjoining apartment was running the water. I told her I was in a hurry &amp; to please take her bath next door. She did. I took my bath &amp; rushed back to the bedroom. My husband was asleep. I felt a very strong physical desire to intercourse--I mean I felt it while I was asleep, but it was extremely strong. I couldn't wake my husband &amp; I awoke instead, still feeling rather uncomfortable.
