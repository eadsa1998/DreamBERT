 I'm at my friends the Ramos' house. My housemate Stephen Ramos is on the phone with his father Franco. Stephen asks me if I want to go walleye fishing tomorrow, which is Saturday. I ask him if it's ice fishing. He says no, but it's hard-core cold open water fishing, on Rock Lake. I say, "Yeah, okay!"
