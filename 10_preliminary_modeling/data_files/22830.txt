I go to a concert or some other event in the car with Sharon.  I also take Ronnie Nadner and someone else.  I figure Ronnie will ride back with someone else, but when we go back to the car, he comes along.  We are supposed to go to CYF (Christian Youth Fellowship) that night.  It seems like Ronnie is going to that too.  Anyway, driving back, we are passing through some clean, green hills.  The highway doesn't wind around the hills like a regular highway but back and forth with switchbacks, and so we can see most of it most of the time.  Sharon says she had better go to her brother or her sister's house.  I don't like this, because I have planned on taking her all the way home.  I also feel kind of funny to find out that she has a brother and a sister.  She seems to be surprised that I didn't know it.   Pretty soon Ronnie asks me if I am not taking her home.  I tell him I have to take her to her sister's house.  Then they both say that she has changed her mind and was going home, and that she had said so about 15 minutes earlier.  The gas tank registers empty.  Sharon is either driving or backseat driving.  We pass up several filling stations and go to one that is kind of out of the way.  I buy $1 worth of gas.
