I was in a mammoth, luxurious house. I was talking to a woman named Juliana, but she ran away after something had disturbed her. I think it was the doorbell ringing. I went upstairs to look for her with a tall, husky boy. We started opening strange doors, and I was so frightened that when I said something about it, he picked me up. Finally we opened the door to a huge bedroom with doors leading into every part of the house and out onto a beautiful terrace. All of a sudden Juliana tried to dash through the bedroom from one door to another, but we caught her before she could get away. Next, there was a very distinguished woman guest in the house. I tried to anticipate her needs, but she told me to get her linens. As I was looking for them in a hall filled with drawers and shelves, I came across numerous used and new toothbrushes. On one of the top shelves I saw a box-file with the numbers 60 and 604 directly below each other. Opposite the 604 were the words Sandra Gordon, very severe case. (I seemed to associate this with an admonishment I had received at my job a few days before.) I was rather surprised to see this, but I went on looking for towels. Finally I went into the big bathroom where this distinguished lady was bathing, and asked Juliana where the linens were. Then I woke up.
