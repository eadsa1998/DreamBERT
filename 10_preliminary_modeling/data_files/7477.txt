Mary and I are walking in what looks like the downtown area of our hometown. Mary is very young and beautiful. We are happy and in love and hold hands as we walk. We stop from time to time, embrace, and kiss. These are long, passionate, "French" kisses. We stop kissing and continue our walk down the street. Somehow I know I must initiate a discussion with Mary about her impending death. I have to broach the subject, ask her how she feels about dying, and ask her if she has any last wishes. Does she want to give me instructions about anything she wants arranged after her death? Surprisingly, Mary is receptive to this discussion. My fears concerning her reaction are groundless. Then I commit a terrible mistake by calling her by Bonnie's name. I apologize profusely. I am very upset. But Mary is very gracious and forgiving of my blunder. We continue talking, and again, for the second time, I call Mary by Bonnie's name.
