I found a dead body out the front hidden under some tree branches. I went inside to call the cops but I couldn't remember the number. I tried to read a magnet on the fridge, which had different ones to call, but I could read it. It was suddenly black outside. The kitchen light wouldn't turn on. I did a reality check and 'woke up' but then went back to the dream. The cops came and then left. These girls came in to party and I made them get out. They tried to steal some sauces. The window started breaking and I had to keep checking the doors were locked. Mom 'stole' these cars, which were long oil-ish trucks. She went to a food shop. This lady came and she was a bad guy. She could see the future in one of her eyes. Someone threw little rocks at Ezra. One hit the window but it didn't break. We stole a truck and I moved the second one and parked it well. Then the car was joined to this gigantic dormitory thing. There was an all guy band. Two were Jewish. One looked like a Jew but the other didn't. The one that I could tell was a Jew was hot.
