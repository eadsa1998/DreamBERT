 I'm in a bad neighborhood with many black drug dealers and few police. It seems to be overridden with evil. I think a good way to move drugs safely is to use a police car. I am in, or I am, a police car. I move on the ground when other cars and people can see me, and we no one can see me I jump and fly, using my feet for steering by pointing my toes up or down. I land on a roof and am then in a room. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. A man named ____ Johnson is there, as well as a tall redheaded woman named Annette. She is very skinny and stiff. Kevin is sleeping. I use my hand to stroke Kevin's erection while he is sleeping. He awakens just as he ejaculates, saying, "Wait a minute...", because he doesn't want to ejaculate, but wants to keep the control and stamina he has always had. There is a puddle of his semen on the floor. I go up to Annette, who is standing against a wall. I feel her small breasts and kiss her. She walks out the door saying tomorrow will be the night. I say to her, "Tomorrow is always the night!" She may come back in the room. She and ____Johnson may know each other.
