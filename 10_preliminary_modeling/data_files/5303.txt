I dreamed that I was in this huge dark house with a random scary guy. I had my laptop with me and was trying to shut it down. I remember wanting to go home really badly but I couldn't until my laptop shut down. The big scary random guy kept coming on to me and trying to get me to take my clothes off. He was trying to rape me, and I was really scared. So I tried to call my father, but all the numbers on the phone had been rearranged, so I couldn't figure it out. The guy was chasing after me, telling me that he was just fooling around. I started to cry, and finally I was able to call home. But I didn't know where I was! My father kept asking me where he should pick me up, and all I could say was that I was somewhere in the mountains. It was awful. The guy caught me and hung the phone up. But then Caleb came in and hit the guy and saved me. He brought me to his car and we drove for a long time. We finally got to a motel type place attached to school. Hugh started making fun of me, and I hit him square in the chest. He grabbed my hand and pulled me really close to him. Our foreheads were touching and we were about to kiss, but I was still so upset about that scary guy that I ran away. I ran into Mr. Lopez, who tried assigning me more geometry homework. I tried to do it, but it was really difficult. Everyone around me kept trying to mess me up, so I was running away, holding onto my geometry homework. Then I woke up.
