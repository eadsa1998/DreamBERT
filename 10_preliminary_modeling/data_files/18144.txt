I dreamed that my husband and I were in the big department store in my hometown and they just put a whole rack of winter clothes, coats, robes and things. They weren't even sized right or put on the racks. I was looking at the winter coats and seeing what kind I might like to have if we could afford to get one. The saleslady was helping me. For some reason I thought I wanted a white coat. I looked at several of these and all different sorts of coats. I also tried on some robes. We must have spent a long time in the store with me trying on coats and everything. I know we didn't really have in my mind that we were going to buy one, and I don't know why we were spending so long.
