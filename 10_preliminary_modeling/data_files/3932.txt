["On Phone Duty"]  I am lying on a couch in some room with a small square black phone. It rings and I answer. I can barely hear the man at the other end and have to ask him to repeat himself frequently. I tell him I am on phone duty for the Counseling department and work at home. He then says, with recognition in his voice, Barb? I say yes. Who are you? I never hear his name. There is a baby on the couch somewhere and I am sort of watching it for someone. A woman with very small pre-pubescent breasts is walking across the room toward the window. She wants to look out. Something is going on out there. A man is stopping her.
