I was at this shop. I was a prisoner and I had to go with this cop. We were near an exit and when he turned away, I walked out. There was a guy in a car trying to get me. He got out and I jumped out and he did as well. I was half hanging out. He kept spraying some sleeping gas. This other guy tried to stop us, but he fell asleep. The guy spraying the gas got tired and I pushed him out of the car. I drove out and I was at the back of Nana's. The gate leading to the backyard was just a wall, so I ran to the normal back door. Nana greeted me and I said "This is a boring dream". Nana was like "huh?" and I thought 'Oh, I must've woken up'. Something happened and I had to call these people. I had to rewrite their numbers and I asked for the piece of paper. Eugene's number was on the list and I was like 'yay'. Samantha was there. That Acquaintance-M-05 guy gave me a typewriter. I was at the front of Nana's. Calvin was there. The geese came and I jumped over the fence. Calvin did a flip over. This girl got hit by a truck. I was talking to her father about religion and he was religious.
