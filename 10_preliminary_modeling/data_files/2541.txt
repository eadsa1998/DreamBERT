I am a young man with shoulder length hair like Mark (or Jesus). A beautiful woman is attracted to me. I am to her. We are scientists that work with animals. Suddenly she turns into a crazed creature that kills and maims. She must touch your hands and then rips you up, your blood rushing out all over. The man sees her do that to some research animals and runs to tell the others. All the blue uniformed (overalls like mechanics) gather together and she comes in, sweet and interesting, a siren hard to resist. He almost lets her touch him, but the others rush around him and they all hold hands. She blacks out and comes to seeming normal. She asks, "Did I black out?" They all nervously watch her and try to appear nonchalant. She says, "I need to do the weight drop." They all go with her. It is a machine that runs straight up 200 ft. and then smashes toward the ground very fast. She is very adventurous and loves it as fast as it will go. The men love it too and are nearly swooning. One man says, "Wow! That's even better than sex." They admire her. Then they run to another room and hold hands. She comes in, cajoling, needing to connect and hold hands. A woman runs in screaming, "She got to all the animals. You should see them. It's horrible." I see and hear blood spurting out of their bodies. It's sickening. She grabs the last hand of the serpentine and one of her hands is free. The crazy woman comes toward her. The woman at the end of the line wants to give in to her. I (now a woman) scream, "No, NO! Don't let her touch you." I manage to penetrate the spell the monster woman has created, so she goes up to a woman named Doris, in the middle of the serpentine. She nearly lures Doris into letting her join the line. I scream over and over, "Doris, Doris, don't let her. Concentrate." I break the spell again. The monster woman goes from the end woman to Doris over and over again, almost making it each time. I am exhausted, but must fight on.
