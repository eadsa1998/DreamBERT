I was home napping. A football hero came over to visit. I got up. I offered to help him fix something to eat. I found a box of macaroni and started to boil those. I was looking for something to go with it. All I could find in the cupboard were stacks of 1 layer, frosted cakes in boxes and cellophane bags. I looked in the oven, a pan of stewed tomatoes. I stirred it with a spoon (that had holes in it).  It was not very effective. My brace was lumpy and mis-shapened. My foot hurt to walk. I was embarrassed. I tried to adjust the brace. I thought I had it on crooked. I went into an adjoining room and called to my mother. She was stepping out of the bathroom. The football guy walked by the door. My mother clutched her robe together, embarrassed, as part of her stomach was showing. I ask her what she had planned for dinner as I didn't want to use that. She said, "Fish." I said, "Ugh!" Fade. Now I'm on a date with a young man, a sophomore. He's clean cut. We're walking down a street to get to his car.
