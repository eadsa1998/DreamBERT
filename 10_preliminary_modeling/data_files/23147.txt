I was setting up a breakfast, sort of like we did for students at the university where I worked.  Students started arriving before I had put out anything to eat, and I was embarrassed, but then I noticed that someone had indeed put out some bagels and a few sweet rolls on a table which I hadn't noticed before.  Later on, or in a different dream, the preparations were a little more elaborate.  It seemed to be an event at a nearby university, because Maro Smith was there.  He was speaking to the group and mentioned a play or a movie which was going to take place either that evening or on Friday, I'm not sure, and he asked me if I was going to come.  I replied that I was supposed to play baseball that evening in one place, and volleyball in another place, so I didn't know if I could make it.
