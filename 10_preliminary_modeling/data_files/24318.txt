I'm at a baseball game. I'm playing in it, or at least trying to play. I have access to the underground parts of the stadium, the back ways. I feel like I'm late for something. There are multiple fields, like in Little League, though the whole thing feels professional. I wonder if it's a place where I'm supposed to be. I've never been too good at playing baseball, though I try to look what I'm doing.
