I was working for NTNS but we were in a huge warehouse. I had been cleaning up and organizing. I found some racks with children's clothing so I rolled them over to the children's section intending to transfer them later. When I went back to do it, Darren was there doing it. I went on cleaning up. I was finding lots of racks with wheels that we didn't know we had. I ran into a stock boy also cleaning up, moving things, and throwing things away. We had a discussion about why they had saved all this stuff. I was then approached by one of the committee chairs about a problem. It seems someone had given two families a very large amount of clothing free and used my name. I tried to tell her I didn't do it. I finally found out that Darren and Angie Ho were responsible for one and a woman named Debbie [unknown in waking life] the other. Darren and Angie were operating as an independent agency helping the underprivileged. They helped themselves to our stock. They did have an office our building. Even after we told Angie Ho she couldn't do this, she continued under a disguise and alias. I finally caught her and turned her in. Also, she was posing as a government employee giving advice on raising and caring for children. I reported her as unqualified and mentioned that BJ would be great for this kind of work. The committee chair still did not believe me. We found Debbie, but it was her word against mine and the committee chair believed her. I found many different rooms on different levels, piled with boxes full of supplies, racks, etc. I also wound my way around an upstairs workroom and back out again.
