I was hanging up an artificial flower on our wall. I cut off some of the edge flower stems, and gave it to Ann for her lapel. Al from Dill's came in and was he dressed sharp. He had a fancy colored coat. He looked at Ann's coat on a chair and said, "Are you going to wear that?" and she said, "I am." He said, "The people are going to be dressed their best for this dancing party." The band or orchestra started to play. I saw a horse turn a direction peg in the opposite direction. It was pointing just as a joke on his master.
