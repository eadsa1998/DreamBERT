Someone named David Snare, supposedly an online friend that I met in person.  He came to pick me up and my attitude was, "oh, you again."  Part of the dream was in French, and part was in Japanese.  Somehow I ended up the actor in a small, independent film.  Part of the filming was at my friend Ray's place.  We stopped and I ate lunchmeat with a fruit rollup.  I woke up dizzy.
