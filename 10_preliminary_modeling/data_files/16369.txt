I was watching something on TV that was Celine Dion celebrating her birthday in France on a beach. And she was like jumping around and dancing and singing this like club and techno song about "I got my suntan and I got my ________, I got my this and I got my that," and part of it was in French, I guess. The next thing I knew this person came to the house, and I realized it was her and she was kind of short and kind of fat and she had short, dark hair. And she was wearing this tee shirt with like writing and stuff all over it. And she was kind of blah, she was kind of sarcastic like Terri is. And I would say things like how great it was to meet her, and how this is so exciting, and she would just laugh and kind of like "Everybody says that." And then we had a slow dance together, and I just couldn't stop crying because I was so touched. She did actually say something nice through her sarcasm, I can't remember what it was. But I was just so touched, and I don't remember anything else. ... in my album there was this line that goes, "I can't believe it ___________ to me" [singing] -- and part of it was a little flat and a little off key, so I figured I would highlight that area and try to transpose it and try to fine tune it by maybe 30 cents or something like that. Well [laugh] somehow it kinda got all whacked out and it just went totally off the wall, and then it sounded like [singing again], "Oh, I can't believe __________" and it sounded like a tape that was wearing out. It was the funniest thing. [laugh]
