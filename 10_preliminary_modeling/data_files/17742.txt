I was working on a school project with some people.  The librarian asked how my brother Stuart was doing, and it brought up my angered feelings about him.  We were working on something with food, and I asked someone to go get something out of the microwave.  I saw a red and blue blur, and told the person to never mind.  I knew it was Superman, and he was going to get the food for me.  I wondered for a moment why...I concluded that it made sense.  Spiderman had a crush on me, so Superman liking me too wasn't that big of a stretch.
