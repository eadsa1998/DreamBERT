I was at the foot of some stairs , like in one building at the university where I work.  Dick Spears was there, along with someone else I knew but don't remember now.  We had a short conversation.  Rafael Cruiz was there too, and he attacked me, jabbing at me viciously with something like a ski and a ski pole.  Somehow I got hold of a knife with a long blade and struck back.  I don't remember whether I stabbed him or not.
