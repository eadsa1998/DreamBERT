I woke up and I was at home. I was thinking I would call to leave as it wasn't my home and then I thought 'What am I thinking; I've been here 15 years?" Someone said there was a guy called Ethan Coatzee and then said he was "Preston Garfield". I saw a shadow on the front door and I got up to run and said "Get out of my house". There was a person there and I unlocked the door and ran next door. This guy opened the door and let me in. There were quite a few people scattered around. There were some people at a table and I explained that people had taken over. He said "nice place your father's got" and I said "That's what I thought". Then it was a game. Ezra was playing too. We had to find clues. There were steps outside and this guy was going down and disappearing. We got this thing at the end, which led to three other things. We got others to do them but the white shard was right [that's what it says, have no idea what it means]. Then it was a movie and Mom was there. This girl got pregnant. She told her mother and she told her to get an abortion by going on the train tracks. Then the train tracks had a special area for people who wanted abortions or to commit suicide. You had to hold on to something and it would electrocute you. I think she was telling her mother she had decided to kill the guy and it was her first time.
