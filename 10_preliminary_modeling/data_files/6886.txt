At a meeting of the legislature, mostly women were there. Roll call showed many absent. Discussion bores me. After dinner, a very large casserole filled with sliced meat under a crust. I look for a smaller casserole to put the food in, there is enough for another day. Cupboard is crowded and can't find dish. Bread is spilling out of the breadbox. I complain, "why can't they put the bread back when they've got what they wanted."
