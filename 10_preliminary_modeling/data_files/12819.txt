I was at school and I had one of the science classes. There was a new girl and she said "I am awesome and have huge melons!". Everyone was like "ew". There was a relief teacher and they asked me if I liked Nathan Nelson (I was thinking it was a cross between Dmitri and Seamus). I asked "who?". On the roll, there were dots for people the teacher thought liked each other. Mr Reilly had put me and Daryl together. I had asked a teacher for a yearbook a while ago as we didn't get one for Year 10 or 11 (I was Year 12). Eugene was in the class. Calvin and Sabrina were together on the roll. I tripped over this wall. My leg was twitching and Jeremiah was looking at it. Daryl invited me to his house and I went there. He gave me this farm-y looking shirt [Clark Kent like]. They had a big house. There were ghosts there. They had all these Pokemon pictures around. There was going to be a party there. There were photos of Daryl and he had a piercing and I was like "ew". Daryl tried to get me to drink and I refused. His mother said that he just quit smoking. I told Ezra about the dots but he already knew. I was trying to tell Mom that I didn't like him.
