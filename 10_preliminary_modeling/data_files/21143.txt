Ann and I carried a work bench to a certain spot. Ann said her dad would have used it if he were alive. We walked down hill and had to watch for slipping. I was a star ball player and a fading star had a small man try to assassinate me. I caught the fellow with a box and I figured he had a gun in the box. He tried to aim at me, but I pushed the box aside and held him for the police to take him in. I saw a black swan roosting on the schoolhouse in Rivertown. It was night and there were a lot of colored people there. Loddie had a fancy looking cat instead of a dog as I called him. I was running away from the assassinator. A gang of guys came to Sue's house and they wanted to assassinate me because I knew who murdered a fellow who they brought in front of my door. I looked out and I saw the fellow lying on the sidewalk. I was teeing off golf balls. I knocked two at a good distance. Then I put on another and it was a flatstone.
