I'm in a hotel room with one of my girlfriends (age 21). I see a tall, blond woman wearing a gold evening gown. Her gown catches on fire. My girlfriend and I hasten toward an open window and jump out. The room we had been in was devoid of furniture. (Not too sure of last statement.) We quickly run around to the front entrance. We go into a large room. I see a handful of people sitting on what appear to be shoe-shine chairs. Their heads are all bent down and they appear to be very sad. I recognize my father. I seem to recall that some of the others were also members of my family, but I couldn't remember specifically who they were. Someone tells me that some of the members of my family are missing.
