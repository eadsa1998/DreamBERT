My cousin Jack was imprisoned on trumped-up charges. For the first time in several years, the extended family of uncles, aunts and cousins got together.

We had gathered in the shed at the back of my childhood home and there found proof of the false accusation. Corrupt officials were trying to take credit for Jack√ïs invention of microwave screen savers.
