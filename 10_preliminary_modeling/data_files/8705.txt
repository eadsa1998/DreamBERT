Garnet P called to see if I would be interested in selling Avon since she is retiring and moving to North (or South) Carolina. She was telling me all of the benefits and that they were also doing some kind of recruiting special right now. She was telling me about all of the things I would receive as a new recruit. We had a light-hearted conversation. I kept telling her I wasn't interested. I finally said I would give it some thought over the next few days and let know if I changed my mind. Mostly I was just trying to end the conversation.
