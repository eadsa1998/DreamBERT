I was having a club meeting at one of the member's homes in the suburbs. We carried on the meeting after which we went out in the back yard and played volleyball. (It had rained and the cement was wet.) There was a girl at the meeting whom I did not know, but after she left I asked someone her name and discovered that she was one of my girlfriends who I didn't recognize because she had changed her hair style. She is my age, so I don't know what she was doing at a meeting for 12-year-olds. (I lead the group.)
