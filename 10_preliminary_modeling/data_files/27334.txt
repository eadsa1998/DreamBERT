I dreamed I was at a recording dance. It was either in a small room or barn. Not many people were there &amp; I was just standing and watching as my fiance wasn't with me. I saw two fellows dancing who I recognized, but the girls with them were unknown. Both fellows went to high school with me and I knew them very well, although I have never gone out with either of them. The one is now engaged while the other is at A. I saw a M. girl dancing and although she's engaged, she was not with her fiance. I wished I could dance too and felt since the fellows were old frlends they could have asked me to be nice, but they didn't. I couldn't see how the girl was able to dance when I couldn't.
