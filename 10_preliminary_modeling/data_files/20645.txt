I was in an institution. I had some clothing in a cabinet in a room. A new room a floor below was opened, and I was given a cabinet there. I took a stack of handkerchiefs on the elevator to put in the new locker. But the elevator operator brought the elevator up to 4B first. When it stopped, I made some noise and a nurse came to see if anything was the matter. Then she left.
