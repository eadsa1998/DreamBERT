My first morning alarm was going off and I kept reaching out and hitting the snooze button. I was working on something that involved five-minute increments. Each time the alarm went off I would hit the snooze thinking that I needed to anyway because it would remind me that the next five-minute increment was over. I was becoming extremely irritable with this whole process, and especially with the alarm going off but I thought I was nearly finished so I thought I would just try to stick it out. I finally woke up enough to realize what was going on and I turned the alarm off.
