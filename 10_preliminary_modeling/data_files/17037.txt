I'm in a line up some stairs in a large run-down building - perhaps an old apartment store or office block. It is the kind of space that gets used for one-off club nights (perhaps illegally). The people on the door won't let me in. I'm with someone - I can't remember who - there's a deal to be struck: something to do with bringing a table. I find one and haul it up the stairs. I'm being chased out once I'm inside. The place is huge- like a rabbit warren, and full of people.
