I dreamed I was at sorority meeting at S's house. All the girls were seated around the living room and they began to discuss our barn dance. I remained silent, but was inwardly seething. Finally, I could contain myself no longer. I rose and made a fervent speech. I was very excited and practically shouted. In my speech, I told the girls I was resigning from the sorority. Then, as I spoke I calmed down a bit and reminded the girls that in the initiation, the president told us that one of the key pearls in our pin stood for cooperation. I reminded them how very uncooperative and inconsiderate they had been about the barn dance. The two girls who had been particularly nasty began to weep--begged me not to resign. Then all the girls chimed in and I began to sway my opinion. When the dream ended though, I was still undecided.
