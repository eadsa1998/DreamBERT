It was night and it was spooky. I went to this Chicken Treat somewhere a while away. It was more like a booth than a store and there were two girls working there. I was walking and ordered at the speaker in the drive-thru. I was given this 'key' which was like a bullet. I ordered a chicken dinner, "with nice peas and chips". The girl serving said she didn't recognize me and I said I wasn't from around here. I kept looking around nervously. Then I heard a noise and it was coming from the top of a hill some way away. I realised it was zombies. It ended up getting close and was making gurgling noises. I went into the booth and one girl complained because it was cheating. I asked how it was cheating and she said that it knows where we are now and ran out. It chased her. The zombie looked like it had bad effects. When it attacked, it had this '80s' glow around it. I ran the other way. More zombies came. I kept running and ran into a house. I held the handle of the door up, and there were two doors, but only one had a lock. Then it was ages later and it was now a movie. The leader was a girl called Pinhead. There was a tough guy called Rook. At first I called them 'Sook and Mal'. We had been living there for a while. We were waiting for a zombie to die, but it didn't seem to be happening. I watched Zombi 2 and complained about Lucio Fulci and Michael Bay to Ezra. I joked that I was going to watch a Michael Bay film and he asked which one and I said I was joking.
