I was in the gas station where I work about 34 hours a week, and instead of half of all the employees being there for one shift there was the whole total present which only served to heighten the confusion. Cars were piling in from every direction and stopping in the middle of the drive and blocking traffic as they often do. No one was directing them to proper positions so that they could be serviced, so I was trying vainly to establish some order. The situation grew worse and worse, and each attendant seemed to fell that he was working all by himself with no thought of teamwork. The new boss who was there was just walking around giving out simple useless orders and making the situation worse. As the confusion grew, I became more irritated and the dream faded.
