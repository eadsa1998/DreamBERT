Marissa Camden working very hard, baking cakes and giving parties for the handicapped; then she comes to see our house. Marissa and Wendy bake another cake, while I sit and talk with Hillary? (Martha?/Marissa?) I apologize and show her (Marissa? or Hillary?) my file of comics and recipes. View of Jonathan jumping rope and lashing out at others. Why? because he had had therapy and "able to express aggression outwardly and openly."
