I was on a street. Ezra and I were trying to get somewhere. This evil guy was around and Ezra and I ended up in this alley thing. The evil guy got in and half killed me, but once he left I was fine. He got six bags of blood from someone. I tried to call Mom but I got no answer. We left the place. Later I was in a building, but cars also drove through it. I saw Eugene's father Abraham and he let me through. I saw Eugene later and he had this thing on his ear, which I realized was something that he was using to listen to some sports thing. This guy was going through my pencil case. He didn't say anything to me. Alejandro, Jeremiah and Darius were yelling about something. Thuy called Eugene 'Mickey'. One of them said something like "Eugene would've had more to say in a convo especially since Alejandro didn't know much". Darius was swearing in Macedonian. There was this other evil guy who had light brown hair and brown eyes. He had bushy eyebrows which were angled down, like he was angry. He could easily swap his hair around. He made his eyebrows normal and he was pretty good-looking. I was a car with him later trying to trick him. Lillian, some others and I were in some photos. I had made a face accidentally in one of them. There were other photos of kittens.
