I'm helping out at a church. The pastor is busy and so I take a telephone call from a woman who wants a refill on her prescription. I ask where does she think she's called? She says, "Valley," the name of a pharmacy. I tell her she's got the wrong number. This is a church. Then I go to a room, where a few people and I are seated around a table. I'm taking my pills and get confused with my pink pill. It looks just like my "aspergum" pill only now the aspergum pill is larger, like a round piece of bubble gum with its name imprinted on it. I take my pills and then see more in a small dispenser cup. Confusion. A man says, "Oh, the four of us will be late," and I realize the church services are getting ready to start up. I wonder if maybe I will sit in, a sense of wanting to connect and I look in through the two glass windows. I'm in a rest or cry room and then there's another glassed-in room where some people are seated in pews. Beyond that is the crowded church area. I see the richly robed (red and gold) band and choir filing up to the front. The horn section (trombones) is moving their horns back and forth like a fancy 40's band or like "Chicago" or Herb Alpert band. The choir is already seated, doing hand jive moves to the song. I want to go join them and yet feel hesitant. I decide to sit in the back room, "cry room" and listen in. If it gets boring or dogmatic, I can leave. I have old, distant feelings of fear about sitting in a quiet crowd. I see a woman wearing a white hat with foofy flowers and netting. She's getting ready to sit down.
