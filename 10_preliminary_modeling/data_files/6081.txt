This dream took place at Peter's Pond Park in Sandwich, MA. Peter's Pond Park is a campground where my family and relatives would camp every summer for the past 32 years. When we first arrived we setup our campers and tents. Then each family cooked their meal for supper. Later on in the evening the young children and teenagers went to the Rec Hall. Back in the campsite the older crowd sat down and played the game Screw your Neighbor (4 corners) and Scattergories. The following day my mother, my father and I went down to swim in the pond. But the pond was no longer a pond; it was more like a brook. While I was swimming I began to notice the bottom of the brook was filled with slimy creatures and there were squirrels everywhere. I remember looking to the side of the brook and there were squirrels looking me straight in the face.
