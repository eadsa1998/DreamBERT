Mary and I are playing cards in our living room. She is ill. Suddenly, she stops playing cards, stands up, and says, "I've got to float." Her stomach is very distended and the expression on her face shows her obvious pain and discomfort. I come over to her, gently gather her into my arms and say, "Oh, I wish there were something I could do to help you, Mary." Her arms are around me and she replies, "Oh, Ed, you are helping me - you are a great help."
