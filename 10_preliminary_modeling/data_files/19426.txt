It was Carla's birthday and, as usual, I went all out and prepared for a lot of guests. I bought lots of things for the kids and planned lots of games. As usual, her dad messed it up. He was late and had something I needed. I don't know what it was, but I know everyone was getting upset and we needed it. Finally, he came and he had forgotten to bring whatever it was. Carla started crying and the whole thing was a mess.
