Driving in a car up north. The leaves are beautiful colors, like Fall. Many maple trees. Getting out, we walk out onto the lake which is frozen. A band is going to play and people are ice skating. A man is selling bikes -- neon green. A foreign man, middle-eastern, steps onto the ice and says that the band can't play today because the name of the band is "Tomorrow." They can't play tomorrow because it's Sunday. Sam (my fiancee) is playing the guitar. People are booing at the man who told them to stop. We leave on a bus, and Sam and I sneak past a blind woman who wanted to "look" at my ring.
