I'm on a ferry with my family. The ferry is also a submarine: it's like a submarine/cruise liner. We dive underwater; I'm the only one who missed the notification, and as the ship dives at a ninety degree angle, I careen through several hallway openings before finally crash landing at the front of the ship. I land in a dining room with Nick and the family, and for a while we watch the fish floating by the outside of the glass. The dining room is designed for undersea watching, you see. Nick and I decide we've had enough and go to get our luggage.
