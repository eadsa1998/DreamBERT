I woke up to Kiether Sutherland and Morgan Freeman pointing guns towards the down stairs neighbors windows. I try to figure out a way to get out of the room without them killing me. I try to make them laugh. I go to the bathroom and hear a loud noise. When I go to the living room, my mom and brother are talking. I look out the window and notice how red the sky is. Tainted like blood. Red waves are crashing against the buildings and tumbling down. There are a bunch of sailors cheering for a blond stripper in a stars and stripes bikini. "Is this a Terrentino film?" I ask my brother "Yes," he answers.
