I was at a swanky hotel it looked like; there were no sounds. I started the dream with the feeling I had done something wrong. I was walking through the lobby. Pinkish/red carpet, lots of big plants/trees. The front side of the lobby was glass at an angle. I was walking, eventually, to the elevator and saw an old high school friend. She said nothing but looked at me with disapproval. This all happened in slow motion. I saw a brunette as me, who I knew at the time but I can see her face now. I got on the elevator. There were several people who I didn't know. As soon as the elevator started up I knew what was going to happen. The elevator shot through the top of the hotel. No one panicked though. Everyone was very calm. I pulled the doors apart and we were hundreds of feet in the air. We slowly fell towards the ground. None of us was concerned. We just watched as we fell. It was actually a cool feeling free falling with no anxiety. The next thing I'm walking out the front door of the hotel. I'm watching myself walk out the front door, as if I were watching back on the TV. And then it ended.
