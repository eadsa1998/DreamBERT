I was somewhere that was possibly school. This guy's girlfriend was on the phone talking to a guy and they made plans to meet up and have sex. I tried to tell my friend without telling him, that they were supposed to have lunch together. I was having lunch with him. Later, we were doing an experiment in chemistry and we were supposed to use the Bunsen burner but some people didn't and they got sick and I didn't. Later people were turning into vampires randomly. I was also in the middle of turning, and it took a while. Elijah was in the street. I went into the sun and sparkled (like in Twilight). I could smell blood.
