Uncle Albert is getting ready to leave for a vacation and is taking me along.  I don't want to go, and I tell Uncle Albert that someone is coming by to get me at 11:00 a.m., but it makes no difference.  Someone does finally come by for me, though:  Uncle Joe.  On the way home (or wherever we are going), we stop at an old school (2-storey) where summer school is going on.  I am to tell Pat Byers goodbye.  There are about 8 rooms on each floor.  I go to the door and look in each one.  Everyone is apparently having a lot of fun.  When I am spotted, I get in trouble for being out of class, but I explain that I don't go to school there and I have come to tell someone goodbye.  I am beginning to think that I won't find her when I see the back of her head, in the 16th room upstairs.  I tell her goodbye-I don't remember how..  By the time I go back outside, it is dusk, and almost dark.  I wait until dark for Uncle Joe, look around the building, etc., but can't find him.  I am growing worried.
