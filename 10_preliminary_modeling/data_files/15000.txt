I was at university and it was different. I went to some class and then left. I was with Evelyn in an elevator. She was really short. My feet were cold and I realized I had no shoes on and I went back to class to find them. I asked the lady there and she said she had seen them and got them for me. She got rashes from my socks. I went to class and it was full of people. I put my shoes on. I had another class but it was later. I was on MSN with Ezra and he told me to accept the webcam invitation. He and Emery danced around. Ezra had dyed his hair black and Emery was wearing a tutu.
