I am in a graduation gown. It is necessary to drown and then be saved or come back to life to fulfill this ritual. I am very afraid to do it. But Theresa needs me to do it to help her daughter. I call out to God/spirits for help. A bolt of lightning comes to me, runs over my body and back out my gown, from the thighs and groin area. I see this as a powerful sign. I am capable, I can do it, I am special. I go to the pool. Theresa and I hold hands. I see Charla already lying, not breathing, like she's asleep on the bottom. I feel sadness. I am also afraid I won't be as brave. I jump in and immediately panic, fighting for air. I can't surrender to it like Charla can. I wake up gasping.
