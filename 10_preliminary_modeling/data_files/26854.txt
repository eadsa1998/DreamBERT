 I'm in the garage at home. I uncover a pit in the cement floor that had been concealed. It has old rolls of film in it: some used and undeveloped, some unused. It is my mom's film from the early 1980's. There is some high-speed film: 700 or 800 ASA. There are a few photographs in the pit too. I talk to my mom about the pit. She seems to have forgotten the items there and is almost reluctant to speak of them or deal with them. She says the film is expired and is no good to use.
