I was driving in a car with 2 other people, 2 men, males. I don't remember who they were or their ages, whether they were friends or unknown people, but the three of us were driving to go to either to perform a robbery, a hold up, perhaps a murder, I don't remember which, and we were on our way across a causeway, perhaps McArthur Causeway, I'm not sure. I noticed as we were driving down the causeway there was a boy riding on a bike, a young boy perhaps 6 or 7 years old, 8, and a man in a car, I don't remember what he looked like either, but a man about 35 or 40, who I had never seen before, kind of was riding alongside the boy. The boy was riding on a bike on the causeway. The man looked out the window and patted the boy on the head and told the boy to pull over to the side of the road. Evidently by this time we had passed them and I was watching in the rear view mirror. So I knew that something was fishy about this, that the man was trying to tempt the boy to get into his car perhaps. So I told the men that I was with that we had better turn around and see what was going on so we stopped there and the man was talking to the boy and he said to him come on get in the car. Obviously he knew we meant business or we had caught him doing something wrong because he got immediately in the car and we drove off with him. We were trying to figure out what to do. I said we should take him to the police, but the other men didn't want to do that, mainly because I suppose I think we had guns ourselves with us and we were going as I say to make, perform this robbery, or hold up or whatever. So we decided not to and we just dropped him off when we got off the causeway. We figured it would take him a few hours to get back to his car and by that time the boy would have gone. That was the end of the home dream.
