I remember being in a room. It was very large and I had never been there before. There was a man in the room, around 35 years old with black hair. He had a program for a drum and bugle corps, competition that he wanted to show me. I remember that he opened it up and on first glance it reminded me of a program that I had designed once, but on closer inspection this one was different. I remember that on the top of the middle page of the program there were little finger-like tabs of all different colors that could be manipulated back and forth. I supposed they were like bookmarks and you could find anything you wanted to in the program by pulling a tab. There were no markings on the tabs though. It seemed unusual that a program would have these things and I thought it was kind of funny. I remember playing around with these tabs, pushing them back and forth, etc. That is the last I remember.
