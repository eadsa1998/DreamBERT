 I'm in a parking ramp going to pay and leave. My bill is $1.00. I pay with a $10.00 bill. The black woman gives me a $20 and $1 bill as change. I drive out of the dark and dreary cement ramp. I'm very thirsty. There are a bunch of soda machines lined up to my right. I think of stopping, but don't. There is a man on the run. Police are pursuing him. He is in Boston. Police officers are lined up with guns on both sides of a street. There is trash piled up like banks on both sides of the street, where police hide. A metal cord runs from a power source in this razed area. The man attempts to access this power by drilling into the cord. Later the police arrive. The power source has been altered so that it has created a magnet, which a pry-bar and other metal tools stick to. I may be taking part in this scene at the power center. I'm at home. Men dressed in gray, who are invaders look in the windows and see me. I'm afraid. I have no privacy. I don't want to be seen. I don't want people to look in. I run upstairs and lie underneath the window facing south in my sister Ramona's room. I'm afraid men might still look in. They don't. I go into my room. There is a yellow grade school-nametag-like piece of paper that says 'Kathy' on it. I move it to a different place. I decide that I'll just walk downstairs whether or not the invaders are there. When I get to the kitchen my mom is there. This pleasantly surprises me. Ramona is home. The invaders aren't here. I may eat a plum.
