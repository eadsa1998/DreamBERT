In this dream I was at some sort of cottage when a number of others were there also. It was some sort of a party, and we were playing cards - Can't remember if we were playing any thing special. Everyone was laughing and singing. I felt that they should pay more attention to the game instead of fooling around. Suddenly I got up and said that if they couldn't do any thing else then I might as well not play. I went out of the room and laid down and began to cry, the more I heard them laugh the harder I cried. When I awoke that morning I had the feeling of being depressed.
