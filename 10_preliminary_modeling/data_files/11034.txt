I was lying half in my bed which is beside a window and half out on a ledge which seemed to be attached to the window sill. N, a friend my own age, came into the room and stood beside the bed. A black cat appeared on the ledge and I screamed at N to take the cat away, as I dislike them intensely. She picked the cat up and was holding it. I said to be sure not to let it loose in my room. She smiled and dropped the cat, which ran out of the room. A spotted cat appeared on the floor and I screamed again. The cat jumped onto the ledge which was 3 stories up from the ground. I wanted to push the cat off but was afraid to touch it. N. just stood there and watched me. The black cat came back into the room, jumped from the bed to the ledge and touched my leg. By this time I seemed to be having a mild case of hysteria.
