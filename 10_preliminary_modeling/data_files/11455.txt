I was walking across the street and a car hit me although I felt no pain. I was lying in the street and my legs wouldn't move. An older woman came over to me and tried to help me up. I became very frightened and didn't want her to touch me. I tried to struggle against her picking me up but I only fell down again. Another woman and then a whole flock of people came over and tried to help me. They lifted me up and started to carry me like they do a baseball player after knocking down the game winning run. I started to feel better but then I broke away from them and started to run. Nobody seemed to chase me and I slowed down to a walk but then I didn't know where I was walking to and I became afraid and it was dark all around me so I couldn't see.
