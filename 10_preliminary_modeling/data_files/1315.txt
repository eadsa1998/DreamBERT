I am on a boat, going down the river with a man. The boat over turns and I must swim for it. The current is swift and getting swifter. We are nearing a waterfall. I struggle and get to shore and make it. I see him struggling and I give a helping hand, afraid I might get pulled back in. We make it safely.
