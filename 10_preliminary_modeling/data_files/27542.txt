I dreamt that I went out with a young man who had just come from C--, someone I have never seen before this dream. He was a friend of my closest girl friend's fiance. J--, her fiance, and this friend of his took me out for dinner while we were waiting to pick her up later. We went to a very unusual Chinese restaurant--a beautiful large elaborate-looking place--a dream creation. We had dinner in a private dining room which was screened off from the rest of the place by green drapes. The color scheme of the room was yellow and green. That is all I remember.
