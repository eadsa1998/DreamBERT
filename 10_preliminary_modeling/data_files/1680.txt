Millie is desperate to get a job. The feeling is she can't get one. She isn't qualified. She hears about a job and goes to apply. Lots of other women are there. She rushes in ahead of this other woman and says, "They've already hired someone." The other woman turned away and Millie went in. Now we are in a house. A huge candle is in the living room. She and I notice the hot wax has made a hole and is going to fill it up and drip over the edges. She says, "I'll watch it so it won't drip." I say, "No, we'd better not burn the candle." A boy is very disappointed. Then the boy and his brother see some German soldiers conspiring to kill my grandfather who is asleep in his bed. The boys crawl under the bed to save themselves. The boy says to the younger one, "If you make a sound, we'll die. Promise me no matter what happens, you will be silent." He promises. The woman soldier comes in with a machine gun and kills the grandfather. The boys are silently sobbing. Then the woman goes away and the boy goes to find her to kill her in revenge. He sees her and rushes to her, grabbing her by the throat and choking her near to death. Other soldiers, officers, men saying, "Don't do it. Let the system kill her and then you won't be hurt." She sneers and says, "What evidence do you have? It's my word against yours." The boy says, "My brother saw you too."
