 I'm at Arnold's Drive in on the east side of Wilmerton. I'm in a back area of the shack. I order food and drink. I pay a girl there $1.25, which is for doing my laundry, but at the same time it may be for the food. She is getting ready to put the laundry in the washer. I point out to her that there is a white shirt inside a dark green shirt, so she doesn't wash them together. My grade school classmate Patrick Bergman comes up to me and says he is there with his buddies and they will kick my ass if I go near his table. I don't bother to go near him. I sit alone on a picnic table in back of the shack, and am content with this. I'm talking to my high school teammate Binky Ahmed and Olie Kecker about parties. Olie wants to have three big parties. I tell him we're not having them at my house: I've already had my big parties, and am not having another. I may have a party if I get an apartment. Binky will have a party.
