I was at school and there was this boat. We were allowed to go on it in groups for a certain amount of time. Daryl was on before us, and then Evelyn, Calvin and I went on. We couldn't work out how to listen to music. When we left the boat we were given a score depending on how 'odd' our favourite movies were. Festen was worth 90%, and Calvin got two 100% for gay movies.
