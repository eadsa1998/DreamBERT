I was carrying a shallow black candle on some stairs.  My cousin Allen was behind me.  His parents my aunt Fiona uncle Logan were there, too.  We went to a bowling alley.  On the way I started rubbing Allen's crotch through his pants, showing him what I do with my boyfriend Jeremy, I guess.  My paternal step-grandpa Sal was at the bowling alley too.  Bowling balls were all around, under a blue light.  Two people took balls shaped like feet.  I couldn't find one with holes spaced correctly for my fingers.
