This is one of the dreams I had last night. I found myself at home seeing for the first time the new house my parents bought. I understood it to be new, but it turned out to be a made-over model of my aunt's old farmhouse. I was disgusted with the whole thing, but I tried not to let my parents see it. I kept exclaiming how each thing was so nice and at the same time was trying to figure out in my mind how they could possibly like the atrocious thing. I remember the wall between the living room and dining room was nothing but a huge aquarium. The kitchen had absolutely none of the latest conveniences, including no linoleum. For some reason, I began to search for my old bicycle and was awakened at this point.
