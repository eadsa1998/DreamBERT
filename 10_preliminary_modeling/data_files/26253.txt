 It's Halloween. I open the doors to a place where a big party is going on. People dressed in black rush out and bombard and surround me. Someone steals a piece of paper from my back right pocket, amidst the crowd. I feel this and turn around as the person runs away. I chase them. It is my housemate Norman's girlfriend Sunny Pile. She and Norman are looking for a phone number that they think I have. They thought I took a yellow piece of paper with a number on it, but I didn't. I react violently. I severely verbally reprimand them both, saying, "What the fuck were you doing? What did you think you'd find?" Norman mumbles, "I knew we wouldn't find anything." I move about the party and pick up my two pieces of yellow paper with phone numbers on them, to ensure that they don't find the number that I have. I do have what they are looking for. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is standing at the party. I see her as I pick up the papers. There is a tiny dead northern pike on the ground. My brother Wally is suddenly there, in town on business. I'm happy to see him and I suggest we go to a bar. Norman has lost his ID, which is fine with me because I don't want to be with him. Wally suggests we go somewhere where Norman can come with. I don't want to do this, but I agree to do so.
