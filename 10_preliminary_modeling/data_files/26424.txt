 I'm at home. A small black gorilla comes in through the back door, which is open, and starts to walk around the kitchen. I see this and am frightened. I clap and make loud noises, scaring the gorilla out the door. I look out near the back porch and steps and see there is a huge fat black mother gorilla and four smaller black young baby gorillas. They are loafing, lying, and sitting around, just hanging out. I'm scared because of the potential danger they present.
