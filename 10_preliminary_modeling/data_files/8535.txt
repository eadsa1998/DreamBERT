I was watching the Ellen DeGeneres show. She was talking about things that she had set up online that would result in her making donations to the Children's Make A Wish Foundation. The first thing she did was to set up a special search engine. Whenever anyone used this particular search engine she would make a donation to Make A Wish. The second was via her website. There were several things that you could do on her website and whenever anyone did any of these things she would make a donation. The third was independent of these but I think it had something to do with Ellen Degeneres merchandise. This might have been if you bought any of this merchandise online or in a store. But, again, it would result in her making a donation to Make A Wish. I thought it was great that she was doing this. I didn't think I would do much, if any, of the first or third option. However, I thought to myself how much time I spend on the computer and how often I use search engines. So, why not use one that is going to do something good for someone in need? I seemed to be sitting at the computer using this search engine for quite awhile after I heard this.
