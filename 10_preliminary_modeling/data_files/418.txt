I'm looking for a place to live in another town. I don't know where the best areas are, but I'm visiting with some people who can help me look. There's a girl who knows electricity and building - she does something with it for a living - and she helps me examine a place that looks pretty junky. The LT community meetings are being held (outdoors?) under some trees, and I've come early. John Larroquette is here and trying to get a young guy to get up on an elephant - it's kind of a prank, he knows it's hard and he'll have an even harder time getting down. It is pretty funny. He's right in front of me, and swinging around pretty wild, so I get up and move back a bit. He ends up on the elephant, but facing backwards. Oh, boy. Folks start to show up, and I remember I need to tell Grace that I made the phone calls I was supposed to make - I'm way behind. I'm staying in a little, dark apartment with a guy, and another man has just come to stay briefly. We're having a conversation, rather quiet; I'm showing him where things are. I'm getting ready to go somewhere and haven't got all my clothes on, which is usually okay, but I don't know if he's uncomfortable with it, so I mention it to him. It's a little awkward, and I get a little self-conscious. I actually think about what it might be like to have him touch me, as if it might help.
