I was on a cruise ship, a huge cruise ship and we were on route to Israel, India and Italy. But we weren't on the ocean, we were on a big map laid out somewhere. It was a beautiful map, with all kinds of colors and I remember seeing India, and I knew that after we left there we would be heading towards Israel and then to Italy.
