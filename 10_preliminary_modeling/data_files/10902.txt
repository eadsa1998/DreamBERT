The situation took place during sorority rushing. The place was a grassy little hill in what seemed to be Florida. The hill was in front of the cabana-like building. It seemed that all our rushers had pledged other sororities and we were very upset, especially over one girl. We all attempted to talk to this girl, but were berated for dirty rushing. We became more upset as our favorite girls were running in and out of the cabana with other sorority girls and we were left sitting on the hill with a few, meek little girls we had never seen before.
