I'm not sure how it started but I was with Sam and Dean (both Supernatural). We were following clues. We went to a hospital and were looking for a room and I said "it better not be room 217". It was 180 something. I took this little thing off the bed in there. I heard the heart rate machine thingy beep and then flatline. We ran to the other room. We discovered that some guy and Penny (The Big Bang Theory) were related. This lady nurse said she called the cops on us. I said we'd have to run. So, we ran to a forest-y area. Dean was slowly walking down the path and Sam was a little further down. I started running down the path. The cops called out to me that I was only allowed out for now, but that I had to go back to jail (I had been let out to help them catch Sam and Dean, but I just agreed so I could stay with them). I started to run faster and I had this net-like bag and I would throw it in front of me, then run and pick it up and throw it again (to avoid carrying it around). Sam had then gotten somewhere else and I caught up with him. There was a shiny white van and we got in. We laughed and he started driving. A cop van came towards us (from the side) and we saw it crash behind us. I asked where Dean was and Sam was like "Who's Dean?" and then I turned into a demon, and I was watching it in third person. Sam was telling the demon it was supposed to possess him and the demon said no, it was meant to take over me.
