 There is a fishing camp up where I am somewhere in the Big Resort Area. The camp has huge shallow ponds filled with different types of fish. I see many northern pike ponds that are about an acre large. There are a lot of dead fish floating, but many more alive in the pond. People go here to fish, and pay by the pound for the fish they catch. There are price boards in the little store there, for how much it costs to fish. I meet a man that works at the store who is about my age. I think that I'd love to have his job. He says something to me about two-on-two volleyball, which some of the summer employees in the Big Resort Area were going to do. I ask him how big the fish are in the ponds. He says they get three pound smallmouth bass, and that the northern pike don't get very big: they eat fast or something like that. I see his living quarters, which are simple and neat. An older man tells him to use his shotgun to fix part of one of the cabins or houses there. The young man shoots a grenade-like bomb into a window, which blows up the room it lands in. I don't think he realizes what happened. I get a note later saying that it was blown up.
