The kids and I are in a large building. The girls have sent away for "spirits" or witches. We are directed to a room. It is a rip off. The girls are disappointed. Dovre goes upstairs to complain. She comes running down the stairs worried. A witch has threatened her. The witch comes downstairs and says we must buy or she'll "get us" with other scary spirits. I say, "Oh, yeh?" I "howl" at the air to protect my kids and scare the spirits away. I'm a little scared myself. I raise up in the air and yell, "Arrrr!" Kathleen comes around the corner. "What are you doing?" I say, "Looking to see if a lion comes at my kids." Then one comes around the corner, and I scare him. I raise up in the air and yell "Arrr." The lion stops.
