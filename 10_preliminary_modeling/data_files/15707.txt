I was on Facebook and someone had commented on a status saying something about me liking Dan Palmer, Kit Harington and Benjamin - but not quite so obviously and then Dad posted saying something like 'you like Dan Palmer, Kit Harington and Benjamin at the same time?' but had tagged Dan Palmer and had also said something about the number of people. I untagged Dan Palmer and it showed who had seen the post and he hadn't and I was like thank god. I went to add him to people who couldn't see the post but he didn't come up. I went to search for him and he didn't come up. I checked my friend count and it was 61 (one less) and I realised he must've deleted and blocked me and I assumed it was because of that and I was really annoyed.
