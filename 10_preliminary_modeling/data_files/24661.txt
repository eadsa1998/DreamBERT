In the afternoon me and my friends went to see the movie, The Flintstones. I went with five of my friends. That night when I got back from the movie I had a dream. I dreamed that I was Pebbles in the cartoon version of the Flintstones. The next morning when I woke up there was a cartoon version of me in a picture and the name at the bottom of the picture was Pebbles. I ran downstairs to show the picture to my mom when I tripped on the first step. Setting: In the movie theater and in my house and in my dreams. Characters: My mom, Helen, Melissa, Arlie, Lisa and Sandy. I don't know the people in the movie. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared. I was really happy when I got to go to the movie with my friends but scared when I saw the picture on my bed.
