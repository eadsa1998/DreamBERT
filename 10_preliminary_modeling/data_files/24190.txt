I dreamed that I had just woken up in a hospital room. I remember snippets of the surgery. I had been badly hurt. A bullet, perhaps. It was in the same place where my appendix scar is. It didn't hurt yet, but I knew and wanted and was looking forward to painkillers. At my bedside was my mother. And in my bed was a girl who was beautiful, who said she loved me and that her name was Kimmi. A tooth of mine was loose also. I looked around. All kinds of stuff was strewn about the room. Spoils of some kind. The thing is, I didn't remember a single thing. I knew who my mother was, and later, who my friends and brother were when they came in, but the past -- I don't know how long -- was gone. I told Kimmi that I didn't know who she was and if I loved her. We snuggled close. I put my hand on her pajama-clad leg. I felt bad that I couldn't remember her. My mother accepted her, so I assumed they had met previously. Marvin, Kareem (friends from college), someone I didn't know and my brother Gerald came in. They were congratulatory. They were also giddy and laughed the laugh of someone who knows something that you should know but don't. Apparently, I did something completely badass and somehow got away with it. Kimmi was having a hard time coming to terms with my memory loss. My friends were making sexist remarks. I didn't know her, but I felt strongly for her and sorry for her. Her parents had warned her to stay away from people like me who would break her heart. She went to the bathroom to freshen up. She was strong, though. And pushed through the crap.  I also had a loose tooth. When it came out, it had a metal root, very futuristic. Like an implant.  I yelled because I wanted to share this with Kimmi. "I feel like I am 10 or 12." I tried to remember when my teeth last came out.
