Father Andrew is making preparations for a funeral service: rattling boxes etc. He asks me if would help him make 20 cards, heart shapes with name and date engraved; I sit down and we start talking. Marissa, his wife, is looking very stern; she comes up and asks why I hate her. I say "I am shy" and "I wanted Nevena and Wendy to be friends. I hoped we could all go on a picnic together She runs to ask Father Andrew (now in ordinary clothes) and they kiss and whisper happily, like kids. And it is arranged!
