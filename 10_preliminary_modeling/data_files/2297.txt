I am feeling unwell and these men are ruthlessly teasing me. They say I'm no fun, sexually rigid, etc. I try to get away from them. I run upstairs and see two groups of them coming from both ends of the hall. I'm stuck in the middle. He makes me dance with him, pulling me roughly around. I am angry. [BL]
