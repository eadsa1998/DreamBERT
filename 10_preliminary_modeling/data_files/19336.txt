All I remember was being back at my old elementary school except it was in Jurassic Park. The school was on stilts in some places. You could see the velociraptors, or whatever, out the window. People were pulling them around by chains. I went out the front door of the school and some raptors jumped through a fence. I tried to run, but I kept falling down. It was unpleasant.
