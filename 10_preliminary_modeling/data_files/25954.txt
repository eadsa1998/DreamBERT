 I'm at work at Fishing Haven, but I've got 10 minutes before I need to be back so I'm going fishing. I take the staff boat. It takes a lot longer than 10 minutes for me to do this. I see a picture perfect bay and want to cast there. I use a yellow buzz bait. I want to use a torpedo, but I'm short on time. There are people at a house on the bay hauling dirt, soot, and garage out of the place. I help by carrying pails of ashes. I say goodbye to the people I've helped. We're in a different place. I hug them. They are my brother Wally, my uncle Dannie Redding, and another man. We share a group hug, and then I hug them individually. I say to Wally that I'll see him in October.
