I had a dream last night that I've been thinking about all day. It's rather simple. I dreamed that I was walking near a highway. I was going on a long trip. I was going to my husband's hometown, where his parents live. I don't know that I was going to see them. I was in the road and acting as if I was driving a car although I was walking. There were trucks in front of me and cars and so forth, though the road was curving and you couldn't see very far ahead. But I did have a chance and would pass these trucks. I would just run out and go around them and then go on. Before very long I came to a place where the road was under construction. Since I was walking (I was barefoot, incidentally) I could go on this part of the road even though it was blocked off. I walked along this part of the road where there was this lane down the asphalt and everything. I came to a  point where the workmen had stopped because it was lunchtime, and they were eating their lunch. I started talking with them and started having intercourse with about 6 or 8 of them. It didn't seem such an unusual thing to me at the time and I was going to continue along the road. The reason this dream seems important is because I have had several dreams over a period of time in the past where it was night and I was barefoot and out walking somewhere along these dark streets in some strange neighborhood and I didn't know where I was going or why I was going. But it always in a strange neighborhood and I had sort of this lost feeling. I think this dream is sort of symbolic. Perhaps I have found my road in life or something like this.
