Driving with my husband in his truck up a road. Then I was running down the hill racing him to the bottom; I could hear the engine but when I caught sight of the truck I couldn't run (slow movement). Then there was a shopping center and I started to run through it to still beat my husband to where -- I don't know. I came to some glass doors and my husband was waiting for me on the street and started to leave. So I ran out waving my arms. He slowed down and I noticed I had no pants on. There was a women's clothing store so I went in; there was no one in there but two retail ladies. She asked if I needed anything and I said I wanted a dress. She showed me a magazine with ugly clothes and I pointed to a dress and asked, "How much?" She said, "$147.00. I then noticed there were a lot of people in the store and I had my tan coat so I put on my coat and told the lady I was going to look around other shops but would probably be back to buy the dress. I really wanted to say, "You've got to be kidding to sell a dress like that, you stupid bitch." I went outside and up the street was my husband pumping gas in his truck.
