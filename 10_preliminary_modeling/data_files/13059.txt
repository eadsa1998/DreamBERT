Some guy had those gas masks, like in the episode of Doctor Who. Earlier, he killed the Doctor (David Tennant) and someone else. I got trapped somewhere underground. There were lots of people down there, including some soldiers and Ezra. The soldiers though, I think, worked for the bad guy. When the bad guy released the 'gas-mask disease', by opening a window and put this girl with a gasmask on through it, everyone ran. The soldiers got attacked too. Ezra and I escaped. Then we were at Mom's. The Doctor woke up. He came to us and someone went down the stairs and we followed. I had my arm around The Doctor's waist, to help him walk. We ran out and Mom, Ezra, The Doctor and I got into the car. Mom was driving and I was in the driver's seat. This guy's parrot kept falling in this hole. Mom said she had been infected. She tried to kill this other parrot. The road was wet, and we slid on it. Then we realized that she really had been infected. Then I was at home with Dad and Ezra. The hair straightener was around. The bookshelf was in the kitchen.
