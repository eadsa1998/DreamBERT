I was parking, and the emergency brake didn't take hold.  I rolled forward and tapped a gold car.  The driver was pissed.  They screeched off and might have been coming after me.  We went to some park equipment.  I was watching over my next-door neighbor's daughter.  My godfather Ben was watching a little kid, too.
