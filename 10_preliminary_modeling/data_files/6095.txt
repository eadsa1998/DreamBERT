This dream was about Dr. Busik. [We were having a test in her class the next day so that's why I think I had this dream.] The dream started out at her house but then moved to Laz Anderson Park. We were there talking and her kids were there sledding, but there was no snow. Then somehow we were talking and her husband came and went for a swim in the pool that was at Laz Anderson Park. Then I woke up.
