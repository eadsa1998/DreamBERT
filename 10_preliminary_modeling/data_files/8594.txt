I was at Bev's. There were a few movie videos that seem to be sitting on the floor. I comment about one that appears to be a three-video set. Someone tells me that they rented those for Rachel S. Rachel S may have been the one to tell me this. I notice it is of the same genre as Sleeping Beauty and Barbie. I asked her how many of them she has watched and she tells me that she has already watched them all. I was surprised that she had seen them all already. Then someone mentions that it is seven hours of video. I was also surprised by that. When someone tells me that Rachel S watched all seven hours in a row. without a break, I almost couldn't believe it. It just isn't like her parents to allow that type of thing. We talk about some other things. I going into another room and I open and close the door in a way to try to avoid Rudy, their dog. either coming in or going out of the room, but I'm not sure which. I prefer not to be in the same room as Rudy because he is so big and overwhelming to me. He likes to lick people and he slobbers a lot. I still have some fear of dogs, or at least have not gotten myself to be totally comfortable with them. We joke around a bit about my actions to avoid him but they tell me they have him in another room. as they usually do whenever they have guests. We also talk a little bit about other videos. Right after I left their house it occurs to me that it would have been nice of me to offer to return the videos back to the video rental store for them.
