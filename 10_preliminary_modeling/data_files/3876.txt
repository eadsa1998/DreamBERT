["Fast and wily baby."] I have three children. A girl, about 8 years old, a boy about 2 years old and a young baby. We live in a city that is all indoors. We have two places we live. We are traveling from one place to the other. The girl is argumentative and not helpful. The boy is active and having fun. The baby is always sneaking away from me and popping up in odd corners. The baby keeps changing shapes as well. At first it was a normal baby. Then it was a small rag doll. Then a toy. I am angry at the girl for not helping me watch the baby. I am frustrated with not being able to keep up with the baby. At one point, the baby in the shape of a small doll was caught in a corner behind the wall like it was in a mouse hole. I had to wriggle it free. Then it bounced off to get into other mischief. Now we decide to travel back, on foot to our other place. We meet a male neighbor and the girl is talking with him. I am concerned that she is so unconcerned about talking with strangers. I come out to supervise. We return to the first place and I do a visual check to see if anything is amiss. I see three places where I left things on. The toaster nearly burnt something near it. I comment that I could have burned the house down.
