I had been discharged from a hospital, and I went back to get something. A female patient was looking for a doctor. She was walking up a stairway that wound around an elevator shaft. She saw a woman doctor on the next flight of stairs and hurried to catch her. The patient was thin and plain-looking, about 30.
