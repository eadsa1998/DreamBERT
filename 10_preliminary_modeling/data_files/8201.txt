I was trying to fix something out in the backyard. It had something to do with water. When I did it, it actually created a worse problem and it looked like a mini-Niagara falls in two different places. They weren't very high but very wide. The water was just gushing out like you would see at a water fall like that. BJ was at the house and I said, Quick we need to go call maintenance and get them over here right away. Then later I thought I should have just found where to turn the water source off inside and do that until maintenance got there to fix whatever it was that I did.
