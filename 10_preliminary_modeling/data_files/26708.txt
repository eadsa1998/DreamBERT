 I talk to my mom, who says something about my friend Melanie McDyss. I'm excited at first, and I think Melanie will be home in New Zealand when I visit. Then my mom says that Melanie called our house and said she'll be at our house for Thanksgiving and New Year's day: she will not be going home to New Zealand. I'm then in the McDyss home in New Zealand. It's a very large house with many separate rooms for different people and functions. Many tables are set up for a fine dinner. There are several pool tables, both upstairs and downstairs.
