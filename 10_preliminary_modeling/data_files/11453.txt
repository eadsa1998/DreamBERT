I was swimming in a pool that I had frequented this summer. There were a great many girls swimming too and when I looked at them I noticed they didn't have any bathing suits on. I went underneath the water and one of the girls followed me and there was a bed on the bottom of the pool. After I had satisfied myself with one girl another came down to the bottom of the pool. This went on for a long time until I could no longer stay underneath the water. I started to dry myself after leaving the water and all the girls gathered around and blew hot air on me until I was dry. It was a wonderful sensation and I lay down on the grass and all the girls surrounded me and started to sing softly in my ears while they stroked my body with soft, gentle hands.
