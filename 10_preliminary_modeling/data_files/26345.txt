 Two basketball teams start to practice together. One of the teams is made up of all white players. The other team is all black players. I'm familiar with the team of white players, but I'm not a player. We all walk into a gym, which is where the white team usually practices. It's a really nice hardwood basketball court with new hoops, and a nice gym. There is a gathering with parents: a program. Several of the white players put different sheets together to assemble the program. I hand a few of these sheets out, though I'm uncomfortable with this because I'm not a team player anymore. I shake hands with several of the black players and say their names, which I don't understand because I've never heard names like that before.
