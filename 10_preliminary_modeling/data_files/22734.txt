In black and white. I ran through some very dirty, cobbled streets which were like ruins. Suddenly I arrived at my house, rather tired, and there were people there. I had to dress up because I was very dirty. I also dreamt that all my friends were coming out of my transmitter. As soon as I awoke, I forgot part of my dream.
