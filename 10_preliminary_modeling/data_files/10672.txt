I climbed up a fire escape from my mom's house to the rooftop of some ghetto. Two drug dealers from my school and Snoop Doggy Dog were hanging out on the roof drinking forties. I joined them. Some cop started bothering us. A fight broke out between one of the boys and Snoop Dog. Snoop pulled out a gun. I ran down the escape. People on the street started to run. He pointed the gun and threatened, "Y'all better tell nobody... or you next." I ran to a bus stop and I was scared because I was the only white girl there. This dorky girl at the bus stop asked me if I was going to the dance. I waited with her till the bus came.
