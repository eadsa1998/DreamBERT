I am cleaning up some papers, letters and books. I feel bad because I have ignored this nice man named Wendel W____. I decide to write him a letter of apology. I write in different colored inks (like my journals and dream books) I take it to him. He is very happy. We lie down together on a bed and I am on top. We make love, but I don't feel the sexual feelings in the dream. We decide not to do the ejaculation in me, so I won't get pregnant.
