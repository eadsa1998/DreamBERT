 My brother Wally is getting married. We're at home preparing for the wedding. Wally comes and expresses his concern that no one is there yet. Grandma Redding is there, using a cane or a walker. I go to the bathroom. When I return, the ceremony is over, and they have just been married! I have missed my brother's wedding! Photographs are taken. I kneel down next to my cousin Melvin Redding.
