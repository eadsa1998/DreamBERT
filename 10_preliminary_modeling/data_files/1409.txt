Tyler and Jerome are in a bedroom together. They are breaking up, arguing and upset. I interrupt them because Grandma Mildred has requested shaving equipment so she can shave Grandpa Lloyd. I ask if I can borrow one from them. They are very annoyed with me and glare, but Tyler gives me his mug and straight razor. I am concerned if Grandma can use it safely.
