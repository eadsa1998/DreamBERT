I dreamt I was in the church which was part of my elementary school in this big uncomfortable dress. And both sides of my parents' families were there. We were waiting a long time, and no one knew when the ceremony would begin. I asked my aunt and she said, "We won't get out until after midnight." All of a sudden I saw my boyfriend drive by in his dirty pickup, full of junk, in the back. I ran out calling his name and chased the truck to the light where they were stopped. He was with one of his friends he hasn't talked to in months and they were both dirty. Then I woke up.
