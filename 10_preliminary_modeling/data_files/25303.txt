 I'm in an airport. People have just parachuted in. My friend Yvette Ullman comes in. She is black, and is dressed in black. Other people from Brimson are also there. I recognize faces but don't know their names. One girl is insulted that I don't remember people's names. Her name is Holly. She has dyed blond hair. My high school classmate, Karen Baton, and her brother Ryan have also parachuted in. <br/
