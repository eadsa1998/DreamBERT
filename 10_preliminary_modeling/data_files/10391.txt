On a trek through the DESERT that is very hilly and sandy; at the end of the trek we are to eat a cake and I carry a jar with water and a knife to cut the cake. However, we have to climb up a very STEEP slope, or Ladder, and when I come to the top, I find that I have lost the jar and the knife, but it is too steep to go back alone, so I call for HELP; remember calling loudly for Marissa Camden to come, but she does not hear me. I decide to wait.....
