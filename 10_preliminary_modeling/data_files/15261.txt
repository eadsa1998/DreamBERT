I was sitting at a table outside with people from Entourage. I only remember seeing Eric and Ari though. Omar Epps and some others were there too. Eric was a lot shorter than me, so I was pretending he was a kid. I sat next to him and joked that he was lame and moved next to Omar. I accidentally splashed him. Then I was at Nana's and Ezra said they were taking the Cocky home. They were saying "eat the poo poo" and I recorded it. I showed Dad later. I was on Facebook and I had a photo of Ezra and Jensen Ackles. Scarlett commented on it and said Jensen had nice eyes. Jared Padalecki was on a photo too. I was watching TV with Mom and Jeremy Piven was on it talking and then it was some show with kids wearing lots of makeup.
