Grey's Anatomy was on TV. Mom said it looked like a good show and I said I hadn't started the new season yet because George had died and he was the only character I liked. Later, Ezra was looking at The Soprano's stuff. There was a picture of Silvio and I said that I liked Silvio. He also typed in some nonsense and we joked it would come up with stuff about Paulie, but it came up with Silvio. I asked who his favourite character was. We were going to the movies and usually I was in the front. Ryan and Ezra were also in the car. I went naked and got dressed in the car for some reason (and I was in the seat behind the passenger). I decided I didn't want to go because it had actually happened before and had to led to some lame events and I turned back time and I had to do everything the same but I didn't want to have to watch all the movies I'd watched again.
