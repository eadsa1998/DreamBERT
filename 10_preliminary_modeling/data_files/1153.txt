Humphrey Bogart is my husband. I am Lauren Bacall. He calls me "Baby." We are in a car. A boy lays down on the road. We see him and don't back up over him. He runs away up some cement stairs to his parents. We follow so we can meet the parents and tell what happened. We meet them. The woman is a black woman, and the man is white. I say, "Oh, how coincidental. My husband (Bogart) is black and I am white. We were meant by fate to meet and get to know each other.
