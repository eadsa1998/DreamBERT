I enter a store, on the second level. I pass through a gauntlet of disability activists picketing the store. I pass through them and notice a balcony rail and go to look over and down at the main floor. It is teeming with people. I've never seen such a crowd. I ask someone what's happening. They say it's a sale. I say, "It must be one heck of a sale to get people to push and shove and force their way in." They say, "It is." I think, "I'd never get myself in there, so why even try?" Then I realize the sale is happening on this floor too. Maybe I'll find something here, where it's not so crowded. I find a yarn department and see the prices are really good. A knitting needle that costs $1.25 is a $1 off. I think of stocking up. I look for rug yarn kits, for hooked rugs, or needlepoint kits. There's not much left. I wonder if I could get a freezer, if they are on this floor.
