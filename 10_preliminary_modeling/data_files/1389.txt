I'm at the house in M City. Some of the C. department is there. I am in the "pool" room. It's changed. Two children are going to have their hair shampooed. Large gobs are put on their head. I am worried. The shower water starts. The kids cry out. It's too hot. I then notice the water sprinkles in the ceiling are raining hot water on us. We escape the room. Then I remember my book is in there. I ask someone to help me. No one does. I do it myself. I make several trips, first for the manuscript, the hard copy and then for the disks (the soft copy) and then for the computer. I am afraid to unplug it in the water for fear of a hot shock. I do it anyway and am pleased that I am successful.
