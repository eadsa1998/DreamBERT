The house is a mess. I am walking down the road and someone comes by me and says I left the house unlocked and keeps on going. I am angry, cause either I leave it open to intruders or I trudge back up the hill and go lock it myself. I go back. Some people are there and I am annoyed with them. I go off alone to watch a movie or something.
