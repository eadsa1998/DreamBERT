Derek is gone. He's taken off. I'm in a room with a lot of cops. They are a group of bad cops and my group is putting the sting on them, to bust them. I'm yelling, "Get in that auditorium room, NOW!" We've cut off their communications with their organization. They're laughing at us because they're the ones with the power, but somehow we surround them and they go in and I slam the door shut. I walk to each one. One dark-haired man is lying on the floor. I pick up his head by the hair and yank him around, saying as I do it, "This is what you did to the patients." Another man I kick in the groin and belly saying, "And this is what you did to them." We have them arrested and taken away. Now I want to find Derek. I go to the screen door and open it to go outside and two men are standing there. I walk past them, and look and look. I come back in, not having found him. Lisa and another young woman are there. We're talking about my silly boots. I say, "Well, that's the way I wear them, Oh look, it's inside out." Then Derek is back, looking for me, only we miss each other and now he's in his car and driving and I'm in my car and driving. We're on the same road, maybe a car between us, and are unaware we are so close to each other. After driving for awhile, Derek sees that it is me in the car ahead and he speeds up to come up on my right side. He waves at me and I smile and see him and we drive side by side for awhile and find a place to park and we get out, Derek in his chair and me with a walker and we embrace.
