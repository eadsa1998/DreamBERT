Last night I went to bed rather late because I started to think about the things I had to do today and I felt very satisfied with the things I had done and about the meeting where I had looked at slides about climbing the Huascaran and of the area of the Huaylas Canyon and the towns around it. I went to sleep in rather good spirits. I dreamed I was at the camp (which in reality was going to be Friday, early in the afternoon) in a green field, a beautiful field where there was a stable and a variety of the finest and most beautiful animals. I was in the position of being the one who made the most maneuvers and I demonstrated things to my friends and felt very happy. Later, in the evening, we sang cowboy songs around the fire and we did this before going to sleep, and we finally fell asleep and everything was over then.
