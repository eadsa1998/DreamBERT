I dreamt at being at a hair salon with my maternal Grandma Jane.  They were talking about her being 70, not 75.  I was looking for the black cat in the store.  It was pregnant and I wanted to make sure it was inside.  I went back and I found it with our cat Buster on my bed.  My high school friend Leon was there.  The cat had already started to give birth.  I took one kitten over to the dresser (it was dark in my room; there was a light from the hall) I typed into a laptop her name was Tilly.  I went back.  Leon handed me 9 cats and I was trying to count them.  She'd given birth to 12!  Then I went back into the games closet.  My brother Stuart, my mother and I pulled a game out.  We had five versions, each box a different color.  I thought they were all the same game, but they weren't.  The one we played was the red box, the one we were used to.  But there were 5 dice in addition to the typical two.  Stuart won after only going halfway around the board, and I was upset because they still wouldn't tell me why there were so many dice.
