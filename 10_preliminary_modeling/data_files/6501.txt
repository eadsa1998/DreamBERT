I was at work and needed to take the bus back to town. So I walked down to the pickup point to get on the bus, and found there was no bus, only three or four beat-up old pickup trucks driven by good-ol-boys. Some disreputable old people from the apartment complex, Morton and his wife, plus another guy that stares at me a lot, were waiting in line, too. "Morton" and his wife were shouting at one another as usual, and the other old guy just stood there, being unnerving. Luckily, they all got in this one blue pickup together. I got in the red one behind them. As I got in the car, I asked: "So. We're going to S City?" Without really answering, the guy said: "Shuttle to B Town!" I was clasping a dollar in my hand and I resolved not to pay if I could possibly avoid it. There was a long drive along a crazy screwed up road, and the upshot was, in order to get to B Town at all we had to drive over the treetops of this really dense forest. So the goodolboy begins driving over the trees and the guy in the back really begins protesting violently, which makes the goodolboy lose his concentration (it takes a lot of concentration to drive on treetops, you know!) and the car kind of tips like a boat taking on water, and then finally falls through the trees twenty or thirty feet. Lucky for me my window was open -- I clambered through the window just as the car tipped onto its side, and took refuge in a branch. When the car hit the ground I climbed down the tree and joined the people. The other passenger was laying motionless at the bottom of a chainlink fence (wind knocked out) and same with the goodolboy. They were both alive, though, and arguing enough that I could sneak off without paying. <br/
