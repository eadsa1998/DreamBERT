Some boys trick me. Then they break into the library to get some beer. I have to go home. One of the teachers is to leave school and we get to a place where suddenly the whole building twists and turns. There is an earthquake and everything collapses and I've got to get away on my motorbike. But there is no more gas in it. I can't get it started. And the operator asks what I did. I say I pressed all kinds of buttons and he says, "Yeah, you really messed it up. Here is your money back, 6,000, I don't want to deal with you anymore." So we go on and get to a place and put the motorbike down. I have been nasty to everyone, also to my son, who does not look like my son. Everything is collapsing and people are furious with me and are after me. Then I run with the motorbike but it still doesn't start and someone else comes from the opposite direction. A friend of my son David. David says, "Dad, this is.... He can fix it." But it is still empty and in the end we don't get it to run.
