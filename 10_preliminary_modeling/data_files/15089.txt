I was at Dad's, which was different. I was going to watch Firefly or something. Then I was at home, which was also different, with Ezra. The X-Files was on TV. Adam Baldwin was in it, though he was young and it was only season 2. I think he was a bad guy. There was also something about Beckman (Chuck) and a crazy dog.
