I was playing a game. I occasionally joined up with a group of people for some post-apocalyptic stuff. Some of them were Game of Thrones characters. Sansa was in a castle. A guy had just been injured and she rushed to the bedroom to see him, saying 'oh please, let me marry him'. There was a Korean guy. Eddard was at the bed and told Sansa to be quiet in case someone heard. I was with the group from before wandering the streets. We were looking for a bad guy and we turned the corner and saw a huge guy standing there, and it was the guy we were looking for. He roared and ran towards us and we ran. He jumped up and turned into a giant. Some others and I organised to find a tall flat surface. The giant said it was for me and a guy to have sex on and gave us a few minutes. We hid behind stuff as he walked past (he was like a skyscraper). He tried to make a guy eat an orange but he was having trouble. I shoved a bit into his mouth and told him to hold onto me tightly. We grabbed this kid and went to the edge and I told them to hold on tight and jumped. I woke up in bed with the guy there. He said it worked but it wasn't perfect as they hadn't eaten all the oranges. Sansa and Arya joined us. I came back later for an exam. I asked where everyone was and it turned out someone had died and Arya was captured.
