I was in this little car which we used to have -- a Fiat -- and it stopped in front of this little house somewhere. It was a small, plain little house which belonged to some of my husband's young relatives, or perhaps they had something to do with the boy who was with us, I believe , a boy who was in his late 20's or early 30's, I would guess, a blind student that I read for. They might have had some connection with him, but at any rate I and Al, I believe, went up to the house and went in and it was sort of a confusing house. It was small on the inside too and there were kids running around. The young woman who lived there was sort of running around after the kids and I was telling her or Al -- if it was still Al, he had turned into some girl -- that I was going to see these movies that were on. At least I would like to see these few movies that were on about based on Thomas Wolfe's novels, Look Homeward Angel and Time and the River and one of his others, I guess. Each of these was a 2-hour movie and they showed them one after the other, and we discussed the merits of doing this for a while. Of course, the last time I read Thomas Wolfe I thought he was awfully adolescent and an adolescent writer and he had a huge opinion of himself and this person agreed with me, but I thought I still might like to go see the movies.
