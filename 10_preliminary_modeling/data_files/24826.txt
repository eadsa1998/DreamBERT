I was at a mall and there was a group of kids. One girl and a bunch of guys surrounding her. I was in a jumper outfit (I hate jumpers) and I had this huge ball which I kept throwing in the air and I would go after it and fall over (I was a klutz). Then my sister came along and we skipped around. Then I was at this hotel in the woods and I walk around the side and it looks like our patio, except enlarged. There's a bench overlooking a creek. There's a full moon and my swim coach is on the bench whistling (he always whistles). That's all I remember. Setting: First at an outdoor mall like in Nebraska or something. Then a hotel or something with a patio and a creek. Characters: This popular pretty white girl, four guys, and me - a girly klutz. Also my swim coach, a 70 year old guy. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy yet stupid, pitiful, dorkish. I was such a klutz and a baby. My coach whistling on like my back porch in the middle of nowhere. It was another bizarre dream.
