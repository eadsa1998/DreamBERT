I was at a hospital and I worked there. George and Izzie (both Grey's Anatomy) were there. Izzie was going to be working with old people who were asleep so I gave her some reading material. Callum Blue was there and he had stitches in his face. There were three movies playing and one was Sample People, but it was completely different. Someone was talking about "dreamy Nathan Page". I recognized Sample People playing and I saw Nathan Page there and I said "I love that movie! I watched it for Ben Mendelsohn, but it ended up being my favourite movie, you were really good". Poppa was there.
