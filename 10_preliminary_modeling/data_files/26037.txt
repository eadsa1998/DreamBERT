 It's Halloween. I'm handing out candy at home. It is late, and I shut the lights off and close the door. Just as I do this people walk up the sidewalk. I give them candy and they leave. More people come. I run out of candy and run inside the house and scrounge some up. I get some Butterfinger candy bars. I am eating, or have made, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
