I dreamed I was taking (Gestalt?) physiology examination. I was working through the examination and I got to this one problem, which was a carbon atom labeling problem, and it was fairly difficult. I spent a long time working through the problem in some detail. It took a very long time to solve. It was a problem concerning the pentose shunt mechanism where you had to figure out which carbon he wanted. In other words, its decarboxilation mechanism where 6 glucose (M oities?_____) eventually end up as 5 glucose (moities?______), but the carbon atoms and the glucose molecules have become rearranged, and the problem is to give it an initial glucose molecule with labeled carbons in it so as to find out how this ends up. I successfully completed this problem after having spent this time on it, and then continued on with the test. The dream was essentially all day residue. I'm anticipating a test and the carbon labeling was the essential content of an entire lecture given earlier this week by Dr. Valuteman.
