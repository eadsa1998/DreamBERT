My school was invited to a dance at this school and first there was a really long line and then the school that was having the dance left and we started drawing on the walls and talking. This girl named Courtney was making out in the same room. Setting: At a big big school. Characters: Me, Robin, Steve, Courtney, Will, Patty. They are all friends from school. Steve is the head guy of the school. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, sad. I was happy there was a dance, but I was angry that it was boring and I didn't get to make out with Will.
