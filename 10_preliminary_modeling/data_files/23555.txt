I was walking down aisles looking for something. Like I was shopping. I saw birthday favors and confetti. But that wasn't what I was looking for. Then there were lockers and each one belonged to a person. Each locker or box had gifts in it but mine was empty. I kept getting shocked (physically, like electricity) when I tried to touch my locker. I was walking around aimlessly and the room was filled with aisle upon aisle of lockers. The room was full of unknown people.
