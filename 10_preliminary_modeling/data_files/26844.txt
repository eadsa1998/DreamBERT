 I have just returned from the Big Resort Area with my friend Bubba Hacker, and we're in a grocery store. We're buying small plastic cups of pudding for our friend Kevin Simpson. There are different flavors, and they have whipped cream on top. They're cheap: we buy Kevin five or six. I see my friend Stephanie Peterson and say hi. We leave. I give Bubba $15 gas money for driving back from the Big Resort Area.
