I dreamed I was at my own wedding (I am not married). I was conscious of the fact that although my mother (age 44), my father (age 47), and my sister (age 22) were quite nervous, I had an overwhelming feeling of contentment and happiness. As we walked down the aisle, which was down the center of an extremely large ballroom, the small orchestra was playing "A1ways." My groom (his face was not clear to me, and it was no one I know) was already at the altar and he was watching me intently. It took a long time for my parents and me to walk down the aisle; but all the while I returned my groom's gaze although I was aware that my parents were nodding to people in the audience and smiling at them. Suddenly, with my eyes still on my husband to be, I started to sing along with the orchestra. My mother was very startled and appeared to be a little embarrassed at my unconventiality, but my father quietly said to her, "This is all hers." My dream ends while I was still walking down the aisle and singing, and the whole audience, and my parents, were smiling and some of them were crying because of the great love my fiance and I had for each other.
