My house is filled with boxes of Terry's and I can't get around. I am concerned. I see she is packing things out of the house and I go around back and see down out a window that she has taken two of my crocheted afghans. I holler down, "Hey, Sue, Susan," I can't remember her name, like it's Ellie's roommate sunny. I go quickly around to the font door to call out, saying to Ellie, "She may take the TV set, but that's not so bad, I have insurance." Ellie says she's more worried she'll take the food, considering the problem she has with weight. "Oh, I never thought of that," I say. It wouldn't be so bad. I'd not be reimbursed, but it's not so much a loss. I go down the hall and some woman agrees with me that I have been gaining a lot these past five years and it really shows. I walk away from her saying, "See, I knew that but people wouldn't tell me the truth. I hate aging!"
