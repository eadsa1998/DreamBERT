Lat night I had kind of a dumb dream. I dreamt that I was at school and they were having like this graduation fair party. And I was there with Melinda. And Mom was going to come and join me. And Mom went in the bathroom and said, "I'll meet you guys outside." And Melinda and I went to this classroom that was set up with little work stations, and they were supposed to be like audio work stations, but ours was kind of like bland because somebody stole our mixer board, and there was just this TV playing like video footage that somebody took with a camera. And Melinda and I are sitting there watching it because, you know, she thinks it's like really cool, and next thing I know I'm kind of falling asleep. And then I start getting really into it too, just watching everything that this person videotaped. And then all of a sudden, it didn't feel like too much longer but I realized it was three hours later, and the whole party was over and Mom was back to get us and find out what happened to us. And I was so mad that Mom didn't come and get us sooner, that she was in the car taking me home, I was screaming and yelling and whipping my purse out the window and like, "Why wouldn't you come and get us? You made me miss the party!" And I was so resentful that Melinda sat there, bored as anything, but she was watching that movie that I thought she thought was interesting and we missed all the rest of the goings-on that day. And so I don't know what that means, but that was kind of dumb.
