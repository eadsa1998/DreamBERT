For some reason, I was watching Hot Tub Time Machine [note: I haven't seen it, nor am I interested in seeing it]. Then it was real. Everyone was running from someone into a building with different rooms behind these curtains. I was there too and ran into a room with mirrored walls and I could see everyone else. I then woke up in bed in a house with the shutters on the window opening. I was married to Harrison Ford (who was one of the people who were running before). We wondered why we were partnered up and I was annoyed I hadn't been paired up with Eugene. There was dog poo on the floor. We had a little dog, who was old, and had liver problems.
