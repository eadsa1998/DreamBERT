I was walking thru the fields and the small weeds looked like a small forest. They looked like trees and beyond there was woods. Bill Mohr was walking with Joe Grabar. I said, "Hi Bill," and he said, "Yes, Bill what?" and I said, "Yes, you are Bill and look like a Bill." Joe walked down the hill with us an we were watching for pit holes. Then finally we came to one and I said, "This is what you can see a lot of here, a lot of cave in into the coal mines." We looked into the hole and there was a man in there. We threatened and commanded them to come out and he did. Joe had a gun and I told him to hold the man captive. He held the man and I was up on a bank looking down on the suspect and Joe. I went down and Joe gave me one of the pistols. I pointed it at the suspect. Joe was going away and I was to guard the man. Joe left and the suspect was in my hands and could see he was trying to escape. I pointed the gun at him and threatened and commanded him to not try to get away or I would blast him, my finger was on the trigger and I was pulling slowly on the trigger. Then the man turned into a woman and she tried to get away. I threatened her with my gun and fist. I also threatened the man before with my fist.
