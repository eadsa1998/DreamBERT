["The disabled man stands up."] I go to the office of Bob T. to get an opinion and some advise. He is in a wheelchair. He is pleasant to talk with and very supportive. Merle is around somewhere. I leave and then need to return and ask him some more questions. I go down a school hall looking for his office. I find what looks like the right place, but none of the green doors have labels on them, so I don't know which door is his office. One door opens and a person walks out on crutches. I figure this is his office and I go in. I turn and see him standing near me. No wheelchair and he is very big and tall. I am surprised. He apparently can stand and walk a bit, like I can. He smiles and sits close to me. Another woman and her friend sit close by and the four of us are in physical contact we are sitting so close together. Our knees bump and so on. I am aware of the contact with Bob. He seems attracted to me and I to him. It is friendly and pleasant. Now I am in a room with my two daughters, Paulina and Ellie. I am cleaning up my things and want them to help carry some of the dresses. Ellie is not interested in being helpful. I am a bit annoyed with her. I look out the window and I see many black whales lying down for a nap. They are above the water line, and are nose to tail thick. Hundreds of them. I then turn and decide to boat down a water way thick with sea lions. I go fast and then turn to go back. I slow down, concerned I will hit a sea lion because they are just under the surface of the water. The water has brown spots of sea weed in it.
