 I'm deer hunting in an area that is like Grandma and Grandpa Redding's farm. I'm out near a cornfield that is cut down. There are several small fields around it with standing corn. There is a woods there too. There are a lot of hunters outside: six or eight are visible along the cornfield. I go near a man and his son, not initially realizing that I may be too close to them. Deer are everywhere. Some men on the edge of the woods seem to be leading a doe, as if it is tame or it is a pet. Deer frequently run across the field and are seen daring around the field edges. I take a couple shots at one deer. There is a group of men driving a field of standing corn that I am near. I think I should move, and I do. There are foxes and rabbits around. I am in a small building similar to one of the old chicken coops. I see a small fawn. At first it seems bigger than it actually is. I aim, but see it is really small. I am near it. It is lying down, like a lamb. I pet the fawn. Later, the fawn is gone. Outside there is a pink-headed peacock on the road into the cornfield.
