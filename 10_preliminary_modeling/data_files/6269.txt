A dream that I have been constantly having since my early childhood has been bothering me for quite some time. The dream occurs in this beige-colored room -- not quite brown -- with no doors and no other way out. Throughout this dream I am a small particle in this huge room and all I seem to be doing is looking for a way out. The reason why I keep looking is because there is this deep man's voice calling my name. It keeps getting closer and closer to me. I am totally helpless in this dream because I can go nowhere. However, I somehow find a way to get out of the room. I'm not quite sure how but it does me no good. Because when I get out I end up in another room exactly like the one I was just in except that it is white and not that beige color. The thing that is weird about this dream is that it occurs in slow motion and I can't seem to move fast enough to get away from the voice. If I do the whole process starts all over again. Everytime I hear the voice all I want to do is run, but there is nowhere to run. That's all I remember about the dream and I never know if anything or what happens to me. Basically, I wake up right when the voice gets so close that it is in back of me and when I turn around to see who or what it is I can still see nobody and usually I wake up.
