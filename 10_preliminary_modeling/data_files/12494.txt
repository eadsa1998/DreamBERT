Mom dropped me off at home, which was actually Dad's 'work'. He had started his own bottle shop. I had forgotten my keys. Ezra was in the car too. Darren took me back later and I forgot my keys again. Dad was there this time though and he said to turn the lights off when the shop closed because he was going out. The customers were getting angry. People from school were there. Then it was closed, so I quickly got rid of all the customers.
