I am sitting on a couch with Kathleen Corey and some other people from where I worked, presumably department heads. Another colleague is sitting opposite us in a chair, going over some enrollment figures with us.  I feel very awkward and out of place, but it seems I am needed to supply some of the information.  I don't remember what happens.
