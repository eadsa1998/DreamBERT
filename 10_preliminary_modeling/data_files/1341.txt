Dwight/I leave. We are going up to the mountains to be alone. We take food. The snow is deep. We napped. When we woke up a huge bear was standing up ready to strike and eat us up. We threw our food at him and barely escaped! We went back down and looked for our old apartment. My father and my mother watched us from their apartment window. We found it, #18. We went in only to discover someone else had already moved in. We tiptoe out hoping that they don't catch us. We walk on. Finally, it is time to return. We have to jump from a very high bridge and swim a very deep and wide river. We poise to dive and we're scared. I make the bridge come lower and we jump in. It is very shallow and then after a few strokes it is very deep. We swallow a little water and struggle but we make it to the other side.
