My dream begins like this: I was sad and with no money and I asked Our Lady of Guadalupe to help me win at the races, and I was completely asleep, but I heard voices which told me, "3-4-8" and I said, "No, no, not that." Suddenly I was in an all-white room which looked like a hospital where there were three beds and on each bed two women which I didn't know. I awoke without being able to interpret my dream.
