I had started for a train and finding the New Year's tea in the waiting room. Lingered there but returned for suitcase. Started out again but found I had left suitcase, feared the door was locked but it wasn't. When I finally got it, met M. who was going on the same train. Noticed it was 16 minutes of and the train was leaving at 15 of, so asked M. if she was taking a taxi, went with her but got separated at the station. Hurried in and asked where to check suitcase. "Right here" and did so without any ticket, asked where to buy one. "At that window." It was double. Two men were at one, I went to the other. Heard, "Train waits here, you have time." I got a large ticket cut in an odd shape. I couldn't remember the name of my destination. Said it began with a C and was about three stations away. He said, "Bonneville, we pronounce it Buno." Wondered how he knew. Asked, "How much?" He said, "Nothing." "But why?" "Read the paper." I much puzzled get on the train. Two men were scrubbing the floor on the side, the other side was wet and looked like hallways. Room at end like European first class car with U.S. section. I look for M. and try to find a seat. While at ticket window, think I lost handbag but now find it on my arm.
