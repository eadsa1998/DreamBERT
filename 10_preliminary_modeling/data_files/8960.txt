I was at an SAID meeting. I don't know where it was being held or why. I was sitting at a table talking with a group of people and there are other people in the same room but not part of our group. Aaron S is sitting alone at a table working on something financial for SAID, seems that it is related to budget. My group is discussing what Aaron S is working on and someone says that they don't think he is the right person to be doing that, implying that he isn't qualified or won't do it as well as someone else might. It is something that SAID has alot of trouble finding someone qualified who will do it. I was sitting there thinking that I am qualified and could do it well but that I would not like doing it at all. So, I decided not to say anything. Someone else said that they could do it well though no one responded, implying that they didn't agree. Some others agreed that it was quite a challenging task rather than telling this woman that they didn't have faith in her ability to do it well. As we continued talking I had an idea about exhibit space at the next conference. I reached kind of behind me to my right and grabbed a paper napkin to write on. I jotted a note to myself so I wouldn't forget to mention it at the appropriate time and then slid it under something so the person I was going to talk to about it wouldn't see it. It was something about using individual smaller rooms for some of the exhibitors. The person I was going to talk to about it was sitting next to me and noticed what I was doing. I told her that I had something to discuss with her later and smiled as I slid the napkin under the other object. She smiled back. One or two other people made comments and I just smiled. We continued with the group discussion.
