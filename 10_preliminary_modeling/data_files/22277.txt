There was a big party in my home and there were lots of guests. I went into the living room and discovered that they were all from Iquitos (I met them when I went there three years ago). I disliked them terribly because they seemed awfully vulgar and ordinary. I discovered they were eating a roasted pig and asked them to let me try a bit of it, but they refused to let me. I was indignant because they were in my home and besides, my mother had put out the pig. However, we saw two women get away through the window, taking a whole leg of the pig with them. We chased them and they locked themselves in a bathroom that is in our patio and wouldn't let us in. My mother and I pushed the door. I told her that these women were so petty that they would probably throw the pig down the toilet. After a lot of pushing, my mother was able to get into the bathroom, but they closed the door behind her and I was unable to open it again. I cried for help, fearing that they would harm my mother, and the police came. They opened the door and my mother came out unharmed, but there was no trace of the pig. I told my mother, "I told you they were going to throw it down the toilet." We went back to the house sadly and I saw a pig on a window. I asked my mother to give me a piece, but she refused because it didn't belong to her.
