I dreamed I was walking down B. Road, by myself, when a car pulled up and said, "Hello, S." That's the name my family has for me and I walked to the car. There were three fellows all tall and good-looking whom I recognized as being people I knew well - but I didn't think of them separately. They drove me home and after I walked inside I knew they were J., a nephew on my father's side - J., a cousin on my mother's side - and J., my sister's fiance.
