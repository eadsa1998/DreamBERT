I was in front of a boy I had always dreamed about. He was a very shy boy. I had to force him to speak because he was very quiet. What impressed me most were his eyes, which were steel gray and shone extraordinarily. I invited him to a party I had organized at home and we danced all night and were together the whole time, until in a moment I was not watching, he started talking to a girlfriend. I saw him differently; he wasn't shy any more. Instead he was rather careless. I was disillusioned and I withdrew to my bedroom because everything had failed.
