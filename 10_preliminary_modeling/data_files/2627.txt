I am in a room. Outside the room are empty jail cells and school rooms. No one else is there. I am aware someone is trying to kill me. The door opens and a white pail with a thin creamy white liquid is put in the room. I realize it's an explosive and I run, grab a broom and sweep it out of the room. I slam the door, but the broom with some of the liquid on it gets back in the room, by the door. I go to the center of the room and wait. It all explodes. I am unhurt. Now a man is in the room with me and he says intently, "I'm hungry." He looks at a bowl of mush and I look and it's covered with mold (big mixing bowl). I grab it and run for the sink and turn on the faucet to wash it down the drain before he tries to eat it and get sick. I also have a banana I'd brought in from my lunch and it swells up with water. I'm going to give it to the man because I know it's not poisoned because it came with me, but then I realize I'd best protect myself and eat it or I'd have no food. I squeeze or "milk" the water out (also a white liquid); it gets skinny and flaccid. I take a bite out of it (or break off a piece and eat it). I remain on the alert because there's other ways I could get killed here. The man says, "Oh I didn't realize they wanted us to marry/have sex." He goes on to explain how he isn't very careful and doesn't let the rubbers warm up properly. He's following me around and I say to him, "Please stop talking like this. I'm scared; people are trying to kill me and this isn't helping."
