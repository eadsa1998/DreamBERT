I was performing an experiment. The experiment was very difficult and I did not entirely understand it. Finally after much practice I knew what I was doing. I pulled a string that was attached to a bird's beak. I was afraid I was going to hurt the bird and at first I did not want to perform the experiment. I saw that I was getting behind in my work so I finally tried the experiment. To my amazement, everything worked out all right.
