We go to a restaurant with TOM FOSTER (former roomer) and old friend Kathee; we pay for Tom since he doesn't have enough money and we had promised ourselves to help the poor. -- shift: Tom and Kathee are babies and almost drown in the swimming pool; we barely rescue them; then they are checked for blood pressure and heart rate; we too are being checked for blood pressure, and I am the last one to be checked.
