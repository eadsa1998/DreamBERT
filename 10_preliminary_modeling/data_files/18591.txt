I was engaged to a fellow I'd just met the day before. He was a waiter at a restaurant. He was Spanish or of some genetic background heavy on the black, black straight hair and deep tanned skin. I forgot the guy's name but since we were engaged I went to see him at the restaurant. I was carrying Rudy's tennis racket and Rudy had asked me to slide it under the equipment in the waiters' changing room. I put the tennis racket in a paper bag so (that) nobody would steal it. (its identity hidden) Me and my fiance and his buddy went to the beach and sat in the warm tidal pool. I didn't know either of their names, but it was pretty obvious they were gay. I said, "Don't you want to swim out in the OCEAN?" My fiancée's buddy said, "NO, it's too cold." So I went swimming in the ocean alone. It was not too cold at all. I went to a computer seminar and the girl next to me had a problem. 3 big pieces of popcorn were growing out of her chin and we were trying to figure out how to get the popcorn removed. On her face, the popcorn was dense and could not even be whacked off. We went to a 3-day seminar to try and figure it out on both Quark and internet. When I got back from the computer seminar I went to the restaurant at the beach. A guy told me my fiancée had died in a fire the night before. One report said he had been trying to rescue the fire victims. The other report said he and his buddies were smoking crack, dropped the pipe and burned the apartment building down. I went to see William at our new place. He was teaching. He had an office we could walk into. He said, "Merri, your fiancée was killed last night." And I said, "I know. What day is class. Do you wanna got to the beach?"
