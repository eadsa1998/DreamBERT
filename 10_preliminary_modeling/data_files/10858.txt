I was on an embankment by a lake with two of my girlfriends from Mather. There was a card table there and some chairs where we had eaten lunch. One of the girls was away from the table. I looked across and there was a flowing river going down the hill which looked more like a ski jump. It was so smooth and there was an edge just above the level of the lake over which the water flowed slowly. As I looked at this, I saw a tall blond young man in what looked at first like a canoe sitting straight up with a paddle floating down this river and landed on the lake. He was in a kayak (Eskimo boat). He jumped out. He was wearing dark trousers, loud socks, moccasins, and a dark shirt, and swam hard to a launch nearby letting the kayak drift. The launch was wide and gray and not like any I had ever seen.
