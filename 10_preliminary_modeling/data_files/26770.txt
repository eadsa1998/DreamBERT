 I'm going into a sporting goods store like Smith's Sports. I meet my friend Sam Kingsley, who is on his way out. I ask him to come into the store with me. I'm going to look at and possibly purchase, some athletic equipment. We go to the section of rollerblades. Then we're in a section of Lacrosse-like equipment, or some sport like it, where there are long sticks with nets on one end. They are different from lacrosse sticks, specified for the sport, which I'm not sure of. I see a stick that looks all right, and look at its price. It costs $75, which is much more than I thought it would.
