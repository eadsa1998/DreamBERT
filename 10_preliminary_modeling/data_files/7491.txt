I am in some sort of classroom or hall (in Israel) when the phone rings. I don't remember if it was I who had initiated the call. Yes, I think I did. Mary answers and I hear distinctly the unique sound of her pleasant voice. She tells me she can't talk to me now because she's busy. She tells me to call back soon. Then she hastens to assure me that she'd do anything for me. I hang up and am very thoughtful about what she had said. I'm anxious to get back to talking to her.
