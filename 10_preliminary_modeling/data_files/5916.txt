Am sleeping in an Army barracks. Something has disturbed a guy at other end of room and it wakes me up. Room is full of men in bunks. The disturbed guy throws a pillow at me all the way to my end of room. I catch and shout to him that I have better things to do than mess with him. He walks towards my bunk and I just lie there and hold pillow. As he gets nearer I throw the pillow at him. He ignores, turns and goes back to his bunk.
