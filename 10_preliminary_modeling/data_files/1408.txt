I am tired and get up. I go into a common dining room. I see eggs frying and get a spatula to turn them over. They break and are difficult. Co-worker Juliet gets a very long handled spatula and does it. Sheila J and I talk. Mabel tells me my dress is on inside out. She says she'll stay with me for awhile. I say, "Great! Let's ride horses." She groans. I say, "Just for 15 minutes." She reluctantly agreed. I wonder why I want to; it's silly. Juliet asks what language class I'm taking from Sheila J. I say French and change it to poetry. I try to explain to Sheila why I'll be absent for the first week because of the counselor work schedule.
