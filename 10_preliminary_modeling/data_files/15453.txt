I had a job interview at Bunnings. It was different. I had to shake hands with heaps of people and then shake fingers. A lady gave me a uniform and I accidentally dropped some keys into a chute, but they didn't go all the way down. On my first day, I forgot the uniform and she just gave me a spare. She got me to sit at a closed register and said to read 'mobile network' books. Elijah was there as a customer, but then he was working on the front counter and said "I just had Bob Dylan [as a customer]" and everyone was like 'What? Why didn't you say anything?'. Mom made fun of the uniform. It was a darkish green and the shirt was quite stiff and the shorts were short.
