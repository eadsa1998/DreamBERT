It entailed me and 2 of the maintenance men that work here in this complex, playing a game of Monopoly. We have a fairly large dining area in this building where I live. Both of these men is named Dick, Dick T and Dick B. and they're both very nice, capable men, in terms of taking care of needs and repairs. We were sitting at one of the tables out in the dining area and the Monopoly board was on the table in front of us with all the little pieces, the ship and the shoe and the whole thing on the board, but we were playing with several decks of cards. Somehow we would score the Monopoly game by the hands of the cards we were dealt. And Dick T and I were doing very well, we would get good hands, but Dick B got 2 zeros in a row, became very angry and said "I ain't playing this game no more and got up and left".
