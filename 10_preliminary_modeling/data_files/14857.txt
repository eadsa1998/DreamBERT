I had to one more trimester of the MUPC but it didn't count towards grades. I sent an email as 'Katy' to them asking about it. I got a reply from Mr Epstein saying they were looking to change it soon. I was annoyed about it. It was also October 14. The subject selection sheet had stuff like newspaper, create, bounty hunter etc. For the bounty hunter one, you had to scan barcodes on people. Calvin was there. We picked the same first choice but he put my second choice as his last.
