There was a sheet of ice on the flat roof. It came loose, so I crawled under it and broke it loose. It seemed to be flexible and I was walking under it and looked above thru the ice as though it was glass. I had on a hat of honor of some kind. I walked with a lady of honor to a dinner. I noticed I had the hat with the top off. It just had a thick band and I took it off at the table.
