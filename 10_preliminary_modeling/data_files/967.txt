Ernie is in a car. I'm talking to him. We are parked in front of a house that sits between the old M City house and Dora's house. I see Mrs. XXX. I go to her old house to get something. I wish they'd move in again. Ernie drives me to my driveway. He says he'll come back and pick me up a little later. I gather up my things that are in a disorganized mess on the seat, papers, a T.V. guide, appointment book, etc. I start to walk toward the house. Someone comes out, a bad guy. He stops me. He has a small person on his back. He makes me the one that has to whip the little person to death. I am appalled. I'm being forced into it. A crowd gathers. I/Ernie slowly pick up the whip and I/Ernie get an idea. I/Ernie start beating the little person, so cleverly that the sting of the whip hurts the bad guy more. I move the whip to the back of the bad person's knees and whip and whip and whip until he drops. I am exhausted but proud of myself. I lift up Muffin Cat and say to the crowd, "I want you to meet the one who really did it," but the crowd isn't paying any attention. They are going to listen to a woman sing. I try to speak louder, but they don't pay attention. I pet Muffin Cat and say, "It's O.K. You did a good and clever thing."
