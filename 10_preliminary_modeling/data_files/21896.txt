We were inside of a big rock. We had it hollowed out into one big room. It was about a hundred feet high and the same for the width of the inside. I looked up at the high ceiling and walls and said, "What a nice, smooth, hard rock." We had done a good job. I was peeling off the rock crust which made the rock smooth and polished like. I was also peeling the skin off an apple with my fingernails, the rock also with my nails. We had some rocks on the lawn also.
