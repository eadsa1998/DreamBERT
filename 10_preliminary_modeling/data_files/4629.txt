["Physical therapy. Better get going."] I am trying to do exercises of my feet. I use a sort of stair step device. A dog is friendly and nearby. I tell someone he belongs to some people who live with me. A Doctor or physical therapist follows me around, concerned and talking about a possible problem with some of the bones, muscles and joints in my right foot. He names a part or a technique I should be concerned about.
