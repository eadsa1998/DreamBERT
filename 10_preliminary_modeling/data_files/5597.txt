[1997-05-25] I dreamt about Mother Abigail in Stephen King's "The Stand." I don't know what the dream was about but she was in it along with some of the other characters from the book; Stu Redman and Frannie Goldsmith, there were some others there but that is all I can recall. I don't know where I was or anything , but the book does take place in Colorado and Mort and I were there once.
