Ezra and I were outside this cinema at this rocky place. We saw Austin and Ezra asked him why he was there (it was late at night) and he was waiting for Indiana Jones 4. We had keys so we let him in. I finished Monkey Madness on Runescape. When I was killing the demon, I had low health and ate some tuna, but I finally killed it. The next day we were at a shop at the food hall. Calvin was there. This lady there accused me of breaking into the cinema, but she had no proof. She and this other girl started chasing us and we were throwing cakes at each other. They kept putting them over my head. I caught the other girl and told her that the other lady was making it up but she didn't believe me. Finally, she got caught and we decided to take the cakes.
