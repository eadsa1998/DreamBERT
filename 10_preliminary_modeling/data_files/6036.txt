I had a dream where I used to work, the guys' clothes store called Dejaiz (a chain of the merry-go-round). I remember talking to people who I worked with but I don't remember exactly who they were. I remember one of them saying that I had better do a better job selling or they would fire me. Then up on the roof there was someone famous, so I ran over to see him. He was on stage so one of the bodyguards told me to go up the stairs because the bodyguard had mistaken me for someone else. So I did and he knew who I was and I knew who he was but then the dream ended because my mother was looking for me. She was calling my name.
