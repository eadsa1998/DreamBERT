I found out that Eugene actually lived at 44 Casserley Ave. I went driving down there with Mom and it was a fancy house. I got out of the car and was going to take photos of it, but I heard someone talking to Eugene, so I stayed back. Somehow I ended up in the house. There was something that said his middle name was Trenton or something. His father was called Eugene as well. His mother said something that implied I'd been noting down all this information on Eugene and she gave me hers, Eugene's and Abraham's (his father's) birth certificate.
