I'm in bed with Gordon (co-worker). We are lying there, clothed, talking about clients and work. I look out the window and see a boy who is turning in to a duck. He is growing soft white down on his chest. I am intrigued by this boy. He's been abandoned. I reach out and touch the downy softness. I ask him to come into the house. We'll examine him and take care of him. A couple of VR counselors come in. One is Paul Simon. I am attracted to him and vice versa. I am now on the periphery of the group. I go outside and sit down. Paul comes out with 3 copies of the VR class report on the boy. I start to read it. A tall guy, a friend of Paul's comes over. He's my boyfriend. He sits near me. Paul goes in the house and sits in the upstairs window and looks longingly down at me. I look longingly up at him. We silently agree to go away. The tall guy leaves for a minute. Paul and I sneak off. Wherever we go, this tall guy appears. We even go to different time periods. In one time period, I complain about the locked in lot of women. The tall guy appears as a boxer. I keep wanting to read the case report. Paul decides to take me home to his house. We have to sneak in because his parents would misunderstand and think we just wanted to go to bed. Paul leaves me at the front door and sneaks around to the back. The father comes out and finds a baby at the door step. I am in full view but he doesn't see me. I'm lying on my back, hiding. The father pulls some clothes, adult women size, out of a hamper for the baby. He then massages the mother's neck to placate her. He's taking care of her so she won't throw the baby out.
