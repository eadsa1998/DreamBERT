I was on an island in this dream. There were two large buildings that looked like Navy barracks on it and there was a terrific wind blowing. In one of the barracks there were about a hundred men and in the other about a hundred women. I was going from one building to the other for some reason or another and my dream ended when the wind tore off my blue shirt that I was wearing and somehow it was sucked into a small hole in one of the barracks.
