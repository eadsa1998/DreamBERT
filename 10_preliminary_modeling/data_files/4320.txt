["Who's going to clean up?"] It is late night and a band of musicians are finally done playing. But they don't go home. They sit in their chairs all night sleeping. The floor is a mess. Papers and junk all over it. I attempt to push the paper pictures in a row on the floor under the bandstand, but don't go so far as to pick them up and put them away. I go to bed. The next morning I get up and my mother wants me to clean up this mess. I say why should I have to do it? You didn't clean up anything, nor did the musicians. On older man, one of the musicians wakes up and leaves. My mother says if you won't clean up the mess, then just leave and live somewhere else. I say OK, I will. I go to my room to pack. Then I not only don't want to pick up the mess but I'm too tired to pack. I just want someone else (my mother?) to clean up the mess.
