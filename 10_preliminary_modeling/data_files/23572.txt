Went to a man's pink, castle-like Victorian house. Huge. I made popcorn, sat on his couch and he came in. Realized he had a wife/girlfriend, felt bad and left. Met up with Rhonda. Dick shows up. In a dance club. Yelling at the DJ about the awful music. Hiding behind pilaras. Dick finds me with a checkbook in hand. Driving around in a truck with Amy [my deceased sister]. Huge planes shaped like saucers were landing near Twin Peaks. She said, "Those are high level government dignitaries." In another place. See an old roommate who tried to pretend she didn't notice me. Went into an elevator and it started falling rapidly. I scream, felt real. Elevator stops. I go out by a pool and I see this beautiful red bird that had my face or some woman's. It was a lovely bird, velvety wings. In awe of its beauty. Out of nowhere a giant black crow or raven swoops down on it and starts pecking at its belly.
