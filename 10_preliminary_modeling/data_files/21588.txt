I saw the number 1231 on some object that was moving by. I was in the country. I saw and heard two big frogs croaking their heads out of the water. I went further and I saw a doe lying on top of a dead buck. I felt sorry for the doe. Someone shot the buck out of season and it got away but it died. I was by a r.r. track watching the traffic moving. I was going to jump a freight as it started to move, but I saw a man near which made me think he was a r.r. detective.
