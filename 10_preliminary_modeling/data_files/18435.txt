Recalled fragment: I was an FBI agent or something like that, and I had defected to the enemy, who seemed to be rather primitive natives of some sort. I had gotten rather romantically involved with this native girl, but I think I was ambivalent in my feelings. Then I was captured by the police and FBI, who considered me very dangerous, but were also sorry that I had defected. I don't recall my reason for defecting, but it was on the order of doing something that was good for my country in the long run, even if it hurt them immediately. Anyway, I was being taken back to police headquarters at the last of the dream, and thinking that they should treat me, a former policeman, with a little more respect.
