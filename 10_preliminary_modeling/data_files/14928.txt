I was at dads and it was different. Rover was there. Dad made dinner for Ezra and himself, but left me some. I went to bed and told them to make sure the balcony was locked, so Rover didn't fall off. This girl created this product called Depeche Mode and sold it twice. I was on LastFm, looking at the top of 2009 and there were lots of Depeche Mode songs. I went to France and this nice girl and guy showed me around. First I was with Mom and Ezra in a car. We drove past a waterslide which went straight into the ocean. These kids threw some powder and it got in Ezra's hair. There was a river thing going through a cliff. There was a shop with lots of toys.
