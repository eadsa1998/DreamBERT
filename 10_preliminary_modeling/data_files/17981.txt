My friend Jason called.  He had gotten his own place to live in the city we work in.  Then I was standing on a porch of his family's place.  He had a sibling with Down's syndrome who was sad that he would be leaving.  Jason didn't seem to care.  Jason was supposed to have painted the room we were in, but there were big blank patches that he'd skipped.  I said something about his laziness or irresponsibility to not finish his task but someone in his family defended him.  I consoled the sibling with Down's syndrome.
