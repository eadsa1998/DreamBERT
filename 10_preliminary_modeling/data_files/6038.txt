I am walking up this hill with my friend Carolyn (in the neighborhood where my grandmother lives) and we see her cousin Joe. He is washing a car. (Joe does not live in my grandmother's neighborhood. I also have a crush on Joe, though he is really shy.) We see him and he joins us on our walk. We end up at a convenience store and Carolyn buys a magazine. When we leave he holds my hand and acts in an outlandish way (shouting, jumping. This is very unlike Joe. He is very still and quiet in character.) That is all I remember.
