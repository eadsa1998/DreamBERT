I'm looking at a huge hand-written and colored book. I see a movie image of a small cute fox and a cute pig as they are playing and crawling on some metal stand. Then they jump into water and swim, and I observe how in movies what looks like a difficult feat is really two easy things done separately and cut to look like one. Then in the book I am reading is a list of the training it took for the little animal (dog) to be trained. My Uncle Willis trains the animal from birth. So the list goes. Sanitary 3 1/2 weeks A. (phone #) 2" = (only went to bathroom on floor twice). There was lots more and it was calligraphied and the huge capital letters were hand-painted. I ask my father if Uncle Willis made this book! I am impressed. My father says yes. I turn the page and see cartoons and I laugh. The first square is a car going over a cliff and lots of men grabbing at Uncle Willis, and a cow caught up innocently goes over too. The next square is a closeup of Willis in the car. Men are behind (one political party) grabbing for him and in front coming through the windshield, hands pushing him back (the other political party.) I say to my father, "He must have been running for some political office locally." A small boy (3 or 4 years old) comes and stands by me and says, "I wonder where I could buy some books for 15 cents." My mother who had been sleepily sitting in a chair nearby, tiredly opens her eyes and says disapprovingly and cranky, "I wonder what you mean by that!" (She thinks he's hinting for her to get him some books.) I put my arm around him and pull him close so he can share my book and pat him on his tummy reassuringly. My Aunt Rosalie is watching. My father says, "Do you think it's safe to use the computer now?" I say, "I think so." I pull up to a card table near where he's working so I can companionably read and chat with him as he turns on the computer.
