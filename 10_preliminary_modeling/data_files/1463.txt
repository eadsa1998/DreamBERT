The front lawn as well as the ocean is black and the waves are high and have white caps. I see the silhouetted figure of Ernie outside; he's waiting for me. He's going to splash me, as a joke. I go to the front window. He's there. I run to the back windows. He's there. I sneak out. He and some of his friends gather around me and get serious. They want to drown me. I fell. Now I'm on a train, holding a baby. A woman on my right likes babies and adjusts the blanket so she can see him better. I say, "Pretty clever, having a reversible blanket so you can always see him." The train is racing through the mountains. It's more like a roller coaster ride.
