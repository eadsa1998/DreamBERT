I was at the CAS office. Blair K and Haley N were both there. We each had our own office. Blair K had fixed his office up, personalized it and everything. My office was very dark. It had a dark colored carpet. Three of the walls were dark paneling. The other wall had a very dark wallpaper. I had put up nails and hung some things. At another point I had taken them all down. I can't remember if I was having my office redecorated or if I was moving into another office. I had taken everything off the walls then I decided to take all the nails out of the wall. I was just reaching up and pull them out with my hand. Some of them, the nails had been put in these holes. They were maybe an inch or inch and a half in diameter and equally deep. The nail had been put into the wall directly in the middle of that hole. Haley N had gone out and bought some live plants that were on sale. They didn't look very good at all. They weren't healthy. They were small and scraggly. She had also bought macrame plant hangers in different colors and different color combinations. One was a pale yellow with maybe white and rust color design in it. I was hanging those plants and trying to decide which hanger would go best where. The flowerpots themselves were very dirty so I had to wash them off. That is when I was thinking that she had gotten these plants on sale and had not spent much money on them. That's why they looked so bad. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I was just surprised that she had bought something on sale that she had bought plants that looked like that. It just surprised me.
