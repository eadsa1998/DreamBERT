I was at this weird place and Aunt Sally was living there, underground. Ezra was wearing a nappy and was chucking a spaz. People from Queer as Folk (US) were there. Scott Lowell and I ended up going out (only after a few minutes). Johnny Depp was there also. There was a premiere thing. He was flirting with me and there was this bouncy flower thing and there were pipes. Something turned into a mushroom. Scott and I left and we went to McDonald's. I wanted a chicken Caesar and because it was late and busy we had to wait. They let us wait in this special part of the drive thru, which actually was inside the store. Ezra and Dad pulled up behind us and I said hello. Then I was in the car with Dad and Ezra. Dad got a CD off a girl who was in some advertisement. We were going to watch it on the laptop.
