This fragment has to do with a nautical happening. A young man, rather short but well built, strong, and active calls for a "pea-jacket." When he gets this, he puts it on and then swarms up the rope ladder of a big sailing ship which is tied up at a dock (seemingly in Georgetown). He ascends far into the rigging and drapes a pieces of canvas over some object (not remembered).
