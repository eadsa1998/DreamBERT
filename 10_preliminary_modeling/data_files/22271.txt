I dreamed that Sophie M. (a friend of mine who is trying to give up her position as daughter of a rich family) was rehearsing in the theater group at the university. This surprised me because she doesn't belong to the theater group or to the university. I wanted to speak to her, but she was busy. I got out, angry, and found her car parked. There was a piece of paper stuck on the rear view mirror, which I took while I read it. Her father told her that he couldn't wait for her, but that he was leaving $20 for her and said goodbye lovingly. I was angry because it seemed to me that it didn't go along with what she thinks.
