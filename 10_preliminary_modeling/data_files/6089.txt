It's morning and I'm in my room getting ready for school. My mother is on the phone with my boyfriend complaining that he calls too often. But instead he is actually at my house and comes in my room while I'm getting dressed. He never does that. I'm wearing nylons and a white slip and I pick a real pretty bright flowered skirt which I have never seen before to wear for the day. My boyfriend picks another weird outfit. When I try it on it looks awful and too tight. Also on my bed are these pins to wear with my outfit but somehow I can wear them as clothes too. Some pins look like mannequins others look Halloweenish. We all are in the living room now: me, my mother, my boyfriend, my brother and, I think, my father. We have three small Christmas trees with red tinsel and my boyfriend brought over green tinsel for my mother. She is happy about that. As it's time for me to leave, I realize that I forgot to take a shower and my hair is all up and somewhat messy. I fix it up quickly because I am in a rush. Then I ask my boyfriend if I can have a ride to school, but he says he can't and I think he has a good excuse. Suddenly I'm walking him outside and my dog is barking and howling like he's really mad! Then I notice that there is a hole dug up by an animal in my front yard and the animal looks like an opossum. But as my boyfriend goes outside, it seems to be a different kind of animal than I have never seen before. They try to bite him. One did bite him and I was so mad! I wanted to run to his rescue but somehow I couldn't. He ran up the street to try to avoid the three weird slimish animals, and I think that was it. But I remember I was so angry at those animals that I wanted to slaughter them. I think I was also crying.
