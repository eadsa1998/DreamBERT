I was shopping at Woolworth's with R. At many of the counters sets of chessman set up were displayed. I picked up some from a box and returned them. Thought since it was September, it was not too early to start Christmas shopping. For whom might I buy chessmen. Perhaps J. could use a second set since his sons had begun to play and were leaving home. Then I missed R. Some one told me she had gone to the Roman Catholic room. "Where is it?" "In the northwest corner." "Where is that?" I am disoriented. She points to the northeast. I go arms facing the door in a very small room. I open one and see mother seated with babe in her arms. Open the next door, toilet. Find R. and tell her I will not ride back with her but instead take bus to Waikiki for a swim. That way I can go direct but if I go home with her, I would have to transfer. But as I return to do a bit of shopping I remember it's too cold to enjoy swimming.
