I lay in bed trying to get a daily double from my mind and I heard #3 as the winner. I was dreaming I was in bed with Ann and Mickey Merunis, Ed and another fellow came into the bedroom and Ann played up to them, so I got jealous and walked out. I was at the Randall entrance and one of the ticket sellers told me to play a pocket horse. It was told to him by a woman. I stopped by a little girl. Her eyes were blue. I asked her to tell me what number horses were to win in the first and second race and she said "dress." I said, "Not names, but numbers," and she said "dress" again. I bought a ticket for the daily double. It was 3 and 3 and I looked at it and I saw 1 and 2 on it, but I awoke before I could see if it was 1st and 2nd race. I fell asleep again and a fellow was selling tickets before the race. I was going to buy #10, but then I thought of my daily double ticket I had in my pocket, so I pulled it out and it was 1 and 2, the two was sort of blurred, but I made it out. It was a Randall ticket and there was a few letters in front of the one and two numbers that I couldn't make out. They didn't spell any certain word, seemed like foreign.
