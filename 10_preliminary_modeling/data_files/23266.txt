I am going around with someone named "Marian Barry," who is  an attractive black woman.  She is like a social worker or volunteer checking in on people in need or giving them food or something like that.  I tell her how much I admire her for what she is doing.  She puts her hand on my arm and thanks me.  When we return, we have to go down a long staircase.  Instead of going down the stairs themselves, everyone is climbing down the scaffolding that is vertically parallel to the side of the stairs.  She goes down quickly, but I am timid and move slowly and carefully.  There is a young man-an Arab-who is showing off and hanging by his legs.  He hollers as his legs slip off and he plunges to the floor about 40 feet below.  It is sickening.  Another guy does the same thing, and there are two of them lying on the floor, apparently dead, when I finally get down.
