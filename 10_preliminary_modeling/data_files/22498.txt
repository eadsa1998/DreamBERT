I dreamt I had gone to study in the United States and at the university I met a boy. We talked and we got to know each other quite well, until we fell in love and got married. Then I wanted to come to Lima and we made the trip. I found all my friends waiting for me. It made me happy and sad to see them and to think that I had been away from them for so long. That's where everything stopped. I don't remember any more.
