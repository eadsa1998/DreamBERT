Hugo and I were walking down a street after a stocktake. There was a parade/march on and some streets were closed off. We had taken the train, so were trying to get there. We had to crouch and walk under train to get somewhere. The end of the track was over water (the train flew?). We got to the conductor bit and he'd made a signal like he'd seen us, but then he started the train.  Hugo was in front of me and directly under it, so I quickly went back and got up and yelled at the conductor to stop, but it was too late and we all fell into the water (the train too).
