I'm looking for some papers. I put some in a table and it turns out to be a mailbox. I see the phone book and other papers slide down a glass slot. Jennifer H calls and needs one of the papers. I explain what happened to it. Arvonne is getting ready to leave, to go to school. Bonnie is around. A young man in a wheelchair like Russ comes. He's demanding and arrogant. He expects everything to be done for him. He says he's the exchange student for the St. James Infirmary. He goes into a bedroom and I realize with a sinking heart, I'm the only one left to help him. He calls over the intercom when he needs something. He was very smitten with Arvonne's looks.
