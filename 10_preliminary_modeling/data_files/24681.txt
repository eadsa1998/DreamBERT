I was at school when two boys walked up and talked to me. One told me to meet them at the upper field. I ran away. Then when I saw them again, they told me that this boy liked me, too. (The boy who told me these things I know already liked me, and I was embarrassed to talk or be around him.) Next, he showed me this letter, but then someone told me what it meant. It meant song. Finally (I don't mean that as a good finally), he sang me the song and all of a sudden I felt weird, but then I woke up. Setting: My dream was at school in the halls, by the lockers and just seeing things, not being anywhere (for example, with a paper in your face). Characters: A ton of people are/were in my dream. Boys and girls. I know them from school. One of the boys likes me and he even gave me a necklace (not in the dream). Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried, embarrassed. I felt embarrassed that boys were chasing me, although scared and worried at the same time.
