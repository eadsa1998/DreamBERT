 I'm at Teen Variety Night gathering. There are two gymnasiums with the lights on, but the lights of one will soon be darkened for dancing. My sister Ramona is there. My friend Melanie McDyss is there with some friends. It is a Halloween-type party. Others and I dance. I do the splits, like a scissors. Melanie is short and has a big butt. Her dark blue jeans are pulled up high. I'm standing on the edge of a gravel-like sand pit filled partially with water. My friend Tim Zelling is in the water. There is a snake by him in the water. I encourage him to move. Then there are several snakes right around him. I don't know if they are poisonous. I know he could get bitten if he moves suddenly, but I tell him to get the fuck out of there! He does get out, and doesn't get bitten. I feel a sting, like a bug bite. I look down and see snakes coming up the side of the bit: I've been bitten! The bite doesn't hurt much but I'm really afraid of what will happen now that I'm bitten. I go sit down and start squeezing out the venom. The bite is on the arch of my right foot: a really tender area. A woman is there, and show throws rocks at the snakes, and maybe at me.
