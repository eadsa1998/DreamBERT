I was working for a company other than CAS. I was working at the computer, using Publisher, creating some kind of booklet. There was a lot of discussion about the overall look and was it the same general look as the other company materials or should it have it's own look or just have some tie in to the company such as the company logo. Someone had also created a graphic. It wasn't created by a professional. We all really liked it and were very impressed about how good it looked for not being done by a professional.
