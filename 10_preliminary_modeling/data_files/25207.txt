 I'm clothes shopping at Ragstock with my mom. I buy three shirts and a pair of pants. One shirt is tight and brown. One is long sleep and striped; very nice looking. The pants are green corduroy and cost $11.00. Jeans cost too much. The chicken catching van is by the Uptown Mall. Norm from the television show Cheers is there with his wife. They almost rear-end us in the van. I'm at a loan place. The secretary calls me. She is physically attractive. Another man on the telephone has $10,000 in AT&amp;T phone bills.
