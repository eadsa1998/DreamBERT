My boyfriend Jeremy and I were driving near his parents' house and stopped at a left turn lane.  I thought the car got hit: Jeremy was shaking the bed to wake me up.  After he left I went back to the same dream.  We met up with his mother and went to a hotel for some reason.  There was a spot of graffiti on the doorframe that Jeremy noticed, and he thought it was left for a reason.  I went in and read it, but it wasn't insulting.  A guy came.  I don't know why but we were all supposed to have sex.  I was worried about being stuck with this other guy, but I ended up with Jeremy.  The situation was weird and uncomfortable at first, but Jeremy and I went outside to the roof.  There was both anxiety and excitement about not using a condom for the first time.  I climbed on top of him and I saw an Asian girl looking up at us from the street below.  After a short while, her and a bunch of others came up on the roof where we were.  They said the manager said it was okay for them to be there.  Jeremy and I were heading back to our room when the girl I saw below followed and whispered to me that that wasn't true; they were supposed to get our permission to be up there first.
