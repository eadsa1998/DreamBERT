I am mediating between a father and his teen daughter. I'm on her side. She chooses a strange outfit to wear that the father does not approve of. I ask him what his expectations are because he is expecting her to meet his expectations. I say, "What's so wrong with what she's wearing?" He is disgusted with me for not obviously seeing the consequences she will face wearing these clothes. I say, "Well, those are her consequences. She will have to face them." She also plays dumb to get us to do her homework for her. I realize the father and I have slipped into this trap. I say to her, "You will have to do your own work now. If you choose not to, then you live with it."
