This episode takes place in a field next to a small patch of timber. There are several people playing some sort of game with a large, rectangular air-filled bag, perhaps 3 ft x 2 ft x 1 ft. At lower end is a rubber tube for inflating the bag. Bottom of bag is open. The bag is thrown or passed around and soon loses .... in my mouth and begin to blow it up wondering, 1) whether I will catch some disease from the tube which apparently has been in the mouths of various people, 2) whether the effort of blowing will be injurious to the outrim in my mouth, 3) how the pressure can be maintained in an open bag. After a moment's thought, it seems perfectly logical that this takes place, for the air being blown in is of higher pressure than the old air, and therefore rises to the top of the bag making it buoyant.
