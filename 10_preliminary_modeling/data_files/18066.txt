I was watching TV and the TV was saying, "squids could be horrible with training. They could actually kill you". Well I saw the squid on TV. and a man was right under it training it and he said, "Now presenting" and then the squid kicked him down. Then I saw another squid on TV. Two people were going to jump in and shake hands with the squid underwater. .Instead of shaking hands the squid took them and shook them under the water and not letting them get up.
