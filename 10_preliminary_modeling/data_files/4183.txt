["Shakespearean comedy of love."] I am walking down the street with Archie. We are uncomfortable with each other because its been so long since we've been together as friends. I ask him how things are doing for him. He says it is going well. Now I see a good looking man walking toward us. I am attracted to him. So Archie and spontaneously do a Shakespearean type performance. I am first a damsel, pretty and shy. He and I dance the flirty courtship. Then I aggressively and playfully grab Archie and kiss him passionately. This is all directed toward the watching man who is enjoying the performance and is interested in me. Then I change costume and am a dashing robber in a mask and tights. I sword fight Archie in a very athletic way and kiss him again. He feigns confusion as he is attracted to both me as a woman and me as a man. It is the Shakespearean comedy. The watching man laughs and enjoys the performance. Now I am wearing beaded hair, like a black woman, the beads glittery and shimmery.
