Our neighbors are trying to start a backyard WATER SUPPLY system by filling a hole near their fence with water; I dip a beaker into it for a drink, but say "But it's so dirty." Then I see a 6' tall tank covered with a white sheet near our neighbor's fence. That is our new water supply, but I am still skeptical that it is clean enough.
