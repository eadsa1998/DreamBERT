 I'm at home with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona. It seems that the family is all together. It is fall, and is chilly outside. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. We talk about smoking. I pick my nose and pull out a booger. Kevin and I go to McDonalds to get food for all of us. As we walk form the back door to the front yard my brother Wally comes walking towards us. He is home, surprisingly. We shake hands and hug. I'm very happy to see him. The whole family is home.
