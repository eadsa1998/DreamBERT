 I'm at Washington University. I see my friend Binky Ahmed from Armstrong high school, who goes to Washington. He and other guys I know from high school live in a quad-dorm room there. I go into the room, and they are all sleeping. They get up. My friends Simon Naver, Tony Kramer, and Binky are there.
