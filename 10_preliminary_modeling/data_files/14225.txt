My notes are extremely messy and I can barely read any of it. The photos from school were back. There were photos of me when I was younger and we had group photos. I had pigtails and was laughing. Johanna was in them and was fat then too. I had to do this drama thing. We only had to do a little bit, but then the guy decided to make us do two. We had to do something with these guys. They sent us to a balcony to get to know each other. There were two lots of chairs and this guy went to my chair. There was a lady doing tricks in a plane, it caught fire and hit the ground. It exploded and just missed the building behind it, which a heap of people were in. Ezra was there. I said something about it.
