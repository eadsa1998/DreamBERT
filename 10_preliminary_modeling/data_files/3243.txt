Merle has a crush on me and draws porno pictures of me. Lucy and I are looking at them. I am impressed with how big my eyes are, and how pretty. Later, there is a girl named Lori and she is acting out or crying and I say to her, "This has got to stop or I'll call in the children services division." I know she's been abused, perhaps sexually, and maybe Merle and another man are doing it. I am going to report them. I want this abuse to stop.
