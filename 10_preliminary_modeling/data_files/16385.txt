I was at Memorial Stadium, supposed to do a DJ thing, but I was kind of lost and wasn't sure where I was. And I dreamt that I was on the opposite of the field from where I usually am. I'm usually at Gate 1, but this time I was on the side that has the sound booth, that was like about Gate 4, and it was kind of scary, not in the "whoo" fear sense, but in the sense that orientatively scared, and that I was like at this concession stand and I had to go up, but for a minute I was perched at the very tippy top, the absolutely toppest seat that you can have in the actual ball field area. I think it was the 5th or 6th floor, and there was a railing and I was looking down. And it's not very often that I'm afraid of heights because I look down, but that time I looked down and I was like, "How the heck did I get up here?" And I was thinking how somehow the gates were going to open in five minutes, and the equipment was supposed to be set up around Gate, and I had to get there in five minutes, and I was at this tippy top seat. And I didn't have any CD's with me, and I was trying to think of some excuse how to get them to lend me some of theirs. Like, for example, that I didn't know I was supposed to be here today or something dumb like that. And before I could even do any of this, I woke up.
