I was intimating my wife, but she was just a girlfriend in my dream. I was single. I intimated her in different places. Once I was in bed with her and her brother came in as I was lying in bed with her. He looked our way, but I was behind my wife and covered up. He didn't see me. Then we went out in the woods and I found a good hiding place. We crawled into the bushes and I told her, "Now this is a very good place. No one can see us." So I started to intimate her again and she was willing and ready for me all the time. I seemed to be running away in flight from a bull. I am not sure or clear on this.
