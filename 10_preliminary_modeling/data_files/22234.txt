I have only a vague recollection of the dream. I remember only that I and a few others (I suppose I knew them) were in a fight. We were few and we had a lot of enemies (the place was rather dark and it was like a corridor). Therefore, we withdrew. We were pushing a door so that they wouldn't come in, but there was a hand which was hitting everybody. This made me furious; we opened the door and I chased him. He hid among his companions; I lifted a desk and started hitting everyone who crossed my path.
