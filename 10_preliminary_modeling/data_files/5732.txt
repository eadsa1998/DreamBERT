[1997-05-13] I went into this nut shop I used to go into to buy peanuts and cashews and things and I went in and thought, "boy this place is really small, they must have changed it around" which was really weird because they had just taken up half the space that used to belong to Wiener World [which in reality is about a half block away on the other side of an alley] and made the nut shop really big, but now its small again. I went in and talked to the person, trying to decide what kind of nuts I wanted and I couldn't think of anything that sounded good because it was early in the morning and I didn't want peanuts and I didn't want any other kind, but I asked him though, if they had anything they could mix with chocolate covered raisins and they said they didn't have anymore chocolate covered raisins.
