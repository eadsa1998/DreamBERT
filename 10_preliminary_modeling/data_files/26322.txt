 I'm at the Roller Rink in Wilmerton, on the rink. People are playing the number game, and I think of hiding alone by the inside of the orange wall by one of the numbers, so the person by the disc jockey pit can't see me. I'm in a smaller group of people, including my lab professor Shane Diamond. We seem to be over near the rental desk by the bathrooms. We're in a circle, and we seem to spin or move in a circle. This is a game, like a give away. I'm lying on my side. The circle turns clockwise, and I knock my skate wheels up against the metal railings that are on the outside of the circle. The circle of people stop moving. I end up next to Shane, so I'm the winner and he gives me a bunch of scratch off lottery tickets. I give four or five tickets each to two people near me. I think with all the rest I've got to have winners. I walk away, with my skates off, and then go back and put my skates on the rental counter. I have an hour to use up before we leave.
