As I enter the house where the party is, I see Mrs. Gariaga and sit beside her on the sofa, and ask, "when did you come?" "I've been here since 1919." "But haven't you been away?" "Yes." Further conversation, then I say, "I must see our hostess." But I can't remember her name. Pass into second room where a table is set up but they are not serving yet. Go on to third room and find hostess before a charcoal brazier, red flames, warming up an elderly lady. Ask or think, "why use charcoal when there is a fireplace in the room." I take a vacant seat and start eating. Does it warm better? Go back to middle room. Some people are sitting at the table. There are hard candies and I think I'll slip them in my bag to take them home but the bag is missing. I hurry off explaining why to third room for bag. Ask hostess if she found it. She shows me my black bag on a table.
