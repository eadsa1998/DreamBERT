I realized that I had forgotten I was supposed to pick some friends up at the airport. I was driving in a hurry to get there. Outside the airport I saw a bum who somehow struck me as a wise old soul. I asked him if he knew anything about the flight my friends were supposed to be on. He told me that their plane had landed over an hour ago. I went running through the airport looking for them. I didn't see them by the baggage claim so I randomly chose one of several escalators to go up. At the top of the escalator I saw two of my childhood friends seated on a bench with their luggage. I apologized for being late and told them I was really happy to see them. Ann gave me a sincere smile. Barb was really pissed off. She said, "Thank you for coming, let's go," in an angry sarcastic voice. I said, "Well hey, I'm here aren't I. Don't I even get a hug?" She continued to walk angrily. Ann came over and gave me a hug.
