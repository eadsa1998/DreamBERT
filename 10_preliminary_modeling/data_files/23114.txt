Anita and I are sleeping on the floor of a gymnasium, along with a number of other people, including some relatives-Uncle Jack and Joe, I believe.  There is a golf course there, and I want to get up and play golf.  The two relatives get up before me and go to sign up to play.  I call to them to wait for me, but they have already left.  I am very disappointed, because I would much rather play with them than with strangers.  We start looking for a place to eat.  There are two cafes in the building, and both of them have a waitress whose body is painted black and white and looks like a cartoon character.
