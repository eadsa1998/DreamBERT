There's a party taking place at my childhood home. It wasn't planned - people just kept turning up outside until there are hundreds of people or so. It's very stressful. I go round the house closing all the doors and windows so that no one else can get into the house. Finally I pull the plug on the stereo so that people (that I don't even know) get the message that the party is over and disperse home. A group of girls plead with me to let them in to use the bathroom - so I remit. They turn out to be from my year at high school - I recognize them, although I never really knew them that well. They hang around - I don't know why. My friend Sacha is there too, and my cousin Ashleigh.
