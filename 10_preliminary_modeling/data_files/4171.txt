I and two girls, perhaps my "children," are walking up a path with a bunch of other people. We are going to the top of a mountain ridge. As I approach the top, I feel small earthquakes. Then I see a steam vent. The steam is pouring out. I realize we are on an active volcano that is about to erupt. I turn, with the girls and run downhill, yelling to the other people that the volcano is erupting. We run and run, then I see a river. There are wild animals in it, swimming fast to escape the volcano. I see elephants, alligators and mountain lions. We get in the water with them, knowing they are just as afraid of the volcano as we are and wont bother us. We swim and swim until the river is now dry and a small long tunnel. We run, hoping we are not trapped in there. Finally we get through to the other side but the lava is converging on us. We are then rescued in the nick of time by a helicopter just as the lave surrounds us on an island of rock.
