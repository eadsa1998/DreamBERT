I had a dream that I was babysitting my brother and we were watching movies. We were watching the Star Wars trilogy. When it was over, he wanted to watch Pocahontas. We were in something I remember as a "public living room." Other people walked in and this one girl had a huge crush on my brother. When I was done babysitting him, I had to go babysit the Pike children in Post. When I was there, it started to snow. Mr. Pike got home as I was unloading the dishwasher. He paid me and let me go. Then school started. I had to go to a Spanish class that was somewhere else. I was packing my backpack to go, and all these people kept taking my stuff and pestering me, so it was impossible to pack. I must have woken up and then begun a new dream. I was one of the friends of the Culkin family. Also in this group was Aidan. We all got really drunk and started walking on this bridge, complaining how adults never understand kids. We were all planning for a surprise party or something...Aidan was meant to guard the door while we all set up. But then I woke up.
