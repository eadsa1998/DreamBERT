I was at a shop with Silas and Samantha. I bought season one of Queer as Folk (US). I was trying to hide from Michael Palin. Calvin was in the carpark. We went back into the shop and I found season two of Queer as Folk (US) so I got it. Calvin asked which one Ted was and I said "The one with Ted written under it". I was then naked and alone somewhere. I asked this teacher for clothes and she gave me a nighty. Some teacher was called Swanee, and had my season one of Queer as Folk (US).
