I am on the back patio of a wealthy ranch-style house.  Dad is around.  Richard Dreyfuss too?  He keeps bugging me.  I am standing up the whole time.  I am weaving with cotton, a small thick rug, like an Indian rug.  Then I take a stiff card and scrape, scrape hard down the square I've weaved.  It becomes more finished-looking.  Then I think - that's the Pueblo way, now the Navajo way is to scrape horizontally.  So I turn the card on its side and scrape horizontally, and more fluff comes off, it's like big pieces of extra fluff are coming away, making it look better and better.  This guy comes up and tells me something negative.  Like I'd better do something (can't remember what) or it won't be right.  I feel contempt for him.  I am aware that I've been standing this whole time.  Later I'm with Dad in the front yard - well manicured lawn and trees.  [Dad was in another Native American dream located near our childhood home - something about a cave.]
