Portal 2 had a bunch of randomized endings. You had to 'roll' for them and each one had either a good one or bad one (eg, in one version you'd die, in another you'd live). I can't remember it very well, but the one I got (it was all text btw) had something to do with Wheatley's insides? I think his insides were getting put into something else and I was thinking 'I wouldn't mind Wheatley's insides, what the hell am I thinking?'.
