I fall into a DEEP SLEEP while talking to Mitchell; I can't stay awake no matter how I try; When I awaken, I laugh and look for my shoes. I can only find an old pair that have a hole in the sole.... Mitchell's oldest son comes into the house and they embrace warmly; then the younger son comes in and again I see Mitchell without his beard. Later I laugh when I tell Frank how I fell asleep during the hour; Finally I find my regular shoes in a corner and put them on.
