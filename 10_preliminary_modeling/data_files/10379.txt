We are living in a small town where everyone is Orthodox and meditates every day. I am friendly with a woman priestess who wears white satin and carries a baby. We all sit in the dark and dont talk; meditate a long time. Then out in a small town much hustle and bustle, I meet new persons and introduce them to the woman priestess who is still wearing white satin.
