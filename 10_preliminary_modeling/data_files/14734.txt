I was on my bed with a lady, Verity at the end and I was in the middle against the wall. Michelle Williams and James Van Der Beek were talking on another bed next to mine. The lady mentioned rats and Verity was like 'are those the small creatures that eat mice?". She said "I live in Italy and I sit on the steps", to explain her lack of common knowledge. She asked if they could grow so big that [something I can't read, but basically really big] and I laughed and said that it was the minimum size. I looked over at Michelle and she was sitting, holding her legs up into the air and she had no pants on. I pointed it out to the person next to me and we realized her and James were both naked. Michelle saw us looking and she said "we had sex". Then she was sitting next to me and referred to him as Dawson and I said that's funny that you call him Dawson. There was a book about Dawson's Creek. Dawson and Joey were in a car 'years' later. They were dressed up to go to a dinner with some important people for Dawson. It was from his point of view and it said "I'm on a date with her". He looked over at her and thought she looked good and he was thinking 'I bet I can win this bet' and then it said he didn't. They had stopped somewhere and had sex "twice". It said their "nephrons" were in close proximity. The next page started "after I jesm" and that he felt relaxed. I woke up at home later. My computer was hanging off my door (which was normal). Mom was talking to Poppa and saying that she tries to keep up with events and wanted to see them. Then Nana and Poppa came into my room. I remembered my dream and they left and they wanted to go to an expensive cooking class. I was patting Spaceman.
