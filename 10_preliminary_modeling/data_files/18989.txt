The setting of this dream was a zoo. I didn't recognize it as any particular zoo. There was a young woman, a teacher, I believe, who was making a big ruckus about removing the ducks. The officials who were all men were taking the ducks away, for some reason that I can't remember now. The teacher was objecting to this. There were children playing with the ducks. I was an onlooker.
