I dreamt I was office duty in the dormitory (consists of answering doorbell and telephone). I was sitting in the office when a tall, dark-haired young man came in, walked quite rapidly through the hall and living room and out into the dining room. He took a napkin and napkin ring out of the napkin stand which is at the entrance to the dining room, then he sat down at one of the tables all by himself and waited to eat. I thought this was very funny and I laughed and laughed. It was very amusing. I believe he took someone else's napkin, not mine. I don't know who the young man was, but he was about 24, I'd say.
