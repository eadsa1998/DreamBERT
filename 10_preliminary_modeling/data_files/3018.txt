I am riding a bicycle with a man. We each have our own bikes. We are mountain biking in the wilderness. With fairly good ease, we are biking up steep hills, covered with trees and underbrush. As we near the top, he laughs and says we can take the easy way. A rough gravelly road is there. We get on it and reach the top. Here we see a TV monitor and it indicates a hard hat area. This means there is construction going on and we peer over the edge and look down into a mountainous valley to see men building and clearing. We see terraces being cleared. This is a terrible use of the wilderness environment. A group of people come up near us to sing protest songs, songs of protestations. It's like a church choir. Rochelle decides to join them. She says with confidence that she will have taken over by the end of the song. She joins the bass section. I listen and sing along from my position near the edge where I can see the men working. I then decide to join with the choir. I go over and see the people are standing on a rock platform and I can't see how to get up there to be with them. So I decide to stand near them in front, dead center, I notice wryly. I then scoot over to the side. Rochelle does her power thing and takes over the bass section as she said she would. Then we go back to the same position near the edge. They are having a meeting. Rochelle and I are strategizing. We decide we can't win the whole battle and get them to stop construction, so we try to suggest they make their places wheelchair accessible. We even are conciliatory there and say, "OK, not the whole place, but at least ramps instead of stairs." Lucy joins us; she is angry and yelling and we try to shush her so she won't spoil the work we've already accomplished. Now we try to get her to get in the cart. I'm in the back seat behind the driver's side and I call her to me. She is being an ingenue and not paying attention to the whole picture.
