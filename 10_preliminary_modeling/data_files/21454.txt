I was hanging around a bridge where there was a creek. It was raining because the creek was running deep and muddy. Then it would get low. Then I looked at it and it was getting deep. Then I noticed or I flew away from the creek. The water started to flow the opposite direction and then I felt an earthquake. The ground shook. I saw cracks in the earth and trees and buildings started to collapse. I was in flight, flying away from danger so nothing would fall on me. I finally got out into the country. I heard a boy say Sunshine, that's a racetrack in Florida. I was working at White's and I said, "Now how am I going to get to work from this job on time for the other?" but I was working the 3rd shift at Dills and I could make it from job to job. I was with Bob, sitting on the curb, and I saw a pencil. I wrote with it and it was blue. I asked Bob if he wanted it and he said no.
