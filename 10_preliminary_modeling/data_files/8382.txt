I started flying and thought, here I am flying again and Ben D thinks I fly in my dreams to overcome an obstacle or to escape. It feels like I am in a hurry to get home so I decided to fly over these buildings because it would be faster than walking all the way around them. I was trying to get home. It was dark. I was talking to someone about life insurance and some dream thought about a waking life dream conversation. I was thinking in the dream that this wasn't the same at all.
