 I'm about to fly to Australia with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona for a vacation. I'm talking with my cousin Melvin Redding on the phone. I say I need to stop talking to pack for my trip or I'll miss the plane! It's true: I'm not prepared for it at all, I'm just winging it. My high school basketball teammate Olie Kecker is there. We may be in my mom's bedroom. I try to decide if I should bring one or two bags. I'm going to pack very lightly: barely having anything and scraping by. We're at the airport. I run back to exchange or pick up something at the last minute-maybe to exchange a bag. I think I may not be bringing a camera.
