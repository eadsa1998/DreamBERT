I was in a hotel, in bed with a stranger. Her back was to me. I felt comfortable because it was a woman and I wouldn't have to worry about sexual demands. Suddenly, he turned and started to wrap himself around me (very large penis). There were feelings of anger and sexual pleasure together. He pinched my nipples. It hurt and I got very angry. Each time he'd pinch, I'd scream angrily, "No! Stop it! Don't!" He wouldn't listen. I pushed away. I ran downstairs out to the street. He followed in pursuit and tried to cajole me into wanting him. Now we were dressed. A crowd was wandering around. He asked me to dinner. He changed from aggressive to charming. I felt aloof but was interested. It is very vague at this point. There was more, but I can't remember.
