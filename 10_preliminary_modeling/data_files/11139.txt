I dreamt of my wedding and honeymoon. The dream was in Technicolor. My mother wore dark purple and my fiance's mother wore light purple. I married the guy that I'm going with now. I went through the whole marriage ceremony. Following the wedding there was a reception and all the people wanted to kiss me when I went through the receiving line. After the reception we went on our honeymoon and stayed in a motel. I wore a white negligee and lounging jacket. After the honeymoon we went back to our own little house and he carried me over the threshold.
