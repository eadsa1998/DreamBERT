 I'm naked in my bed under the blankets at the Whitman house in the morning. [I'm conscious that the morning in the dream is the same morning that I actually had the dream.] My sort-of girlfriend Stephanie Peterson comes into my room eating graham crackers. She goes into a room to the south of mine and to the east of my housemate Stephen's room. I grab some socks and a pair of white underwear that are lying on the floor next to my bed. I toss them over to my laundry bag because they are damp from semen from my masturbation. I don't Stephanie to see them so I toss them away. She comes over to my bed. We start to kiss. I am now wearing pants, but no underwear. She puts her hand down my pants. She suddenly yells in a loud and startled manner, "Oh my god!" She is looking up at my closet area. There is something there that is very frightening. She thinks it's like a spider. There is a sheet covering the closet space. Poking out against the sheet are two horn-like objects, like ram horns. The horns are on the head of a creature that was Jabba The Hut's assistant in the movie Return of the Jedi. I think of punching this creature right on the horns. It is throbbing. This creature is a swarm. Someone takes a green laundry bag/mosquito head net to use to contain the swarm.
