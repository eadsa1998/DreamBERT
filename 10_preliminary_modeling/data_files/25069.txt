 I'm with my girlfriend Annie Thomas on the top bunk of a set of bunk beds. We're wearing very little clothing. She hugs me, and I hug her. She starts to cry. For some reason, I start to cry too. But I am faking the crying. I'm not really sad. I slip off the bunk bed in my fake despair and go out the door, and down the hall.
