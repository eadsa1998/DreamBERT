I was playing World of Warcraft. I was in the water and killing stuff for some paper, I had 4/6. There was a player named Eugene and he was a low level. It turned out it was actually Eugene. On Facebook he had been helping someone from last year fix their computer. I thought the way he was explaining stuff was cute. He left notes at the bottom of this lake (on Warcraft). I went down and read them and they said 'Izzy, stop reading/following me' etc. One said "I know that you love me..." and "give up" etc. I crossed the love out and put 'hate' and did similar things with the others. Then Cuddles, Simba and Gizmo were in the water and I killed them and they respawned. Eugene and I ended up talking and hanging out for the rest of the day. Someone made these cake things. They were filled with cream and covered with chocolate, but the cream was actually on the outside. They were nice. Steve Buscemi was at Nana's. I gave him a cake and when I came back later he had killed himself, after finishing a movie. Anyway, I made a Murloc sound at Eugene and he laughed and did it back. Then we were at school and we took the same class. One of them was in a pool. I was asking him questions about Warcraft, he was level 17, but he had started again. He asked me how I got home and I said that I took the train and he came with me. I didn't know what the people there were talking about and left. I went to the shop. Mom told me to get something and then she got it. I was complaining to Nana about the new house. Nana had a box of blocks that I used to like. I saw Poppers, Granny and Aunt Sally outside. Uncle Wilbur said someone didn't want to see me. I was then outside walking up to the back door and Johnny Depp was walking past and I said "hello" and he said "Hi Izzy" and I asked "How are you?" and he said "Good, how are you?" and I said "Sensational". As I was walking up the ramp, he said "Bye Izzy".
