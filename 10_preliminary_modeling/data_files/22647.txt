This dream was the funniest and most fantastic one. I dreamt twice about the same theme, or perhaps the second time I was merely recalling the dream. I was laughing with my friends and at that moment a rather old man passed by on the street, skating and doing pirouettes, without falling. I and my friends were surprised, and we wanted to invite this man to my house. The boys and I stepped into the hall at my home, where I took up the carpet and the man started to skate on the floor marvelously, and we all were amazed. And I started to call my mother, my brother, and my father so that they would see him. So then all of us tried to do the same thing this dancer did, but we fell. Well, I honestly don't know why I dreamt about this. Surely you can interpret it. I do remember that the man had the face of the butcher or sometimes that of the milkman. I can't really tell which of them it was.
