I was working in a group to compete in some sort of dessert-making contest.  We talked about what we wanted and I went to go home to get something from my mother's cake-decorating supplies- perhaps sprinkles.  To do so I was going to take the shortcut through the Winchester Mystery House.  I went in the back door and had no idea which way to go, but somehow made it through the dim halls pretty quickly.  When I got back, there were 12 girls who were supposed to be attracting the guys and end up coupled.  I had no idea how to go about getting the guys' attention, so I started to talk to the small girl instead.  She was laying on her side.  She was only about 18 inches long, like a doll.  One of the guys came to talk to her.  One of the guys' approaches to wooing the girls was to read a poem.  I listened.  It was very sweet.  I could tell it was about an ex girlfriend, and made some mention to that effect...playing up to him with sympathy.  He was wearing a cowboy hat.  We started talking and sort of ended up together.
