 I'm on Eagle Lake in the Big Resort Area. I canoe out early in the morning by myself. I'll meet others later in the day. I come to what I think is the portage to Evergreen Lake. There are a lot of people there. The portage area is really big and redone. It's fancy, with gravel and some docks and a bridge. There are steps from where the 20-rod Evergreen River portage leads up to the main portage. I go to set my canoe down in the water. I slide down a steep cliff and catch my footing on the bottom of the rock race, right next to the water. I toss the canoe in. I think it may have floated away then, because I can't see it. I ask a man if it floated away. He says, "No, it's right here.", and motions to the side of the dock he's standing on. I put the canoe to the side for now. I go through a short tunnel which is the portage. I hear a man talking about this portage, and if he's been here before. He doesn't mention Evergreen, so I think I'm not at the Evergreen portage. The tunnel is narrow and elbow shaped. I squeeze through and am in a little apartment-like place. I have some deli turkey and sliced pepperoni that I put in the little refrigerator. The door falls off the refrigerator. Three Forest Service employees arrive in a large hovercraft, powered by a huge fan propeller on back. They go right onto the portage with their boat. I'll have to go back and tell the guys we can't go in at this spot because we don't have a permit.
