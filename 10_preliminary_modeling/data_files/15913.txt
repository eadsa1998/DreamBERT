I was with a group of others on this rocky formation. We were in like a crater of it (there was an 'exit', but it had high rocky walls around it. I had the DSLR and someone set off this little explosion causing a dust storm and I was taking pictures of it until I realised it was coming towards us and I put the lens cap back on and closed the screen and turned away from the dust hugging it to protect it. Later, I was out somewhere with a bunch of people. There was a long, but short, wall and Tristan sat down leaning against it. Everyone else followed suit with Judah at the other end. I went to sit next to him but had to get up for some reason and Fletcher took his spot. I sat down next to Fletcher and was trying to get a photo of everyone, they all waved and were kind of lying against the wall. Fletcher kept adjusting himself and getting closer to me each time, until I was squished against this pillar at the corner of the wall. He moved again and I was literally jammed in between him and the pillar and his legs were touching mine. Most of the others had left by this point. I sent a message to Tristan saying 'help' and had no reply. Then I felt something crawling on my back and I jumped up squealing and tried to brush it off. I couldn't find anything, but I saw lots of spiders coming out of a crack in the pillar. I found Tristan later and I said 'thanks for the help' and he just laughed. I said Fletcher was pretty much sitting on top of me and he just laughed again.
