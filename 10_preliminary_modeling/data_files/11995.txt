Graham Chapman and I were good friends and I was on the net and I found pictures of him being alive after he died. I printed them out and left them so he would see them. These girls gave me a fake number plate. I knew it was a fake, but I put it on a car that I had. They said the speed goes up to 39kph. The number plate was 80, which meant I was speeding. They went off and I got in the car with Mom. We had to go in the Hyundai and I had to sit in the back, which I complained about. Ezra wanted to see Species 3. Later I was talking to Graham and 'confronted' him about the pictures, but he said he didn't know. Headlines from back then, said stuff like 'Dead doctor' and stuff.
