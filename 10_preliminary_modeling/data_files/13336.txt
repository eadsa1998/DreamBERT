I was at school. I was at form and we had to run down this hall. This person asked if I was late or had already been to form. I was in Physics. Samantha was in one of my classes and Elijah was in another. In Physics, I had stuff out including my dream book. Darius was near me and he sat next to me when he realized I didn't want him around. I moved to the back of the class. Darius and the others followed me. Eugene came and he was near me and was trying to look at my book. Darius picked up this jacket and threw it on my head and it fell to the floor. Mom had found some water pattern. We were at McDonald's. There were two kids (a girl and a boy) and they were my kids. The boy was like me -- shy and quiet. The girl wasn't so much. There was something about The Young Ones. Mr Stevenson had an iPod? Geraldton was the only safe place because of something. There was something about mud and electricity.
