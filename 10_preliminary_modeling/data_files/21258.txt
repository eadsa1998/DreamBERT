In my sleep I was thinking of what horse I would have next to play and movie came to me in my dream that it would be a good one to play next. Prom seemed to be in my dream. I seemed to be repeating it in my dream. I was in a city and they had one main street detour. There were signs up. I ran a streetcar. I was working in the shop and I had a bushing job. Some pieces were undersize and some were marked or rough. My sister Mary was not living with her husband. It was not Henry, but some Italian man. His brother was helping Mary to write her letter having her husband come back. There was something in the letter that was not up to par. Grandma came up and erased it, then started to sign her name. I said, "That's not right. You're not to sign your name there." So she erased it. I was sprinkling water on the boys from the shop. I picked up a black book and John Arendas had his name on it and there were other names and his address on it.
