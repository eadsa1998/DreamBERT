We were in a used car lot looking for a car, and most of the cars that we saw were little white Fiats like the one that we have. The car lot was up in the mountains and there were all sorts of winding roads around it. The car dealer was showing my husband one car that was made out of some sort of wood and it was covered with this whitely paint and it was a very funny car. It really didn't look much like a car, but it was so rotten that it was starting to fall apart right in the middle of the demonstration. I knew that he was trying to sell us this car that it really wasn't any good.
