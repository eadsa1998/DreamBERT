A neighbor man lets me lean on him and helps me into the house. Ellie informs me that my ex-husband has come through and sold the house. I am furious because if they had told me this before the meeting, I wouldn't have had to go through all this. I say, "I'll just wake him up and tell him off." The girls defend him and tell me not to bother him. I am mad that they take better care of him than they do me. I just know the husband is going to try and get away with the money from the sale of the house and bilk me of my share.
