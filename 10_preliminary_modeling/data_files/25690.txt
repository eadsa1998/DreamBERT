 I'm with my friend Nate Nelling and my girlfriend Jackie Hunter. A man is being forced to commit murder, or say he committed murder. It is a mob-like scandal. Later, evidence surfaces that will free this man. There is a person speaking on a pay phone. The words spoken by the person are played on a loud speaker outside the house of my classmate Chuck, and they are spoken to my classmate Virgil. The message is threatening. The speaker runs way from the phone so he won't be discovered. A large corporation has an interest in concealing the murder. They threaten the opposing lawyers with loss of the most important things in their lives. The lawyer or the person that has been blackmailed knows what is happening. The pressure to concede is great, and the potential loss for standing one's ground is huge. It may be that I am the lawyer. I don't seem to be there. Nate is making a list of people. On it are our former basketball teammates Tony Kramer, 6'4", John Kulik, 6'8", and Nate. It is like a basketball roster. There are more people on the list.
