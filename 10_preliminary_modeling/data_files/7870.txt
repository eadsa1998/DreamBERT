I was trying to give myself a perm. Someone else had started it but then they quit. I was determined to get it done so I was trying to roll it myself and I was getting really frustrated. I had taken them out and started over. My hair got dry so I had to completely wet it again. At first I was starting to make rows on the right side above my ear. I tried that a couple of times and then I decided to start on top and get that hair out of the way first and then do the lower rows.
