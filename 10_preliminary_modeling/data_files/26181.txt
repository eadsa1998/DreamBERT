 I'm in the presence of stern administrators, including my grade school principal Candy Bevner, my third grade teacher Liza Minikel, and others. They are having a big meeting. I try not to distract them very much. I'm off to one side. My high school friend Elise Rooks is there. We talk a little bit. She expresses interest in spending time with others and I tonight. I think this is strange because she doesn't express interest in being with me often. I'm very attracted to her. I don't respond too enthusiastically to her. A woman comes in as I leave. She says she has had a dream. I offer advice in passing regarding it, though I think I may be invading the administrators place. As I walk out some younger teenage boys are walking next to each other. One says to another that Elise invited them to spend time together tonight. He says Kenneth Hanson and other people Kenneth's age will be there. He must not recognize me, because I'm right next to him. It seems, that to him, myself and older men like myself are "cool".
