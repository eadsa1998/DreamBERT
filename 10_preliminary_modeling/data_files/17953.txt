I was parking a big rig truck.  My boyfriend Jeremy held a bowl of soup for me while I ate.  Then I was somewhere outdoors with my longtime friend Kip and his girlfriend.  My friend Ray was a teacher for something going on.  My mother was there, and she was annoying me somehow, perhaps nitpicking about the way I was doing something.  I asked Ray in confidence to sign off on my 'invisible plant', a project I made up to toy with my mother.  If I talked about it alone she would know I just made it up, but if the teacher signed off on it then she would have to think twice.
