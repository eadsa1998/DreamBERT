I was at home, playing Sims 3. It had no lag, and the effects were ok but a little blocky on the edges. I played it for a few minutes and then I called Mom, as I was waiting to go back there. In the kitchen, Ezra needed to plug something in. I can't understand what I've written, but it looks like it says Mom's computer, my computer and two others in the car (?) outside and 2 of 4 on something. He wanted to take out Mom's computer. I asked why not one of the other ones. He unplugged one, and it started smoking, so he took it out. He then unplugged his 'Counterstrike LAN' and this other thing and the smoke stopped.
