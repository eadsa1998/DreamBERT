I was at a shop in the toilets, as were two girls. This strange man came in. There was something about a leprechaun. We left and a teacher told us to get into groups and then hide. I was in a group with Calvin, Silas, Duane, Evelyn and maybe someone else. We had a good hiding place, but I got up. We hid again, and we put Calvin in a bag. I got found. There was a crazy psycho guy.
