There is a spider in my house but it is as big as a puppy and looks like a bumble bee. It is playful but I am scared of it. It pushed into me. My girlfriend wants me to play with it. The "spider" is brown and yellow. It knocks me down. I am slightly disgusted by it. I want it out of the house, but my girlfriend wants us to keep it.
