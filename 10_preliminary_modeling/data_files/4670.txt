["Engulfing waves."] I and 2 other people are standing watching huge "60 foot" waves crashing up over the top of a huge mountain peak. It is awesome in size and power. I am afraid I won't survive it. We decide our survival depends on enduring under the wave. We stand with some kind of air bubble plastic over us. We are surrounded by the pounding waters, engulfed. We hold our breath, waiting for the wave to pass and recede. We barely make it. The other woman keeps talking nervously as a wave hits. I am concerned she will use all the air. After a very large one, I say wow. I'll bet that was a 30 foot wave. A woman like our neighbor says with scorn, I measured it. It was only 28 foot. You didn't have your facts. I glare at her angrily. I felt put down. I mumbled I got pretty close on my guess. I turn and go inside a cave. Like deserting them. Then I turn and join them again for the next huge wave. After I survived that one, I decide to go out away from the mountain it might be safer. As I stand on the flat plains, a wave of high water surges at us only waist high. But as I watch, the wave over the mountain had picked up huge round boulders (black). They are rushing toward us. I turn and run for my life. Someone yells get behind something. I find a rocky outcrop and crouch behind it. The boulders that would have killed me crush and break up on my shield. I decide its safer right under the mountain. I return to there.
