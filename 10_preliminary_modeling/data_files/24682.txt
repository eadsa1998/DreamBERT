I was at school running around the halls playing tag and hide and go seek. My dream went back and forth between running around the halls at school, in a party where you can paint shorts, and a place where it was like a harder game of tag because you would be climbing walls and fences, but these walls and fences were already set up for you, because the place where we were at set up a special game for the older kids. This dream was fun. Setting: The dream took place in more than one place at school, and some other places that I don't know about or what they are. Characters: There were tons of people in my dream. My sister, plus tons of people from school. I also saw a lot of people in my dream that I don't know who they are. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, scared, energetic. I thought my dream was interesting. Plus, I think it was fun to have this dream. I sort of like to wake up to this dream and think about it.
