I am a concert pianist on stage playing dissonant Beethoven like dynamic music. My hair barrette snags open and my hair flies all around in my enthusiastic playing. I look at the audience with a smile, like, "Oh well," and play on. I finish and stand to bow. A man comes out to help me put on my shoes (black high heels with straps) I have an umbrella hat and I don't do the straps, the audience is just going to have to accept this idiosyncrasy. The applause is weak and dries out. Then I decide to do an encore. It's my best piece, a ballad, soft and sweet; then it tells a musical story of children being good and then mischievous.
