I had a dream that I was at my friend Karen's house. I haven't seen her in eight years. I was helping her mom clean. I knew a great way to clean the toilet and the tub. I said I knew tricks because of a household book I had. We were waiting for the kids to get back from gymnastics camp. I asked Karen's mom what gym camp they were coming from. We stepped out of her house and the train with the kids pulled in. One of the cars was shaped like a big VW Bug and it was orange. All of the little kids were at the front of the train and when they got out, they had big bags of cookies and goodies that their mom sent them. One little kid offered me a cookie, but I didn't take it. Then one little girl asked me if I had seen the Smith babies. I asked Karen's mom if Helen Smith Seibert had gotten married. She said yes, and that she had two babies.
