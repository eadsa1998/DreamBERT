The Hitler Dream. My boyfriend and I are going up hill. I am on a train or in a wheelchair. My boyfriend sees Hitler and feels he must introduce me to Hitler. I want to be with my boyfriend, but as soon as Hitler sees me, he decides he wants to have sex with me. I have no choice. I feel trapped, resigned, scared. But before he can hurt me, I must be seen by either a priest or a counselor, I'm not sure which. It saves me. It intervenes and he (Hitler) goes away. The priest or counselor stands behind me and sort of hovers over me.
