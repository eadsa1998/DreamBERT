A pretty lady in an old fashioned dress, red, is walking with her sister, who has some limp in her leg. They are talking. The younger one says, "I'll push you in the pond." The one in red says angrily, "Don't you dare! You'd better not." The younger one actually does it. It's a cloudy, cold glacier of green water. She's under for awhile; all those skirts are weighing her down. Then she's up and angry. She pulls the younger one in. The she starts to help the younger one out. The younger one lets her gimpy legs go limp and doesn't help. The one in red gets angry and says, "Don't you do that! You always suicide when I'm helping you. Use your legs!" When that doesn't work, she threatens to tell papa. Then the younger one "wakes up" and says, "No, don't do that, O.K.," and they get out of the pool, as the younger one is still explaining why not to call papa. She is afraid to be seen as helpless and not trying by him.
