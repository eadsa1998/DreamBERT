I was at the beach with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, and they had some other kids with them too. And it must have been Oceanside Beach, I think. We were swimming around and playing in the water. And I was noticing that where it was shallow there was a lot of shells and poky barnacles and things, and it wasn't really that smooth at the bottom. And so we went deeper, but I wanted to stay close to them. And then they said they wanted to go and do something else. They had a dog or something they were going to walk. I think it was like a beige-ish-brownish dog, kind of like the dog Tiffany that Sandra used to have. And so they went to do that, but I said I was going to swim so more, so I did. And then I got out of the water and I went into the like the little beach house thing to use the restroom. And I was walking around and I was wanting some food, and I went to this vending machine where you put cash in the machine and you get like a card, like a gift card that has like a plastic with money on it. And when mine came out, it wasn't like a credit card like you expect; it was like a mini CD. And I thought to myself, "What am I going to do with this? Who would take this?" And then I thought it might be time to reconnect with Samantha, Sandra and Derek, so I called them on my phone, but and then I realized at that time I was totally naked, and I was like walking down the beach or running down the beach, kind of covering my chest. And I sat on the bench for a minutes kind of waiting for them. And I figured, "Well, I'm not going to sit out here totally naked. I'm getting back in the water." So I did, and then I woke up.
