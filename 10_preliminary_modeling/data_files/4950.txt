I had some company and they left. I was tired and wanted to sleep. I could sleep sitting up in the van, passenger side, or sleep on the bench seat in the back. Both ways I'd be uncomfortable and cold, so I went to Thea's house and slept in a bed there. They weren't home. I woke up the next day and was getting ready to leave. I came out of the bedroom and found Thea and someone else there. She lectured me about taking advantage of her, using her house without permission, and she asked me if I had used anything else. I was quite annoyed with her. I wanted to leave. It didn't seem polite to leave in the middle of her lecture. She was angry. So was I. I felt guilty and caught but I also felt justified and annoyed. I wished I had chosen to sleep in my cold van. Then, I just decided to leave. I said, "Bye." She was miffed. I was then in a library, borrowing books. The female that was with Thea was also borrowing books. She was jealous of something. I talked to my brother Dwight. [BL]
