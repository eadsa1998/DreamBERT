Robin Hood outfit. Changing in a hall and people come through I'm caught with my pants down. I'm a teacher of writing. I had intended to do a "Birds of a Feather" performance, but the writers/students were so enthusiastic they peppered me with questions and I used all the time lecturing about how to be a good writer.
