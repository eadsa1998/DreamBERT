It was my first day of work experience. Mom didn't make dinner until 3.30am, so I didn't go the second day. At 8.01am, I got a text from 'Anna Frost' asking where I was, so I replied saying I was sick. Ezra was doing an internship on this forum when people had learned too much? He was kicked off and he was now doing something on Sims 2, and had a low percentage. Mine was like 99%. I downloaded a movie from 1987 with Jason Segel in it, but he was a teen/young adult.
