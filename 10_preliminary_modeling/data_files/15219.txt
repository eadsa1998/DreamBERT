I was at 'school'. Calvin and others were sitting on these steps. Then I was younger and Ramona and I were given our reports. Mine said 'obesity' and had drawings of exercises to do. I yelled back at the teacher and then decided to wag. I got to King Road from across the reserve, and was near Wellington Street or whatever it is. Ramona had come with me and she went off to her house. Then I was in a class and I was about four, but had gone back in time. There was a thing on the wall which had birthday cards for the teacher. I realized he was gay. I laughed and read out the card which had long, weird words, one of which was "totalitarian". He was amazed that I was reading the words so fluently and got me to read out more. As this was happening, some kid fell out of the window. Then I was driving and I followed this car into this mechanic place. It was a police car and I parked next to them. I said it was a magic trick. There was a piece of meat and I pretended to be a character from From Dusk Till Dawn and made a slurpy noise. I laughed. I was still four by the way. We were near a beach. I went to this food hall place. There was a guy who looked like Jason Segel.
