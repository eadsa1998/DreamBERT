The fire crew is around.  The houses we live in are much nicer, larger, with shiny black tile floor in the bathroom.  Bathroom is much larger than in reality.  I start to feel sick.  I am aware the rest of the crew are in their houses or one nearby house.  I have trouble breathing.  It seems lungs or nose is so blocked I can barely get enough air in.  It gets worse and worse til I am using all my effort just to suck in air.  I see the assistant crew boss and tell him I can hardly breathe.  He seems totally unconcerned and says something like - Well it won't last very long.  I find if I just move [I actually turned over in bed] I can suddenly breathe okay, but the potential for blocking air is still there.  Next I am in our bath / bedroom.  It is nicely furnished.  I undress, look down and discover I have a penis, an erection.  Female parts too.  I think: so this is what it's like to feel an erection.  Then blood - I get in the tub - lots of blood - clumps, not drops.  Feel like I will pass out.  I call Michelle to take me to the hospital.
