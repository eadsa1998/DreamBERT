Mary and I have just separated - or are planning to separate -and I am pleading with her to come back. She challenges me with the question, "How would things be different if we stay together?" She also asks me how I would keep myself busy and not repeat whatever I had done that is a problem for her. She wondered if I purposely did things to make people angry with me. The tone of this dream was one of great anxiety on my part.
