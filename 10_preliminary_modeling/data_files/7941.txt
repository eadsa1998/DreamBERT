I was with Eric and Stephanie Forrester. I think we were watching two of their small grandchildren. One was a boy and another a girl. I think they were playing hide and seek inside the house. It was dark outside. The little girl went outside. There was a lot of greenery. shrubs and such, narrow paths, steps, etc. I knew as soon as she went out she was going to be very hard to follow and keep my eye on her. I called to Eric that I needed him to come out right away to help. I finally grabbed her and brought her back inside but she went right back out. She said something about us trying to keep her inside. She said something like oh yeah, watch this. She turned into a very small chameleon or a lizard or some such and darted into the dirt. As soon as she came back up I grabbed her. At this point, Eric and Stephanie and the boy were out there and they had each grabbed one also. None of us knew which one was the little girl or if any of them were her. We took them and put them in this box. Now they were like snack cakes. We were trying to figure out which one was this little girl. Each of us took a bite off of one thinking that it would make her turn back into a girl. It didn't work. Someone had suggested that if we did that we would figure out which one was her. The little boy just kept eating until they were all gone. As soon as he did he realized what he had done and he got very upset and was crying.
