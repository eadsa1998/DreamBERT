I was at Bill Wallace's home.  He wasn't there, and I was looking for something-I don't remember what.  His mother was helping me.  I thought it was in the pocket of a pair of shorts.  She said she knew just where to look, and she pulled open the drawer of a chest of drawers which appeared to be full of jeans-long pants, anyway.  She took out one pair and pulled out a pair of green shorts from inside them.  I told her that wasn't the pair I was looking for, and commented with amusement that he liked to wear shorts underneath long pants.
