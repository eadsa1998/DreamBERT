My mother, who has been driving, gets out of the pickup. My brother Dwight goes in. I start to pick up some things they left to carry them into the apartment complex. A pair of black gloves (my mother's), Xmas presents, and some pretty woven yarn cloth. I have my arms full as I start to walk across the parking lot. I drop some things, books, cards, and pictures fall to the ground. I curse and try to pick them up without dropping everything else, but no luck. Everything falls all over the asphalt. A hip black man, like scat man on T.V., jives up to me. He's going to help pick things up. As he starts to do so, he notices a huge bow and arrow set on top of the pickup. It's like a crossbow or a speargun and it's very powerful. He loads a red arrow into the thing and aims off into the distance. I say, "Hey man, don't do that at full force, you'll spend days looking for the arrow." He shoots it but it just goes a short distance over the bushes. He laughs at me and goes to get the arrow. I find some boxes to put the stuff in. A crowd is starting to develop. They look like they are going to steal all my goodies. I then have a high powered rifle. I hold it at them. I call for my brother. He comes over to carry the goodies in. A very inquisitive older woman comes over. I say disdainfully, "See, just woven cloth mostly, nothing of great value." I swagger around feeling pretty show-offy with my gun. A guy wearing glasses, but good-looking, just looks at me, slightly disapproving. I show off my prowess with the rifle. Dwight gets all the goodies in. I then notice a pile of wrapped Xmas presents under a tree near the pickup in the parking lot. One says, "To dad, from Dwight." I think, "Huh, that's silly. They'll get stolen." I then decide not to worry because they're wrapped. I figure the family was getting too crowded in the apartment with all those gifts and I go on in.
