We are on a houseboat: with a therapist: a warm person; first a man, then a woman who leans over me as I lie down; she says she loves me. I return to talk - then see beautiful view of the sea: "I came to see the view" and then I see the San Francisco Bay (vivid image) - but therapy is at an end. Then I get the bill: 2 invoices; he explains them in detail and I can't see how I can pay; everyone walks away; they mock me; they say I can stay on the houseboat, while they go to have fun. Feel hurt.
