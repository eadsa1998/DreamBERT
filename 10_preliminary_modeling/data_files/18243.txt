I was in this dime store. The room was very, very big and very swanky and very fancy and nice and modern. A very nice place to shop. It had a very big ladies room which, however, instead of being nice like the rest of the places, it was very filthy and in horrible condition so nobody would even want to go in it. This sort of upset me, but it seemed that they should do something about it since the rest of their store was so nice. I don't usually do things like this. I went up to find the manager or whoever I should speak to about it. Finally someone seemed like the likely person to tell about it, and so I started telling her what I thought about this. And she said yes, and somebody else had just come in and was telling this person over there about it. So we, I and this other person, it turned out to be this girl Diane who is the wife of a graduate student in Psychology here, started telling her about it and talking to each other about it. Sometime later, maybe not the same day, I came back to the store and I wondered if they had done anything about it, so I went into the ladies room. Sure enough, it was real nice and clean and I was glad that they had fixed it.
