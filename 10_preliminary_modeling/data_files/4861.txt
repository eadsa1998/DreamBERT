["Can't find the toys."] Paulina and her boys are with me. We are in some building. I gather up some medicine and toys and hang them up with the clothes. When I go to retrieve them, they are gone. I can't find them. I look all over. I feel frustration. Maybe the boys took them and hid them. I go outside and crawl up to a second story of an unfinished building. A crowd of people are on the ground looking up at me. I see them tossing squeaky toys around and see the two I was looking for. I ask them to toss them up to me. They do so. I feel better that I found them.
