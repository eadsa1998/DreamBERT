I am attending a business conference in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and walk out of meeting in a hotel and into a sort of large cafeteria where many people are eating in wide open space. The food table contains some sort of delicious looking apple cobbler mixture. I walk behind counter and start serving people as they come to table. The cook is seated near me--also behind serving table--and he is eating voraciously. I am nervous for fear the inviting apple mixture will be gone before I can get any. Later, in hotel lobby, I see Steve Andrews (fellow Manager in my office) get off elevator. I walk up and mention that I left the meeting to go home. Also tell him about the great apple mixture in the hotel restaurant. We stroll into a small waiting area and sit down. I am in a small, uncomfortable, old-fashioned brown chair close to ground, and Steve is in a normal and comfortable chair. I am squirming, trying to get in a good position and envying Steve his much better chair.
