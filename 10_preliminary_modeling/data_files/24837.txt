Most of the dream I can't remember. I think I had been on a camping trip, and on the way back we stopped in something like the Star Dome; I lifted up the flap of this big rubber star shaped thing, and inside I saw what I thought were three bats. When I got out, I think I remember being back on the camping trip, in a place similar to a camp site we stayed aton a camping trip I took with my dad. Now, everything after that is a blur, but I seem to remember some man (who I think represented my father, though didn't look quite like him) being shot, and as some police man dragged him off he handed me a strawberry smoothie. I also remember meeting with the 7-8th girls, but I don't know where or why. Setting: Inside something that was star-shaped, and made of rubber, blown up like a balloon; some parking lot, unrecognizable. Characters: There were three bats with red eyes; I think my friend Chloe got in there (she went camping with us this summer); some man who I think represented my dad; the My school 7th-8th girls. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, shocked. Bats and camping are a little weird, but I think seeing my father shot (which probably came from some movie I watched) is a little disturbing. What could it symbolize? Nothing, I hope.
