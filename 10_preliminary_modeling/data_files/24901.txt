I was in a swimming pool with Julia and Erin, and there was dirt on the ground of the pool, so when you swam across the middle you weren't allowed to put your feet on the ground. These guys were diving for a lid to a drink, and they had to pick it up with their mouths. Suddenly, my drama teacher was there and she made us turn around and not look as they dived for it so as not to embarrass them or something. That's what she does in the dance class during exams, when we have to make up a dance she makes everyone turn around so the person won't be embarrassed. Setting: In a pool. Characters: I'm sure Julia was there, plus Erin and my drama teacher and two guys. I didn't interact very much with the two characters, they just kind of followed me around. Feelings and Thoughts: Mellow. I had a fight with my mom yesterday. Julia was really supportive and nice 'cause I was upset. Maybe that's why she was in the dream.
