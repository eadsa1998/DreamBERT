I was at school. Calvin and I had to stay back along with Samantha and someone else to dig and bury graves. Samantha got hers done, but Calvin and I got our grave dug and then ran out of time. Dad picked me up at 7pm. The next day, we got in trouble for burying them where we did. I was told to write an essay. I was in some house. Nana and Poppa were being mean. I was at Mom's. Mom and Darren were moving the table. There was a movie shelf and Dog Soldiers was in there. I said "So many movies I want to watch". You had to pay for them. Amelie was in there and a movie called Hare. Ezra and this kid with corn were there. There was something with Christina Aguilera.
