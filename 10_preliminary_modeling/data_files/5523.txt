I had the care of a small child, I don't know if the child was mine or someone else's. In the beginning the child, a little girl, was lying on her back, very asleep, and a coverlet laying askew. I carefully placed the coverlet over her, but could not cover her feet, so I pulled it down and her shoulders were uncovered and I pulled it up and her feet were uncovered again. Then she was in a crib a very large crib and she was sitting up, laughing, she was a beautiful child, but I can't remember any details of her face or hair.
