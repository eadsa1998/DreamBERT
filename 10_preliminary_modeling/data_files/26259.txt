 I'm with a black man. The man is trying to look nondescript, to not draw attention to him. He wants to go somewhere, to leave the place where he is, and this may be escaping. I drive the car and he sits in the passenger seat. He has my push a button to use the hydraulics in the car. I do, the front and back ends of the car go up and down. It seems to be a high roller.
