I was at Bob Lippert's home. I was in a bed. I had some covers on myself. I saw his two sons' babies. They were nude and I just had my gym shirt on. I was a little ashamed. I looked into the other and room and I saw Mr. Shimpo. I took a look at him and he looked like a bully. I was in the house. I looked out and it seemed cold. They said it was about 6 or 7 above. I said, "I don't think it's so cold." My car was on Superior Ave. getting serviced and I was on Superior somewhere around 60th or 70th street. A car was coming, I said, "A superior car. I can ride to 116th Street." I was running to the car and the light changed and the traffic started to come. So I slowly flew above the traffic, then changed my mind and started to fly to 116th St. A fellow was near me for I flew low and slow. He pitied me, sort of held me back a little. He thought I was drunk or something. I noticed my arms didn't flap as they usually do. I finally came to a high cliff and my destination was down below. I looked down and I really was nervous. I finally jumped and glided down to the ground. The man and woman came down to me. They thought I got hurt so I told them I was Superman. The woman got frightened and sort of fainted like. I said, "Superman is a good doer, not evil; don't be afraid of him." They finally braced up. I was eating peaches. I was walking thru a different dept. and it seemed so hard to walk. I was slow. I was drawing coke. I put the hose into the oven to water it. I looked into the sky and the sun was so bright and clear. I watched Arthur, the time study. He was doing a job of rubbing. He did it so fast that it couldn't be done all day at that speed.
