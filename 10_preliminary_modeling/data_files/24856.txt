I was Oksana Baiul and I was ice skating with Katarina Witt. We decided to go to another rink, but when we got there it was too small to skate on. Suddenly I became myself along with my family and we were staying at a house by the rink. Inside the house, there were millions of sweets. Setting: An ice skating rink and a house. Characters: Me, Oksana Baiul, Katarina Witt, my mom and my sister. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I just read an article on Oksana Baiul the night before.
