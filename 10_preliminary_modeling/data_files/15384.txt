Dad and I went to the UK just to check out something -- we could do a 'quick' flight, and it would often land in front of this building near the sea which was near an embassy. Right next door to our building was a huge pet shop. There was a big exhibit in the middle with lots of cute brown puppies. There were ducks and geese there. I told Dad that some of the characters in Friends had a duck and chicken as pets and they were cute. Then it turned into a zoo. Some koalas and another kind of animal had all been packed on top of each other. I thought it was mean. I ordered one and told them to deliver to some address. A guy put the koala in a plastic bag and laughed. Then I walked away and I was like 'slice him open, slash his face'. I heard them do it and then I was carrying the plastic bag and dropped it in the middle of a park. The koala ran and went up a tree. I was thinking I would call it Chandler or Joey.
