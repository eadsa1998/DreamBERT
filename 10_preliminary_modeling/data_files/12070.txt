I woke up and I had to kill this weird thing. The next morning there was some guy at the end of my bed. He gave me $10, and I had to stab his hand and then shoot him. I stabbed his hand and then he turned into this freaky little squish monster. There was an island and people were missing. I asked Nana and Poppa for a gun.
