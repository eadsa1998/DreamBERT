["Racing well."] I go into a huge stadium, indoors. Thousands of women are attending a special Woman's Conference. I walk up a long ramp and find chairs in a row up high in the stadium. I look back down the ramp and see rows and rows of already seated women. It's a long way back to the rest rooms and I need to pee. I decide to wait. Signs are being placed in front of our chairs. I then decide to find a rest room. I walk some distance and find a bathroom with a large bathtub in it. The warm water is already drawn. It is a cleansing ritual says the man in charge. I get into the tub. The water is clean and a bit cool. I want it warmer, and turn the faucet on to add hot water. I am clothed in a black spaghetti strap top. Bonnie comes in. She wants to take a bath. I tell her this isn't a bath, with soap to get clean. This is a special cleansing ritual. I get out and put a leopard spotted T-shirt under the skimpy black top. The man tells me I must wear it over the top. I rearrange the tops. I leave the bathroom, still wet, but not uncomfortable. I get in a manual wheelchair. The man tells me the ramp is steep at first, and will be a bit hard to go up, but then it evens off and is easier. I struggle hard to push myself up the steep ramp. I manage to get to the top and see a downward slope with tight corners. Now it's a challenge, fun and fast. I lean into it to gather speed and take the corners like a race car, loving the excitement of barely making the corners with squealing tires. I do well and am having fun.
