I am with a lot of LT people, at something like a talk - a church service - don't know. Ben is there and he kisses me the way he usually does and asks me to go out with him - not just for one date, for fun, but sort of like a trial going steady. I say it may be okay, but I want to think about it and talk to Sue S.. I don't actually do that, but I do see Sue sometime else in the dream, she's sitting in the "audience" sort of place and there's a very loose sort of atmosphere where we are, as though it were an ongoing class and you can divert your attention from it to talk to people - very much as the Training is, but not physically set up that way and we're not actually doing anything but looking on.
