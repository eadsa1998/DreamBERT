I had put notices up on bulletin boards and doors at school with my name on it. I then went around collecting them. People had written messages on them for me. I felt pleased. I go out to find the minibus for disabled. I pass Jerome who is talking to a male friend of his. Jerome says, "You don't know my family. Lydia has two masters degrees and you'd better watch out around her. It isn't wise to care for her." I walk for blocks looking for the bus. I turn back and go back to the school thinking I'd left early and passed it.
