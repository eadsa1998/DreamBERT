I went to the YMCA. there was hardly anyone there. Two men approached me and wanted to talk to me. I wasn't getting my workout done at all. One in particular that I talked to most. His son was there too. I think I left came back. There were a lot of women there. It seems that they were all nuns, women from CIIS, and BJ. One or two of my CRHP sisters were there as I was going in. I had asked this one woman help me to learn how to use the Stairmaster. She wasn't sure how to use it but showed me. She fed this yarn into the Stairmaster because it would do some kind of knitting as you were using it. So she fed this in and it was feeding out this long piece of knitted yarn. It was very irregular and uneven and it came out very fast. I said well, it's very uneven and irregular. It doesn't really matter because it isn't something I want or need anyway. I was still having trouble using the machine. Then I was looking for someone else to teach me how to use it right. There were two machines there. Another woman came over and started showing BJ how to use it while a man was showing me how to use it.
