I was shopping. I wanted to buy some gum. I looked and found some gum, one stick free on some packages of single sticks. It was almost closing time, so I paid the girl a dime and said I would find it and pick it up. I found myself walking and driving down lanes of a park and this was supposed to be a store. I saw a banana growing on a tree. Then I came to a bakery dept. and there were all kinds of cakes and bread. I took two loaves of bread from a high rack of bread.
