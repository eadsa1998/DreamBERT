I was with a couple of kids (3 boys, 2 girls) and an adult. We were driving to some fun house thing. In the dream, I knew who these people were, but when I wake up I have no idea who they are. The fun house was a big multicolored building. We got inside, and all of the sudden, a really scary face appeared on the wall. I don't remember exactly what he said, but he was laughing and telling us that this was all a game. He also said we would never get out. I didn't know where I was. Suddenly, a chair lift appeared and we got on. Then I woke up. Setting: A car and a fun house. Characters: A parent and 5 kids, but I don't know who. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared. This dream is actually more like a nightmare. It's very eerie and frightening. The dream I had is a recurring dream I've had since I was 9 years old.
