 People are blasting a tunnel though a very deep portion of a rock mountain. They are very deep down, blasting to the other side. They are close to the other side, and are about to break through. There seems to be some question if the tunnel will line up correctly on the other side. The rock mountain crumbles a little bit, and is about to collapse. People flee out from under the mountain, out of the tunnel. I may be there, and I escape. There is a man with a radio talking to others about what is happening. Most people escape unscathed. The mountain collapses under its immense weight, crushing down and falling a short distance to the rock below. One man may get caught under a big chunk of rock, but he seems to be okay.
