I was at 'school' and it was the first day back. I was annoyed. It was Tuesday and I had English first. Ms Solomon said to start working. The class was weird. I was trying to find somewhere to sit. There were four rows. Elijah and Theodore were sitting on opposite ends of the third row. I sat at one end of the third row next to Theodore. I moved the desk away. I was hoping the teacher wouldn't tell me off. Eugene was talking to me at one point and when he walked away, I was thinking 'why the hell was he talking to me'. I was trying not to giggle.
