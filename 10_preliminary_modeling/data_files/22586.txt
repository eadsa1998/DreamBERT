I have again dreamt that I was in Cuzco. I dream this often. I always see myself in beautiful landscapes, alone, contemplating the river. But after that I see myself surrounded by many people in a dancehall, where I am the most wanted dance partner. But then, I don't know how, I find myself praying in the garden. Afterwards I see myself in Lima, but just as though I were in Cuzco. The places become interchangeable. I always dream of a person whom I loved very much. This person happens to live in Cuzco, and I think that this is why when I dream of that landscape, I always feel a lump in my throat and watery eyes. I am on the highway, which, in the dream, has a wall with an entrance to the city, but I am unable to enter it. In reality there is no such wall in Cuzco. Afterwards I see that I am bathing naked in the river. There isn't anyone around, but nevertheless, I feel ashamed. Then I don't remember any more.
