I am in a room where lots of activities are going on, like ladies playing cards at a table, and two women seated, reading, etc. I am there to have a session with my psychiatrist. I call him Dwight. He says to me, "I don't feel comfortable with you calling me by my first name so informally. I prefer you call me Dr._____ because you are a very repressed woman and it would embarrass me to be out socially or in public and have people think we are friends." He then hesitates about wanting to do the session in this room because of all the other people. I want that session, so I efficiently go over and pick up the table the ladies are at and walk it out the door, forcing the ladies to follow so they can finish their card game. I then go to the two women in easy chairs and say to them, "Please try to read more quietly." I feel pretty good about taking care of the situation. I remember the doctor had a tuft of gray hair on one side of his face, maybe his left as he faces me. Others had that same kind of tuft of hair. It's like a bushy sideburn, only growing out of his cheek.
