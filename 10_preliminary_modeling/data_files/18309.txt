My husband and I were in the mountains, perhaps at times the Swiss Alps. Very green and lovely. We felt acclimated after having been there a week and wanted to take a short hike, without the children. I had a hard time persuading my mother, who had gotten in the dream somehow, to keep the children for a few hours. We had been staying with Barbara and Jan, etc., while they had been gone, so it seemed only fair.
