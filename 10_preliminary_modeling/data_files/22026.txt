I was at home, surrounded by my family, and all of them had colds and I was desperately searching for anti-cold remedies in the medicine cabinet so that I wouldn't get sick, because if I got sick, I wasn't going to be able to attend classes at the university and they would mark me absent. And I would be behind in the assignments and when I finally returned, I would feel lost because I wouldn't know what they were talking about, and when they took the lessons, I wouldn't know them. I went on and on, looking for medicines, when my mother told me not to worry because I had already had the flu, and that I was messing up the medicines in vain. I answered that I would have them anyway. But I didn't find any; they had only vitamins. There wasn't even one aspirin. Therefore, I decided to go out and buy them. It was very cold and I wore at least three sweaters in order not to feel it. I arrived al Balconcillo, after a lot of walking, looking for anti-cold tablets and I didn't find anything. All the drugstores were closed and I felt hot. I arrived in Lince and no luck. Sweat had gone through the three sweaters that I had worn for the cold. I got to a store which is in the corner where I used to live, all red and perspiring, and I asked Louie, the owner, for an anti-cold medicine and a glass of water. I saw his face very clearly, exactly the way he is, and he told me, "Brother, you have a terrific fever." And I told him, "Don't be stupid; it's from all the exercise coming over here to get the medicine." I took the tablets and went back home where, to my surprise, everyone had gotten over their colds. I turned on my radio and fell on the bed, exhausted. It was about 8 p.m. and I thought I would sleep until the next day and that it might be a better day. It ends here.
