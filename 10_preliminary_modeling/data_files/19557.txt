I am oiling a buggy, and tightening up loose bearings, or nut, on axle. The buggy is caked with mud. The wrench I am using is the small, black, monkey-wrench with defective adjusting screw, so that it has to be readjusted frequently. I tighten the nut considerable (pull hard) and expect it to "bind" but find, on testing it, that it turns easily though groaning at one spot. The oil is squirted through special oil holes which are larger at top. The oil is really too thin for a buggy (this one hasn't been used for 2 years or more) but I conclude no harm is likely to result, as the buggy may never be used.
