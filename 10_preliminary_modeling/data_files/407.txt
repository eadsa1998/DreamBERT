       Later: I'm at the library, at a row of shelving, checking through some things. Everyone's attention is directed forward, as if somebody's teaching a class or giving a talk at the front of the room. (And maybe so.) I find a group of cards, look through them, and find mixed in there's some [paper library card applications]/wedding invitations for Geoffrey's wedding. They've got names on them for people I recognize, and it's very stupid for them to be mixed in here. Who did this? (Me, I wonder? - I don't think so.) Well, hell; now what? I should do something about them - call the people up, I guess. I know at least one of them's out of town. I'd better go do that. I turn around and see the next shelf (sorting shelves) is still not sorted completely yet. I'd better do that right quick. I stick my arm out to put the "invitations" down and knock over a lot of books, though I catch some before they go all over. Oh, great. Well, I'll fix it. VK comes over and tells me to let (somebody) do this, he'll be just fine, we need to let him. (This guy isn't visible, but I picture him in my mind's eye as Benny on "L.A. Law". He's slow but quite competent, and new here at the library, we're all learning what he can do.) I tell VK about the "invitations" and go off to deal with them.
