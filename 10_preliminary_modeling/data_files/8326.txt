There were three couples and I have no idea who they were. One of the couples was engaged. The other couple was about to become engaged. By the end of the dream all three couples were engaged. For either one or two of the couples there was some suspicion, I think from the woman, that her mate was either not truly committed to their relationship or maybe he was seeing being unfaithful. That may be why they became engaged - so he/they could prove to their partners that they were committed.
