I was walking home from school and I put my bag on the island across from the logs. I did this because Mom came and picked me up. I then realized it was gone. I was really upset because my phone was in it and so were a lot of other things. We went back and it wasn't there, then it ended up in the middle of the donut, in front of the house across from the logs. I then left it there. I ended up with my phone later and I wondered why I had it. I was jumping fences with someone and there were rabbits.
