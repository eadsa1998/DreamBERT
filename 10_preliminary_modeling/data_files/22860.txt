Our family arrives at church, and I discover that I only have on a dirty pair of trousers and a sleeveless white t-shirt.  I wonder why Mother and Daddy didn't notice it before we left home.  I can't go to Sunday School and church like that.  Mother says I'll just have to go home and change.  I start out in the car, but notice that my good blue trousers, my suit coat, and my white short-sleeved dress shirt are in the car.  So I decide to find a closer place to change.  I go to Longhorse St. and am going down it in the direction of our house when I see a streetcar on the tracks with nobody in it.  It has doors like a train coach on each end, and is almost covered in ivy.  I consider it as a place to change, but think someone might come along, and the ends are kind of open.  I think on the way home I will go through City Park and possibly find a place there.  Then it occurs to me that possibly I will see Linda Forestt there, since she is supposed to be camping at 10:00, and church started at 9:45, which reminds me that I am already late.  I go through the entrance to City Park and see a bunch of girls swimming in a pool.  I am surprised-the weather isn't exactly cold, but it isn't warm either.  I go on to Aunt Wilma's house to change clothes.  I don't have a tie, so decide just to wear the slacks and white shirt.  When I get there, all the girls (Girl Scouts) are there. I think Linda is there too, but I'm not sure.  I realize that church is more than half over and when I get back it will be over completely.
