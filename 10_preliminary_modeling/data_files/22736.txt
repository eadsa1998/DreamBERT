I was a split person. I stayed on the roof of my house over the maid's room. During the day I was good and at night, bad; that is, I attacked people and my face and body were transformed. Several scientists came to study my case. They were dressed in white. I ran around the house. I remember that the furniture was very old and the floors were very brown. I was dressed in black and was horrified at being a split person.
