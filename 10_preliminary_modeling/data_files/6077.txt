I was walking in a hallway at a school going to my science class. I saw a skull of a small animal on the carpet. As I got to the classroom, Beth was telling me that she was going to be out of school for three and a half months because she had guests coming. Then, our boss walked into class late. She was always always late, and Beth made rude comments about her to me! Beth didn't like her, but was extremely fake to her! She pretended that she liked her. Our boss was overweight and wearing a pair of tight leopardskin bicycle shorts. Her stomach was hanging over the waistband. Beth ignored our boss and told me that she was not going to tell our boss that she was going to be gone for three and a half months and was just not going to show up!
