I am in the street with cars stopped and people watching a bright white light-like dawn over the earth's surface appear before them. It is in the distance, a strip of light and brilliance. I move toward it into a room, big like a ballroom, empty and with high ceilings and long velvet drapes. A woman (the source of the light: she is a ghost spirit) stands in the middle of the room in a long velvet dress, regal with gray hair. She is bargaining for the painting with a man who stands holding it. She is firm with her price, very sure of herself in the command by her voice, and she gets the painting and turns around to show it to me. It is a portrait of me.
