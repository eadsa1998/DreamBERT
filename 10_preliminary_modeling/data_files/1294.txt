I'm teaching Spanish to a small group while the teacher is out. I create a long sentence and write it in English on the board. "The City of Springdale with clothes and things give me XXX." I am standing at the board asking the group to give me words in Spanish, la cuidad de Springfield, etc. I lament that I should never have chosen this sentence; it's too complex. I ask 3 women to tell me in Spanish what they see out the window. They do so. I don't understand all they say but I pretend to do so. I look out and I say, "Unhippie." Then, co-worker Tyler comes by wearing hippie clothes, rhinestones on his face, a moustache, etc. We talk. Then it's time to leave. We are all camping near by for the weekend. We step into the bathroom. A woman complains that when we turned on the water, it put cold water in her shower and she wasn't done yet! We go to the bathroom and then notice there is an organ in the room. Then we go outside to get into the VW bus. I get in and it's cold. The seats are like rocks inside a refrigerator. I am a passenger in the back. The driver is paralleling the ocean. We hear rock and roll. Someone says, "Johnny XXX is here." I'm glad. Then the driver drives into the ocean, paralleling the road. I say, "You're in the water. Is that safe?" She says, "Sure. I'm on the beach. No problem." We then are still in the car but are standing and running, our feet splashing on the water-soaked grass. I look up. A fat yellow woman is ahead. Even her nipples are yellow. We nearly crash. Now we are running along side the VW bus.
