I was 'in' Queer as Folk. I went out with some guys. Later, there was a bunch of us and they were having a competition and asking how 'big' everyone was. Stuart was sitting on a toilet, naked, with his butt sticking outwards. Then I was watching Community, and Jeff was expected to like this 'hot' girl. Abed picked up on Jeff's emotions and convinced him to tell Britta how he felt. He chased her down and she was on the phone and he said "I have a crush on you" and she looked shocked and repeated it and he laughed happily and left.
