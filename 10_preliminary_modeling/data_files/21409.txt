I looked at the clouds and to my surprise one cloud was coming towards us. It was coming along the ground. I said to Ann, "Look, here comes a cloud on the ground." There was a woman that Ann hated in our relation and she said she would not let her come to our house. We were supposed to be newlyweds and a couple lady friends of Ann's were watching us. I knew it, so we went to bed and to sleep. I think I saw a horse with For as part of a name to win.
