Matthew had either called or came home and was upset. He was telling me that Ashley B had decided to break up with him. I wanted to make sure that I said the right thing or didn't say the wrong thing. That was most important. I wanted to be comforting and I didn't want to say anything that would alienate him and keep him from coming to me in the future and talking openly. I was thinking to myself that it was for the best that she made that decision.
