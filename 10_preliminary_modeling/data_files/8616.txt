I was working a computer but there were other people with me. We were recording things in kind of a list fashion. It was questions or things for consideration. There were many changes being made in the town and decisions needed to be made about what changes. It was very similar to the TV program Town Haul. They were renovating many of the old buildings in the town. But there was a limit to how much they could do or how many of the buildings they could renovate. Everyone would mention the buildings they thought should be considered. Then they would name the reasons why the various buildings should be considered. I was typing the items into a text box. After they felt they had completed the list they would try to prioritize and make the final decision about which ones would be renovated. But the items in the text box seemed to be more than just those reasons why a particular building should be considered. For example, someone had me add something about a black Terrier. It feels to me that the Terrier had been in ill-health. This made one of the buildings in town seem more of a priority to the people in the town. At one point in the document there was a second text box. either on top of or inside the other. The second one was very, very wide. Maybe I had not set it for word wrap. But that should not have needed to be done. I did change the setting to word wrap and now the second text box was the same width as the first.
