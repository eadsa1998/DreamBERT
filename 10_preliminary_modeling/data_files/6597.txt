Q. (a new love) kisses me on left cheek. I blush very mush as I realize 3 or 4 girls must have seen. They rise and move off to tell we are engaged (never were) I think; but I remember he's married and hope they won't tell but it's all right because someone knew. A lady doctor expected to move to Donna (my hotel) from Vacation camp isn't coming I'm told on visit there. I see an empty room with new matting on the floor being arranged for a new guest.
