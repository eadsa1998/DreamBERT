The next-door back yard has huge exotic lettuces growing in a garden - all they have to do is take off a leaf or a part of one to have salad material for a week, and the whole plant's beautiful. I think I'll plant those next year, I'll get her to help me. I'm trying on sweaters in the store where Abby works, but (either there's no dressing room or I don't want to use it - I seem to be in a hurry). She's not thrilled with the idea and we have to keep a lookout for her bosses. I get stuck trying to pull my blouse off over my head and have to unbutton it, which is not fun because the buttonholes are tight. I'm also trying to change or pull off sweaters on the front lawn where you cross over to the next yard, though it's not flat here, there's rocks or an upgrade and bushes, so we're somewhat hidden - I'm talking about how even though I like to wear sweaters in the winter (Abby asked me why I was wanting all these), I certainly know to layer so I can pull some off when I'm too hot. There's a TV family here, getting ready to go somewhere, all wearing coats on the front sidewalk. I notice the stripe trim on the teenage daughter's coat, and think, "You know, they must give her that same coat from wardrobe for consistency."
