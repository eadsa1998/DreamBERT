I was watching a movie, except it wasn't, which was like a sequel of Children of the Corn. Eli (Children of the Corn 3) was in it. Granma was pregnant. Smudgy and some other cats were in this cage, which was like a glass container. There was a pig in one too. We took something out of a smaller container and I asked why we didn't let Smudgy out. Smudgy didn't like this guy called Jacob, which reminded me of Twilight. Somehow we saw a glimpse of the future and a fire was going to burn the whole world. We realized that someone had done something in Gatlin. Eli, some others and I went there. There were kids infected with corn and we got them to leave. If they were infected with corn, they would burn better there. Eli randomly turned into a tomato on the path. Granma apologized and he turned back and said in a weird voice, "apology accepted". Ezra found this scene of Twilight on Youtube, which went for 8 minutes. I said it was "still stalking me". It showed Edward and Alice (from the movie) and I said that the actors chosen suited the role. Rosalie (actress from the movie) was driving and I said she didn't.
