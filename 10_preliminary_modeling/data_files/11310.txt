A rich ran came to me on the street and showed me a suitcase full of money. He assured me that there was a million dollars in the case. He said the money is yours if you can tear this phone book In half. If you can't I will kill your mother and father. I took him up on his wager, confident of my strength. The phone book had these rubber pages which made it stretchable but not tearable. Finally upon giving up no more strength in arms, the news came that father and mother had been murdered. I vowed I would spend the rest of my life in attempting to catch the tempting villain.
