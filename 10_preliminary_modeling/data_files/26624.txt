 I'm with a tribe of Aborigines. I then move to another tribe. At the new tribe sheets are being cleaned, which occurs once in a few years, by hanging them out on a line. The first tribe sends three or four members to the second tribe for talks. All of these members are dressed in bright orange shorts. The chief of the second tribe ignores or rejects the talks. He walks away. He is a huge man: over six feet tall, weighing over 300 pounds. The first tribe then begins the destruction of the second tribe by sterilization, via food and burning/smoke. Some of the plants burned that give off good smoke are also good to eat, including cauliflower. The leader of the second tribe killed his own people after learning they were sterile. I'm in a room with my housemate Glen Ryan. We're talking about horrible killing of the tribe by sterilization. It is pouring rain down very hard outside.
