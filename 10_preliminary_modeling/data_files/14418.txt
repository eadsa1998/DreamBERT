I was at university and I was on the computers. My old 15" monitor was there. Brent was like 'what the hell is that?' at the monitor. I explained it was mine but I had a new 22" now. I was sitting next to Preston and I felt uncomfortable. Then I was at a place and I went into this room and there were all these Asian kids in there from Beijing. They got sent over because something was happening over there. There were toys and blocks everywhere. There was a bed, which I sat on and there was a chicken thing on there. There was also some game, where you collect food, clues etc and match DNA and find the 'killer' or whatever they were. The 'killer' in one I did was the victim.
