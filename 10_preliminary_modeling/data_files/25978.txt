 People are playing African drums in the basement of the Jefferson School by the lunch room. I go and play a bit in front, where the leader's play. Then I sit down because no one acknowledges my playing. I crazy dirty man sits by me. I move away from him, and go under the stairs. The leader is playing and people are following along. A song is played. Each person selects sticks off their own large sheet of stickers and puts them in the appropriate place on a card. I find this easy to do: the selection is simple. My grandma Redding is there. Carlos Maren, a gay man I know from high school, and another gay man are there.
