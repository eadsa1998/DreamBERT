[1997-05-16] I was in church, at mass and suddenly the father stopped the mass and said "that's all I'm going to do, I'm not going to do anymore mass, I'm leaving" and he did and we all got really mad, all of us in the church and we started to say "he can't do this! We have to have mass. What would happen if all the priests did that? We'd have no more mass! It would be awful." My friend B and her mother and I were walking out and I said "you know, that's terrible, I think he just did that because he's got somewhere to go on his schedule and he just wanted to get out and do it" and B's mother said; "he's right there. He just heard everything you said" and I said "I don't care! I'm glad he heard me and I'd say it again if he wanted me to because its not fair that he did that to us." And I was real mad and didn't know what to do. We kept walking and went home and I was at the church that was across the street from the house where my parents lived when I was growing up, so we went to their house.
