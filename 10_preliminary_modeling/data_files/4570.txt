["Can't find Paulina."] I am visiting Paulina at her work place, which seems to be a counseling social service agency. I meet her boss. We chat. Then Paulina wants to change jobs. She and are walking together. It is time for me to return home, but first we are going together to do something at the University. We are walking down a path that winds around a large grassy area. I see some soccer players standing around. Drew Carey stands there chatting with them. We chat for a moment and then I notice Paulina must have gone ahead. I walk on down the path, looking at groups of people hoping to see her. I come to the building and can't find her. I am concerned now. I go into the building which has a huge sort of open wall rather than a door. I can't see her. I turn back and go outside hoping to find her there. I decide to wait there looking as I have the best view of the whole grassy area there. I am worried we won't connect and feel bad I let her out of my sight.
