I was walking with Ezra near home. We saw police and a car and thought it was Santiago's but it was his brother's. It was a yellow car. I had to walk past to get 'home'. Then I was a guy who knew the guy who owned the car. I was an inspector and this cop guy told me I couldn't get inside, call anyone or travel.
