 I'm in the southwest United States. I see mountains, valleys, rock formations, the Grand Canyon, the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and some structure named ___nine, which may be a depression of some sort. My brother Wally is with me. He tells one man, who is a total bullshitter and who knows nothing, all about this place because he knows about it. I stand on a polished rock-type flat area with a University of Montana emblem on it. There are two bathrooms, one with an "M" above the door, and the other with an "S" above the door, which at first I think might be an "F". A fire truck arrives. A woman comes up from the truck. She is okay but seems stunned: is recovering. Everyone takes photographs of her. I try to get out of the way: I don't want to be in the limelight with this woman, or even in the background.
