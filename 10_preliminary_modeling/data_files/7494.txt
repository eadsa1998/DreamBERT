I can't see Mary, but know she is in the house. She is doing a great deal of cooking and has several pots on the top of the stove. Either I think it, or someone says: "She hasn't done so much cooking in a long time." All of the pots on the stove begin to boil over, and there is no one in the kitchen. I go over to the stove and turn off one burner (or all of them). There is a pot on every element on the stove. I have difficulty finding the correct dial for each burner or element. However, I am eventually successful in doing so. It is only while I am struggling with the dials on the stove that I sense that Mary is somewhere, upstairs, in the house. Next I am in a room trying to take a shower. There are many young men in this room. (I think they are students.) I don't know them, and they don't know me, but it does not seem strange that they are in the house. I am struggling to take a shower and have trouble finding the proper taps to turn on the water. This shower room is not at all like a bathroom -- it looks more like a living room or den.
