I'm at a house with some old friends. My friends from school Saul, Ralph and Terry. It's incredibly messy - full of stuff - like being waist-deep in a charity shop after an earth quake. As I leave I notice another old school friend, my friend Reece, who is hidden behind a pile of clothes. He had kept quiet, perhaps because I had upset him. On leaving, I scratch the door, and feel guilty about it, but I pretend it wasn't me who did it. I get a lift back to Terry's parents house by his dad. Terry's house is full of his sisters. I get the impression I'm back in the mid 80s. I wake up feeling anxious.
