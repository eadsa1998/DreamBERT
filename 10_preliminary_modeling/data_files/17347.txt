I met with my boyfriend Jeremy in a tower.  There was a well in it.  We started making out.  I was on top of him and about ready to just go for all out making love.  He stopped me and said "In 20 days.  Wait until you work at the observatory so we have full privacy."  I said okay, but I still had aroused, I guess.  I walked a small dog, as did Jeremy, and I followed him off to the right.  Something deterred me and I went left.  I was stopped by Sally and Ted Forth from the comic "Sally Forth", and they questioned my interest in their daughter.
