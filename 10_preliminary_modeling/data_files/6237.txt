It started out that I was at school (high school) and I was going to classes. When school let out I went to my car. (I do not own one but have seen one I meant to buy.) There, in the car, was Stacy (a girl I like). I got into the car and then we went to a park. I didn't recognize it, but I felt comfortable like it was my room. We got out and had a picnic lunch. After lunch she said, "I want to tell you something." I retorted by saying, "Really, what?" She told me that she was a witch. I didn't believe her so she showed my by calling the clouds around us (overhead, and it was clear before). Lightning and thunder came from the swirling clouds. Then she flew into the air. I sat there in amazement as she took my hand. We went flying over Boston and then we went above the clouds. Just as I leaned over to kiss her, I woke up.
