I climbed up this tree and ended up on the roof of this guy's house. He had several little buildings that were his house. Something happened earlier and this building had blown up and killed his wife and he blamed me for it. He saw me on the building and I fell off. He was trying to kill me. He looked like Jack Nicholson.
