I was hungry and Mom and I went to a petrol station to get food and a car was crashed near it and then it blew up. For some reason, we couldn't go to the petrol station. We snuck back to the car and then Ezra and Jayson did too, because there were these ranger people who liked stopping people. We got in the car and one guy came up to Mom's window, but she drove off. They followed her and ended up crashing into us, we got out of the car before it blew up, then the ranger people died. I was starving and somehow I had managed to save some stuff, we kept trying to get a ride, but people thought we were bums and kept saying no.
