I am in the army.  I have eaten already, but I enter the mess hall looking for some kind of electronic box on the wall.  I'm hoping it is at the front, because I am in my green uniform with my captain insignia, and I am embarrassed to walk past all the men eating there, many of whom know me but don't know I am a captain.  Unfortunately the box is not in the front, and so I do have to walk through the mess hall.  Most of the men are also in uniform, and I do hear a few sarcastic mutters of "Ooh, a captain."   I don't find the box in the back either, and when I come back, I have to squeeze between one wall and the tables of men eating next to it.  From across the room I hear "Yo ho Carlos."  I have the feeling it is directed to me, but I don't stop, because I'm not sure.  Then I hear it again, and I stop.  One of the guys not in uniform is talking to me, although he is looking in a different direction.  He makes some remark about my rubbing up against that dirty wall.  I look down at a piece of chalk I am carrying in my hand and lightly trailing against the wall.  It has a little dirtiness on the tip, but not much, and my uniform doesn't appear to be dirty.  I respond, icily, "Does my touching this wall have some significance for you?"  I considered saying "Do you have a problem with it?" but I was afraid that would sound like a challenge to fight.  He doesn't respond, and I walk out of the mess hall.
