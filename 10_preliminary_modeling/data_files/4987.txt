I have a neighbor; he visits frequently. We are friends. He starts kissing me very gently and kindly. I like him very much. We realize we are going to be lovers. It's very nice. I feel happy. Then I realize the bad guy neighbor is on his way to visit me and I don't want him to know about my new relationship. I "see" him coming down the road. He's riding in some open air vehicle and has crows that talk. He sends one on ahead to give me the message that he's coming to visit. I hurry to get my friend out. I leave a message that I've gone to a small family birthday party at my brother's house next door and he can drop in if he wishes. I hope my good friend doesn't decide to drop by too. It would make things more difficult. [BL]
