Mabel is trying to bring Andrea and I back together. We are sitting at a table together in a meeting. Mabel stands up and starts to announce how we've been having difficulties. Both Andrea and I get embarrassed and angry and tell her to leave us alone. During the course of the meeting, we have to talk to each other and I smile and look her in the eye, being open to reconciliation. She continues to be cold. I smile at that too. How typical of her.
