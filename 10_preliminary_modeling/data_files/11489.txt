I was crossing a city street late at night. It was deserted and the night very black. I got about halfway across when I became aware that a terrific wind was blowing directly head on. Two headlights glared out of the darkness, but because of the wind I could make no headway. I cried out and awoke after which I discovered that my forearms were shaking from the exertion, apparently of having tried to swim through the opposing gale.
