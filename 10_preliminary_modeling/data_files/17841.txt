I was in the drug store in the town where I went to college.  It was more of a grocery store though and I was doing some shopping.   I ended up talking to the manager, though, and I got a job there.  I was thrilled to finally have a job!  I rearranged some of the shelves a bit but hadn't been taught to work the register.  One register was blocked off with plants or something and I talked to the manager again.  I was so happy, and I thought about how lucky I was.  Then I realized what city I was in and that I would have a half hour commute, which seemed pretty ridiculous for working a drug store.  But I was still happy.  I went home for the day but going out to the parking lot was difficult.  The front of the store was partially brick, as if it was an old converted mental institution.  I searched the parking lot for my car and couldn't find it.  I started worrying about how I would get home and considered calling Sol.  Then I remembered I'd parked near campus and started trying to climb a steep hillside to get to the parking lot.  It was a difficult climb up the dirt through the trees.
