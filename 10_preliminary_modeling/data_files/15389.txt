I was driving down a two lane road. Two cars behind me were going the other way. Then it was like a movie. They got out and walked down the island in the middle of the road. There were two cars and two girls. They were like 'is it weird I feel drawn to these cars'. They decided it was their destiny for them to take them. They were worried that it could be a trick to make their lives worse. Then it was years later and they were all successful. One of them had just got a part in Friends and was given pot. They all met up and had a smoke and hallucinated. One of them saw a leopard and a dead baby in water. They all ended up dying. A guy reset and things went differently.
