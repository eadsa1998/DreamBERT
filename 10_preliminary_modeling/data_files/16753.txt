I am in a room and there are three girls there. They think I'm a girl. They ask what happened and I told them I gained some weight since Europe. There is a bowl of frosted flakes right next to me and I can't help but grab a couple. Then I think I'm living with them for some reason. One of them had fairly short, straight dark hair and wore really cool clothes that I liked. I remember her the most. Then, either in the same room, or maybe another, some boys come in and one of them sit on my lap. I don't remember looking in the mirror throughout this dream, but I remember feeling "like myself" and I didn't think I'd look any different anyway. Back in the girls' room, I sit on a couch, trying not to give away the possibility that I might not be a girl. I'm on a chair and pick up and look at a deck of cards or something similar. Then I go over to another couch where one of the girls is watching TV or something, and I decide to relax and get some sleep. Then all of a sudden Mr. Dell and Sara are in the room. I saw her, and hoped she wouldn't recognize who I was. Then we were playing a game of some sort, and Sara chose me ("James") as the first one to go. I just sat there, hoping nobody would think that male name was mine.
