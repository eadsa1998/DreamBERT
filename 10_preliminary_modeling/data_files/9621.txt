I go to the Camden's: Fr. and Marissa invite me to go to the movies; earlier Father Andrew came by for my children! We sit at long tables at the movie. I arrive late, so I sit across the aisle - Father Andrew was worried and comes after me; then we walk in together - later, on the way home, I ride up with Father Andrew and Reynaldo lying on his stomach; we look at the scenery and talk; very happy.
