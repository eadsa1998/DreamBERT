I was sitting on a sofa with my girl's girlfriend. I was waiting for my girl to arrive and her girlfriend told me she had gone out with somebody else. I swore, and this girl not liking swearing, asked me what I said. I asked her if she heard me and she laughed and said, "No." I kissed her after that. Just as I was doing this my mother walked through the room. She simply looked at us and walked right on through without saying a word.
