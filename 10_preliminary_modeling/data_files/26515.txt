 I'm working with three lower-middle or lower class Hispanic men. We're working at a fruit and vegetable stand. The day ends. I may ask the three bosses if I can take some of the produce to eat. They say okay, but I find that the boxes are all taped up so I can't get any fruit. A homeless man comes around, begging for change. I say to him, "Tell you what: Why don't you come home for dinner with me?" He agrees. I change clothes quickly as he waits. An attractive woman comes into the house where I am. I know her to be my roommate, though we've never met. As I'm leaving we meet and talk. I'm trying to find a light switch for the front of the house. She shows me where it is. I see that the homeless man has stolen my truck! I go to get him. He is then driving a bus that he has stolen. I try to get on the bus. I hang onto the back of the bus as he drives fast, and then stops abruptly. I smash into the back of the bus. He does this several times. I dupe him by hanging off the side of the bus. When he stops abruptly I'm flung up near the doors and I get on the bus. I have a gun. I point it at his head while he is driving. There's another man there also pointing a gun at the homeless man's head. I fire my gun repeatedly at the homeless man's head from point-blank range. The homeless man has taken the bullets out of our guns and we don't hurt him.
