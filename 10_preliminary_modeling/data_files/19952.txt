I was off the ward without permission. (I was confined in a hospital.) My mother came, and was disturbed because I had left the ward. I said to her, "Do you want me to stay here for 20 years?" My voice quivered with emotion. (Note the 20 years mentioned in last night's dream. After last night's dream, I had a feeling of tragic emptiness in my past life. Tonight, I felt it again, but with a feeling of resignation, whereas last night, I was very disturbed about it.)
