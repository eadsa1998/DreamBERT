At the beach I am showing some children various articles; to the girl doll things, to the boy a large crowded assortment of small toys...Trying to empty a box and show the articles taken out to my brothers ...Try to crowd past a man to get to the bathroom. Start to close doors before taking bath. Hunt for folding screen and find it quite tattered in a corner. Children march thru room and L. calls to me to shut doors after them. I say, "No" and when thinking I was unkind, I was half undressed for bath. She says, "Ah" and the children close the door.
