I had a concert to go to. I got there and it was in a small room. The ban was called K'Um. I didn't know any of the songs except they played 1985. I wondered why I paid $100 to see this. The guy next to me had the same shoes as me. I left after 30 minutes. I went to the Royal Show and Seamus got a balloon for this young kid. I went to walk out and had to push this woman out of the show and then I waited for the traffic to slow down and walked across.
