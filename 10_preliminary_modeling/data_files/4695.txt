["Lunch bus."] I am downtown in a city. With a woman friend. We get into a restaurant and sit down. We are eating our food , when a man sits at our table. We are conversing and he tries to join in. My friend moves the dishes to create a barrier line between us but the guy doesn't get the hint. Suddenly, we see we are on a lunch bus and it is beginning to move on it's route. We are startled. "Maybe we should get off" she says. I say get the name of the street. I hope we can find the van. We sit there in indecision. I try and see street corner signs.
