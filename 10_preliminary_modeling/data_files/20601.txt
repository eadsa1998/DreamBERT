I was living in a house with my mother and sister. (It did not resemble any that I have ever lived in real life.) A woman investigator came and questioned me about some flowers that were sent to someone. I said that I had mailed them, but I did not know who had requested that they be mailed. Later my mother threw some garbage out the window. Our garbage cans were on the curb. My sister went outside and moved some of them. Then I went outside to look at them. I tried to pass the next door house, but a new stair and stoop were being built, so I had to detour. The neighbors in that house were not on friendly terms with us. I came to a tree with a branch shaped like a horse's head. It seemed to have real horses' eyes. They stared at me. The branch itself began to appear to be a live horse. I looked away, and a little later it appeared to be undernourished when I looked again.
