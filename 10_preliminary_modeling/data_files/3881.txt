["Long time wooing."] I am some jungle primitive woman, shy and careful like a deer and also a royal person, a leader of my tribe. There is a group of men who are after me, to steal me into their tribe. There is one man, not of their tribe, or my tribe, who is very attracted to me. But when he approaches me, I shy off and run, thinking he is like the others and means to entrap me. He is incredibly patient. He repeatedly waits in the clearing and very slowly approaches me. Gradually, I allow him to approach, as I am also fascinated and attracted to him as well. But the bad guys keep breaking through and use the advantage of his attracting me to try and capture me.
