There was a killer. Me and someone else were running from it, but there were two of them (they were the same, but they were each a half). It was able to run really fast and just glided along in a straight line and turned really quickly. We ran into a police station and tried to tell them there was a killer, but they just sort of wrote us off and told us to leave. It was coming, so we ran out. We ran into a toilet and locked the doors and hid. It was coming through one entrance so we left through the other. It was night and there were a few buildings. The killer was like a shadow. It ran into a building and killed everyone in there in a few seconds. Then it was from its point of view and it was actually a girl who was looking for her body which was in the sea. One half of it took off and called the other 'Amy'. This lady was at the top of this tall building. She got a call from someone saying they were here and she sobbed and jumped off the edge to kill herself. This was already planned if they came. They caught us and put us in a cage.
