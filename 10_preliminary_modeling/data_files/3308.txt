I am in a huge house being made over into apartments. There are lots of interesting rooms off rooms. Ellie and Charla and I take a room and I am looking to see where to put my furniture. I see I have a sort of hallway. and someone else, a man, has put a chest of drawers in the bathroom. I go exploring and find another room in yellow paint with a nice window looking out to the busy city streets and I hear music from some dancing place across the street. I go back out to the big room and go around a corner and see Ellie's side. She has a beautiful closet with all her clothes hung up and pretty things and lots of room. I say, "Maybe we can move things around so I can share this space. I can bring my bed in here, and use that yellow room for writing." Then I look out the window. There are lots of interestingly dressed people walking by in crowds, people with roses, headdresses and so on. I say, "Ellie, bring me my camera." She does and I look through the viewfinder, trying out different shots, looking for a good one, trying to be more discriminating than I usually am. I get frustrated as none of the shots look really good. I sit on the edge of a window, knowing it is several floors down, and feel balanced precariously. Ellie asks me if that isn't dangerous. I say, "It could be, but I'm being careful." Then the camera isn't working well and Ellie opens it and sees I've wound up toilet paper into the case by accident. It had been on the bottom holding something broken. Now it's all enmeshed with the film. I say, "The film will be ruined," and I burst into tears and sob and sob. I am so stupid. Ellie says, "You did the best you could," and tries to console me. I walk to the bathroom to pee and Charla follows and I sob, "I didn't now it was going to be like this, when I was a child, I mean. Thank God." I see Charla has on a pretty dress and compliment her. I don't want her distressed with my sadness.
