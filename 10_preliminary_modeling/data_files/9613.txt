Roxanne comes over and complains: I get very angry at her. I tell her I am a bad person; "because we scream and yell and hate and fuck" and I tower over here: I spread my legs in a vulgar fashion: she is shaken. (!) But we make up and embrace, but she lets me walk home while she drives, because she has so many errands.... (also to repay me?)
