["Kind aunts."] I am trying to knit a sweater of soft blue yarn. I am making something for Paulina. I look at it and see I've forgotten to follow the fisherman knit cable pattern and am doing a simple knit design. I also dropped a few stitches which created a run. I pack it and several other knitting projects away as I am leaving. Several of my aunts are there. I might even be in Grandpa Lee and Grandma Maude's house. Aunt Charlotte walks with me holding my hands very caringly and is very loving and caring. Perhaps Naomi is in the background, concerned and loving as well.
