["Bear Cubs And Sleeping Beauty"]  I am in an old room with very high ceilings. A very tall thickly built man is there. I am looking around, because this is his house and I am curious about how he lives. It is run down, and junky, yet the room itself has elegance with the extremely tall ceilings. I see piles of old things and then I see a litter of bear cubs. Maybe 11 or 13 of them. They are cute and frisky. I pick one or two of them up and hold them. One has a very long thin snout, more like an anteater than a bear. The Mother bear is near by, watching comfortably. The man likes me. He is from some unsavory family. I like him too. He seems gentle. He stands up and I stand near him. I am amazed how much taller he is than me. I am aware of how his muscles are not in good shape. He is sort of pudgy, yet still good looking. He feels warm and cuddly, like a bear might feel, if you could trust the bear. I do trust the man. He lays me on a stretcher and I close my eyes pretending to be asleep. He carries me to other rooms in his house. His male relatives are suspicious of me. but the man and I just like each other.
