I was in this classroom and we were doing some activity to do with birthdays. We were talking about people born in January and I was thinking of Eugene. I was sitting next to Selena (also born in January). I was thinking that her birthday was on the 1st. There was a power out and then we had to watch a movie. I was thinking that Calvin would be happy. There was something about Mariah.
