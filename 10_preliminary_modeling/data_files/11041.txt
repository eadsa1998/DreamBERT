I was driving home from the show alone, and I was at Richmond and Mayfield or somewhere when I got lost and ran out of gas. I got out of the car and walked up the hill in the snow. Four little boys were playing where my glasses had fallen off so I went back to pick them up. But the smallest boy had [them] and wouldn't give them to me unless I gave him a dime. Then he dropped them and both frames and lenses broke. I couldn't drive without them so I was very angry and made him give me his name and address so I could send his mother the bill (the name was Asa something!). I went home for my streetcar pass so I could go back and get the car. It was cold and night time and I was dead tired and my father couldn't drive me there because his car was broken. It was about dawn when I went outside. In front of our house was a car with a boy I know in it with his three roommates sleeping. I woke them up and the boy held out my car key to me. I don't know why this was so wonderful but I didn't have to go back for my car. There was snow on the ground too.
