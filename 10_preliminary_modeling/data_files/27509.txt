I was trying to buy some records in a record shop, and I wanted to get the flat, black disks like everyone elses, but the man was trying to talk me into getting a disk that was in the shape of the wax that a dentist puts in your mouth when he wants to take an impression. This record was blue on one side and pink on the other side. I remember that the record fit into the victrola just as an impression fits into a person's mouth. I felt very nauseated. I insisted, however, upon the black, flat records, and finally bought them and walked out of the store.
