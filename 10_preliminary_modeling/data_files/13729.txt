I was at Nana's. There was a boxing match and this guy wanted to win on 30 points. They could get 'free' points by spinning a wheel. The other guy got 40 points. We went outside. The boxer guy was there. A friend of Ezra's was there and I started hitting him. This curly white haired guy was near the fish pond and I said "Who's the creepy dude?". The boxer said "My manager. My father,". His mother also had curly white hair. We all went to leave but all the exits except for one had been blocked. We went out and there were stairs. We saw this car drive off, but then it came back. This dark coloured lady got out. She had set up an obstacle course. I passed the first obstacle and was going over to the second thing. I had to go through a hospital and this lady gave me a baby boy to hold. He was really small and kept opening his mouth but he was 'muted'. I got to the second thing, which was on a computer, and the lady came so I gave her back the baby. Alejandro finished at the computer but someone else got his computer. Eventually I got a computer. We had to play this Mah-jongg game. If you made a mistake you would get an electric shock through the mouse. I finished and then was at a chess board. This giant lizard escaped and it stepped right on my side of the chessboard. I told the lady what happened and she said I could move on. The lizard was then a dinosaur. It kept coming after me. I was running up and down stairs and then went into this shop. The whole inside of it was cushioned, airy, bouncy and dark. The dinosaur followed me in and I hid under the wall. The dinosaur went past, but then saw me, but I got out. This girl was hiding behind a pillar. She was going to check where the dinosaur was but then its nose came past and was sniffing. Then I was in the car with Dad and we were driving to this forest. The sky was smoke and fire. The trees were burning and they had health like on Runescape and it was going down.
