I am running in my nightgown down a street at night. A woman from Church sees me, "Where have I seen you?" She turns away. I go to see Cindy: without a present for her birthday; leave early for a meeting; visit a jail; see a very battered table: ask if I could not donate a good table? recite poetry... awaken.
