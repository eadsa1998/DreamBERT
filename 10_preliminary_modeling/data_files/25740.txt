 I'm at Armstrong High School in Wilmerton. I'm leaving school early, and am outside my car, which is parked on the northwest side of the building. I am mixing some cookies in with ice cream, stirring them together. My college classmate Jason Sonnefelt walks out of the doors. I expect to give him a ride or go with him, so I expect him to get into my car. The passenger side door is open. He walks by the car and doesn't get in. I am surprised and confused. I close his door and get in my door.
