It's nighttime and me and my sister are leaving a house party. We get to my car and it's my old 1983 Chevy from high school, only the hood is missing. The lights are on and I say to my sister, "You left the lights on and now it won't start!" She says, "Oh well," and pulls out her cell phone to find another ride. I say, "Wait a second, what am I going to do?" Then I wake up.
