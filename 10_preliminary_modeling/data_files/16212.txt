We were camping and our family was like it was when I was little. I don't know exactly how old I was. I must have been little too, I just didn't feel little. I was acting like I was big. But I felt little compared to the others. [Mom -- when you were little, you always acted like you were big.] Well anyway, we had Samantha and Sandra, but we also had three boys instead of just Derek. We had a big boy named Quinn, like in his 20's, we had a big Derek, about 17 or so and we had a little Derek who was like 8 or 10. And the two big boys were alright; the girls were kind of reserved and shy like I was probably at that age. And the big boys were okay; they were like, I always saw them in camouflage and they would go hunting and stuff and fishing in the woods and stuff. The little Derek was scary, though. He had red hair and he would run around. He was a boisterous little thing. And, you know, I think I saw him near the keyboard a few times. He was carrying it around and running through the woods with it. And I can't remember too much about what happened during the dream or anything. I just remember that whenever the little Derek was around, I was really scared. And that's all I can remember. [Mom: I think you can identify with the big Derek, because he's your big brother that you talk to on the phone with music and stuff. But the little Derek is the little guy that scared you with the noises when you were little, and in your dream you've kind of combined both of them because they always, there was a while there where Derek and Ronnie were wearing camouflage and they were big boys compared to you when you were little.
