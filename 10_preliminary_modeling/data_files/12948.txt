Meredith and Derek (both Grey's Anatomy) were getting married. It was Meredith's fourth wedding. She was somewhere and saw a man in the distance and asked who else was in the building and was told no-one. She went upstairs and found her father. He said that every Thursday he'd disappear to see if he missed his family.
