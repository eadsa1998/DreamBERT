The dream begins when I am met at the N-- Y-- train station by my boy friend, 24 yrs. (whom I have not seen in a year). He does not kiss me but takes me by the arm and leads me into a restaurant. We are sitting across the table from each other; he does not say a word but smiles in a mysterious way. I try to reach him but while doing so, the table seems to grow in size and I cannot reach him. My philosophy teacher, 65 years, enters the picture. My friend writes out a note and gives it to him, where upon he leaves the room and the dream ends.
