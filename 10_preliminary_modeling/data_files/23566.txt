I was swimming in this beautiful river/pond. Vibrant green and gold colors, sparkling. I had a snorkel and mask on and was being video taped for a promotional advertisement (something having to do with school and dancing). I saw it replay a couple of times (participating and watching it at the same time). I'd dive in under water, arms back, palms upward.
