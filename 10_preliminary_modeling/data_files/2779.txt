I am at an abbey for a conference and somehow I leave the lecture feeling picked on and sad. My time there is spoiled, so they owe me an extra day and night's lodging there to make up for it. I walk down several flights of stairs and see books lying under the stairs, books about babies and children. I want to pick them up, but keep going. Now there is a long hall with doors opened to rooms on both sides. I look to one on the right and see a little girl baby in a pink sleeper smiling at me. Her woman caregiver holds her up. I enter the room reserved for visitors of the abbey. Other women are there; so is a priest. I think he's attractive and am aware he's a priest. He gives me a book. He gives each of us the book he considers appropriate for us to walk around the room with. I see the title. It is "To Be A Star" [I typed start twice instead of star]. I feel a bit uppity and think, "Of course he would give me this book. How appropriate." Then I look more closely and see it is a book about Jesus. I suddenly feel humbled and very sad. I feel like crying, like grieving. I walk the room holding this book and wondering if I can handle this huge responsibility. Now I sit at a table. The priest is there and several other women. I take off my suit jacket, and think, "This won't do any good because he's a priest." I notice my frilly, ruffly blouse. I sit.
