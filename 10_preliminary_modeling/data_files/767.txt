Howard and I split up. He takes the kids. As he walks away from me, their backs are all to me. I feel badly. I see "Drew" walking ahead of them. He has "given" me some other kids in exchange. I say, "No! I want at least one of my own." He finally agrees. I'm in a house. A group has arrived for a tour of a "fire engine-bus." I show them the fine features of the swivel driver's seat. We're in a field. There are lots of busses, games, and ladies at tables. I ask why we're so far away from the house. They shrug. A janitor comes by and points to the clock. "11:30," I say. "Break for lunch. We'll reset up closer to the house after lunch." In the house, there are lots of papers piled on a bench. I move them.
