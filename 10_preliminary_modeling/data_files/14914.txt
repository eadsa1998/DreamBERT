Mom got me into some concert. This guy said it was "The Smiths" and I was like "Oh my God YAY!". Savage Garden came on singing I Want You. They got stopped though because they weren't supposed to be on. Then The Smiths came on and it was a song called 'My Princess' which was a duet with Madonna and it went for like 10 minutes. I changed my status on Facebook to "*Squee!* Morrissey!" Savage Garden stood in the background and were annoyed and embarrassed. I went to a pet shop and I met this guy with a beard (it was black). There were lots of puppies and kittens. There were mice and they could get out and had leads on. There was a Timezone and it was closed but I went in and there were police outside. I waited for Mom to come get me.
