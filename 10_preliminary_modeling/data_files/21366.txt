A 2 won the race or 3, but I think 2 did. Hilts was arguing with a friend of his who owed him $4000. He seemed to have found it and either gave it to a woman or was lying and hid it for himself. I was sweeping the floor by Hilts. It was raining outside and Hilts had all his clothes on the line. I heard him bawling out his son. They were arguing about something. I was walking home in Rivertown and I saw two horses running towards me at a fast gallop, so I flew up high enough out of their reach. The horses were talking. One said to the other, "You killed the other fellow and you would like to kill more. I will give you a kick. You better stop doing that, killing people." I saw nose $412. Grandpas Evans was cutting apart bread and the loaves were as big as a bushel. I was going to take dancing lessons. The pupils lay on their stomachs and then got on all fours and walked. I walked on my hands and feet. One young fellow said, "These old guys, why do they want to learn to dance? They can't." I started after this fellow and said, "So you think we can't learn because we are old and weak. I'll show you." He was afraid of me, so he invited me into the studio, but when I looked in, it was a kitchen and no one was there.
