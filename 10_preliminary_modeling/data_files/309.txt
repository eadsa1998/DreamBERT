I need a curtain fixed or changed or put up. Bruce Mulkey is here helping me with it, and he asks me for a screwdriver; he's in the bedroom. I start for the kitchen, and stop to turn and ask, "What kind?" He says Phillips. I go to the bag in the kitchen pantry where I keep my tools and pull out screwdrivers. The first 2 are straight - I wonder briefly if a Phillips is in here, but the next thing I get is one. I stop for a second on the way back and when I get back Bruce isn't there anymore, but My ex is. He's in the bathroom doing something with the curtains there. Now, Bruce had been going to borrow or substitute something from one of the curtains in here for the one he was working on in the bedroom, but what My ex seems to be doing is putting up the new curtain in here and taking down the old one. There was a regular-length one over the toilet, under the shelves [for no reason at all - it's just a wall there], and he's taken that down and put a little short one up, just over the toilet - it's about 6" long. It looks silly. I realize I forgot the screwdriver, don't know where I've left it, and go back to look for it, wondering what on earth's going on about the curtains and what to say. I find it where I laid it down on the way through the living room, and I'm surprised - I hadn't realized I'd only brought the blade. (Apparently it's one that can be fitted into a handle, part of a set, though it's quite large for that.) I rectify that and come back to the bathroom. My ex's nearly finished and I don't know what to say to him. I certainly didn't want what he's done, but he'll get mad if I say so when he's doing me a favor. I wish he wasn't here at all - Bruce knew what I wanted and would have done it right - you can't depend on My ex, and he always thinks he's right, doesn't want to be criticized.
