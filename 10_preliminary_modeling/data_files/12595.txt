I was at Mom's and I went down the stairs and was sitting near the back door to write down my dreams. I got up and saw these Native teenagers out the front. I locked the back door, but only the wood one and ran upstairs but they got through. Mom told Ezra and I to get some stuff and get out. We ran out and then I was like "What about my laptop?". Then it rewound and I got my laptop. The Natives were selling our stuff.
