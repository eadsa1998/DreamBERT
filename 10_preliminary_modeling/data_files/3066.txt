I live in an apartment and a woman comes in and says, "I have to help you put proper coverings on the tie downs of your curtains." I am surprised and say, "Why?" She says because the management insists that everyone do it. I am upset. "We'll see about this," I say indignantly. She is the secretary of Dan T and his wife. She comes and works for me a couple of hours a week. She takes down the snowman Xmas ornament I have on the right curtain. There is a Santa Claus ornament on the left tie. I walk down to Dan's office and say, "We have to talk." He sighs, "Here she comes, to make trouble again." I say, "Why do I have to put on specific tie down covers? This feels like an invasion of privacy. I should be able to say what I want to have in my own home." He agrees, but he also explains that the ties need to be protected so they won't get dusty. We talk. I go inspect his curtains to see if he is complying with the rule. He has lace curtains that don't have ties. I say, "I'll have the secretary look it over, my curtains, I mean." He seems very grateful that I hire her for a few hours, like this is a very civic thing to do. He then brings me plastic packets with books and yarn craft things in them and I look them over. It has something to do with the curtain stuff. I choose one, wondering if I should pay for it or just walk out with it and assume he gave it to me. I watch him to get a clue if I am being given it or not. I can't really tell.
