My husband and I were in the backyard of one of our friend's home. There was a man inside the house who kept shooting at my husband. We were finally able to get inside the house. There was a young boy, who seemed to be the younger brother of one of my friends, with the man. We finally persuaded him to help us force the man outside the house which we did.
