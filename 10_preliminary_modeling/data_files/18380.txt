The dream involved my being a prince or something like that, and I and the king and queen and all sorts of royalty were trying to stay out of some sort of revolution within the palace or something like that. They were fighting with swords and a number of people were killed, but we eventually lost out. The house I call the palace may have been the house in the previous dream episode. I'm not sure.
