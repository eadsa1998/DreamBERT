I went into a church. A Mass was being said. My mother and sister were on the other side of the church. My sister was talking so loudly that she was disturbing the others. She saw me and called to me. Then she walked in front of the communion rail to get to me. She spoke loudly to my mother, who answered her. Then my mother followed her. The priest glanced at them from the altar. Later I was touring a residential area where I had lived years before. Other men were there. I wanted to climb a steeple. A man gave me a boost. Then he chided me for not being able to climb the steeple unaided. As he turned to speak to a someone, I descended the steeple unaided. (I awoke with an erection.)
