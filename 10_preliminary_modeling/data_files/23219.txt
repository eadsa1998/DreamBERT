I am walking on a city street with Jerry Schwarz and Jack Ramsay, on our way to have breakfast or lunch somewhere.  Michael Roemer comes out of a building that we pass, and we speak, but don't smile or shake hands.  He looks very drawn and tired.  When we get to the cafeteria where we are going to eat, I am behind them.  Someone I don't know is between us.  The waiting area is divided by a labyrinth of railings, and the ceiling is low and the walls are painted with large black and white squares.  The total effect is to make one dizzy.
