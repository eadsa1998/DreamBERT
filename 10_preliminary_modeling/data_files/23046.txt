I was in a kitchen by a pantry, maybe standing on a chair, and was attacked by a Mafioso wielding a knife.  He actually stabbed me a couple of times, but the tense anticipation was worse than the actual stab.  Then I grabbed him and wrestled the knife away from him, then began beating him unmercifully, practically to the point of death.  He hadn't really angered me that much, but it seemed to be a matter of principle.
