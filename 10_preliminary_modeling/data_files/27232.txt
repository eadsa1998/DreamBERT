About two weeks before entering M--- as a transfer student I dreamed that I was dead for two years--that is, I felt as if I were dead but it turned out that I had been in an insane asylum for two years. At the end of this time my friends came to call for me. I was full of questions about everyone &amp; asked why my best friend had not come along to call for me. They sneered &amp; said she was quite changed &amp; had been living with a man. They told me, too, that the man with whom I was in love had visited me several times with a girl from N--- Y---.
