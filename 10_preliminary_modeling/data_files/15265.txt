I was at the video shop in Parkville, but it was different and organized differently. The foreign movies were separate from genres. I was in an English aisle and found Yojimbo and Oldboy there. I grabbed them and then remembered that I'd seen them and put them back. I was looking for Paris, Texas. I found a section which had all season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and said "I wonder if there's a Joss- [Whedon section]" and then saw there was. There were two other girls and they wanted 'Keeping Julian' and there was an exchange which I can't read, but has something to do with Firefly, and then we stared at something in amazement and discussed how awesome Joss Whedon was. Then a guy called out to one of the girls and they asked his name and he said "Big Tuna and I laughed, as well as the others. Ezra and Dad were then there and I was thinking that I should explain about Jim and Andy's tuna joke from The Office. I got my phone out to record them and they were just saying jokes from the show. Then Will Arnett and Amy Poehler were there and got up to talk. There were two guys and they did a competition and the one that lost said the other guy cheated, but went along with it anyway.
