I was watching TV, VH 1, and suddenly I saw Jefferson Airplane singing, "Don't You Want Somebody to Love." I said, "Valerie, Mom! It's Jefferson Airplane." The person who was singing was really Grace Slick. She had long brown hair, and she had a really gentle face. She looked kind of sweet. Her face kind of looked like Carrie, who was in the Stephen King movie. Valerie came down and said, "Oh!" Mom finally came down and said something. I don't know what. Mom and I were kind of happy to see it.
