I was at Mom's, which was different. The front room had windows at the front and no curtains. I can't remember why, but people weren't supposed to know that I was there. I saw "Officer Barbrady" coming, but it was actually Bellick (Prison Break). I ran out the back and hid behind something. After he left, a bunch of people found out that I was alive or whatever. Granma was one of these people. She brought a bag which had another bag on it under the shoulder and another going out to the stomach. The backyard was big and farm like. Then we were out somewhere and Granma was acting weird and we realized she was drunk. She was driving me and Mom. We saw police up ahead at a booze bus, but they let us through and we were like 'lucky!'. Then I was watching a movie with Kevin Spacey. I had written down the ending before watching it to see if I was right. I was and I was telling Dad it was easy to guess. Then it was like the sequel or something. Robert Downey Jr. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were in it. Jeffrey was a bad guy and in his Watchmen outfit. He was on the phone at a desk (it was like in the movies, where it's a dark room with a lamp on, on the desk) and talking to the 'good guy' and I thought 'damn his voice is hot'. Robert Downey Jr. was wearing a cool coat and I said to Mom that I wanted a coat like that. He was running down a street. Someone's mother, who looked like Judith Light, was at her work in a big building. She was in a big meeting room with ladies all around the table. There was a scream and it went in slow motion and it exploded. At the end of the movie, it showed Robert's character getting a job and sorting everything out. I said that I liked how it sorted all that out at the end, to get ready for the next movie. I think it was a Batman movie, and I was glad that it didn't suck as much as The Dark Knight.
