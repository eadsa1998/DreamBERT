A man asks me to go get the record books so he can write in something that isn't true. I say, "No. I will not help you cheat and lie." He says that I'm not a good woman. Other women do what their man says. I say, "Do you mean you think being unladylike is worse than helping you cheat and lie?" I was shocked and didn't believe it myself. I was surprised he could believe that.
