I'm asleep on my tummy in a one room apartment. It's night. Ginny comes in and she's just arrived from San Francisco. She lays down on top of me and hugs me. I'm really glad she's back. I am aware of tenderness and sexual excitement. She slides her arms around my breasts. I feel repelled and then decide I want her. I turn. She takes her clothes off. I lay on top of her and feel exquisite tenderness, love and sexual desire. We caress and kiss one another. I am making love to her. I want her to feel good. Her enjoyment heightens my enjoyment. It's all in the first tentative stages, desire and need are strong, and then something stops it, or it just stops and I'm feeling the cats jump on the bed and curling up to sleep. I sense her 2 boys in the background somewhere (I wake up amazed at how real all of that felt).
