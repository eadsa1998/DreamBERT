I was walking between 105th and 107th on Euclid Ave. with a fraternity brother of the same age as mine. I had a blue sweater on; he was wearing a gray sweater. I cannot remember which of my fraternity brothers it was, however as we were walking along, in a rather silly mood, a large woman of 55 approached us from the opposite direction. She was wearing high heels and a brown suit, the jacket of which appeared too small for her enormous bust line. She had deep lines in her forehead and around her mouth and wore too much make up. This friend and I both saw her simultaneously and let out a giggle. We felt embarrassed. I did anyway, and hurried past her to look back and begin laughing once again. There were many people on the sidewalks. The next instant I was at my girl's apartment sitting next to her on a sofa. I exclaim, "Oh honey. You should have seen the enormous woman I saw today." There was no color.
