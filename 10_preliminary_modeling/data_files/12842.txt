We had an excursion and were at this amusement park. We were sleeping and Calvin put something of Eugene's on top of me. Elijah and Seamus got me to sign this branch thing. Adelynn found all these 'smelly' things. I could smell all of these things with my mouth open. One of the things was really stinky, but I was too excited that I could smell it and I didn't care. This dog had to find these two cookies (by smelling). He found them and ate them. Then I was at this place with a bunch of other people. Adelynn asked "Who 'did' A Clockwork Orange?". Elijah put his hand up, so I did. A bus came. I had stuff hanging off the edge of this 'ledge' (it had logs across it). This girl pushed my stuff off so I picked her up and threw her off, but she was ok. Eugene came to do whatever the activity was with the branch, but all the spots had been taken. I wasn't allowed to eat McDonald's. Dad talked to Tiana on MSN and they talked about Spongebob.
