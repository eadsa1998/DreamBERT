Now I'm being a guest DJ in KLAC in E City and nothing goes right! The record player won't work, the tapes are missing, things fall off or are lost. I'm talking and explaining all the while so there will not be any "dead air space." I tell them how I was at Dover at a Mobility International conference and had ghosts in my bath, ghosts taking MY bath! I couldn't say the word "bath" correctly. It was more like Napt. Charla comes in and loudly talks. I try to shush her.
