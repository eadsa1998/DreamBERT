Mary and I are walking through the streets of what appears to be Tel Aviv. We are having quite an animated discussion about pregnancy and genetically inherited physical factors/ characteristics. I am making quite a strong argument for what I think runs counter to Mary's viewpoint/ comments. But, in fact, I'm just repeating exactly what Mary is saying. Mary looks terrific -- as she had before she became ill.
