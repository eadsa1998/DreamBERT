I'm in a public playground, except it's not for young kids, but older kids and adults. It's like a mini football pitch surrounded on all sides by high walls - possibly made of steel - as if we're in a ship. The games seem to be semi-organised. One of them seems to be 'penalties' - ie someone stands in goal, and someone puts the ball on a spot and shoots. The atmosphere is nasty - as if on a rough estate. The other players are rough kids and their dads. My brother and I take them on as best we can. It almost ghettos violent, however we avoid escalating the situation.
