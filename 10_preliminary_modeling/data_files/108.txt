I'm driving a car, going into town on a road,there's some structure nearby overhead, and this may be a bridge. I'm by myself, got business somewhere, on my way. Not anxious or excited or up or down, just okay all the way around. Daytime, sky's a trifle overcast, weather calm. I'm in a train or bus station (about where Union Station really is) looking at a display of Dad watches. I intend to choose one but haven't decided. They're mostly all alike, large faces, maybe oval, with wide, colorful bands, some bright solids, some flowery patterns and plaids. [They remind me of the new shorts I've got, especially the pink and black flowered ones.] This is not a crucial matter, but I'd like to get it out of the way so I can get on with my business, and I am taking rather longer than I thought to decide. I can't actually see other people from here, though I'm aware there are some around. The display rack is sort of tucked in a corner, this is rather a tired little excuse for a station gift shop.
