I was at a gas station near the viaduct bridge in Akron asking to have a tire repaired. (I was riding a bicycle.) The tube shrank up into a piece of rubber like the end of an air pump. The attendant was showing me the puncture. The next thing I knew the attendant was a girl and she began questioning who I was. I told her I had lived in that neighborhood all my life. After a while she recalled having seen me before. She fixed the tube. All the while I was anxious to leave. One of my buddies had just bought a car and he had given me the keys. I was anxious to take a ride. I left the girl quite abruptly and found the car where it was left for me, but I couldn't get in to drive it.
