This fellow and I were walking arm and arm thru the parking lot of a Greensurgh hotel. The entrance faces the lot and we walked straight by it, but a considerable distance. I could see a woman scrubbing the floor of the vestibule. I was quite shocked to discover that it was my mother. This fellow never met my mother so I thought of introducing them. Of course, he had no idea that that woman was she. I doubt that he even noticed her. As we walked by two conflicting thoughts passed thru my mind. I will introduce them. I won't introduce them. It turned out that I didn't. At this point when it was already too late to do anything about it, I was furious at myself for not having done so.
