As you could probably tell, I've got this snotty nose you would not believe. [laugh] Anybody listening to this tape would not want to listen to it. Last night I had a dream about Christmas. I dreamt that it was Christmas already, and we were up in Jackson visiting Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt. [blows nose] Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt had moved to a new place and it was a big, huge place in northern New York, kind of an old rural area. And they had this big living room that they were going to have a Christmas party in. It was like half the size of the Coliseum. It was like the banquet hall at the Wyndham Hotel where we had our Spanish conference banquet and dance in. There were three Christmas trees at this widthwise end. [blows nose], and I asked Mom to show me how to turn them on, turn the lights on, and she said they weren't even decorated yet. And people were starting to come and we took Aunt Christine and Uncle Burt and Granny was still alive at the time, and we went outside to see the waterfall on the river that ran by their house, and we saw a waterfall that she called Luria Fall. And then I woke up.
