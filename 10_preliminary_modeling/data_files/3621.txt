I am in a hospital getting blood, or giving it, with maybe a surgery coming up. I am in a hospital corridor looking for the elevator. A woman comes up and introduces herself. Apparently I know her. She asks me if I will go see Santa Claus. I say, "Oh, maybe." I look down over the railing at the Santa surrounded by kids. He smiles up at me in an inviting way. I then start to go around the corner to find the stairs. Howard comes up and asks to borrow my glasses. I give my second pair. I am now wearing a Santa suit, a round ball for a fat belly. The jacket is open. I am walking down the stairs and kids look at me. I close the jacket. I go around the corner and find the line for Santa. Howard comes back up after the Santa thing. I need some glasses and he offers his to me. I laugh, saying, "I'll try but I won't be able to see anything," since his prescription is worse than mine. I look at them before I put them on and am surprised to see they are one huge lens, not two. I put them on and can see just fine. I tell him I like his better, because mine are trifocals and hard to see out of. A man watches, friendly like.
