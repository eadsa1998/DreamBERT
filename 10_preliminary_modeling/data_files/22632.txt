Then I dreamt that I was in my school with my old teachers, and all the students and teachers were on the roof of the school instead of being in the schoolyard, but the roof was rather peculiar since it had all along it three rows of elevations which were shaped like seats. But afterwards I wasn't on the roof, but in the yard, because I saw a huge wave that was coming towards us. It was as though we were close to the sea and it was coming out. But the school is not near the sea, and the wave that was going to cover us was advancing rapidly and it was about 20 feet high. Here it seems that I woke up in the morning.
