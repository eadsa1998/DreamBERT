I was playing a game. I turned into a rat and went through the sewer line. The level I was at allowed me to build a place where all the sewers would link up. I built a pet shop (which was a cover). Then I was a rat again and I hid in a 'doghouse' at my boyfriend's house and he came to say hi. I can't remember why I had to hide.
