I was driving in my car, from the backseat. I was having trouble seeing. I'm driving too fast. At the last minute I see that there has been a terrible accident and I see that there's all kinds of emergency vehicles. I slam on my brakes and I swerve way off the road. I'm trying to avoid hitting all of these vehicles. I'm expecting these emergency workers to get really angry with me. But it was almost as if no one even noticed because they were so busy taking care of the accident. I went ahead and tried to drive around the vehicles. I did drive around some of the vehicles that were parked there. I got around them. I think I backtracked. I had a very deja vu feeling to it. while I was still in the dream. I felt that I had either been there and done that before or maybe the feeling that I had dreamt it before.
