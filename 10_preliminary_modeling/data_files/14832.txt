I was at the train station. Madelyn and I were hanging out. There were two queues and one was huge and the other one was small, but you needed lots of cash. I waited for Mom in the line (there were four people in front of me). She finally came. I think Mom didn't want me hanging with Madelyn. I said that she used to hang with me and Calvin. I had lost more weight.
