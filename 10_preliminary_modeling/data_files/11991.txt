I was 'watching' my dream with someone from school. I already knew what happened and I didn't want anyone else watching but they had to for some reason. Anyway, in this 'dream', Jayson and I were going out and we were making out or something. He got up and went somewhere. Later, I got up and chased Mittens down this hall and I discovered that he was in this room. That was the end of the 'dream'.
