I could not hide under a ledge. There was no room for me. I crawled on and ended up under the bed. It was in a neat, shiny house. The floors were quite polished. The "animal" was now an ape. He tried to snatch my feet from under the bed and eat them. He left periodically, and I was able to "boost" my companions through the window to safety. He came back and closed the window so it would be harder for me to get out. Ape left and returned with friend who was a man. They decided to let me get away. I woke up.
