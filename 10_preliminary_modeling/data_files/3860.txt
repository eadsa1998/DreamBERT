["Making Masks."] I am sort of working for a movie company. I am trying to get on there, so I volunteer to do things. A very busy harried woman is in charge. She has been given the order to create an unusual bit for this part of the movie. She is stretched beyond her limits and can't seem to think of a way to do that. She is trying to create a mask. I try to help her. At first, it isn't working at all. I am trying to crochet a row out of a waxy candle like material. It keeps crumbling. I then get the idea to curve the mask to the shape of a face, more pointed and narrow at the base, like the chin. I try decreasing stitches and then for the next row to increase stitches. It is still difficult but is working better. The cotton thread is coarse and very black. Somewhere in this dream, Howard is seated on a bench right by me, companionably hanging out with me. It was a friendly feeling. Now the boss wants the woman to create a whole new little scene to put in the movie. She can't come up with an idea. I have one but she isn't listening to me. I'm just an "extra."
