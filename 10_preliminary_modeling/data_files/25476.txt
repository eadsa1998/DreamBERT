 I'm in Rock Village with my mom and my sister Ramona. We're going ice fishing. We stop to get bait. I go up to two old men in a shack-like place. I buy worms and leeches. The bait comes with two stunned fish. The containers of bait are in the mouths of the fish. The men tell me the fish aren't dead, and I should let them go. One in ten of these stunned fish will live. We leave, and I realize we don't have an ice auger. I look in back of the car for things that we could use to make a hole in the ice. There is a hammer, a crow bar, and some metal rods. I decide these things would work. <br/
