 I'm at a dance club that has the atmosphere of Big Dance Club. I see Amy Kunkel. She talks to me and tells me this has become her hang out. Prince either owns the club or is there. I go out of the club and see some neatly trimmed bushes. They have a reddish-purple veil covering them. One of the bushes looks like a big Afro. I pull this veil off the bushes and scrunch it up into a little ball about the size of a cantaloupe and put it to my nose, inhaling deeply. It smells a little bit like raspberries. It is the color of raspberry. It is Prince's veil. <br/
