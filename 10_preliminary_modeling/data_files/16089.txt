Mom and I wanted to take a walk, and we were going to bring the personal CD player along with the hand-held portable radio in order to listen to what the boats were doing out in the water. We were going to walk down to the waterfront. And we started walking and I got lost, and I just sat down and listened to the personal CD player. But when I was listening to it, the sound stung for some reason. And then we were riding around in somebody's Fox 13 truck and it had a siren on it. And I had to stay like five feet away until they deactivated it. Another one that I had was that we were looking in Service Merchandise for a cell phone, and the cell phone that was supposed to be, it could, it was like a FM receiver or a hand-held thing. It really wasn't a phone at all. It had three little knobs on it, it had a little display and an internal speaker. The sound was really thin and flat, though, but for some reason we were all fascinated by it. The next thing I know, we were walking In the park with this thing clipped to my belt.
