I was in front of the house.  There was a tall man wearing a velvet cloak.  Touching him made one man who looked somewhat slovenly into a green suit, so he looked like a superhero.  Something about this strange man or his cloak was somehow magical and touching him improved things.  My brother Stuart got to touch him as something went on.  I really wanted to touch him as well, but I was self-conscious about coming off rude, fulfilling my own needs without respect for the man.  He was in the process of something and I got to barely brush my hand against the velvet cloak while his back was turned.  The feeling was amazing; reenergizing and blissful.  Then there were three cats in a pool.  Somehow the cloaked man had touched the pool, and apparently the magical effect had transferred to the pool.  The cats were addicted to the sensation and wouldn't get out of the pool.  I reached in and pulled one out before it drowned.  The tall, cloaked figure spoke to me; he asked me if I had gotten to touch him yet, offering.  I said no not really, so I could touch him again and feel the wonderful sensation, even though I knew that it wouldn't have the same transforming effect the first touch had.
