We were about a block away from our home and someone said our house was on fire. We ran over to it and it was just lit up inside from the furnace, so we went back to where we were before. A little later someone said, "Look at your home." I looked and it seemed to be red hot inside. Frank Lasko as with me. We held hands and ran for our home. On the way I yelled at the people along the way to call the fire department. When we got near the house, it seemed to be red hot. The walls were. I got our garden hose and watered the walls. There was no flame, just they were red hot like a piece of charcoal when it is red hot. The dog was inside barking. He was afraid of the heat. I could feel the heat when I was inside watering the walls. They cooled off and turned back to normal color as I sprinkled them.
