 I am at my friend Holly Lapson's house. There are others there, and we are drinking. I drink six or seven beers, and am buzzing. I act kind of silly. Holly doesn't want to drive anywhere with me in the car. She thinks we'll get caught. Her friend Shelly Mac is there, and has a can of the soda Squirt. I have a can of orange juice. Shelly has a glass that I pour some of my orange juice in because she doesn't want Squirt Light. I spill a bit. Holly is mad that I spilled the juice. The room is pretty dark, and Holly is wiping up the few spilled drops of juice off the carpet between my outstretched legs. We decide to leave. People go out to my mom's station wagon. Holly is frying bacon and has something baking in the oven on low heat. Two men come in the back door at my home. They are Holly's uncles. Holly has left her food cooking and is in the car. I think I'll leave the food, and the two uncles will take care of it if need be. I go out to the car. There are a lot of people in it. I sit in the front seat with my friend Stephen Ramos. Holly drives.
