Ezra worked at this place next to a shop with clothes, so Mom often went there. I was somewhere at night and walked home. I was on Wanneroo Road next to Fieldgate shops and there was a speed camera and a booze bus after the turn off. The street was dark and I started to run. I was at a park and I could hear music coming from home -- my kind of music. A trailer was in the way. Mom yelled out asking if there was a guy out there and I said 'no, I'm trapped'. Eventually I got in. She was on some site which had old music playing and they were playing Mr Lee by The Bobbettes.
