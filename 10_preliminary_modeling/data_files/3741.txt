The first moment I laid eyes on this white, large, two-story house, I loved it. The woman who owns it says she'll sell it to me and I can move in right now and we'll do the papers later. I and my daughters start to move in. Each can have their own bedroom, the outside lawn is spacious and pretty, the rooms large and comfortable. I begin to be concerned because I haven't even asked how much for the house and if I will qualify for a bank loan for that amount. I am tired of living in my cramped little house, but it was the best I could afford. This will be much more. I see the short, almost midget-sized woman who owns it and go to her. I say, "I want to talk about the details before I get all moved in and then have to leave." She is busy driving a tractor towing a cart and I follow her, talking all the while. She smiles and wants to know what that other woman said about her. I say, "Nothing much." I didn't really listen. She says, "Good. Don't worry. We'll make a deal." She wants me to have the house. [BL]
