I was at work. Someone found a head in a pipe. I cleaned out the pipe one day and found two more. I hit an emergency button but not 'worry'. Later, I went to check if I had calls in the office. I said to Ezra that I found two heads and he said he'd call back. There was a guy called Roy Wyatt. Gob (Arrested Development) was on a motorbike and I said "you should wear thicker pants". He laughed and then he took off altogether? I picked him up, and I can't read the rest of what I said. Then I went inside.
