I had a dream that I was riding in a train on a dirt road. The train had no roof. When the train stopped I got out and saw desks with typewriters, telephones and computers on top of them. People were sitting at these desks and looked very busy. Then I turned around and I saw Roman Brady who is now John Black on the soap opera, Days of our Lives. He came over and started talking to me. Then I was just roaming around and I bumped into all my friends and my ex-boyfriend's friends. My ex-boyfriend was not there. Once I bumped into them I could feel myself getting very upset and angry. They started to tell me what my ex-boyfriend was up to. I can't remember exactly what was said, but I do know that it made me cry. My friends and my family were there and they tried to calm me down. This all took place in my grandmother's backyard. After I stopped crying, I went over to the swings and began to play on the jungle gym and play on the swings. The funny part about that is that my grandmother hasn't had a swing set in her yard for about 10 or 12 years now. She had the swings when I was a little girl. Also in my dream while I was playing on the swings there was no pool in the yard, and my grandmother has had a pool since I was either 12 or 13 and I am now 21.
