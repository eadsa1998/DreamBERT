Frieda was visiting me. Oh no, first I dreamt that I was at this play at school, in the school auditorium, or it looked a little different. The sound booth was like under the floor of the balcony, and it was between the mezzanine and the ground, and it was like under the floor of the balcony. And the window was like out. And there was another sound booth backstage, and this girl that I know -- supposedly it was Carol -- was showing me how to get to the sound booth, and the one in the floor of the mezzanine, you had this little trap door that you take off the side of the wall, and there was this little crawl space that I could barely fit through, that someone a big, fat sound technician was supposed to slither through and go up to the booth and then lay down in this little space and they'd do the mixing. And I thought I am claustrophobic and I would never make it up there. And the sound booth backstage was easy, just open a door and go in. And then I dreamt that Mom and I were in the kitchen and we were playing the "Wee Sing" tape and we were dancing to Bluebird and we like did a slow dance to it. And then Carol was over, and there were these roses that I wanted to give to her and I left in the bright sun and they were all wilted by the time I gave them to her. And that's all there is to that.
