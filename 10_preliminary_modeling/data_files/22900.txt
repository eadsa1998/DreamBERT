I was back at the agency again.  I had been on leave and was just returning before leaving for good, so I had a badge this time.  Everyone was surprised to see me, though, because they thought I had left for good.  I asked Aaron Hamilton what he was working on, and he didn't really answer-he just joked about it with some of the other guys in rather cryptic terms, and I resented it.  I thought I would have some coffee, but the whole coffee setup was different, and I didn't have my mug anyway-though there was a mug which looked like mine but belonged to someone else.  Bill Clay came by on his way to lunch: he didn't seem particularly surprised to see me, and he didn't invite me to go along.  My feelings were hurt by this.  I got ready to leave and noticed that I was wearing pajamas.  I felt very embarrassed; I couldn't imagine how this could have happened and began to wonder how I could bear to walk all the way back to the gatehouse that way.  But no one in the office seemed to notice it.
