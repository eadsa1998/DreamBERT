I dreamed I was at my house one morning when the T.V. repairman came. Apparently I was outside in the carport when I heard the repairman fussing about something that my mother did wrong (as he was talking to my mother), which caused the T.V. not to work. When I heard him telling my mother these complaints, I came in from the carport and told him, "Listen, your job is just to fix the T.V. so why don't you just fix it and quit complaining." I seemed a bit angered at his telling my mother what she did wrong.
