Some woman of our family invited two or three of us to a show in the city at 9 p.m. We leave at 9 p.m. We will be late for we should leave in time to get there at 9 p.m. Mar. (my niece) will meet us there. "Didn't you hear the phone?" "No," I answer. "Are you ready to go?" "Soon as I put on my shoes and dress." I can't find my white dress. "Do either of you have it in your closet?" "No." "Well, I'll look no longer but wear my green one." I get it from the closet. Feel urge to urinate. Perhaps I'd better go first.
