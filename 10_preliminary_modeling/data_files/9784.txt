Our house is all torn up and being replastered. - Lots of changes; Frank took over and had it done while we were away: large new room being plastered; and red-brown mud on the outside of house; Marissa comes by: there is no place to sit; see new desk and telephone; ask Frank where he got it; lots of confusion. Frank explains carefully what he has been planning. - Marissa goes to buy two bars of soap for the boys. (!) I see Donna (my sponsor) on a bicycle and then she returns, while a dark storm threatens: see LIGHTNING in dark sky: I talk on phone and then sweep up some Sheik (rubbers) on floor.
