I was on an upstairs floor of a house with my mother. Men were downstairs redecorating the rooms. They had moved the furniture on the floor where we were standing. The floor overlooked the first floor like a balcony. But there was no railing. The floor was slanting toward the downstairs floor. A radio console started rolling down the incline. I stopped it and I removed the wheels to keep it from rolling again. Later I had to urinate and there was no place to go. Someone told me to go to a folding chair and urinate on the seat. A man was standing behind the chair as I did so, and he was annoyed at me for doing it.
