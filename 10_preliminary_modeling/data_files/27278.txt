I was out in a large pond behind my real home. We were pouring plaster of paris in the lake (or pond) from our small rowboat, in an attempt to hasten the freezing over. Finally we realized that even though the water was completely full of plaster of paris, there would still be difficulties - for before my eyes, the water became brown cement. Buildings were still protruding thru the cement, a white church steeple and the ridge pole of a garage. In addition, the wind was blowing, and so the cement was too uneven to skate on.
