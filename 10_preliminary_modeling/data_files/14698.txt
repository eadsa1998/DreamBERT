Mom and I went to a shop. There was a light yellow dress and it was really gross. There were ugly jumpers. There were some flowery shirts and Mom asked why I didn't wear something more presentable, such as the flowery shirts. I said "Do you know, every shirt you like has flowers?" A friend of hers got a genie with unlimited wishes. There were magazines and books about Twilight nearby. Mom's friend wanted me to look in the magazines to find out how Katie Holmes' did her hair. Mom's friend spilled something and summoned the genie to clean it up. I was talking to it and said that my guess is that most people wish for the "person they like, money and beauty". Then I was trying to get off the train but it didn't stay open for very long. I got out and I was inside and had to walk up an escalator but I went the wrong way and had to go down and walk back again.
