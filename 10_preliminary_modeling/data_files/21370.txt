I was at the race track and watched the first race run, but I don't remember the winner. All 8 races were run, but I didn't play any of them and can't recall any of them. Harwood won a new car and was going to give me a ride in it. I was a guard and there were so many rowdies and gangsters that I had to retreat because they took shots at me and were closing in on me. I was in one of the stores and a clerk who worked at night had the cash register full of money. He took out the drawer and was going to have a small kid count his money. The boy wanted to know how much he was going to get for his work, and I said one pile. I meant one pile of pennies, but he couldn't understand. I heard 5 in the 5th and then I saw 5 men in shorts, which illustrated 5 + 5 and the center man had designs on his body. Charley C. and I were talking about the races. I was trying to explain something and he was laughing and kidding. I said, "If you feel that way about it, I will stop talking."
