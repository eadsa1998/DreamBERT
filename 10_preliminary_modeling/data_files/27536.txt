I dreamt that I entered a sedste gathering of church people and relatives clad in pink pajamas and generally disarrayed, as if I had just gotten out of bed. I dashed to a little powder room, where I combed my hair and returned to the gathering. I was aware that had a Sunday school class to teach. When I entered the Sunday School room, someone else had taken over. I was very grateful and looked at my watch. We only had about five more minutes before dismissal.
