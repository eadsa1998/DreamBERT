Earl is at our house and arrives wearing heavy winter clothes; we wait for his kids to arrive and when I look outside I see snow on the steps, but no footprints; Earl comes in with a violin case lined in blue velvet. He is very proud of his violin. He has also brought a Whopper and we eat and talk and plan a trip to the Retreat Center.
