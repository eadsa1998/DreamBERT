I had talked to Dr. Pf's nurse on the phone. After we finished talking and she was going to talk to Dr. Pf and get back to me. However she realized that he was gone for the day so she decided to ask his partner instead of waiting until the next day and asking him. He just instructed her to tell me that there was nothing they could do to help me.
