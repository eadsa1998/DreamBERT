I was at the SAID conference attending some workshops. I also presented one. One of the dreams that I shared was the one about being murdered. Later, at another one I was presenting, Sally R was there. At the end she was saying how frustrating it is not to interpret, then she mentioned my dream and some of the images. I said, That's exactly why it's so important not to interpret or to project your interpretations on to someone else. She said, Yeah. I know. But I'd like to know what that's about. I told her that for me, in this case, some of it is about the fact that I have the tendency to murder myself everyday mentally and emotionally and that I'm at risk for doing that because I am very hard on myself. There was also something about conference next year and I was debating about whether or not I was going to be able to go.
