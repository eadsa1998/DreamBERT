A young man whom I don't recognize comes to the Book Cafe and tells me he left the priesthood. "Why?" he doesn't tell me and I wonder if it is because he is gay. Then I walk out in the dark and am a bit scared until I see a light in a window. I go in and am told I have a room upstairs; when I go in it has two beds and the "roommate" comes in wearing a shower cap (a young man or woman?) I go back downstairs and am told that I have a place in a nice apartment house nearby. Vague ending.
