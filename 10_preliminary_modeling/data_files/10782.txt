I dreamed of 2 girls (I know them personally and always think of them together) both dressed exactly alike. They were beautiful silver-white fur coats which I liked very much. Both were very dressed up, and I remember especially that they wore light blue dresses. We were at a lakeshore. Some older person (a woman) of authority was there. She may have been a teacher. Other young people were there too, but I can't remember who they were. We went out upon the water and went fishing, being quite successful and catching quite a few. I remember that I couldn't understand why the two girls were dressed up for such an occasion. I remember that the weather was fine that day--a blue sky and a bright sun, but it was a little cold.
