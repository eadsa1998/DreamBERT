I was driving a car in a parking lot. It had places that were blocked so you couldn't drive through. I saw one vehicle going out another way. At first I was going to try to get out a different way. Then I realized that the other way was either the best way or the way you were supposed to get out or maybe the only way. I finally headed that way to get out onto the road. It was almost as though the road was a country road. It had been raining a lot. The rain had broken out the pavement. On the other side of the road there was a stream but because it had rained so hard the stream had broken through the pavement and continued across the road into this parking lot. I was driving through this parking lot to get to a place where I could pull out onto the road. There were big breaks in the pavement where this stream had broken through. I tried to also avoid these very large potholes and places where the pavement seemed to be buckled and piled up. As I was sitting and waiting to pull out, it must have been dusk because the cars had their lights on. The driver in the car behind me was becoming very impatient. There was a lot of traffic. I was going to be turning left so I was waiting for an opening large enough for me to be comfortable pulling out. Finally, because of the car behind me, I always get worried that they are getting mad at me if I take too long to pull out, so I finally just took a chance and pulled out very fast. I did make it okay and didn't cause or get in an accident.
