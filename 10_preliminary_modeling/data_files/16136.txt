We were at the park with the boom box and Mom, we were playing with Celine Dion's CD and we took it out for some reason and [laugh] Mom stepped on it and cracked it. And she said, "She was beautiful, but now she's cracked." And the case and the CD were both cracked. And then we were running around the lake and we were playing a tape in this tape player that I'm using right now, and it's just this little thing about twice the size of the palm of my hand and it has a little strap on the side of it. But in my dream it had a much longer strap that would go over my shoulder, and I had it over my shoulder and I was running with it. And it was playing something; I don't remember what. And then I kind of woke up.
