 I'm at a concert at the Franklin Arena with two people. We go to our seats. The band Portishead is playing. The singer is a man. We're late, and have missed the two opening bands. That doesn't matter because we just wanted to see the main band. We move from the left side near the stage to the far side in the B section. These are our seats, and they're poor, cheap seats. T-shirts are for sale. I don't want to sit in our shitty seats. An usher woman asks us if we're in section B. I try to avoid her, to avoid moving seats.
