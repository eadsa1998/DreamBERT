I was trying to reach the Cariagas. They lived on M. Road. I had difficulty in finding way. Misdirected to Ala Moana. Knew that wasn't right. Had forgotten street number but knew I should start north to reach street. ... I had been to a meeting, invited to early supper with a friend. Ate there but had to leave for another party to meet friends at a restaurant. Went to the end of Punahou-University busline. Standing there trying to read schedule, a friend came out and showed me how to turn on the light at the side of the house with a wrench. I realized I had forgotten the name of the restaurant and of the friends I was to meet. She tried to help me remember. Then I realize that I had been out for supper without telling the Home.
