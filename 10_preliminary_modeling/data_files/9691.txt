       Zena in bed in the 2nd room; suddenly window and window frame fall away as in an earthquake; I scream "The child, my child." Someone saves her and puts her on a bus; but I get to her and hold her close; very tender feeling. I look to see why it happened. It was an annex that was not structurally too good. <br/
