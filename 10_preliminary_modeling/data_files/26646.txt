 I have a lucid dream. In the dream I have decision-making ability. I may follow something or someone. I'm at or near Armstrong High School. I practice exercising my volition by going through doors. I discriminate and direct people. Ultimately, I control everything. [This is what I dreamed of; that is, I dreamed that I had a lucid dream. I did not actually have the lucid dream. Rather, I dreamed I had it, and experienced these things. All were experienced within the dream.]
