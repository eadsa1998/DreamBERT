There were holes in the ground and puffs of smoke were coming out like smoke signals. I went underground to see the boys doing it, but the meeting was over. I picked up a carpet and ran out with it. One of the boys saw me. He yelled at the other boys, but before they could come out, I was gone. There were police with clubs. They were using sticks to chase out a yellow snake that was mean. I had a stick, but I noticed I was barefooted, so I just stayed out of the grass. There was a reunion of women who came to our house, and they walked thru our house in sort of a singing and praying march. We were at the cemetery and it was freshly dug and covered. Marie Lasko was to have been buried beside George and Michael. I was out pheasant hunting, and it was only a stick in my hand, so then I picked up a repeater shotgun and blasted at the pheasants.
