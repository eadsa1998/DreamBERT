We have guests and when we return home there are TREE CUTTERS who are cutting down 2 trees in front of our house. I cry a little but can't understand why everything looks so different. I see an address in gold numbers: 40-31st and someone says: "that's the backside of your block." I am very relieved. I run home and see all four luscious green trees still standing intact. I am very happy. I feel thirsty. I offer our guests a guiness drink.
