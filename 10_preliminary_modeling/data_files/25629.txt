 There is a funeral for me. I am dying. I'm outside Carter Church in Oak Valley waiting, wearing a black tuxedo or suit. People arrive, including my friend Mark Long and his family, and my family. I smile and try to be brave. I say, "It is a good day to die." My neighbors Mary and Kent Robbins are there. I see quite a few cars. There is a black hearse on the south side of church. I hug my sister Heather when she gets out of the car. I walk into church with my family. The Robbins' go home. I think it is okay that they do. I am surprised they even showed up in the first place! Kent was wearing a turquoise sweater. We walk in the south door of the church and find a place to sit near the back on the left side. I say to my mom I don't want to have this funeral if I am still living: I want to be dead first. I feel pretty good, not like I am dying. The minister is there. I raise my hand and walk forward to the front of the church to speak. I am going to speak to the congregation. I feel very strongly that I don't want to have a funeral if I'm not dead.
