When Y2K hit a nuclear war would be the result. On the radio they said that there was a possibility grocery stores would be closed for one day for WW III. They suggested getting some water and I decided on 2 gallons. I couldn't wait to go select my 2 gallons, and I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to get a box of spaghetti to go with the water because it keeps good and you have to boil water anyway during emergencies. Wheeling the cart around, I decided that having a box of Cornflakes would make WW III more enjoyable. So I put it (the box) in the cart. Since it might very well be our last day on earth I decided, I felt like, a soda sure would taste good, and I called Sidney to see if he'd like a soda too, and he met me at the store which also sold used tape players. I said, "Sidney, this is just what I need. How much is it?" He said, "One is $3.00 and one is $4.00. Do you like the big one or the little one?" And I chose the little one but I forgot to pay and didn't realize it till I got home. My mother stopped at the buffet table and sent me to pick out 1 1/2 dozen eggs and I could NOT find a carton that wasn't full of broken eggs. There were regular and extra-L(Large) eggs. One carton I found had flawless eggs, but when I touched one with my index finger, all 18 broke in unison.
