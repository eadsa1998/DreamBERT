 I'm riding my friend Bubba Hacker's motorcycle. I'm headed out to County Store, outside of Oak Valley. The motorcycle will only go about 55 miles per hour, like there is a governor on it. It is Saturday night. Country Store is closed when I arrive. There is a man who gets reprimanded by his boss regarding something about nuclear power. At one point the man asks, "Is there something wrong with that?"
