It seems like there was some kind of event going on. I am sitting bareback on a horse, standing in what might serve as an aisle. On either side of me there are a lot of people, I think sitting in chairs. I was trying to leave but couldn't get my horse to go. I looked down and saw that the horse was standing in several inches of water and was drinking the water. I pulled the reins to get his head up but he just jerked away and went back to drinking. I wondered if the horse was ill because he was drinking so much water. I finally got the horse to move and go a few feet and then Bill C came up and stopped us. He wanted me to take him where he was going. I moved forward a bit so he could get on behind me. I noticed how it felt to have him sitting there, against me. It felt comfortable and safe. We only went a few feet and stopped because Bill C didn't feel that it was working. He got off and told me to move up a little further. He got back on and we tried again. That still didn't work so this time he got off and then got on in front of me, telling me to lean in against him and wrap my arms around him to hold on.
