I had my Biology exam. I was like "What the hell?". I hadn't studied. Mathea didn't know about it either. We both went over our notes. Ms Solomon came in and we suggested that we do it tomorrow. Ezra and Nicolas walked past. Mom picked Ezra, Mathea and I up. We went through this tunnel and the lights went out. There was a burglar and Mathea disappeared. We stopped somewhere and Clayton was with us. Mom drove off without me and I was left at this creepy motel. Mom came back and it was 2.44pm.
