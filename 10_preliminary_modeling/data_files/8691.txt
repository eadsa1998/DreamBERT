People I can't identify. Decided to ride two or three things. Someone left the group and got on a ride. Everyone else followed. I got separated from the group and was upset that I didn't get to go. Walking to another ride with the whole group. Explaining to Daddy about one of the rides. Before we finished explaining he got on this slide leading to a hard-plaster, round, children's pool not knowing that the slide would land him there and in water. He went down and completely under water. He came up right away. Of course he was completely soaked. He had on a white shirt and tie. Two of us quickly wrapped him in two blankets. We had him sit in a red wagon that we had with us. He barely fit and sat with his knees to his chest.
