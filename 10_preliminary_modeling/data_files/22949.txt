I was at a meeting, a performance, or some other kind of large audience-type gathering, in an auditorium or fellowship hall.  Kent Heudson and some other GI's from the agency were there.  Kent and I especially had been kidding each other, but I was embarrassed when he cut up out loud and called attention to us while the proceedings were going on.  Afterwards I realized that he had hidden my tiki (the one my wife Bonita brought back from Hawaii), and I was twisting his arm, along with that of one of his confederates, to make them tell me where it was.  I was rather serious about it, because it was time for me to leave, but his arm was so flexible and limber that I couldn't hurt him very much.  Audrey Sturgeon was nearby, and I guess I thought she was in on it, because I got mad and pulled the top of her dress down to her waist.  She was wearing a slip.  Later I went up to her and apologized and tried to kiss her, but she was still mad and wouldn't let me.  Apparently many of us had changed clothes there, because she was looking for her black dress and couldn't find it before leaving.  When I went into one of the dressing rooms or bathrooms to get my stuff, her dress and shoes were in there, and I hoped I could take them to her and redeem myself, but she had gone.  I had been wearing my dress green uniform, and when I put the jacket back on I noticed that the rank insignia were missing, as was the US and the branch insignia.  Actually, they were all in a little pile.  There were other officers -- higher ranking -- nearby, and I was afraid they would see me that way and embarrassed that they might have seen me like that when I came in.  At this point I was getting dressed in a wire mesh locker room.  When I got ready to leave the place, I ran into Rhonda Addilio at the door.  I told her I was embarrassed to admit it, but that Bonita and I had been in Rome a few months before, but just hadn't had time to call her.  She seemed to understand (or not to care).  <p
