Invited to J. and his wife in B. City. (J. had been my lover before I left). Party with lots of people. J. comes to say goodbye to travel to the mountains for a few days. He puts on his hat and comes over and kisses me warmly on the mouth. I nearly faint. Then I go out to the car where he is standing and I run over to him, trembling: "So who had tears in their eyes? Go on, adore me, but for God's sake don't show it." Then under his breath: "I'll be back. This is a maneuver. We will manage somehow to get together." See green leaves on lawn.
