I was swapping 'my' room around. I was moving the bed, which was basically the only thing in there. In the rest of the house there was Dawn of the Dead orig. zombies everywhere. I was going about killing them. I think David Mathew was in this dream too. I think I was trapping some zombies in cages. I also think I had a boyfriend or some romantic relationship with someone.
