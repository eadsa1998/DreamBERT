I was working for Bill C to cover the phones mostly, while Jennifer C was out. We seemed to be working out of a house. In two different rooms there were coffee cups with pens and pencils in them. They were almost too full to get a pen or pencil back in once you took it out. I saw that there were quite a few unsharpened, yellow, number 2 pencils in each one. I took all of those out and put them in a drawer to make the pens and pencils in the cups easier to grab and to put back. Bill C had a television commercial produced. When he came back we were talking about it. He said he got to touch the cameras. I repeated this as a question, with lots of excitement in my voice, because I knew he probably really enjoyed that. He smiled, nodded his head, and said yes. I thought this commercial would lead people to believe that this is a much larger company than it is. He was hiring another person to do the same thing as Bryan N. I knew Bryan N wouldn't be happy about this because his ego won't allow him to think someone could be his equal.
