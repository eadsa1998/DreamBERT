A group of people go moving into an old store front in a city. I see several women that I had gone to the lst and 2nd grade with. I've come back to live. Another woman, my brother and I are looking over the apartment. There are lots and lots of rooms, old fashioned furniture. There are lots of pianos, pretty little ones, antiques, huge mirrors, and a leather flat bag. I start to look in it and think, "I don't want to see what's in here." I look anyway. A baby or a cat is in there. It looks at me and glares. I cover it back up. Then I'm at a dance with lots of guys. Then I'm back at the apartment, looking for a room for my bedroom. I knock on a door and say, "I'm coming in." A guy is in there. He's upset. It's his room. I apologize. I've walked into someone else's apartment. This woman and I keep going to other rooms. I'm holding the cat now. I'm in an evening dress. The woman and I find a room. There are gays in there. She lies down. The cat is upset and runs away. I lie down beside her. Her husband, latin or black, holding their baby, stumbles in drunk and lays down on the other side of her. She is annoyed with him. I have a feeling we're going to make love and I feel scared. My brother and my father are wandering around.
