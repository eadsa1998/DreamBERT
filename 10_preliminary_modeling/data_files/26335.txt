 There is German war taking place. A large building containing soldiers and their commanding officers is being heavily bombed. The leader with cracked teeth is shot in the chest, but continues to fight. There is a small pumpkin or photograph of a pumpkin that he is biting onto in the corner of his mouth, with gritted teeth and a wicked grin. He is a crazy soldier. He has a gun that he keeps on firing nonstop after he is shot. He is insane! My housemate Norman Noman and I watch this. We drive or move around the razed building. It is completely destroyed. We figure the building must be dug very deep down into the earth, for the soldiers to survive there. We drive on. The dead are poorly buried in a cemetery. I see a dead black squirrel hanging by a string from a tree. It has been skinned. Its flesh is visible. It seems to be grabbing onto or attached to a dead gray squirrel, which has its fur. I'm with Dana Scully and Fox Moulder from the X-Files. We're in the baby room at the Redding Farm. Scully has been held up with a girl. There is a skinned human being in the room that is visible. I can touch part of it, and I try to grasp it, to see it fully. The body is Scully. I know she was sexually harassed when she was younger. I sit at a piano on the west wall of the room. There is a ghost-like presence in the room. I'm scared. I try to grasp and see the person. I touch what I think is the quadriceps muscle of the person, but I don't see what I touch. Then I see part of figure in a close doorway, which is quickly gone. The figure(s) are in the other doorway by the kitchen, then.
