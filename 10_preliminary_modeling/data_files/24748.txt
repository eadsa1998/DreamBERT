I don't remember all, but I was visiting an old people's home and there was one crazy lady that kept smiling at me through her window. I intended to jump stairs and go every other one but somehow I glided safely to the last. Suddenly on the top stair, I looked at the last stair and there was the crazy lady, dead, in knight's armor, smiling at me. Setting: In an old people's home. Characters: Old wrinkled crazy lady. ME - NORMAL! Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, neutral. I woke up feeling fairly strange.
