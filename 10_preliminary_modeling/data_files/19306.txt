First I was at school in the cafeteria at hip-hop union (after school activity) and I was practicing breakdancing and battling the other people that were there (battling is just going back and forth dancing). I don't remember that much after that but then suddenly I was fighting a real battle against the Germans in the time of WWII and I was fighting with the Russians. The battle was on a muddy battlefield that had two huge walls (brick) on either side. Painted on the walls were the most beautiful colored paintings of Hitler. I walked out into the middle of the battlefield and stared at them. Then suddenly someone grabbed me and brought me toward the enemy's side. After that all I remember was walking toward this evil looking man painted all in black, just waiting for me and staring at me.
