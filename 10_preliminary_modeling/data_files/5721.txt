[1997-05-01] I was walking with my cane and I started to cross the street and a man and a lady started to help me, seemed like one was holding onto each of my arms and as we crossed I kept thinking that the man was getting too close to me, I could feel the front of him bump against me and I thought he's closer than he should be and it kind of repulsed me and I wanted to get away from him. Then, we got across the street and there was some sort of barrier where they were doing some kind of work. There was a wooden plank there and the people who were doing the work said that they had just finished and that they would open it up so I could walk across. They removed the barrier but left the wooden plank there. I walked across, actually along it, it was following a sidewalk. Then I found myself in someone's house who lives in an alley near us, I have no idea who she was. I found myself sitting at her table and I had a bag with me that had 3 peaches in it. I was sitting at her table, eating her peaches and I couldn't believe the size of the seeds in those peaches, they were just huge! I thought; "these can't be peaches, these have to be some other kind of fruit, because the seeds are just way bigger than they should be." And they didn't even taste like peaches, they were more like figs or some other kind of fruit.
