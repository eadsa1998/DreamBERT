A fat Frenchman is lolling in a chair by an office desk -- his big legs stretched out nearly straight. He is dressed only in a shirt which is much like the hospital night gown. Along back of desk is fastened an index system of his own invention, enabling him to find current quotations almost instantly. There are about 3 cards, each bearing a letter of the alphabet, on each vertical rod.
