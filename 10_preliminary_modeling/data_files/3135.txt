I am captured by the bad guys like the 1920's gangsters and held in a huge basement like place in a warehouse. I have a gun. They open the large doorway up on the wall and start shooting down at me and I aim and shoot them. I crawl up and out and run. I get in my car and drive for help. I find some of the fellow factory workers and tell them of the incident and have them call the police and then we decide to go back and set up a raid on them. I get in the back seat. A woman drives. We get there and go in. Three or four trucks follow us to cart back the evidence and stuff in their warehouse. We go in, pretending to be customers, and there is a pile of wood sticks and I hold one in my hand as a weapon. I watch carefully as they go send word for a man to come help the costumers. I signal with my eyes to be careful to the other members of my team. The men come up like in an elevator and open their doors and start shooting machine guns at us. I order us to fire and I spray them with my machine gun. With a sinking feeling I realize we are in danger and could die from their bullets, but I keep seated and shooting back. Finally I drop three of the guys, including one holding a large fiddle or small bass. Then the head bad guy grabs one of ours as a hostage and holds a knife to his throat. I drop the machine gun and hold up a rifle to shoot. I say, "Do you believe he could do it if I dropped him?" Dustin Hoffman says out of the side of his mouth (he sits on my left), "Don't be silly. Of course I believe him." I then hold my fire and we are in another standoff. It wasn't supposed to work this way. I try to think how to get the drop on this guy. It's going to be another scary and long battle.
