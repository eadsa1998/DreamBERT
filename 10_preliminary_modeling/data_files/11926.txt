I was at a two storey house which was my home, I think. Some noob was trying to kill me and some other people and he threw a bomb up onto the balcony. We threw it next door because no-one lived there. Some people from Jackass were there. There were these invisible buildings which you could walk through that sent off signals to the bomb and stuff. There was this train and it almost hit someone but the signal stopped it. I was then at a toy grabbing machine. I wanted a toy they had of me and I had got a toy, some time before, of Dad. There was more to the story, but I don't remember.
