I fell asleep again thinking of the nice dream I had had and I dreamed something different. I dreamed that I and my family were in a strange country. A cousin of mine, who is 22 and who went to Bolivia with us last year, was also there. Anyway, we were lodged in some kind of horrible apartment. It was dirty and we cleaned it with water. There was even blood and it didn't come out. We decided to leave that and return to our country. Coming out of that, we had to go through a labyrinth of dead-end streets, which were dirty and stank (my father, mother, siblings and cousin). We were able to get out of that horrible city and we started to go towards the frontier. Once there (we were in a car), they wouldn't let us through without going through a great deal of red tape that my father had overlooked. At any rate, we had to turn around halfway there and it was nighttime and it was in the country and the road was very narrow. My father suggested that we hide underneath the seats so that if anyone went by, they would only see two people, but one of them was fat. I don't know who she was, but there she was and it was difficult to get her under the seat. We arrived at the border and when we had almost gone through, they stopped us again so that my father would pay a certain sum of money. Then I got furious and jumped out of the car to scream at them and hit these men who were seated behind a table, like judges. They didn't wear uniforms. They were rather old men. I even wanted to hit one of them, and at that moment my dream ended.
