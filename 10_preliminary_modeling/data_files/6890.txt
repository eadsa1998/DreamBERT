She was drinking milk and eating. I suggested ice cream sodas and will get them. What kind does she want? Vanilla and chocolate. She tells me to get money from her purse. I find $1/2 and 4 _'s, take the former and $1/2 of my own and will get a chocolate too. Go to the store, watch the filling of the order and wonder how i can carry back three orders. Ask how much. $5. That's far too much. I won't pay it. I begin to calculate. Three ladies ice cream, 45c, 3 soda pops, 30c and then there's overhead and labor.
