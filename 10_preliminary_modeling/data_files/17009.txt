A band performance is in preparation. I have teamed up with some punks to do a gig. It's a ramshackle arrangement and the organisation is in total disarray. The bass player reminds me of my friend Tyler. He doesn't pull his weight to get anything ready. He just makes sarcastic remarks. I get pissed off and take him aside and grab him by the throat.
