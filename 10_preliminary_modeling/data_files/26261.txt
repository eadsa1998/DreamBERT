 I ride a bicycle over the railroad tracks on Friends Ave in Wilmerton, going southbound. I'm glad to be leaving something that is behind me. The bicycle I'm riding is old and shaky, with really thin tires that could pop when I cross the tracks. I'm at Liza Simpson's (the character from the television show) toy pile. It seems to be in a trench-like area near the end of the tan colored strip mall, between the mall and the tracks. Liza or I put a bicycle with the items in the pile. It is a small three-sided sheltered area with things stacked up and covered with sheets. My friend Emerald Reinhold, housemate Stephen Ramos, and coworker Megan Hughes are there. We all hug, and are really close together. For no apparent reason I try to kiss Megan. I'm not particularly attracted to her, I'm just feeling amorous. I feel dumb and embarrassed for doing this, and I leave, feeling silly.
