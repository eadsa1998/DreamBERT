I was preparing to take the California Bar, right before the test.  Other examinees with me.  We were all nervous.  We discussed the hoops we'd had to jump through, what to expect, how hard it was.  At one point I said, "Well I'm already an attorney in Utah."  Either meaning it wouldn't matter if I didn't pass, or I'd already know what to expect on a certain part of the test.  I surprised some of the examinees with this information.  I felt like they looked up to me after that.  They were all the law school type, friendly, jock-type, mid-to-late 20's.  There was camaraderie there.
