 I'm near Slope Avenue South in Oak Valley, by Long's old house, by the corner service station. There is a young man there in his early 20's who seems very odd, and frightens me. I'm not sure what he wants, what he does, why he appears to be so strange. I'm sitting in my truck in the parking lot east of the service station there. I invite the young man to get in the truck. He gets in the drivers seat. I'm the passenger, I realize. This is scary, because I'm not sure what this man will do: what he does or wants. I think even though he's in the driver's seat he probably won't know how to operate the truck. He's slim, with long scraggly brown hair, not greasy or stringy, but soft and slightly curled. It's not combed, but looks okay. He's wearing a rusty red or brown mechanic's suit. He has a mysterious quality about him. I determine to not prejudge him. I ask him his name. He tells me. Police officers come up behind us. A female officer sternly says, "Get out of the car. Don't say or do anything. Not a word, or I'll arrest you." We silently get out. The man mocks the officer, whining and mumbling intentionally. She begins to arrest him. There is a male officer on my side of the truck when I get out. He is about 5'10", with a round head. He speaks to the female officer, saying, "Why don't we let these guys go?" She agrees. I look at the male officer and he smiles at me. He has braces. I smile back in appreciation, careful not to say anything. The man and I get back into the truck.
