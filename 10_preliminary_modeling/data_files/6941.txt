At long table waiting for the second course. No waitress comes. At last I get up and ring a bell. No one comes. Then I get up and pass medicines to all. Lady at head drops 3 or 4 pills into her sauce. I expostulate. Then they are pushing back from the table. I ask man to pass me the medicine bottle and take my pill. It's hard to swallow without water so I go back to dining room. Now sliced peaches are at each table. I eat mine and also slices from which were spilling over on the cloth.
