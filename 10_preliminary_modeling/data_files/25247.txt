 I'm working at a table. There is a superior to me eating dinner nearby. It may be my brother Wally. I sneak away and go up some stairs where a lot of guys are working sending coolers down a chute. I join in, after "Little Man", who is a fellow chicken catcher. I am supposed to slide my cooler or move the conveyer belt faster so there isn't much room between his cooler and mine. The coolers are short, fat jugs with small caps, filled with liquid, maybe frozen. <br/
