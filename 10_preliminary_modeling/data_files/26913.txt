 I take a cyanide pill and know it will kill me. It is small and whitish. I put it under my tongue, remembering what my dad said about people in the war who committed suicide by putting a pill underneath their tongue for a very quick death. In a short period of time my left arm and parts of my body start to go numb, like they're falling asleep, tingling. I find that the pill has not dissolved, and that I can still reverse its effects. I take the pill out of my mouth, because I don't want to die. My body slowly regains its functioning.
