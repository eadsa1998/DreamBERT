In an auditorium looking at a report in a 4-inch thick paper volume. Told him we were almost through, only one page more, but counting pages about 30 left. . . . re summer resort where he had been years before asked if he had climbed Mt. Omei (sacred mountain in China). No, he hadn't but he was only 8 years old then. . . . We mustn't lose the ponies ahead, almost did but turning around, saw them in a field where a farmer was working. . . . At reception, time to go. Eight children in two rows as the receiving line. But where is the governor's wife? Well say farewell to oldest child . . . .Woman trying to lead off 5 or 6 little ones, one boy of 3 or 4 years crying and trying to run off. I wonder if she is a kidnapper and if I should interfere . . . In car on way to church, wearing two leis, one red and one of green leaves. They are getting mussed and I take them off and leave them as we reach the church. Mother goes in but I need toilet and go upstairs to dormitory. Try one door but it is locked and I remember there is one closet opening on the hall not a room and go there but I can't find the light, go in in the dark anyway. Some one opens the door and I tell them to shut it. I do nothing but go down to church. Find a seat across the aisle from mother. A boy of 9 or 10 years keeps sliding back and forth in pew. I tell him, "This is church. You must keep still." "But I can't." "Then leave."
