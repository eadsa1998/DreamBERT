Ivan was different and had left them as a teenager. There was a story in That's Life saying this guy came back from the dead. He had died, but not really and it was him. He visited us. Then Chuck (Chuck) was there and he turned into a robot and exploded. Mom came home and Ezra went to the door and was confused and she said 'he didn't turn into a robot' and he said 'yeah, how did you know'. Chuck returned as a girl and she touched this strong glass and it shattered and everyone was shocked. Then there was a big guy and security came and he just ran away and I wondered why.
