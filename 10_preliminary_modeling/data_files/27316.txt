I dreamed G. my steady, and I were at a party of G's friends. I was having a gay hilarious time. Suddenly, G left and I was left alone in this strange house. I wandered around till I found the kitchen where I heard lots of noise. I pushed open the door and everyone was there and they all made a big fuss over my absence. I felt the need to be comforted, yet I was afraid to go to G. because I knew he didn't like public displays of affection. So I stood across the room from him and laughed, feeling vocable.
