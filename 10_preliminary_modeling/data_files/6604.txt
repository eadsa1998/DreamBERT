I was outdoors watching a party start off in a homemade auto. The engine acted up and the car spun round  and round in the yard until it fell to pieces. We rushes up to find the remains of the party, all women, and were puzzled not to find anyone. A big dog attacks me, throws me down but I manage to hold his muzzle so he can't bite. (Miss W. had told of a similar attack on her the preceding evening.) The dog is lying all over on top of me.
