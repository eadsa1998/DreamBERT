I had a pretty bizarre dream. First, let's see, I was at school and I was missing Mrs. Hollander's class, first because I got lost in the hallway, second of all because Melinda and Mrs. Hildebrand stopped me and were talking, and then I took my clothes off and was taking a bath in the school bathroom. And then I was trying to figure out how to get back to Mrs. Hollander's class, but then all of a sudden I was at home and we were setting up this strange answering machine that worked in concert with the computer. And first when we set it up, it requested that you pour a quart of water into it, which was totally bizarre. And [laugh] so we did, and then the computer started up and went through its start-up procedure, and when it gets to the part where you see the Windows symbol before the desktop comes up, we saw this like colorful color pattern, like one of my tops that's real colorful, and this color pattern just kind of stayed there. And somehow I had the notion that we had to give this answering machine food that we ate and samples of our blood and information.
