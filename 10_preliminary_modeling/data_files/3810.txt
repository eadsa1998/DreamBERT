["One last Fling."] I am in a room and have left two men recently who have cheated on me. The third one, Kevin Kline, is with me and I am breaking up with him. Another man, attracted to me, is near. I am sort of showing off for his benefit. I tell Kevin goodbye and then decide to walk him outside. We walk around the corner of the building and Kevin and I begin to make love, just one last time before he goes. He leans me up against the wall and I am helping him get his penis up in me. Kevin says let's go inside and find a room. I look around and see kids playing nearby and so on but I smile and say no, let's just do it here. It's too much trouble to go find a room. But Kevin insists. So we sneak into the dormitory. We peek into rooms looking for an empty one. We have done this before, and I carry a camera so I can pretend to be on a journalistic mission. We go into one room where several empty beds are there. One higher bunk does have an older woman sleeping in it. I point her out and we try to sneak back out. She wakes up, and wants to know what we are doing. So I say We heard you knew Dustin Hoffman and wanted to do an interview. She says yes, she did know him and would give us 15 minutes. I am surprised and not happy because I made up the Dustin story thinking it would be extremely unlikely she would have known him. We sigh and I pull out a notepad and randomly write down what she says not really caring. The sexual tension seems to be fading away. She says Dustin has always talked a lot. He talked all the time.
