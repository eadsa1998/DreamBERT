I was riding out a road in Bob's car. The road ran beside a lake and I noticed that many large turtles were immigrating from the lake to the fields on the other side of the road. There seemed to be two different types of turtles, land and sea. I asked Bob to stop the car so I could catch some of them to take home. They were very large, about a foot and a half in diameter. I caught two and put them in the trunk of the car. Then I went after some more, but when I came back to the car the two I had put in the car were dead and I was very disappointed because they seemed to be so completely dead.
