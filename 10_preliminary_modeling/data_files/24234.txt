later, I was trying to stay awake. I was with a friend and Kristen Needles (a photograph friend) in an apartment. She was doing lines off a table. I wanted to try some, so I sniffed a line. I almost snorted into the big pile. She cut up more with a credit card, and dumped some liquid coke that turned into a powder from a benzoil peroxide-based facial cleanser bottle. I then ate a large amount. I felt buzzy. Then I woke up and kept coming back. When awake, I expected to still be buzzed... I used it as an excuse. "If I take this, I have no excuse to stay asleep."
