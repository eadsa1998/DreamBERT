I was in a theater with my mother and sister, watching a stage show. When it was over, my mother said we had better hurry because we had an appointment somewhere. We walked outside the theater past a fountain. My mother kept telling my sister and me to hurry. (Before we came to the fountain we had passed under a staircase.) Later I was fixing chairs.
