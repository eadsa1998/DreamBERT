We were to play cards. I went to draw my tally but each lip had only names and candy with them. Asked about it. Take a candy and names were partners. I drew Miss. Covington. "Where is she?" In the bathroom finishing dressing. Then she is on the other side of a long table. I tell her I'm her partner. Then instead of playing cards we are coloring and drawing symbolic pictures. "We should score them now." "Who starts?" One at my left says she is treasurer. I am alumna. So she comes first. "Why doesn't Mrs. Lloyd, our chairman, give us rules for scoring?" "She's gone." The treasurer finally starts scoring. Each of us are to score. She holds up a picture of tall houses, says it doesn't follow symbolism of picture underneath and scores it only one. I ask where my pictures have gone. Can't find it. Look at several pictures. They are a mixture of outlines colored and of original work. Still protesting I should find my picture and treasurer should give us rules for scoring.
