We were at Mom's old house, which was totally different. We still had all our stuff there but had only just moved back in. It had like 4 storeys and only had stuff on one side (it was nothing in the middle, stairs on the edge and then a big platform at the back). The roof had a bit you could sit on. My mobile phone was really old and was the size of an old video camera. This lady was checking through it. Mom showed me some undies with Mewtwo on them. Ezra said "I'm 22" and that "we're too old for that". At the Hop was playing and I was tapping my leg along to it.
