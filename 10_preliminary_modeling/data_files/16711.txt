I was walking through a hospital, and there were people on life support. The cords connecting them to the support went through the only place that I could walk through, and since the lights were rather low, I was afraid I might accidentally knock out one of the plugs, or someone might trip on them. Then there were 2 teachers, Mrs. Pappas and Mr. Dell. I think Mrs. Pappas told me to turn a dial or press a button, but I didn't hear whether she said DON'T press the button, or press it. I didn't know what the button was for, but I thought it might have some crucial consequence if I didn't follow her directions. So I called her, as she was walking away, and she didn't answer. Mr. Dell was walking behind her, so I called Mr. Dell, and he said he'd get Mrs. Pappas to come back to tell me what to do, but she never did, as far as I remember. Then I remember sitting at a table, probably outside, and eating, with Mrs. Saint and some others. All I remember is that I couldn't hear much, and I had to keep asking these kids at a nearby table to repeat what they were saying to me- when I did, some people just laughed and told me to forget it, but I really wanted to know what they were talking about. I felt excluded. I also remember Mrs. Jones showing me something outside the school. I don't remember what it was. Probably I had this dream because when I fell asleep, I'd just gotten back from Plainview High School and I'd seen my old teachers.
