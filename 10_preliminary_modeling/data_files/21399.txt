We came to a bridge that was being built in Rivertown. Jimmie Crear turned some lever that was fastened by a steel cable. I turned and opened windows. Helen Labuda came by and Ray Cuera was angry or on no speaking terms with her. She picked up her dress and I could see her vagina and she had a beautiful shape. J. Wiatrak started to fool around with her. He pulled a cork out of her rectum and was holding it as she wiggled and hopped around. We worked a couple of hours on the bridge and I wrote on a piece of paper: Cleaning off bridge for my time.
