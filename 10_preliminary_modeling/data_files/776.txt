Rhonda, her husband, her "Ricardo" son, 2 1/2 yrs old and I were at a famous local actor's home auditioning. I did a good performance. The actor was very intense and liked my work. Rhonda was being supportive. Then the son became obnoxious and climbed all over the people and yelled and tried to break things. Rhonda had just adopted the child and didn't know how to handle him. She tried to coax him to be good. Her husband made a suggestion. She smiled and said, "What a good idea. 6 o'clock him." I felt like I could handle the son with no problem and wanted to help Rhonda. The actor announced some times for rehearsal at the coast. I couldn't hear it clearly and noticed that Rhonda was taking notes.
