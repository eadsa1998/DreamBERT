I went hunting in Puerto Maldonado, a place located in the middle of the jungle. I spent the whole day sailing down the river and fishing at the same time. Everything was a harmony of colors and sounds. At dusk we camped alongside the river. We had to catch an animal to eat for supper. I was so tired, I fell asleep inside the tent. When I awoke it was 10 p.m. A panther had made a loud sound which had awakened me. Everything was pitch black. All I could think to do was to grab my gun and stand alert. The night was very long. I was starting to be afraid, but suddenly I remembered my harmonica and started to play.
