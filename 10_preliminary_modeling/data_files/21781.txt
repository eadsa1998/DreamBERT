I saw Tel or Tol $157. We were watching movies of how hunters get killed hunting big game. We saw a man wound a big doe deer. The doe charged, the man ran. Then we saw the doe. Its head was blood-smeared from killing the hunter. We saw that on three occasions and the deer always faced Judy on the front of the seats. I told her to come back with me. I was afraid the deer would charge her.
