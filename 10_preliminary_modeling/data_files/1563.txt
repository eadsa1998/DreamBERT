I am on a beach, romping. I see a violin case in green and yellow (University colors). It is there for me. I had written a letter requesting it from a music professor so that I could create a better, more creative Happy Birthday song for someone. He felt I could do a good job, so he brought it and left it on the beach to surprise me. And I was surprised. I wasn't sure it was for me. I circled it and exclaimed at my friends. I touched it and it's duck-like mouth opens and gently bites my hand. I decide it's for me and pick it up and go to the parking lot and sit in a van and play. My fingers are deformed, so I must hold it differently. I am rusty. I know the professor is listening. I hope he's not disappointed.
