I was praying the rosary. I was to give the rosary back to Grandma's. She told me to put it on the cupboard. I flew to the cupboard. A big horse was standing there ready to run after me. The rosary turned into a prayer book. I was going to show this horse how I could fly. I worked my hands, but flew very slow and the horse laughed at me. I said, "You just wait till I get a start and then you can try to catch me." Someone had a new refrigerator outside among some boulders, rocks. I was driving along a road, then a train came and held back some traffic and I got into the traffic lane alongside the train. I was swinging on a swing with Vance. Sister Mary and Ann were going in swimming. They put their clothes on beach and small kids were playing and filling them with sand. So they put them in the water to float around. Someone gave me a handful of _ dollars in silver said this was mine on a bet. I saw a half dollar on the ground, then I saw a lot of nickels which I picked. There was a cat around Trixie. I shooed it away and it growled like a dog. I went by and I turned around and the cat intimated Trixie.
