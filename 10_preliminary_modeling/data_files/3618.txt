I am a woman who is interviewing for a job. A man named Will is across the desk from me. He looks like Liam Neeson in Nell. I tell him I was fired and there was sexual harassment and so on. He asks me if he's the first person I've interviewed with. I say dryly, "No indeed. As you probably guessed, I have had lots of interviews but no one will take a chance on me. They think, like I think you are thinking now, that it will happen to them. I will accuse them of sexual harassment, like I'm the perpetrator, not the victim." He looks sympathetic. Then I see a scene happening in the next room down the hall. A beautiful woman is distraught. She is resisting going into a room and she calls out "Bear, Bear," which seems to be a name of a small child who disappeared or was hurt. She is sobbing. I see a mask that a child drew on the wall. I also see a written report that says "Domestic Violence." Now Will leaves the room and I wait for his answer. As I wait, a small odd-looking man, like a leprechaun in a business suit, walks conspicuously through the room calling my attention to him, nonverbally. I watch as he leaves the room by a side door and then I look out the window as he sneaks back around to the next door and sneaks back into the hall. "Humm," I think, "he needed me to be a witness to his leaving. There's something fishy going on here." Will returns and is kind to me. He shows me a glass figurine of a horse which belonged to the other woman. I hold it on my arm and look closely. At first it is a glass figurine of a shoe, an elf or ancient woman's shoe, then it is a horse on spindly glass triangle legs. The legs break off and I am trying to reattach them. I notice there are shoes on the ends of the horse's legs like the shoe the entire figurine was at the beginning.
