This girl was dead and had died at a young age. She was a ghost in this dilapidated house. She made me follow her and fall through the floor. I discovered that her father had poisoned her. Then it was me that had died and that's what had happened to me, but it wasn't Dad that poisoned me. I was a ghost and was trying to tell Mom.
