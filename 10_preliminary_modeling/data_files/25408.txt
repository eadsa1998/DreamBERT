 I'm with my friend Nat Miller, and our classmate Victoria Line. We are in a sort of Candyland. It has a small stream flowing through it, and there are some really big mushrooms that are the size of a football or a basketball. The place is very colorful. There are some colorful little gumdrop-like structures or boxes around. We decide to eat a mushroom. We pick it. It is huge! It is soft and squishy, like a marshmallow. I fell sick and bloated. Nothing happens to us immediately after eating it. We are in a bed in my basement, which is by the stairs. I am in the bed. Victoria and Nat have their feet up on the edge of the bed to my right. We slowly get silly from the mushroom. I run Victoria's feet, and then Nat's feet. I rub Nat's feet because I don't want it to seem like I am going after Victoria. I rub her legs. I am getting sexually aroused, but I don't know if she is. She rubs my feet too. A guy from my geology class and another guy stick their heads down the stairway. They have just arrived home and want to go to bed. They may be drunk or stoned. We were being loud, and apologize to them. I was tickling Victoria's foot, and she was laughing and screaming.
