It was a long time after there had been a zombie outbreak. I was with James Lafferty, who was my boyfriend. I was at some place with people from school. I had to go under water to get this thing with a sticky thing and pick something up, it was a game. There were kittens and puppies and I had them in separate sections. This girl had been training kittens and bunnies to turn them against us. We ran away. We were in a field and this guy came and helped us. We went to this place to do a trade. The guy came on a plane. There was an auction and we bought him for $500,000. There was a submarine and a guy with axes. He cut a guy's arm off and we ran. We went into a building and I could see waves out the window. They were really big and people were swimming. There was an elevator which was voice activated. I said I didn't trust it because some numbers were dodgy. There was a room with computer chips and we were then small (the chips were bigger than us). A guy who was normal size was fixing a computer. We got out and I had my arm around James. We went to a shop.
