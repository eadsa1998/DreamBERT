I had to go to East 125 St. I had a business(card) in my hand with the (address) printed on it. When I got home I was practicing 4 measures on page 3 of the Mozart Sonata in C K545. The door was slightly open because it was hot and this allowed a breeze to come through. My neighbor is very old. Since he had a stroke he cusses all the time. He heard me practicing and he was lonely so he said, "Will you come visit me?" I said, "I can't, I'm going over to Evelyn's." And I had 2 radios. I thought the music would keep him company so I put one station on classical piano and the other on talking. Then I went back to my room and he screamed, "WHAT'S THAT GODDAMN RACKET?" I didn't know if he meant the radios or me clanging on the stainless steel mixing bowl. The door was open 4" with the safety chain and he was looking in. Since I'd burned the pot I was trying to cook oatmeal in the graduated mixing bowl.
