I was with Erik.  We did many things, always together.  We worked together, we were driving together, we camped together in a mountain area.  We were doing some job outdoors, we were at a cabin, there was a metal urn and wooden cupboards.  We were making or fixing wooden cupboards.  At one point I heard or became aware that some acquaintances or town people who did not know Erik were saying: "Why does she spend so much time with him?"  Then they saw him, and their faces said they knew exactly why I wanted only to be with him so much.  After I saw their reaction I was in a car beside Erik (a convertible I think), and I looked over at him for a long time, and got the most intense feelings of deep and pure love, respect, admiration, giving.  I loved him so much in this dream.  And I was able, or allowed, to love him so much here.
