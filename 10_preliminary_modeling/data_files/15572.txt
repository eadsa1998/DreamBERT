I arrived in London to stay with Dad and Ezra. Dad mentioned that he was leaving in a few hours and Ezra was saying for a week. I started to panic about being alone and wondered what accommodation to get. I ended up befriending this girl and we got a room for Â£20 (I said "20 bucks" and then corrected to pounds. There was a bed big enough for 7 people and it was just us two. The next day more people were coming and it would be more expensive. We found another place which was more expensive. There was a room with 5 beds. There was one bench with 2 beds next to each other and 3 were on the floor next to each other. The place offered live-in jobs, but only for 16-18 year olds.
