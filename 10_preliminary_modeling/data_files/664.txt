I am at a house in a nearby town for an aromatherapy session when a bobcat gets into the house. There is another pet animal there also. I tried to keep the bobcat out but it pushed open the door. I got on the table and it got on the table too and started eating. I call my son to see if he is interested in trapping the bobcat. I have to wait for a commercial on the telephone before I can talk to him. He isn't sure if he can do it but he comes and I tell him to be sure and just live trap it. It doesn't seem to be much of a danger to me.
