I know that I am in an airplane and that we are going at great speed. We see this because the speedometer is a kitchen in which the water begins to boil when excessive speeds are reached. I tell this to the people who are driving the plane and they don't believe me, and when the stove top is lifted, we see that the speedometer says we are going at 30,000 miles an hour.
