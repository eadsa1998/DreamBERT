I feel really bad about not remembering my dreams when I wake up. But today I have a vague memory that we were staying at this hotel at this conference like type thing. I can't remember everything, but I was like, Dad and I were in this bathroom and I was like cleaning myself up because I had been sleeping and sleeping for like until 10:00, which I never do, but that day I did. And Dad decides he's going to turn off this tub faucet and make it flab, and so I'm like naked in the bathroom and I like came out of the bathroom and walked down to our room, and it was totally dark, so nobody could see me, but there were other people in the hallway. So in our room, and then I decided to go back to the bathroom and I go to the wrong bathroom. I go to the men's room and there's this guy taking a shower in his clothes and everything. He doesn't even really notice me, so I'm okay. [laugh] And then I go back to our bathroom and things are kind of okay. Oh, and then I kind of got some clothes on and took a walk around, then I was coming up the stairs to go back to our room, and this lady comes up to see me and she's like, she gets on a portable radio and calls the audio man, Jon Onion -- his name is really Jon Bunyan, but they call him Jon Onion from the Dome -- and wants him to help me. Like that was strange, man. And then at the very end, before I woke up, I dreamt that my back was hurting really, really, really bad because I fell from _______ all around.
