There was a house with an enormous slide that went down about 3 stories. I was thinking about how fun it would be to go down the slide. I was looking for something to use to ride on it. I found an old yellow boogie board. Cindy Brady was there. I gave her the boogie board to ride the slide. She rode it and camped out at the bottom, clinging to the boogie board. I told her to share it with the other kids, but she refused to give it up. She wanted to charge everyone a dollar apiece to use it.
