I was in New York sitting in on a radio broadcast with my aunt and cousin. The program was "The Life of Riley." The first part was very noisy and hilarious with people moving up and down the aisles. The last part was very solemn and serious. My seventeen year old cousin wanted to see the program over again so my aunt and he stayed. I went into the lobby of the hotel and bumped into a girl friend. I told her that we were to go out to dinner in an hour and if she wanted to we could go somewhere and talk. I ran through the long carpeted lobby up two stairs and tried to get into the studio to tell my aunt where I would be. The usher let me in but my girl friend kept following me asking me where I was going. I then woke up.
