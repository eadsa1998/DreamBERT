The Merton Circle is meeting. It's a large group, and Hillary says during the break, "Why don't you tell us what's going on for you now?" I am shy and hesitate, but go up in front of this group and speak. This is fun, like when I was teaching, making them laugh and think. They are warmly responsive. I say, "As you know, when we first met, I was teaching at the community college, well, at east, part time and now things are changed." Tyler says, "Boy, have they!" I smile. I say, "And so now I am going back to high school." They laugh with me. I say, "To learn math." Tyler says, "Calculus." I say, "Yes, I am interested in some aspects of physics and math has always been hard and this ties into how much the Merton circle has changed." They all murmur agreement. I say, "We need to talk about this. I'm not sure I like the changes."
