I am walking through the city blocks of a new city, sight seeing. I am now beyond where the stores are and walking along the side of the highway. There are no houses or anything, but I am curious about what is beyond it. The only way to explore a new city is to walk all the streets and see what's what. I decide this way will be too long and I turn and go the other way and am now going down a hill and the ocean is on the left. I want to take a picture and start to cross the road to the little turn off where I can be safe and take a picture. A huge RV pulls up there and I wait, thinking how ironic, just when I was going to go there. Finally they pull away. I get there and put on my wheelchair brakes. I kind of roll a bit anyway, which makes me nervous because it's a sheer dropoff. I focus the camera which looks like opera glasses. I see a small island with birds on it. At first I thought there was a polar bear on it, but it was birds. I snap shots, bringing them closer with the telephoto lens. I then go on and am in a house with I think, Shannon, the old the community college poetry teacher. I've written something, a letter perhaps, and she isn't reading it. Another woman picks it up and looks at it. Nobody is much impressed.
