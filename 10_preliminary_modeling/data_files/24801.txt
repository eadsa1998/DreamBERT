Everybody was at My school and it was about 10:00. We were just chillin' at the upper courts in the dark. Me and Will were holding hands and walking together and it was so nice. Will took 6 little kids to some fort and I was pissed off that I couldn't be with him. Setting: It took place at My school. Characters: I knew all of them - they were my schoolmates and the main character was Will. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I was happy because I was with Will and he was being so sweet, like a gentleman.
