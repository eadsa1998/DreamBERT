A party at our house: a tall man (unknown) starts to explain some shorthand symbols to us by writing them on a blackboard; the room is unheated, so we go back to a warm room. The man asks me to take care of his sunflowers while he is away taking his prelims. As the man gets ready to leave, someone says: "2-4-6-8-16 is the time (interval?) we must intersect" == shift: all the paintings in our house have been taken off the wall; stashed everywhere a big mess and I have to clean it up.
