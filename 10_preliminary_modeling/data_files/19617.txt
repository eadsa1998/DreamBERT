Playing radio; dial past several stations and obtain Big City station in my home state. Excellent reception of a violin solo -- some well known piece, probably "Star Spangled Banner." Violin sounds as though it were in same room with me. I wonder whether the music can be heard by my mother, who is in the adjoining room.
