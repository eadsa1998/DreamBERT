I have a very small house. Bonnie comes by. She is very fat. She is wearing a hand crocheted dress and a white slip. She asks me to help unravel her dress. She has crocheted it incorrectly and she needs me to redo it. As I undo it, my father looks shocked and turns his face away, quite upset. He asks that she cover herself. She asks me if she can borrow something to wear. I go into my spacious walk-in closet and look. I see old, tattered evening gowns (sort of 1950's style). I think, "I sure don't wear them much anymore." I see blouses and then bathing suits and unders. Nothing in there will fit. I then go to my dresser and pull out a big black turtleneck sweater. She says, "That will fit," and puts it on.
