They were going to take the plane on Friday, looking at the schedule. I said, "we'll have to go then too because there are planes only twice a week." Miss W. said, "You can take one from __.The girls will help you take your things over." Then R. was introducing me to two ladies and the third said, "you know Mrs. Taylor", but I didn't recognize any of them. Tried to get R. decide which day and plane we should take.
