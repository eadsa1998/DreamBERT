At one time I was discussing vagus inhibition. Presently I was out in the gray of a wet morning, walking the deserted streets of Newtonville with most disconsolate feelings. I came to our house and seated myself on the piazza. By and by the C quartet seemed to have planned a sea trip. We were to take a train at 8:10. I reckoned that this would be an express and get us to the wharf by nine. Then I remembered it was winter. I fell in with L. near the old corner bookstore at night. We started toward the north end, but finding we were leaving all lights behind, we faced around and decided to go to a theater. I do not remember reaching one. Shortly it was day again. I came to the brow of a precipice and concluded to jump off. I was a little uncertain as to the result, but thought I could do it well enough. And so it proved. Clearing an iron railing, I sailed down easily to a jutting point thirty feet below, landed lightly and leaped off again. Three or four such stages placed me at the foot of the cliff.
