We were at a shop looking place. Dad was there. It was home sometimes. There were all these teddy bear touch lamps on, and so I was turning them off. One of them wouldn't turn off because I had to download a patch. I downloaded the patch on a computer but I needed it on mine to use it. Then the site to download from was down and I couldn't find something to transfer it with. We were then at an old lady's house and if we guessed her full name we could download it because she blocked the site or something. Mom, Ezra and I were looking around her house. I found out that her initials were DSL. I found something that said "Danielle, Scandella, [something]". I said the name, but it wasn't hers. I complained because her last name could be anything and I said that the people at school had last names such as Conell, Ivanovich, Lundquist, Pritchard, Johnston. Sometimes she was a guy who looked like Michael Parks. I went into this really cold freezer and I was putting ice-cream back. A servant told me the guy's middle name was Izzy. I was then at a beach, which was the first known beach or something on Earth. Dad, Poppa and Uncle Wilbur were there. We were on a ledge of a rock formation and waves kept coming up (they were gentle). I put my phone on a ledge higher than the water. I went to swim out and I was holding my phone, but I accidentally got it in the water. I pulled it out but it was completely screwed.
