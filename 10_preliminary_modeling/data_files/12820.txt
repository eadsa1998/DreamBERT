I was somewhere that I've never seen before (though I knew where I was in the dream). Poppa was working on a building. I had an 'epiphany' of that popcorn cartoon. I found this pyramid. It had this thing out the front which was mine. I went in and it was all my stuff. There was a tape in the video player. I pressed play and it was this Simpson's cartoon. Then another cartoon came on and I recognized the bear from the popcorn cartoon so I rewound it and it was it. It was only half cartoon and there was no popcorn music. Autumn was the bear and she was climbing through that pipe. I was thinking 'No way!'. We were on an island.
