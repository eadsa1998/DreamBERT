I am at Chloe's home and discover several rooms set up for children to play in, such as "Snow White and the 7 dwarfs"; I offer to supervise the childrens' group for 2 hours every afternoon; I am not sure that Chloe wants me to do this..shift: I am in a NARROW CORRIDOR and feel "stuck" someone is trying to tell me a joke in German....
