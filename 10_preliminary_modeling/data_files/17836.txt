My old friend Neil Block was over, visiting.  We were in my room talking.  I went to go to the back bathroom.  Meanwhile my mother was talking to Neil about something and not knowing I was in the bathroom, came in with him.  I quickly tried pulling up my pants and sort of tried to nudge Neil out the door, but they just looked at me...so I left.
