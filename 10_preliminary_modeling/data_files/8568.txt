This was about selling CAS products. It seems that I was talking to someone but I may have just been working on this stuff - alone. It was important that we use online retailers and that we create hard-copy marketing pieces for the expensive titles. Also that we not spend the money for BCB to have it's own site. I asked Bill C. to do a search on the web of a few popular titles by other authors and see how many of them have their own site. I don't think he'll find many.
