 I'm at a hotel with a woman who I don't know that has long brown wavy hair. We're staying in the same room. More people are coming to stay in our room, so I sleep on the floor and this has something to do with an egg. My classmate from Brimson Sara Miller and others come in. She tries to awaken me and get my attention. I pretend that I'm very tired, rolling over to see her, and then rolling back to sleep. I feel a poking or tickling sensation. I thrash around. The sensation persists, as if intentional. I get really mad at the people around me for doing this. I get mad at Sara, and then at another man, and then at a person I know of through friends named Dan. I think it is Dan doing this, and I hit him gently across the face with the back of my hand to threaten him. I get up and leave. The room is very crowded, with three people in a bed and many on the floor. I go to the bathroom, which is crowded. I see I have two mushrooms growing out of my right shoulder! I quickly pick them off. I am embarrassed that I had them. The mushrooms may indicate my dirtiness. Many people are reading magazines.
