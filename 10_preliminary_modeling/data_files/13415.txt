Calvin and I were somewhere. I decided I wanted to walk to Baskin and Robbins at Innaloo. It was at a different place, but I walked there and Calvin followed me. Then I was naked and I went into a bottle shop and asked if I could use the phone. She was like "Oh, I got to ask the manager". I found a shirt in this room. She told the manager that I was naked. Then she said "I bet people have been looking at you. Maybe the legs... the slimy fat, no!". I told Calvin to go. The manager came. I went to the toilet and I flushed and it flooded the place. I got into a fight with the manager. Calvin told Mom I went there.
