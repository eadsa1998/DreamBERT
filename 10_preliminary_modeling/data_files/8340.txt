I was at an SAID conference. Macy F and I were rooming together as usual. The conference was much shorter than usual, maybe only two days. We were talking about this as we were packing and getting ready to leave. We had each only packed one very small suitcase because it was such a short conference. As we were packing we had the door open. Dalton G stopped by the room and said something. I said I was sorry that we hadn't had a chance to chat this time but next time hopefully we would. I continued packing, pulling things out of the closet onto the bed. I kept finding more and more things that belonged to me on the shelf of the closet. Large and unusual items that one would not normally pack for such a trip. The one item was a rather large, empty flowerpot that was stained from prior use. I was beginning to wonder how I had managed to get all of this stuff into this small suitcase. I had put some things inside other things. I also realized that, as usual, I was going home with more things than I had come with. I did have a nylon satchel of sorts that I could use to take extra things home. It didn't have a shoulder strap though. As I was emptying the closet I found a shoulder strap from a previous hotel guest and decided to take it and use it on my bag. There was still a lot of stuff left in the closet that didn't belong to Macy F or me. There was a row of books, CD's, or DVD's. I'm not sure which. Now I am in a car with BJ and Kim H. Kim H is talking about sorting through this row of books or whatever. She is criticizing BJ for not doing it each time she is there. So Kim H said that she did it. I was very irritated by this, partly because of her attitude and partly because of her frequent criticism of others. I told Kim H that I had sorted through that shelf before I left.
