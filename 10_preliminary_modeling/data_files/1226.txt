I am seated on the floor in a group of other girls. The guys are going to come over and choose partners. One I think is good-looking walks toward me and then chooses the one next to me. I am alone. I feel sad and perplexed. Why not me? Later I'm walking to class and an ugly guy, sort of like Donald Duck, proposes to me. I turn him down, defending my attitude by pointing out that it isn't his looks that I am refusing, but that we don't get along.
