A man and his brother are with Ellie and me. He is an Eskimo and we sit together on a bench at a table. He hugs me and kisses and I start to remember how good it feels to have someone be physical with me. He looks like Brent from playwright class. Ellie doesn't want anything to do with his brother and so he goes off to find someone else. Now I'm with him and a man comes to the car I'm in (I'm in the backseat) and tries to force me to make love to him. He kisses me and I go limp and then I bite him hard and he gets more vicious and I decide to just "take it" and get it over with. I hate it. He leaves and the cops come and I point to the house he's in and call them violent kids.
