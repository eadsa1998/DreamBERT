It started out that my family, my parents and my brother, was going camping in Sydney, Australia. Only we were camping in plastic bags instead of tents. In the daytime we were walking along the street when my mom told us to stop. This was because she saw a T-shirt/bathing suit stand with a Jr. Bach T-shirt. She got one, and I did, too. Then my dad held up a pair of boys trunks and said, "These are pretty nice." To which I replied, "Uh, Dad, those are boys trunks." He said, "Oh." Setting: On the streets of Sydney, Australia. Characters: My mom - harpsichordist, loves Bach. She was just talking about Jr. Bach that day. My dad - out of it in the world of clothes. My brother - didn't say anything. We were talking about going to Sydney that morning. Feelings and Thoughts: Other. Like my dad was acting dumb. It was kind of strange but it could have easily happened.
