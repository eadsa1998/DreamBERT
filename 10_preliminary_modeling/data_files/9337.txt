In the dream I see a movie ad on famous users of drugs and how it harmed them. The picture in the ad looked like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now and like an eroded face of Ken Kesey on cover of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The movie opens with effects of drug distortions as seen in head of man in top of Volcano (half eaten away or ash and burned marks or darkness). His hand rested on the mountain and body soared above it into steam and clouds--I assume headless. The dream shifts to asylum/hospital/prison where man/boy is captured by police/evil futuristic uniforms as in Star Wars. He screams as loud as possible, "Help me, Save me!" Out of the volcano Christ rises and strides forward in the air, with two helpers or angels, also walking through the air toward the prisoner. Christ has on cape and headdress like monks or St. Francis. But his face was strong. The scene shifts to the outside of the prison (or military base or asylum). At the entrance, a man and two young women are tearing down the signs, MENTAL WARD, RETREAT CENTER. I assume they'll tear down the fence. but the dream ends as they tear the signs off the gate.
