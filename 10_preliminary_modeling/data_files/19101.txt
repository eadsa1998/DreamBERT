The dream was of the experimental situation. I was lying here and had 2 or 3 electrodes loose. In tossing and turning, my hand had become caught behind one of them and pulled it loose. It seemed as if one of the others had gradually worked itself loose during the night. Then I was laying here awake for a while and it seemed as if it took Roger quite a while to come in to reattach them. When he did, it seemed as if there had been a female assistant outside the room who had heard a great deal of commotion, or heard the pens scratching, and realized that things were not as they should be. She had then gone upstairs to get Roger so that he could come down and take care of the situation. Roger and I then had some conversation while he was reattaching the electrodes. I then was lying here awake thinking that I would never be able to get to sleep. It had become very late during the night, and I was still waiting to fall asleep for an extended period of time. It seems that while laying here awake, that is dreaming that I was awake, I was saying something to myself about, "Don't come in as yet because I haven't started to dream," because I'm often surprised when the monitor arrives as it doesn't seem as if he should have because a dream hadn't been taking place. My thought then was that I would be surprised if a monitor were to appear during what I had experienced as wakefulness in the dream.
