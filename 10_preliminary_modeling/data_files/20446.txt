I went under an overpass to an enclosed yard. Something that resembled a bed's headboard was lifted over the wall surrounding the yard. In a storeroom, I saw a number of headboards. One had a mirror on it, which was broken. Another had ornamental carving which I recognized as identical to the one I had had in my bedroom. A man came in, and tried to put the sides on a headboard so he could take it away. But the boards kept moving, and he could not attach them, so he decided not to take it. I reflected that the boards had seemed to be alive when the man tried to attach them. Then my sister came into the room with a large bandage covering her back. My mother came and we told her that my sister would have to leave the bandage on a few weeks. There was a cotton cloth taped over the bandage, and my sister peeled it off, leaving the bandage exposed. A little later my sister asked who brought the dates from the dining room into the kitchen.
