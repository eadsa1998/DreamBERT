I go to a photography class and am putting my lens into the camera. It appears to be a bit crooked, but then it clicks in right. The teacher gives instructions and there are diagrams and such on the board. I go to the ladies' room and come back. I have to put my bra back on. So I step behind an easel in the back of the class. Everyone turns and tries to see as I struggle. The straps get twisted and it's hard to do without exposing myself. Finally I do it, but I'm angry at the teacher (now a law class). I raise my hand and tell her off very directly and clearly. l. The bathroom was too crowded. 2. The rule that says you must put your bra on even if people watch is inhumane ( and there was a 3rd reason). The class was very impressed that I stood up so bravely to the teacher (a woman) and, in fact, talked like a professional lawyer even though I'm in a class to learn to be a lawyer. I kind of enjoyed the experience. I didn't get angry. I was clear and articulate. Then later she starts talking and I raise my hand to answer a question. She ignores me and finally I stand up and go right up to the front of the class, right in her face. She has to call on me. She doesn't like it.
