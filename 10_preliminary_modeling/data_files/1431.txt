Tyler and I are seated comfortably on a couch by a window semi-lying together. I am telling him poignantly about how my physical condition keeps getting worse right before my eyes. He touches my hand sympathetically. Mabel and Tyler are talking and I'm listening, while I lazily eat strawberries. Mabel is trying to get Tyler to help her by covering for her. She's promising to be there on time. Tyler is squirming because he wants to be helpful and he knows she'll be late. They are quietly arguing. He has straw on him and she is globbing whipped cream on him while she is talking. I feel bad for them, but feel helpless and I watch. She says, "You're eating strawberries and cream." I said, "I know. I don't like them, but my body needs them. It told me to eat them."
