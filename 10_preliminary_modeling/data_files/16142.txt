I was living a story, and that there was this poor family that lived in a house and their mother worked ten hours a day for fifty cents an hour. And they had a Santa Claus shaped radio that they'd use to keep in contact with their mother; it was a two-way thing. And the oldest one was kind of hard to deal with ____?___ too much ____?__. And I can't remember too much, but also Mom and I were sitting at my desk? and for some reason I had to take the knobs off the amplifier. First I took the volume knob off while it was pretty loud, then I couldn't turn it down, so I said, "Give it back to me, put it on and turn it down." And then I took it off and gave it back to her. [laugh] And I took the selection off too. I don't know why, I guess we needed to trace them for something. Then we were talking about what to get those kids a new toy for Christmas. And then I woke up.
