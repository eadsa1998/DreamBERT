We were looking in somebody's fundraiser catalog and there was all this kind of junky, expensive stuff. And but there was this one thing -- there was this Easter bunny, there was this karaoke Easter bunny that sang popular songs and I just thought that was the coolest thing, so we had to get it. But we had to order it online, so we went to this crazy website and we finally found it, and we ordered it. And then, then another dream, I guess, but it seemed contiguous to me. All of a sudden we were going to meet the chorus at Countryside High for that competition thing, and we were sitting in a car for whatever reason, and we were almost late. And there was another school parading past us. We didn't want to jump in their line and screw up their order. So we waited until they went by and then we raced up to our warm up room to find out that I didn't have my black shoes. I had my white shoes. And Mom was saying that Josie probably had some. I had the notion that she was there. And then they said, "Just don't worry about it." This was the wrong day anyway. We were supposed to come on a different day. And then another dream, I dreamt that there was this TV commercial advertising like a Frankenstein series of like shows, like Jag. And it showed Madonna talking to Victor, and she said, almost like a kid playing -- first she said, "There's something I know you know how to do, so let's do it." And at that she like, she created another person, I think. And it was like, "Whoa!" And oh yeah, then a little transient dream I had was there was an empty vitamin bottle [laugh] and Mom wanted me to put it outside for the chickens, and she said, "Let's give the chickens a nothing treat!" [laugh] And then I said, "Okay, let's give the chickens a nothing treat," so and I was getting ready to put it outside, but then I realized it still had half my vitamins in it so I put it back in the fridge. That was stupid! And then I woke up.
