My boyfriend Jeremy and my parents and I went to Disneyland.  It was the same it has been in some other dreams of Disneyland.  We went to the rear entrance.  There was a sort of bar with a robotic Walt Disney talking, and people dressed in costumes.  Upstairs were a couple video games.  I wanted to go on the elevator ride that I remembered from a previous dream but nobody else ever did.  At that point, my old dorm roommate Sally was with us as well.  I went to the side of the building and sure enough I saw the elevator, though not dark and dismal like in the previous dream..more following the old western sort of theme of the building.  The others didn't want to bother, though, because you had to pay extra to ride it.  I went up the stairs to check how much it cost, because I was still interested.  It turned out it was only a buck, so I went ahead on the ride.  The elevator was actually huge, with maybe 20 seats and a lot of windows.  I think we were only actually about three floors up, but feeling it drop was a lot of fun.
