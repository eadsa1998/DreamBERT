I am at the home of Ozzie, a male friend from childhood. His house is a second floor apartment with a deck. Lisa, my sister-in-law, is moving in to an apartment there. I am envious because I thought I would get to move into an apartment first. Lisa has tons of Christmas stuff she is moving in. She tells me she has bad news - that my mother is in the hospital because she was nervous from an accident with the car.
