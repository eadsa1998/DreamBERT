We had this really small rectangle patch of grass in the road to later build a house on. I was looking at it, trying to work out how we were going to fit any kind of house on it. I asked Dad what kind of house they could build and he mentioned a cartoon character, which was a reference to the latest episode of South Park that I had randomly decided to watch recently (in the dream). There was a path over it too and I asked if we were allowed to remove it and they said yeah. Mom's house wasn't too far away from it. I discovered Jeremiah lived in front of the patch. Dad had also left some Christmas presents out the front of Eugene's house. They came outside and he called out to them and they just looked at him funny and didn't say anything. I said they were probably wondering why you left them presents and he nodded in agreement. I was then at a house. I was watching TV and there was a knock at the door and I can't remember who it was. Mom and Darren then got back.
