Gary S and I saw each other again. We were living in the same area. After spending just a little time talking we realized we were never meant to be apart. We decided we would not let anything else keep us apart again. He was attentive, gentle, kind, loving, caring, interested in what was going on with me. in my life and in my head and my emotions. I fell in love with him all over again, if I have ever really stopped loving him.
