Louis and Gage (both Pet Sematary) were at a park place with lots of trees. Louis was in a tree poking an octopus and trying to make something collapse. There was some toy that kept being advertised and Gage wanted one. In the park, I think someone was murdered. A holocaust of some sort was happening and Louis was either trying to kill or protect Gage, but I don't remember which.
