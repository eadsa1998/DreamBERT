I am changing my clothes because Darryl and his bride came to our family dinner and I want to look nice. I go into a room and find some girl clothes, maybe Charla's hanging in the closet. I can't seem to find my own clothes. I see a large suitcase on a bed with a pile of rumpled clothes in it and dig around. I find a pair of jeans that may be big enough for my Buddha belly. I start to put them on when a small wooden sliding door opens and Doug is peeking in to see if he can see me naked. I tell him to get away. I am mad at him. I look again at the jeans and see they are way too big. They are Kyle's jeans. That won't do. I am feeling desperate. I want to look nice and I don't seem to have anything nice to wear. I do find a pretty rusty brown top and skirt and I have a petticoat on. I am telling some woman there that maybe the petticoat will show under the skirt because it is too long. She says, "It's fine," but I take it off. I actually do look fairly nice. I return to the dinner where a jumble of food is all over the table. I shyly talk with Darryl and his bride. I am thinking that it has been so many years but it is fitting we are together again. There is also some bad feeling that it is going to be wrong for us to get married. We would not be good for each other after all.
