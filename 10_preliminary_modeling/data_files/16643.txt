Mom and I were supposed to either walk or ride the bike, but I think we were supposed to ride the bike down to the water, and then keep going downtown to get to this little place that I like that had like a dock and some tables, and we were going to have a band. And apparently the band was from Bayside Nursing Home where I play the piano, but the band was going to play like the oldie songs that I really like, like from the 60's and the 70's. And I heard them before and I had the notion that they were really good. And I had the notion that Allen was the keyboard player, wouldn't you know. And I didn't know if the band members were residents or staff, but I thought that they would be residents. And I'm trying to think. I think we were going on the bike and we got like halfway there and Mom got tired and said she had to stop. And she couldn't really go any farther. And I think we were sitting on a boat ramp or something, and there were other people there ______________ and I was wondering and hoping that she was okay, but I was also kind of feeling bad, like, you know, it was made especially apparent to me that my wings were really clipped and I resented that, because I couldn't just pick up and go downtown and enjoy our city any time I wanted to. And so I wasn't really mad at her, but it was a situation that made me regret my own situation itself. And then Dad showed up and some of the other fireman people, just in passing. And I don't know, I think Mom said she was having trouble and she was feeling really weird because of the angle of her spinal cord or something that was causing her whole body to tingle, and that was pretty scary. And Dad was saying to me, "Well, if you want to walk down ______," he was saying, "She shouldn't be walking down to the water any more. If you want to walk down to the water, you should _________." And I was thinking, "Oh, brother, this is truly not good." And I think I was at home and we ________________, and there was this program on TV about the Westportrsburg waterfront and I was trying to record it, but I was trying to do it the way like I do the Penelope (?) tapes sometimes when I want to prep, where I get the thing set up and I get it going, and then I shut off the TV and the amplifier so it could just do its thing independently. And I know there was some more to it, but I can't remember.
