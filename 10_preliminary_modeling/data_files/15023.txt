I went for a drive with Ezra. I was driving and I went into a carpark and I saw someone who looked like a cop and then I remembered that I shouldn't be driving alone. I went to park and there was another person there and I parked in a pram bay and then drove through to a normal spot. Then I was on a red moped thing. I was then at a petrol station and Rover was there. I said "anguish" and he looked at me with a weird look. I knocked on the window of the station to tell Ezra. This skinny girl walked up to me and said "do you have a Porsche?" And I said no, laughing. She said okay and walked off but then she called out "do you have any passions?" And I said "yes, one" and Ezra was laughing. Then I was filling up the car with disco music and petrol. The girl distracted me and I put too much petrol in (I think it went over by one dollar). She squirted me with a hose and tried to get me with petrol. This guy showed me this cord thing to wrap around the moped wheels to keep stuff in place. Then there was this movie which was the third in a trilogy and it was called Satan's Grave. The first one was set in Western times, the second was more recent and the third one was set in the present. The first one was made in the 80's and Clint Eastwood was in it. It involved time travel. I was then in a huge library. This guy said it was during school hours and I said that I was in University and he was like 'pfft' and said he didn't care. I said "I'm 19!" And I showed him a Proof of Age card but he said it was different. It also said that my birthday was in 1994. They refused to let me stay there. Then it was the movie again. This new guy had just finished writing his last 'note' and he found one from SVP (Clint Eastwood's character) which had been written in 2082 (which was now) saying that 'whoever else wrote in here we know who you are' etc.
