 I'm going to tell the van driver that drove us back from Mossman gorge my dream entitled "It's Pink Day". A person I know from school, Janice Jones, is there. She leaves. I start telling the man the dream. I get caught up in the dream and lose my focus. I am walking. My friend Hilary Nano is walking with two people. At first it seems like I might be one of them, but I hear what both of those people are saying. Beth is telling them about us making out. I avoid her and her speaking. It sounds like she wants more than I want out of the relationship. I hide on the sixth floor. I am going to take an elevator away. I push the button and wait. I am around a corner with soap on my hands, rubbing my hands together. Hilary is on the stairs. She comes over to the corner where I am. I look up, knowing she is there. The person there is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I am surprised and say hi. We start to talk. We go in the elevator to go in my room. Then I realize we're on the sixth floor, so we go out to room 637, which is my room. I have her take the room key out of my pocket and open the door. She enters the room with me. Inside it is like an apartment. It is a bit messy. There is a space where the mattress doesn't cover and the bedspring protrudes.
