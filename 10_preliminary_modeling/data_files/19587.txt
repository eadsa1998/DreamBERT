I am searching for the meaning of a chapter name in the bible (?Deuteronomy). Some one, probably my uncle (now dead), tells me about a newspaper called "Hexateuch," published in Washington, D.C., which deals almost exclusively with all sorts of problems that develop in attempt to interpret numerous obscure passages in the bible. It seems very likely that this paper has issued, from time to time, booklets in which are gathered decisions and suggestions on questions that have been argued on and settled. I enter the lobby (a big, high-ceilinged room) to ask whether or not my own particular problem is discussed in any of these booklets.
