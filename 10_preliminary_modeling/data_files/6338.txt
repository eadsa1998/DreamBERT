I dreamed that I met up with one of my girlfriend's best friends. She was trying to seduce me to sleep with her. I kept saying no, that I cannot. If Kathy ever knew what was going on or, what she said she would kill me. To make a long story short I did sleep with her. When I woke up it was my girlfriend next to me not her best friend. I remember waking up and sweating. I could feel my heart pounding. I realized it was a dream and flung my head back with relief.
