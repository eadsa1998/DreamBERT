On the bus going downtown. Talk to little girl in the seat with me. Two little boys get on separately. At first one sits with us, then crosses the aisle to sit with the other boy. I look up from my reading and out of the window and see gray walls slipping by. It begins to look slummy. Think we should be downtown by now. Have I missed my stop? Look for conductor to ask. Now it seems to be a car in a train. We stop an after a bit, I rush off and call to policeman, "where are we?" but I can't get a response and hurry back to the train. Car is now all made up like a Pullman but with no curtains and white beds. Miss my white handbag and find I went to the wrong seat. See a boy sitting in a seat jammed between two beds. I understand something is loose and that's why we are standing still. At least the conductor comes along and I ask where we are. 100's of miles from the city. I must get back but I have not enough money. The train should pay my way back I cry in distress.
