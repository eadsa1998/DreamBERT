We are in a tunnel with an opening door. Edward is visiting, Frank is still sleeping. Edward embraces me and starts to make love. Feels like Frank. So I think well... if it feels like Frank, I might as well enjoy it. But even then I cannot go through with it. I say to Edward, "We better find a more private place." So we walk through the tunnel, and Edward slips me a $10, in a book that I am carrying. I see Bernice, Sid passes by, she says, "I am going to have a face-lift next week." We then go on to watch a ball game: Frank joins us and we all sit next to each other. I am wearing a hand-knitted, dark-red skirt and hooded top. I take the book and try to shake out the $10, but Edward has taken it back!
