I went in water with Risk.  It seemed like Utah, not here.  It was like a lake, I submersed both of us.  She was in my lap, like I was holding her up in front of me on my legs.  When she came up, she was faded, her color, and her eyes were a much lighter brown, like gold or bleached out.  She was just looking blankly.  I got the feeling she had gone blind.  I was terrified for her.  Someone nearby saw her, and said she would die soon.
