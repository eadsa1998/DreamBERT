Pacey (Dawson's Creek) was with some animals. They joined a group. They drove up in some underground area with water. These other animals killed everyone they could and then we ran (me too) and we jumped underwater. I then took a bus to the shop down the road. It got $30 to get there and I had $108 on my SmartRider. The shop was different and the lady there didn't like me. I called Mom and the lady yelled at me about gambling. They had a notepad thing I wanted to get for my dreams. This other time I went there and it was night. We were in the clothes section and the lady was being nice. There was a board on the wall that mentioned Calvin and I having done something. My Little Lady was playing and I said 'I like this song!'.
