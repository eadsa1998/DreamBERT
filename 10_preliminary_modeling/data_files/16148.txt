It was more humorous than anything. I dreamt that the subwoofer exploded and caused a big fire in my room, and we were all running to get out of the house. And all of a sudden I was at school, and I needed a book from the library. And I went to Mrs. Thayer at lunch time and I was telling her that I needed to check out a book, but then when I got there, my memory went blank and I didn't know, I didn't remember what I wanted to check out. But then I just said, I made up a story that I needed a book about growing plants, and so she took me into the Warrior Vision room and she was looking on the computer for something, the card catalog in the computer. And Mrs. Talmadge was over working with the other people, but, and then I was eating my lunch and she handed me the book, and I said, "Thank you," and she said, "We'll have to make a lunch date some time." And then I was going back to class because the bell had rung, and I had to go across the street over to the Bell Building, and then down and around to the main building. And I never did get to class before I started having another dream. I dreamt that we were at the, we were going to ride our bikes to the mall, and we did and we got there, and I was running along behind Mom and Dad with this pillow. And we decided we didn't want to take the pillow in with us, in the mall, so I ran back to the bike, tossed it in the dumpster and then ran back to Mom and Dad. And then I woke up. [laugh]
