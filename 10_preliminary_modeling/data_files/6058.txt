I had a dream that it was college graduation time, but not my graduation, but I was still going to graduate. It took place in a school gym room. I think it was my high school gym. There were five people to be seated on a platform that faced the spectators. I was one of them. They were all women. At one point another woman had to squish between me and another because there wasn't any room left. After that there was a speaker. She faced us, not the spectators. She was weird-looking, but voguish, she had walkmans on. She recited this weird poem. When she said the last line another speaker also said it at the same time, as if she knew the whole poem. Then we all got up and I assume we were going to a larger room. This is when I saw people that I knew I wouldn't be graduating with, so I left. I walked up some stairs. I was supposed to be in school, but it looked like the Burlington Mall, but without the stores. I got to the ninth floor and went into my Informal Logic class. My teacher made bacon. Everyone got the first piece free, but if you wanted more it would cost 2 cents a slice. There was even a sign on a plate that had the bacon on it.
