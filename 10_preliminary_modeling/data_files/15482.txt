I was with Casey and Sarah (Chuck). We were in a carpark and had to get into some place. Casey had to put on an accent which sounded really bad. Sarah and I were like 'for once, we don't have to put on an accent'. We got in there and there was a computer which scanned fingerprints and illegally had spy information. Casey put his finger on it and it came up with his file. He went to leave and a lady saw it and went after him and caught all of us. We were brought to this torture room 'for the Aussies' and it was a heat room. It was very hot in there, but we got out somehow. Later, I was with a girl and she flashed some guy saying 'he won't let you in otherwise'. We got to the door of this pub/club and he let her in but not me, so I flashed him and he let me in. It separated into 3 sections and only the middle one was open and it was crowded. This girl collapsed in a pool of blood and died. She had just gotten married. There was a young guy at the bar and he said 'there's a bad Christmas flu going around. I developed a cure, but sometimes it kills'.
