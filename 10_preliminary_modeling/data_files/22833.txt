Jesuit High School is suddenly coed.  Sharon and I are going there.  We are commenting on the fact that it is now coed when a tall pretty girl standing near us says, "That's the reason for all the disease."  In the lobby are tables with cakes, pies, etc., just for students to help themselves to, apparently, so I do.  There are also elevators.  In the class I go to with Sharon there is a very strict woman teacher.  She says she is marking me tardy for saying something to the girl in front of me (which I didn't) and not helping her with something.  I don't know what to make of this.  After this class I get lost from Sharon and don't know what class to go to.  I have just started there that day and so has Sharon, but she seems to know where to go and I don't, and I feel very lost.  I try Phys Ed down in the basement.  The coach is a sort of thin, short, wiry man, with a face resembling Johnny Barrett.  He says all juniors (which I am) are required to play football, and it costs $50 each.  I get out of there.
