I had a pet piglet. I was looking all over the house for her. I finally found her in a plastic jug, shaped like the ones you see on a water cooler, but it was a pinkish tone, but still clear, and much smaller. While I was rushing around in a panic trying to figure out what to do for her and how to get her out I kept wondering how she managed to get in their. She was lying on her side and took up almost the entire space inside the bottle. I thought I would find some kind of heavy-duty scissors and try to cut the bottle away. Then I found someone to help and they suggested we rush her to a vet, which we did. It was still too late. They said by the time I found her she had probably already died.
