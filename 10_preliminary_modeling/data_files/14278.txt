I can't remember it properly, but Calvin, Samantha and I were playing a real-life game. I brought this burger and we all had to share it and have a certain amount left over for the next part. It was really saucy and Samantha dared me to eat it and I couldn't resist it and took a big bite. I then put it down and went to talk to Calvin. When I came back, the burger was mostly gone and there were only a few bits left. I asked Samantha if she had eaten it and she said she had. I complained and said we needed to share it or we wouldn't get to the next part.
