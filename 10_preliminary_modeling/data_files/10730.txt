I dreamed I was in a strange town and was meeting a couple who were sitting in a car. They were vague and unknown to me, still it seemed perfectly natural to be seeing them. The next thing I knew I was entering a hospital ward and it was through them that I had been introduced to the people in charge. I seemed to be there in the capacity of observer and some kind of new equipment was being demonstrated to me by a woman doctor. She suggested that we experiment and I should be the subject to test the equipment. Some people in the room were alarmed and asked me not to do it because it was untried and perhaps dangerous. I think I was going to go ahead with the plan when I woke.
