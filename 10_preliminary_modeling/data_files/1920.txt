I get in a car that Dan H is driving. He's not doing it very well. So I decide to drive. Things are slippery and we slide. My brakes don't hold very well. We drive but now it's like a giant stamper or xerox that imprints a page filled with alphabets or listings in alphabetical order. I lay each page or stamp down on the road and we travel, one page at a time.
