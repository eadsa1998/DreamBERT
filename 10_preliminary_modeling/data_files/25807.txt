 I'm landing at Bug River in the Big Resort Area with another person. I go down stairs and paths. There is a small, very neat stream. We're supposed to load at the bank of the building that is there. We wait for the party to arrive. Then I'm going on a trip with my friends Nate Nelling, Beth Mock, and another person. There are two stairway paths: a long one going down and a short one going up. Katie W. Egge is the party we're supposed to launch. She reminds me of the large woman named Katie that I worked at Subway with. We're supposed to launch. We have a 17-foot lightweight aluminum canoe and a yellow Mad River canoe. Beth and the fourth person say they want to get strong, so we should portage a lot. They help carry the packs in. I take the Mad River Canoe. The 17-foot lightweight breaks up into three sections. I say we've got to carry it whole in order to get strong. I think we're headed towards Crescent Lake or Rock River. My mom is there taking photographs. There is a party to our left with Chinese people in it. Three of them are drinking red wine and getting their photograph taken. The three drinking wine stand up and raise their glasses and yell when they get their photograph taken. My mom turns to take our photograph. A Chinese man who has puffy, layered, hair sprayed hair obstructs my mom's view of me. My mom takes a photograph as we smile. She moves only her arm to the left, holding the camera in her hand, to take another. She waits a long time before taking it. I get tired and stop smiling. There is no "click" for the photograph.
