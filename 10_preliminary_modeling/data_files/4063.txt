["Marijuana and Radio Interference"]  I am in a house. A group of women are here to do some project. I am clearing off the dining table. My baby is sitting quietly in a high chair near me. I take a sponge and wipe off lots of crumbs. I'm a bit embarrassed there is so much of a mess. I am in a hurry, so the women don't notice. The plastic tablecloth is actually two of them with different prints sort of stuck together. It doesn't look good. I am quickly thinking if I have any glue or stuff the women will need for the scrap books they are making. I look over to the baby and she is nearly buried under cloth and stuff from the clean up. I feel bad. I tell Ellie, sitting nearby, to put her to bed. I realize it is 9 pm  and she should have been in bed sooner. I feel guilty. Ellie is annoyed I asked her to do this. I glare at her and insist. She leaves with the baby. Now the secretary of state, a woman, enters the room. Some woman is announcing her arrival and how this is related to the use of marijuana as a medicinal plant. I realize they had planted some marijuana in our back yard for this evening's event. We are to get stoned before we do the project. I run out the back door to the garden. I see a man pulling up a marijuana plant by the roots and walking away with it. I see green beans thick on the vines. I go back in to confront the women. I tell them I am upset they would plant marijuana in my parents garden without consulting us. They laugh and say it's not a problem, because the law says you can for medicinal purposes. There's only a small chance of being arrested. I feel silly for making such a fuss, but feel compelled to continue. I half-heartedly explain how upset I am.
