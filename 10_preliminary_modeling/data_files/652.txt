I am doing a group hypnosis in a church, probably the church I attended as a child. We have moved the pews so they are in a diagonal line. People are laying in the pews to be hypnotized and I am upstairs in the choir loft looking down on them. I can't seem to get started because of interruptions. Two girls are there talking about prom dresses. One is pregnant. The other girl is one I thought would be more likely to get pregnant than the one who is. A pink prom dress is hanging on a door. The pews get wet, like from rain, and have to be dried off and we start all over again. Then the priest comes in and doesn't say anything about the hypnosis but I feel he is going to say something so I order everyone to straighten out the pews. The experiment is over.
