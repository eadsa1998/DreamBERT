I was playing a game, I think. This 'God' guy was making things hard for us. One of his obstacles were these tornados in a desert place. One was useful, the others were bad. The last person standing won and that was me. The God guy and I went to this water and had to swim over these waves. At the end there were two 'roll-y' waves on top of each other. The God guy told me to swim under but I was worried. Then I saw Dad through this window next to me. I had let him use my computer to play a Powerpuff Girls game. I told him that I was ok. Then I got the God guy to help me go over the sides. The first time I tried I almost drowned myself. I told him if I did a hand motion it meant I needed air. We got over it and then I was moving fast underwater. I hit the guy and he came up for air. He said he'd gone fast so we didn't have to swim. Then it was Runescape and the world had really pretty houses. He asked if I was going to ask Jagex to keep this and I said "no, I want to do everything myself". Ezra and Dad were then outside somewhere and we were getting hot dogs.
