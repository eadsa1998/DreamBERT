It almost feels as though I am in some kind of house associated with a university. I'm packing. Occasionally I will I don't know. It seems that Darren is there. I'm debating about having a conversation with him, that it's time for him to either move out or at the very least move into a different bedroom. He could tell something was bothering me and he asked me. I finally said, I'm just debating whether I want to have an unpleasant conversation with you right now. As I continued to unpack my closet is pretty full so I asked him if he had thought about either moving all of his things into the spare room or something else. He was not at all happy about that suggestion. There was something about Christmas decorations. Darren had been lying on the floor on his back while I was unpacking. He said something about if he could help. I said, You know, you've just been lying there while I have done all of this. I think it would be fair at least if you could get up and help with this. He got up and started putting his clothes on hangers. I was taking them and putting them in the closet of one of the guest rooms. All of his shirts he was putting on a hanger but he wasn't buttoning the neck button. So I was having to straighten and button. He had a girlfriend and his daughter Annie H.
