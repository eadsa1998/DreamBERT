My "daughter" is helping me put finger nail polish remover on my nails and some spots on my fingers too. It's thick and gooey and it sits for a few seconds and then it's all gone, polish and all. We put some on a paper to remove a few messy spots. It doesn't work as well. Then she reaches into my blouse from the back of my neck and says, "Found these," and hands me two ornate bracelets. There are some red hearts on one, same color as nail polish. I say, "How could I have two bracelets hooked to my bra strap and not know it?" She shrugs and skips away. I am angry at her for using me and lying like that. She must have taken the bracelets and pretended to "find them" in my bra strap. Boy, am I going to scold her when I catch up to her.
