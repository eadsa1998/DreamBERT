I dreamed that I was passing by a country road and noticed a cow and bull on the road. The bull was pulling the womb of the cow. I could see the womb exposed -- in my dream I thought it was the womb -- but it was in the form of the udder of the cow. I just stood by and was horrified by the sight. I tried to run away -- but I could not move. I stood there a9 if glued to the spot.
