 It is the night before a big day of tourism at a slide or ski park area. I'm in a group of people. There is an older man, who is the leader. It is snowing. We are in a room. Two of the people are new to the group: one man and one woman. The woman may be Chinese. We are going to watch a movie or television. The leader asks what time we should get up in the morning. I say we should get up at 7:00am. The television is behind me and to my right. The new Chinese woman is to my right. We must turn around for the show on television.
