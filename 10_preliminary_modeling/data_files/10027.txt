I am in a boat and see large fish jumping out of the water. But I want to SKETCH, not fish! I find large crayons, esp. a green crayon and so I start to sketch.-- I am in a train compartment and find Mitchell in a white flannel night gown drawing circles like a wizard MERLIN. I hear people speaking in esoteric languages.
