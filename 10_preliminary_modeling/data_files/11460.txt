I dreamt that I fired Norm for not doing his job on the yearbook. Norm came into the office after an absence of about three or four weeks. I told him that I was sick and tired of his screwing up on the yearbook and that he could pack up and get out. He asked me what I was talking about and I told him that he knew damned well. I was getting very angry. Finally I told him to get the ell out of the office. Norm worked (supposedly) on the staff on the yearbook. He is about 18.
