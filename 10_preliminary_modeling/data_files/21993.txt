I walked to Fairchance, PA with C. Fisher. We were painting the interior of his house. I had on a good shirt, so I took it off because I had a few spots of paint on it. I was painting a fireplace. There were a couple of holes in the wall. I reached in and pulled out a teaspoon. Then I reached into the other hole and I found some loose change. I counted the money and I had more than a dollar in change. We were by our old home in Rivertown, PA and had the paint mixed for painting of our old home. I was up on the ladder painting the peak. I reached out to one side to paint and the ladder gave or twisted and I had a hard time to pull myself back to the straight position. My sister Mary had an old bucket of paint on the ground. I told her to take it by the street curb and take out the lumps and then to mix the paint well because I would use it. I saw Bull in the paper in the entries.
