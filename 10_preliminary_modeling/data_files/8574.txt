We, at CAS, were doing some kind of job for three different high schools. I was driving to one of the schools and had one of the female students who was involved in the project in the car with me. We got to the school and were talking to some other adult(s) there. Bill C arrived and wasn't happy with something that was going on with one of the schools. It was one that both Bryan N and I were involved in the project. He thought it was my fault. I was just thinking, if it was my fault why is there no problem with the other two schools that only I am handling? There were four objects sitting in front of me. There were about 6 inch square but shaped like a corn hole game box. They each had a circle in the top of them as well - that was indented but not a hole. Three of them were blue and one was colorless - white or clear. The difference in the color of the one had something to do with the problem and I knew Bryan N was responsible for it.
