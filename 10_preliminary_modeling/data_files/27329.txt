I was in a foreign land living in a strange house with a very blonde girl. All of my friends seemed to live in this country too. There were two troops of soldiers also in the town who were friendly with each other although they seemed to be from different nations. one troop dressed in white uniforms and wore black turbans while the other troop wore khaki. My fiance belonged to the khaki group of soldiers. For some unknown reason the troops began to fight and those in khaki formed two lines--the first kneeling, and the second standing behind them. This made a perfect target for the troop in white, and in the fight my fiance was shot and killed. When I heard, I was grief stricken and especially because I was unhappy living with the blonde girl, and also had received bad news from my mother. The blonde continually stole my potato chips which angered me. The bad news was that my dog was very ill and my uncle had given him a blood transfusion. I was very upset.
