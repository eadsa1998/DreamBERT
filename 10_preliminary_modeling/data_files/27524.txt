I dreamt that our cleanlng woman, about 50, who has come into our home for many years, was late in finishing her work, because she was sharpening needles in order to listen to the records of the Roman Catholic Mass. I was helping her sharpen the needles, as I was worried that the woman was working overtime. I seem to remember that the time was 4:35 and her quitting time is 4:00. All through this dream, I had the feeling that time was running out, and that I had to hurry. My parents were around somewhere, too, but I don't remember anything else about them in connection with the dream.
