I was at a railroad yard watching the men work and engine came by with a flat topped car carrying three men. One man was moaning and badly banged up and the other two appeared to be dead. They were taking the men to a hospital. Something happened to me and I was limping with a broken ankle so they took me along to the hospital and when they proceeded to set the ankle. They had quite a hard time and I was in terrible pain and when I left the hospital I had a cast on my entire leg.
