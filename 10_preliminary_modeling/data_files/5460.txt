I had the most vivid series of dreams last night. First, I was at Tony's house watching some play or game show of sorts about the history of his family. His brother and sister were there, and I realized he also had another younger sister. The odd thing was that is family seemed a lot like mine --they were really close and played games together and it was very cute. Then I was in a car pulling out of the driveway, and I realized his house was in this steep, mountainous landscape that I have seen in other dreams as well. Then I had a really gross image of having a gigantic pimple on my cheek. I poked it and the white pus/goo just leaked out in a shiny, white, subcutaneous glob.
