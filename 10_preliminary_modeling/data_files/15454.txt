I was in the car with Mom and Ezra. We went through a drive thru and there were kids shoes on the road. I saw two small animals hopping over the road. I sent Dad a text and post on Facebook saying 'It's my birthday, I'm straight [hair]'. Lots of people sent me birthday messages, so I removed it. There were lots of animals around. I went to Red Rooster and a girl ran to help another girl. The aircon was blowing right on her. Someone was cleaning the toilet doors. There was an Asian movie and this girl talked to a guy talking about her boyfriend and saying that when she was younger she hung around with other people and slept with this guy she liked. But she was actually still a virgin and a guy called her out on it and said 'pathetic'. Someone joked that she needed to do it. She pinched some guy's butt but he thought it was the guy sitting behind him.
