 I'm at a party. We're watching an NBA game. My high school friends Gino Teavor and Daryl Yeller are there. Daryl has lost a lot at the casino, while Gino has won a lot. My friends Kathy Branch, Ivory Alshire, and Cheryl Wrightson are there. Kathy is mad about something. My friend Binky Ahmed and I converse about Dennis Rodman, who said something with 1:30 left in the 3rd quarter of the game.
