I was getting ready to go to teach Hebrew school. I was to be picked up in a few minutes. Per usual, I was rushing about getting dressed. It seems that my clothes were heavy winter ones, boots, ski pants, parka-like hood. Suddenly I felt extremely warm and realized it was a summer day and should be dressed in a cotton dress. I hurriedly changed and went out to the car whose driver (my employer) had been impatiently circling the block due to lack of parking space on my street. He is a 40-year-old Frenchman whom I dislike and with whom I have strained relations.
