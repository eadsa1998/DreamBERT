Dad and Mom and I were on a trip and he was telling me things. First of all, he was explaining to me the things in an elevator, and one of them was like a little hatch that you could talk to other people, and another was like -- I don't remember exactly what. But he was telling all these horror stories as to what could happen in an elevator, and how you could like fall ten stories. I was really nervous when we got on the elevator and went down to the ground floor, but we did. And then he wanted me to ride around the perimeter of this garden. First there was a little place where people could go in with a fan blowing out of it, then there was a little pool, then there was the air conditioner and then there was the other side opposite the house. I went around everything he said, but I didn't go past the air conditioner. So I don't remember anything more.
