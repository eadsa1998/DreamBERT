It was a very short dream. A friend of my mother's and of the family has just come back from a vacation in Mexico and the U.S.A. She just arrived yesterday and in my house we were commenting on her trip. I dreamt that she had arrived and that her youngest son, who is 2, didn't recognize her, and cried. She is 38 and we were all in her house, which is a large and pretty house. However, all of us were in the kitchen, which was small, and we were watching the child crying and not wanting to go near her. And while I was observing them, I was wondering what she had brought me as a present.
