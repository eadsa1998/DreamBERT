Our errands were nearly done. A man looking at our schedule asked by which road we were returning. I said it would be the one which had the first train after we finished our errands. He said she would like to go to a show. I had no money left. "I'll pay your way." So we started but I said we might be too late. She said that wouldn't matter. They wouldn't note how late we were.
