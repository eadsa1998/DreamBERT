I was with some people and there was a group of people dressed in green who decided to come after us. We ran down a street and this guy and I ducked into a hotel building. The people went back because all the buildings were closed. One of them came in to the hotel and followed us. They confronted us on a balcony thing. We ended up getting away. Then we were running up stairs and they all looked the same. Every floor above us had people waiting. I said to the guy we should duck into this room. They opened the door and I waited to hear the cock of a gun but there was none; it was just a guy reading something and he said it was boring. We ended up in this big gym like room. One guy was Timothy Olyphant. There were 2 doors and 2 cops came through. There was a ladder up to this area which had another door out. This guy went up and I couldn't reach, so I put my arms around the guy from before and he climbed up. The door led to these air ducts which were made of tent-like material. The guy from the room caught on fire. I grabbed something in the duct and it collapsed and they shot the guy and put him in the fire.
