I was visiting my doctor because I was pregnant. He was concerned that I was getting enough calcium. I was trying to tell him how much I consume each day in dairy products, thinking that it was enough. When I started telling him I realized that it wasn't as much as he wanted me to consume. I knew I was going to have to start drinking three 12 ounce glasses of milk a day instead of the 1 or 2 that I currently drink.
