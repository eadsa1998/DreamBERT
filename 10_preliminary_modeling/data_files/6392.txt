My brother and I were standing outside of a giant green lake. I knew that this was a "sea world" kind of thing, where there were shows and stuff. At any rate, we were standing on a ledge which was perched over this giant pool with green water, and I noticed two people in the far corner of the lake: an old lady in a diving suit and my dad, talking to her. My brother, I guess, fancied himself a performer of some sort, and he was standing at the very edge of our ledge, threatening to jump into the lake at the next exhibit. I could see that he held in his hand several sheets of music, professionally printed, with each bar being two half-note chords, second-inversion ninth chords in C. Each chord was the same chord. I could see seaweed and other things floating around in the lake, and I decided to ask my brother whether jumping in was such a good idea; does he know how deep it is in there? <br/
