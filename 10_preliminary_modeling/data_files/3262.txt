I am at a resort, looking out a window at the ocean far down below. I enjoyed watching the waves and marveled how high they could come up the cliffs and how they worked back toward the sea with such foamy power. I get up to pack, because it's time to go home. I have trouble gathering up all my stuff. Lucy is also packing and her things are mixed with mine. I hold up a blouse on a hanger which also has a small girl's dress on the hanger. It belongs to her. I am a bit frustrated because I don't really want to leave, and some men have sat at my good spot by the window so I can't watch the waves and Lucy's stuff keeps slowing me down. I get to the truck and discover lots of Lucy's stuff under it. I am annoyed. She asks me where her laundry basket is. I see a yellow plastic laundry basket by the wheel of the truck, and lots of clothes, papers, boxes of things. Now I see that the things on the truck are just laying around loose. I start to pack them into drawers in the dresser to keep them from flying away when we get going. A plastic package of honey is there and I wonder if I should put it in the drawer, because it could break and make a mess.
