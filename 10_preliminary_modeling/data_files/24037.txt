I don't remember the beginning, but I do remember that I went over to this girl I am not friends with house and her dad and older brother were there. I remember seeing a stone fireplace in her house. Her dad was really nice. Her older brother was strange. He lived in their house, only there was a gate to his room. I remember feeling kind of uncomfortable and her brother seemed high or something. I also remember something about a pig.
