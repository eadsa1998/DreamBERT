I and another member of my family (either my father or my mother) were sitting huddled on the stairs. Someone was sitting on the landing above, fishing, and we kept trying to keep out of reach of the hooks. I imagine we could have gotten away but somehow we had to stay. In another fragment of the dream I was driving a truck and two of my school friends were with me. We went from store to store buying books. I could see myself shifting gears &amp; even said in the dream, "Now put her in second, now third," etc.
