This dream took place, it was very vague, in some kind of an office. I was working for an advertising agency or public relations firm, and it was my job or my task to push over, get into the press that I was, the fact that Rambler station wagons were the largest selling used car in the U.S. And it was my task to work this in such a way that a newspaper would pick it up and not think that it was an advertisement, that it was a regular release.
