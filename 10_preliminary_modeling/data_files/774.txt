After the wedding, a friend and I were sitting in the auditorium. A good looking guy (minister) sat down next to me. My friend was talking to him. "Oh," she said loudly for my benefit "you're not married." I looked over at him and started talking and really looking at him. He was very nice, sympathetic. Then a bus, lots of people on another as it passed.
