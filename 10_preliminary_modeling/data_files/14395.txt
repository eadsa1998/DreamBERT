It was the day before Ivan's funeral. There was a thing on and Mom and Darren were going and I said I wasn't. When they were about to leave I changed my mind. I was trying to find something that was ok to wear. I went out the front and Mom and Darren took off without me. I got in my car and followed them and was driving really badly, mostly on purpose. They stopped and decided to take me. It was near the sea, on a big boardwalk thing. There were a few rows of chairs. We sat in them and these people were talking about him. This girl was sitting next to me and I was talking to her about stuff. I think she was Regina. I was telling her about how I'd used my last name as a name for something and some other naming method which was quite spiffy. Later, she got famous and stole my ideas. Her last name was 'Damn'. I complained about it. We were still at the boardwalk thing. I left to go to the toilet. I was walking back and there was a confusing path. I walked down the wrong one and then had to walk back down it to get back to the boardwalk. Everyone was walking down a jetty to a submarine thing. I ran to get there before it left. There were no barriers on the thin jetty and I almost fell into the water. I managed to get in. I felt sick and we were moving. They explained there were holes in the control room, so that if there was a leak, a corresponding hole would spurt out water so they'd know where the leak was.
