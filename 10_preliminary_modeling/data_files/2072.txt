I am alone on a desert island and have been there for 10 years. I am naked and live in a cave and have all I need, except companionship. I see a boat landing and men coming up and out of the surf. I go there and the captain is threatening them with a gun. He follows me to my cave and ask me lots of questions. How old was I when I got there? Nineteen years. How old am I now? Twenty-nine years. He showed me a map of N. America and W. Germany. Did I recognize my island, Nol? I'm more around south, but I did see the scientist "Roe" that he is looking for. "Did you have sex with him?" I angrily ask, "Who do you think you are? My father?" He follows me and wants to go into my cave where I live, but I am aloof. I had not given him permission. He waits. I start to warm up to him.
