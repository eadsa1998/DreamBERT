I'm upstairs in a large house where several rooms interconnect. In the dream the house belongs to my aunt Bella and my uncle Bobby. I'm looking for the bathroom, so I venture through a door only to find I have walked into the apartment next door, where Bobby's brother is hosting a dinner party. The guests all look up from the table. I make awkward apologies and then leave.
