I'm at a hotel. I see some people perform. I go back to my hotel room to get my script. I find part of it. Then I realize some girls in the room next door destroyed my script. They are aiming a gun at me from a hole in the wall. It squirts water. I try to duck but I get wet. They are angry at me. Maybe I stole their man. I try to piece together the script. Someone says, "You can come on stage as my assistant." I am quite displeased. To just be an assistant? Then they suggest I can probably remember the script anyway.
