Last night I also dreamed that I came out of my house accompanied by my cousin (male and 23) looking for a drugstore. We went by car. Suddenly we arrived at a strange neighborhood and asked a man who was standing on a corner whether he knew the drugstore and he told us to go on to the corner and turn right. I got out of the car alone and went looking for it. When I turned the corner, I somehow got to a big room which was filled with boys who were Japanese and had long hair. Fearing that I wouldn't be safe, I put on a wig, but my eyes and my behavior gave me away. One of them got up to tell the others that I didn't belong to their group. When I saw this, I took off my wig and started to run as fast as I could, and I was chased by one of them, and when he was about to catch me, my dream was interrupted.
