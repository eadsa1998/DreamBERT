["Stealing my things."] I live in a house. People start coming in the back door without permission. 1st it's one, then another and more and more. They are taking things and leaving, then returning for more. I am angry at them and a little scared, but I do try and stop them. I call out to them to stop. They ignore me. I stand in front of one plump big guy and try to block his way. He threatens me. I feel afraid of him, but I don't back down. I just hope he doesn't hurt me too badly. He walks around me and continues to take things. I decide to call 911 for the police, realizing as I thought it that of course it won't work it never does. But I try anyway. I never even find the phone. Finally I give up. They're too many of them and what the hell, maybe I'll be better off without all this stuff anyway.
