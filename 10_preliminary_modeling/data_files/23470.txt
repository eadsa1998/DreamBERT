I was in a store and was going to buy some maple syrup. All the bottles were real syrup. They are just half full for some reason and some of them have lids. I'm trying o get the best tasting one. My dad just wants some store-brand syrup. My mother takes some of the syrup and makes a paste with it and puts it in her mouth. She has it on her lips and says it tastes good. Then I went home to my grandmother's house and I was very happy to see her.
