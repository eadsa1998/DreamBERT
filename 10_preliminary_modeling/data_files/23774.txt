I dreamed I made love to myself.  There were two of me - me, and the me I was making love to.  I saw my face and myself very close up.  I saw myself smiling very close up.  I realized I could finally know what it was like for someone to make love to me if I did it to myself.  I kissed my face, then my own lips, I touched the skin on my face and neck, touched the genitals on the me that I saw next to me.  I wetted my fingers and touched me.  The other me responded just as I would.  And I was fascinated knowing, finally, what it was like for a man when he made love to me.  The man I had in my mind, as I imagined what it was like for a man with me, was Lynn, and the cabin feeling was in the background.  I came in my sleep and it woke me up.  As I awakened, my hand was moving on the pillow as if touching me but I was coming without direct stimulation.]
