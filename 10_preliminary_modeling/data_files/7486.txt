I am in the kitchen, fussing around, trying to make breakfast. Everything is chaotic. There are many people present -- some are children -- but I have no idea who anyone of them are. The items I need to make breakfast are scattered all over the place, and in two different rooms. When I find the eggs, they are either broken, or rotten, or break in my hands as soon as I pick them up. I am getting very angry and impatient. Then I see Mary. She looks terrible. Her face is very thin and gaunt. She is losing weight even as I look at her. She is in pain and tells me that this is caused by her medication. I take her in my arms, hug her, and try to ease the pain for her. I see a couple of men (I don't know who they are). They are looking for directions to get somewhere. I leave Mary and go to them to give them the directions they need.
