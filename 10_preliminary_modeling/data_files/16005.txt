I was staying at this hotel type of thing. I had a room down one end but it was open and Nana had a room at the other end. Frederick had a room down the hall and we were dating or sleeping together or going to. I was waiting for him and went to his room to see what he was doing. He had to do something first. I was glad Nana's room was on the other side in case anything happened.
