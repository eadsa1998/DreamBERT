I dreamed I was in one of the laboratories, I'm not sure which one at school. Alan F. was, the whole class was there, and Alan said something to me I didn't like or something. I'm not sure. I picked him up from behind and wrapped my arms around his chest. When I picked him up, I was supposed to have picked him up from off the floor. I walked around the room with him, all the way around outside the room. I did this twice. The class was laughing. They thought it was pretty funny. Alan, I don't think he liked it at first, but he couldn't do anything about it, so he went along with it.
