Helo (Battlestar Galactica), Dad and I were invited into some secret thing. It had something to do with The Hulk and there was a picture of it. Mom and I burned all the evidence. Some people came for dinner and Mom slipped up. I was in the other room and pretended not to notice. Dad was also at the table. We found at later he was involved and when we found out he said we could have our account back. Then they captured Helo and tired him up and tortured him. He told them everything within a few minutes. It turned out I was the secret. They got me and I said to treat me like a human being or I'll just sit here. This guy came over and I moved away. Helo cleaned himself up. Then Ezra and I were in a shop and I think he was trying to kill some animals at a pet shop using a bowling ball. I tried to stop him and he tried to kill me. Something exploded. He threw something at a window, which smashed. We had a fight in a clothes shop. He was like 'it was supposed to explode', so I ran. Then a window exploded and started sucking everything in. We both ran through this carpark into the forest. I was then walking along with a girl and it was foggy. There were 3-4 African girls somewhere. I got to this place and I had a puppy and other animals. I let them out. This girl had a dog and it had white stuff coming out of its bum and I told everyone to be careful.
