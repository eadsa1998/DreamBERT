I was watching TV with my boyfriend. I remember being surprised that I was dating this person because I'm just friends with him at school. He tells me that he's going away for a while and will be back Saturday. Then he is gone. My "family" is the cast from the TV-show "party of five." I'm hanging out with them and they tell me that I should stop seeing this guy because of something. I do not remember if it was said what. The oldest brother of the "Party of five" go to the airport to pick up my boyfriend and that's when I woke up.
