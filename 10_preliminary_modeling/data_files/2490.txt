A young man is a good wrestler but he didn't register on time so he can't officially wrestle. He wrestles because he's good and enjoys doing it. He's so good that his opponent takes a long time even being able to move from the start position. Later he and a midget wrestle as a demonstration. Everyone is impressed.
