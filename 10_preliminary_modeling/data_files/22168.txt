I dreamed about someone who was supposed to be the father of my Uncle Felix, who was not the father of my father. This gentleman was tall, gray-haired, about 80 and dressed in dark colors. I was in a house, hugging him, and I cried because he said he was going to die and then my dad and my uncle came and they also cried. I don't know how to interpret this because the father of my dad and my uncle, that is my grandfather, already died. The house which was the scene of the dream wasn't seen clearly.
