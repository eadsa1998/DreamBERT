["Shaky Ponds And Love"]  I am walking with my sister Lydia, my brothers Dwight and Jake.  Another man, perhaps a distant cousin, named James is with us.  We are looking at many tables and booths where people are selling jewelry and other items.  Someone is dragging a long white sheet.  I lie down on the sheet, thinking it is funny.  Dwight is upset, and says get off the sheet.  There are hites on the sheet, and they will hurt you. They will bite you.  I laugh, not too worried, but I do get up and walk.  We go up and down many levels, looking at all the things on the tables.  I decide I want a long beautiful crystal necklace.  I turn back and walk to those tables.  A short round man follows me.  He professes his love to me.  I keep walking.  I looked to my left. I see a large pond.  It is shaking and the water is very active.  I say oh, No. Do we have  to cross this pond again?  As we continue walking, I see that we can walk around it.  And now James has decided he loves me.  He calls a friend over, to witness his proposal of marriage.  He holds his arms out to me, and I walked to him to hug him.  We are going to be married. The other man has found another woman and they love each other.
