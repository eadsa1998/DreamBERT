I was at the race track. I saw the board when the race was going and I saw the PP numbers coming up. It ended with W first and there was another two about 5th or 6th, so they changed pp 7 win. I wanted to know who was going to win the 7th race at Hialeah today. I was standing beside a barn or something looking in. It was loaded with all kinds of animals. They were running in and out of their compartments.
