I had a meeting with Bill C and Blair K in a restaurant. There was another woman with me but I don't know who. When we arrive at the restaurant, Bill C and Blair K are there already. We sit down at the table and Bill C doesn't say anything to me for a while. I went to use the restroom at the restaurant and I was thinking about the fact the when I took my shower that morning I was in a hurry and didn't have time to wash my hair. I was feeling self-conscious about this so I decided to take a shower in the restroom at the restaurant and wash my hair. Bill C finally asked me what I'm doing now. I tell them that I'm teaching at UI and ITI. People at tables around us all are reacting positively to my announcement that I'm teaching at UI and ITI. Bill C congratulates me and I put both of my hands in front of me with my thumbs up. As I do that I accidentally brushed the hair of a waiter who is bent over in front of Blair K. The waiter is a middle-aged gentleman with medium build and thick, wavy, salt and pepper hair. His uniform is red, black and white. I'm trying to figure out what Bill C and Blair K's reaction really is, whether they're happy for me whether they're just being nice or they're possibly a little surprised. At the restaurant Bill C is sitting across from me, Blair K is sitting to my left perpendicular to me, and the woman I went there with is sitting to my right, parallel to me.
