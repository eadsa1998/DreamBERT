I take a new job as director of operations for a retail chain. I'm working for a woman. I go through orientation with her on my first day. When we finished I asked her if I could look at the operations manual. She tells me where I can find it. When I go to get it I see an accordion file. In each of the pockets of the file there are one or more stenographer notebooks. I pull one out, open it up, and look at it. It is a notebook from 20 years ago. It has notes that I had written from the store visits. Each of the pockets represents one of the districts that I used to visit at work with. I can't believe that she still has those, that they are still there, that I found them. As I'm reading through some of them I realize that there are also personal notes in them. Even then I had the tendency to write personal notes into whatever notebook I had with me wherever I was or what ever I was doing. Then, when I would get home, I would go through my notes and copy the personal notes on to another document. I went to my supervisor and told her that I found these. I don't know if I intended to ask for or if I actually did ask her if I can have those notebooks. I couldn't imagine why they would still want them or need them after all these years. I didn't want to tell her that there was personal information in them.
