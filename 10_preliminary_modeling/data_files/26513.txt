 I enter an Armstrong High School basketball game. I am dressed up, wearing long pants, a shirt, and a belt. I have on a light turquoise colored winter cap that extends over my ears. My dad is there. I walk past the coach Jackson Shooter. He doesn't notice me. I walk by him again near the end of the court. He comments on my appearance and says I look good. Someone may also comment on my facial hair. I give the coach a wink and a cocky point with my hand, as if it were a gun, with my thumb pointed up and my index finger extended. I sit with two good male friends. One of the Lorenz family girls takes the hat off my head, saying it is hers. This is the second time today that someone has taken my hat.
