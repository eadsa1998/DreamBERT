I walked down a railroad track with a tire tube. I had a flashlight. It was night and dark. I saw the headlight of an engine coming down the track. I got off the track and poured some gasoline on the tube, then put the valve stem submerged in it so the gas would enter into the tube. The engine was near now, so I told my friends to hold their heads down as it passed and we would not be seen. I was with Kenny and Steve K. from Dill's. We were trying to put on a big cover on a ball like which was about three feet in diameter, but had a hard time getting it on so it would cover the ball like a cover that is on a baseball. Then we had Steve to act as the ball and we tried to cover him like we would a ball, but it wouldn't work. Then we were talking of doing chin-ups. We had clothesline ropes strung across. I said that was too weak to hold us up. There was an alligator and a cat or turtle. I'm not sure now. The alligator jumped up and he went up like a rocket, then came down. The turtle also went face on the ground and the alligator chased him, then jumped on the turtle's back. The turtle went up a tree fast, then made a quick stop, which made the alligator fall off going up the tree.
