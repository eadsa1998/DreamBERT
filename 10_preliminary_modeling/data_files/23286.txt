I dreamed that I was standing on a small shed and that a mad bull was trying to get at me. He circled round the building and made wonderful leaps to gain the roof. At each plunge he would get his fore-hoofs upon the shingles, "scrabble" furiously, and fall back. I had a pair of lawn shears with which I prodded his head.
