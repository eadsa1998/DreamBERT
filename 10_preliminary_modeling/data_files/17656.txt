I was on some sort of school trip.  My old classmate Jim Schumann was there, wearing shorts.  We were in the water in a docking area, holding onto the docks.  It was dark.  I went into a shack of some sort with a propane tank in it.  Then down at the other end of a dock there was a room with a bunch of aquariums full of rodents.  Some of the rats had escaped and we were trying to get them back in.
