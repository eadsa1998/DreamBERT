I was at home. I made a ham and pickle sandwich and left in on a plate in the sink. I came back a while later and it had fallen into some water. Then, it was a chicken sandwich and there was a chicken on the breakfast bar. I started making two vegemite sandwiches and noticed there was this white, cream looking stuff in it. I was wondering what it was. I then found some light brown stuff too and I thought it was poo, and thought maybe it was like the Hide-the-Poo game. I told Dad and we were reading the ingredients and they were new. It was also supposed to have a red crab in it. I decided not to have a sandwich.
