I was driving around the town where I went to high school. It was night. Late night. I was trying to find a place to write. I was going through my notes on my computer, and as I scrolled, the road moved with me. The car moved in reverse along the street. I had a hard time steering with one hand and writing. Then, like video, the world changed and began playing forward in real scenes places I have been that I had supposedly written about, like full motion video. And I could interact. Copy editor Emily Sherbourne was there. It was mildly antagonistic. We tease each other. We were doing that then in a flirty way. Before I began driving, I was in a building that was supposed to be the newspaper building where I work, but much less transparent. It was solid. The elevator opened up and Emily came in. We chatted. Then the doors opened again and it was the actress Cameron Diaz. She said to call her Cam. This was surprising. We rode down and made small talk.
