My wife Bonita and I were driving somewhere late at night, and she wanted to stop for some ice cream, so we stopped at a little crossroads diner.  The service was slow, and they didn't have the kind she wanted, only the three common flavors, so we got up and left without being waited on, and I felt a bit conspicuous.
