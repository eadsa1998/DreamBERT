Charles Charvat and I were forced into a holdup of a company's funds out of a safe. We were inside and couldn't go out or away because we would be shot. My mother and other people were looking for us because we were late getting home. They were running. I was sneaking in them so they wouldn't spot me. I came to a berry bush and picked berries. I saw Grandpas Lasko. I called him and he came to me so close and then turned away and walked, but didn't say anything when I said, "How are you?" I could see his shadow around the corner as he went around it. The fellows from St. Clair were autographing theirs on a wall in Gordon Park. Hlabshe was the last one on these. I was by Gill Grove's home and she gave us the money we loaned her. It was about $28 or $29. I said, "If you need it, keep it or part of it." She said she had $5 and that was enough for her. Ann and I were praying and a priest came by and was happy and silent as we prayed. Then he told us of some dreaded disease that people get and what horrible pains they get. The priest was lighting candles and there was a statue of Christ that seemed to be partly burned away. He put the lighter on Christ's body and it began to smolder. The priest looked and touched the statue's chest and he was sort of frightened. Frank was there. He was going for some water, but the statue called him back. Then the lake water came in and up to where Christ's chest was burning and it was put out. Ann and I were sitting up above on a bank and watching it. Frank came to our house and alone.
