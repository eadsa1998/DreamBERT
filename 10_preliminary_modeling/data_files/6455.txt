So! I'm working at the Hillside Library, with Will. But today, even though it's insanely busy, he's not helping out at all. He's on the phone, talking with his boyfriend Bryan, who currently lives in Boulder or Denver. Right then Will walks out, and I pick up the phone to see what they're talking about. I say "Hello? Hello?" but they completely ignore me: in the background, quietly, they're talking about stocks. Finally one of them addresses me directly, and says: "You know, there's some kind of SubGenius thing going on in town tomorrow..." <br/
