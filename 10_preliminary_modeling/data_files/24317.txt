I'm on the run with Cameron and Sarah Connor (characters from Terminator). We're in a beat-up old truck. Though Sarah turns against me. Or at least wants me to go along with a plan I don't agree with. I decide to dash away from them. I don't have any weapon, so they know I probably can't get far. I find a big tree and climb up into the crook of its branches. It is filled with leaves and ferns and dirt and dead branches. I say to myself, if you want to survive, you need to go all-out. And so I bury myself up to my chest in the detritus.
