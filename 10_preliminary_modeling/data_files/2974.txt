I am in an apartment that is across a street from a gas station. A man comes over and says that this could be mutually beneficial for me and the man who owns the station. I have something he wants and he has something I want. The man comes over, kind of a geek, and says, "Oh, by the way, I owe you some money because I helped myself to some tags for hunting and I need to pay you now." And I say, "Oh, really? Well, then you should also pay me interest because you didn't even ask." He laughs and tries to weasel out of doing that. Now he and another man and I are walking, still dickering about the money, and he wants to be my honey. He asks and I say no. He then puts his hand/arm around my shoulder and I walk out from under his embrace. That makes him mad. He's kind of like a wealthy black man, only he's white. I go into a closet to find a pretty dress to wear and he is watching jealously.
