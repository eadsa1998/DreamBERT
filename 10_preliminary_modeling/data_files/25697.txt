 I'm in my neighbor Wilma and Gary Stein's yard. It is winter, and cold outside. There are some young, naked people in the yard dying. The youngest is a small toddler, who is cut loose from something by a tire. Three people from the group can die at once. I chase my classmate Al Livern, who is in the lilac tree. He runs away. I chase him. We fight. I smash his nose into my knee, and his nose bleeds profusely. My nose bleeds a little bit too. I think of my high school classmate Tom Dement. I know Tom bled when he was in this situation. The three young people are dispersed in the yard, separated, to die at once. I either want this to stop, or I want four people to die at once: one in each corner of the yard.
