I am walking out with a man (Clint Eastwood). He is very tall. I look up at him and feel love and warmth. I wishfully say, "Are you going to try and change me?" He smiles and says NO. That's not right. He goes on to tell me that he's the strong and silent type. I shouldn't try to make him talk. The feeling was that I was already too verbal and made a lot of annoying noise. I need to really "listen" to the quiet and the feelings. I feel sad, because I like verbal and am good at it.
