I went to see Dr. Cooperman with Barbara and Audrey. His office was changed. He went up on a high wall to get into his office. It seemed to be off the basement in our old house. There was a lot of rubbish around I was to get rid of. I picked up a bottle. It seemed to have oil of some kind. Cooperman called me in, then he got a book of pictures and said Audrey looks like this girl, a certain hairdo and Barbara like another picture with a certain hairdo. Ann got pies for everyone.
