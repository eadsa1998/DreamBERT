I was chasing someone. I saw Jeremiah, who I didn't recognize, and asked him if he'd seen anyone. He said no, but kept looking around. I saw the person and continued to run after them. I caught up with them behind this building and they gave my DS to Eugene, who I also didn't recognize. He said he had nothing until he got this DS. He gave it back to me and I put it in my pocket.
