 (My recollection of this dream was prompted when I saw a minivan today on the road.) I am in the Crossroads Shopping Mall parking lot with my mom. We are leaving in the car. My brother Wally is there, and is driving a minivan. I ask my mom where Wally got the minivan. She says that he bought it. I ask how he can afford it, and my mom says that she doesn't know. We drive out of the parking lot.
