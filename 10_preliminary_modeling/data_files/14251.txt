I went to the shop with Mom. She bought some expensive thing and I got a little hook thing for my wall. At the checkout the lady said it came to some amount "plus 1000". As we left I asked if my hook had cost $1000 and Mom said no it only cost $1.50. As we were going to the carpark, we walked past a black van that was pulled up on some grass next to the carpark which was for a radio station. I walked past to go to the car and Mom walked towards it. I saw Hamish Blake and another guy walking towards it. I looked back when I was almost at the car and they were looking over my way. I was then in the car and they came over singing to this girl, asking her why she didn't come over, and she was laughing and embarrassed. They came over to my side of the car and touched the door doing a funny dance, which made it lock. I discovered the other guy was Merrick Watts. They were messing outside for a while and I was trying not to laugh. I was thinking I should get a photo with them but I thought it seemed too dodgy to ask. They gave a girl from school some Cheeto's and Lillian asked for a couple and the girl just handed her the packet angrily. Lillian was like "I'd love to get chips off them". I was then at Mom's, which was different. I woke up and I went to get something to eat. I found chocolate biscuits and chocolate and stuff in the fridge, which I got excited about. There were Spongebob toys on the bench. Mom said they were cool.
