I am hosting a Tonight Show kind of thing and the guests flake out and I carry the whole show. After it is over, I go to my bed to rest. I am exhausted. Capt. James T Kirk (William Shatner) comes to my house because he wants to make love to me. We are already lovers and he is hot for me. He comes in and tells the other people in the house to make themselves scarce. We'll want privacy. One woman says OK, but she's had a hard time today. He says, "I know, the show. They flaked out on her and she had to carry it all." The woman says, "And she came home and had the chills. She may have the flu." William says, "Oh, well, if she doesn't feel like making love, then we won't. We'll just enjoy being together." He comes to my bedroom and says "Hi," and grins, implying his wishes. I sort of groggily smile. He goes back to the living room and is talking to a man when I get up, in panties and a blouse and take off my bra as I walk into the room where he is, now all hot to trot myself. I wave the bra seductively and he grins and excuses himself and we go to my room and make passionate love, to create a baby. It must be done right at that moment. The position is strange, but feels quite normal in the dream. He's laying on his tummy and I sit on his butt. I see the bald spot on the back of his head and kiss it tenderly. Later, we have children and live in this house with many rooms. I see a bedroom where the walls and floor are scuffed and wood chips flaking up and needs to be cleaned up, a dressing room with a curved wall mirror is between two guest bedrooms. In the living room down the hall is a huge gold couch with many sections. I walk in and grin at him, because it is time to make love to have another baby. He gets up and shoos the kids away. He puts an audio tape cassette up my vagina we are in a hurry because we are driven to do it at this very moment in order to get pregnant. We make love; it is great.
