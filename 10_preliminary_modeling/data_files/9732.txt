I volunteer to do some organizing of games on a playground: hear Hank M. (leader of small group discussions) give a Lenten talk: very liberal, provocative and favoring intermarriage of Japanese girl and white boy; laughter. Father Andrew gives a class: has chart to call names; very correct; on the way home I say: "Father Andrew, could at least have memorized the names." <br/
