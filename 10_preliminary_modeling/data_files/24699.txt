I was at Sydney and JC's house. We were playing games. Then my cousins came and we went bowling. I was at a strange school. It was almost Halloween. We were putting Halloween stickers on our lockers. Jenna was getting hers and the principal was telling a story about a mean college girl. Setting: At Sydney and JC's house and at school. Characters: My neighbors, my cousins, Jenna (a friend at school) and the principal (unknown). Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. It was a pretty normal day.
