I am a counselor. I am asked to temporarily be a health worker and diagnose a patient. I enter the examining room. A woman and her husband are there. I tell them I am a counselor but I will do the best I can. I then walk down the hall to try and get more expert advice. I think they both have Multiple Sclerosis.
