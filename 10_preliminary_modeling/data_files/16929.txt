In the dream my friend Terry and I went to a brothel. We were a bit nervous, but sure about going through with it. We're in a big house with several rooms. Three girls came out. There were also a couple of men there - they were probably security guards. Of the three, one was very pretty, and had dark hair. Terry said "I'll go with her" pointing out the pretty one. He and the girl disappeared off, leaving me with the other two. I said "OK, I'll pay for the Blonde one". So I paid and we were led to a room. She led me in, and said "I've just got to do something, I'll be back in a moment". After a long time I went back out to the lounge because she didn't come back. I spoke to one of the men and he introduced me to a new lady, who was apparently the hostess - she had dark hair and was very attractive. She smiled and we went back to the room together.
