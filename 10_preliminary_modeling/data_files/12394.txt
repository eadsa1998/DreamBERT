I was at some fair. We ended up at a park, with a big court 'inside' these fences. Dad, Mom and Ezra were there too. These guys were chasing us. They caught up and let me go -- for now -- and were going to kill Mom. I could barely walk and I went up a hill to a house. I then called the cops who sounded bored and didn't do anything. One guy then was looking for me. Later, I was back at the fair and talking to this guy. He was a bad guy but I had forgotten who had been there. He said something and then shot his gun somewhere. This other guy started shooting. I went over and I didn't know if he was good or bad, but he ended up in hospital and then I believed that he was good.
