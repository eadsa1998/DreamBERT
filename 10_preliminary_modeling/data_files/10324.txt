We are at a Retreat Center gathering; I call Frank to pick me up and it is raining; some confusion; at one point I am with a couple and their baby and I keep putting on the baby's blue hat; finally I get into our Honda and drive smoothly down our street: suddenly my car turns into a bicycle and I pedal as fast as I can. I see Reynaldo on his bicycle riding behind me and he carries a gallon of milk and is not holding onto the handlebars. He is wearing a red T-shirt; we laugh and when I get home I call Frank to explain why I left.
