There was a virulent new religion, very dogmatic and oppressive. Sort of a stony atmosphere -- my husband had been outspoken against it and had had to flee; I had an invitation to go to church on Friday morning with my children, and knew I had to go if I wanted to survive around this place. My husband had fled to Canada, where he had worked hard to find a job -- selling extra heavy sheets to Canadians -- and to buy a life insurance policy for 10,001 dollars so he would provide for me if anything happened. He had also managed to find a room right over our home, where he could hear the sounds of his son learning to talk (naturally Canada is up). I didn't know what had happened to him; but he managed to slip away and see me for a few minutes, so I knew he was alright.
