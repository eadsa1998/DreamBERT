["Running with the wolves."] I am at some gathering of women, maybe a university campus. The women seem distant and unsociable. They all begin to walk out toward the woods. I follow and soon realize that they are really wolves in human form. I become frightened. I run and they chase me. I desperately climb a tree. The wolves jump and growl threateningly at the base of the tree. I am high enough up that they can't get me. However, I see a black panther in the tree and in order to save myself I pretend to roar very ferociously at it. I am afraid but somehow it worked and the panther leaps over me and runs away to another tree. Now later, I am coming back to the campus. The women are gathered to do some performance. One woman draws a circle and chants and drums. I am suddenly hypnotized by this and lean into the circle, laying my hands and arms into it. I transform into a wolf, huge glowing eyes, big teeth and growling vicious personality. I growl and threaten. Then I run. I am being hunted down. I crawl into the bushes and slink up hill under cover, I am still in human form, but I am a wolf. Or at least I am experiencing things as a wolf. I come around a corner and peer down an embankment. I see a half grown boy playing with his baby chickens, ducks and bunnies. My eyes glitter in hungry anticipation. I slouch down the embankment and swoop down on the unsuspecting innocents. I eat the ducklings and am approaching the bunny. The human part of me is aghast that I would eat live creatures and hates the sounds of it dying. The wolf part doesn't care. It just takes and eats.
