["Speech contest."] I am with a few people in a room. Someone says we should give our speeches now. I am not prepared yet. I'd been making notes but I hadn't practiced it yet. I say ok and go to the front of the room and improvise as best I can. I am talking about four toys I hold in my hand. A thin green rubber figure, a squarish pink thing, and two others. As I give the speech, I realize this is merely a rehearsal and wish it were the real contest because I'm doing OK and don't want to have to do it again. I finish and then it is time for the contest in the other room. I go there and sit quickly down on a weird single bed with a rubbery covering. It bounces another speaker around suddenly. The judges (several women) have spiked hair do's. I remember I had just washed my hair and hurriedly brush it to get the tangles out. Now I am back in the other room looking for the judges grade on my speech. I look through a pile of papers seeing numbers and dates and letter grades. The pile goes from A'' to B'' to C''. I don'' see mine. I keep searching for it. I hope I at least got a B.
