I'm going to the toilet in this open space - the building is where I work, I think - the toilet is located at the end of a wall between two areas, and faces some seats. There's a couple of women sitting there, and there's a man sitting up on the wall - I think in an opening of some sort, he sits up there to oversee whatever goes on below, like a lifeguard. He's chatting with the women some. I've got a gas problem, and am very uncomfortable. I sit and try to let it out very slowly and not make any noise, but it takes a long time and they're noticing and snickering. There's also a man in the space behind me, and he notices too, but he's trying to be polite and not look. The guy on the perch says something aloud to the women, and I really feel angry and humiliated. I glare up at him, and say "Fuck you" - muttering, not wanting to start an argument. But he gets angry, jumps up and climbs down. He comes over to me on the toilet, waggles his fingers and says, "Come with me." He's playing offended, and apparently means to turn me in for being insolent or insubordinate. I get up and walk with him, saying, "I wonder if you've really thought about this." I'm thinking, even if he reports me to somebody, I've got a very good case here, he's the one who ridiculed me, in front of others - even the man behind me was laughing. I'm picturing myself defending in front of somebody, and them realizing what a jerk he is, and they'll probably turn on him. I ask him where we're going, and he says, "Oh, about 10 floors up" - he's very supercilious. I realize he means to report me to the director. Oh, please. This is out of hand. I stop, and sharply say, "Look here, you stop - I am not going to be taken to the principal's office like some schoolgirl. This is ridiculous."
