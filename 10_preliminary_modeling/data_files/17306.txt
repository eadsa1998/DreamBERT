I dreamt of the university near my parents' house.  I was there with my mother and my best friend Emma.  I guess we'd finished moving in and went to get something to eat and figured out the dining system.  The servers were two feet above us.  The soup guy sloppily dropped clam chowder in my bowl.  Cost counted, so I wasn't sure how to handle returning it.  I had already gotten my drink but my mother and Emma headed towards that station.  There were four of these high-ceilinged black-structured buildings with lowered courtyards.
