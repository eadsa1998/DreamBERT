I was a little fat boy chasing a strange bird. It had the face of a rat with huge eyes, and huge black wings with gold tips that it beat as quickly as a hummingbird. I chased it into a meadow, whereupon I learned that the way it disguises itself is by burying itself headfirst in the dirt and sprouting a flower out its ass, so you can't tell the birds from the flowers nor the flowers from the birds.
