There was an airplane that was going to some place called Jollymont. There was this African place with lava. Jack Nicholson was there and his arm was all weird. The plane was put on autopilot. There was a camp place with evil people. Calvin and I were looking for a phone. We were throwing toys at a bad guy. There was a restaurant and a girl was in this thing. Some guy's wife or mother found her.
