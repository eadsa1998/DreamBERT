I could not describe the dream exactly, but it all revolved around a very important piece of work I have to do and for which I don't think I have enough time to complete it. I only know that the dream (which was turning into a nightmare) was surrounded by several people that are close to me, who were putting a lot of pressure on me to finish the work.
