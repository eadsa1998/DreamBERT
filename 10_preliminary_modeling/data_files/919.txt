Co-worker Tyler is typing. He is smoking a cigarette. It's in his ear. He follows me up a long flight of stairs. He backs a shopping cart/amigo wheelchair down the stairs. I am concerned for him but he's doing fine. He comes back up. We kiss and I feel very happy. He loves me and I love him. We walk hand in hand. I think, "College this time is the way it should be." I thought of college the last time where lots of men went through my life. I felt solid, secure, and happy with Tyler, like finally, I've found someone special to love.
