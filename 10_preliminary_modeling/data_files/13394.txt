Ezra had some friends over. I went to have a shower. I had a feeling that someone was going to open the door so I wrapped a towel around me. Then all of Ezra's friends came running in one by one (Clayton, Leroy and Emery). Afterwards I discovered that they had taken photos. Dad said that "one wants to have sex with you" and I was like "What the hell? Ew!". The photos didn't show anything except "two and a half" showed my bum. In the morning I told Mom in the car on the way on to school. I was crying and I said they should have more respect. Mom was like "Oh, now you're crying" and stuck up for them. I said "It's the worst thing they could do to me".
