I was back in the apartment where I lived when I was between 5 and 10 years old, although I was still my present age. I had gone into the apartment expecting to see my wife or my mother. Whoever was there was in the bathroom. So I didn't wait for them, but I went out and went downstairs and out on the street. I suddenly realized that we had not lived in this apartment for years and I had walked into someone else's apartment and made myself at home. So I was kind of embarrassed. Then I met my grandfather who actually has been dead for 10 years or more now, although I didn't realize this in the dream. He and I went on uptown to get something to eat. We went into several food stores and apparently my grandfather's idea of getting something to eat involved buying a loaf of bread and some raw hamburger or something like that. He was being very economical. He was always doing for his economical traits, to put it mildly, while he was alive. I wanted to go on and actually find a restaurant.
