I was imagining of intimating Rose C. and Ann asked what I was thinking, and I told her I had a secret impulse on Rose. She didn't like my attitude and I didn't blame her. Bobby was walking on the street and he fell into a manhole. I ran to his rescue and there were some people in the manhole whom were controlling it and they said I would have to wait when it was Bob's turn. They would get him out. Ann lay nude on the bed. I said, "Cover up, someone might walk in."
