I was with Dr. Burke. We were preparing for a meeting with several other people and trying to find a place to conduct the meeting. We all went to the car together. I think there were six of us. First we went to a hotel, maybe the Hampton Inn. There were so many children running around. It was so noisy. Then we went to a different hotel. There weren't any children around. It was much quieter so we had our meeting there.
