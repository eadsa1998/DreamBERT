["Sexy hippos."] I am in an old big house. It's a bit run down. Some man keeps coming in with small gifts. I guess he broke something and is trying to repay me with things I had said I wanted. He gives me a china tea set but as I look at it more closely, it is rather coarse thick china with chips in it. Now he's at the front door and I go there and he wants to fix my electricity problem out on the porch. I try to tell him I don't need all this, it isn't necessary. He keeps on doing it. I think he feels guilty. I see a path and call to Charla. I say let's go for a walk and go see the sea lions. She and I walk up the path which goes up a hill. It parallels the coast line so on the left is the ocean. We get to the top and look out over the edge. I see many sea lions out in the ocean. Now lots of other people are coming to see too. They bring radio station equipment and platforms for stages and so on and very soon my view is cut off. I walk around the area trying to see over or past the booths and platforms. I see a weight lifting contest being set up. I find a small place where if I get very close to the edge, I can see. I look and somehow I can see from underwater. I see two hippos. One has the others little curly tail in its mouth and is pulling it backwards toward himself. It is a female hippo who wants to make love to the male hippo. I chuckle. Then suddenly, the male hippo is up the cliff and coming at me. His huge mouth with all those teeth is right next to me and I am trying to crawl and roll away. He has me in his grip and is rolling over me. I am afraid I will be crushed and injured or killed. He seems to want to make love to me. I squirm away from him and walk back down the path, wondering how I can manage all this without my wheelchair.
