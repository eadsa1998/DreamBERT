I had worked a crossword puzzle all the horizontal words but not the vertical and couldn't find the definitions for the vertical words. I hunted thru a pile of clothes. I hunted thru the book and found some puzzles I had skipped. Then I saw six nails in the wall on which R had hung some shoes in bags. I knocked off one and hung up my shoes. I wished I had a place to put things, had two or three garments in my arms. Told mother R shouldn't have driven in the nails since it was against the rules.
