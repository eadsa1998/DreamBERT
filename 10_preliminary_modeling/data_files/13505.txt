I was driving with a guy and a girl. I liked the guy. There were zombies, and he had picked up supplies from a shop earlier. We found this other town and there weren't any zombies around. We went into a shop and there were people inside. I asked if there were any zombies around. They said that there were a few. We got a trolley and got heaps of water. The girl stayed with the trolley. I looked for an esky to keep the water in. I told someone to get something 'fun'. I got rollerblades, notebooks, pens and the last issue of That's Life. Then Mom was there and she said she was buying pencils. There was a crash and I went to the trolley. It had been trapped in a little room with the girl on the other side. I was trying to ask what happened and then the zombies got her. I told people to shoot the zombies when they came through. I found the guy we were with and we ran.
