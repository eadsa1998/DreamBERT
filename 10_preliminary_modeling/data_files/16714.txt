I dreamed I was in a big room, with lots of people. There were tables, but I didn't see any food. Bernice was there, and there is a brief sexual scene between us. I guess we were in school, or at a school event, because after that, I was very afraid that everyone had seen and that I could be kicked out of school. I pretended the whole thing was "a show," walking around to every table asking everyone "how do you like the show?". I didn't feel like anyone was there at the time. I felt "they" were looking for me, and would catch me any minute. Then there was a girl who I sat next to, and told her what a surprise, that I'll love her forever (and I don't just say those things, believe me, I really mean them. I sound like Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye, I know- but I know exactly how that kid felt). Then I heard somebody call my name, and I knew I'd be in huge trouble. The strange thing, though, is that it wasn't my name. I can't remember what they called me, but it seemed natural like it was really my name. So, I brought this girl through the nearest door and downstairs. I kept telling her to run faster, but I didn't run away because I felt safer with her around. As far as I remember, I got out. Then, I remember thinking I had woken up, and coming outside my house to see a school bus in my driveway. I thought the bus might have been from my dream, and realized in that case it could have been from anywhere in the world. I looked at the location on the side, and it said it was from somewhere in CA, which, instead of making it out to mean "West Coast," I thought it meant "Central America." I also remember getting a phone call and being called into the studio of the radio station ABCD at the nearby university- but it wasn't a small studio room, it was more like a big gymnasium. If I remember, not everybody had all their clothes on (some of the guys had their shirts off, I think) and the main guy there reminded me of one of the early morning guys on WAAF.
