We went to the Winchester Mystery house.  Watched a chair fly around the dining room and such.  They told us not to, but I took three eggs.  I hid them in the living room.  They were cracked.  I sat on the counter in the kitchen next to Grandma Jane.  A chubby kid came in and warned me of above.  There was an earthquake and I got my hands above my head just in time before the cans fell out of the cupboard, but the impact still hurt my head.  Outside, there was a pig that looked like my stuffed pig Albert.
