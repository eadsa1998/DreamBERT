Jake and Valerie and I are in a car. I'm in the back seat. I see the landscape go by. I see buildings, including some that are just being constructed. I comment on one. I notice the streets are flooded. Then we come to an intersection. A parade is coming to the same intersection across from us. Jake is annoyed. I say, "Let's watch the parade." He growls out that he'd rather drive on. He turns so that we are now in the parade! I am somewhat embarrassed. He pulls across the road and into a parking lot and then we drive to his house. I see a grandfather clock with strange symbols inside it. I say to Valerie, "Oh, I see you got that clock." She says "Yes." She also got each of us a program that fits into the clock and proceeds to demonstrate my program.
