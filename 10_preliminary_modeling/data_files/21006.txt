A lady came in to buy some boards. I had some old ones and they had a heavy mess wire on them. She was going south. She stood beside me and was she tall, about 8 ft. - a tall lady. People were moving south on old wagons and old style cars. We stopped to see some people we knew for direction to a certain part of the town. We sat in the car and thought they would recognize us, but they didn't. Mary and I bought a large brick home on E. 30th St. It had a basement like a large tenement house. It had four floors. There were porches the length of the front of the house. All across the front was on all four floors. The yard was big and the lawn was bad because there were a lot of kids jumping on the roof. It was low then. We had all the furniture in the house. I said we would get a nice price for our furniture. The furnace was gas and it was going full blast. The beds were big and soft.
