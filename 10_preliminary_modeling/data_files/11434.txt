I was washing in a bathroom at what in the dream was the Waldorf but couldn't have really been because it was much too shoddy. There was another boy in the bathroom who was also washing. (This bathroom went with our room.) Suddenly a woman materialized in the bathroom beside me. I dropped the soap in the washbowl and splashed her slightly. I apologized for my carelessness. As I was leaving I noticed that all she had on was a thin nightgown. I diverted my gaze from her because I was embarrassed at her dress and also because I had splashed her. I got into what had been my bedroom. It was filled with beds in which were young boys about 10 or 11 altogether. The dream ended.
