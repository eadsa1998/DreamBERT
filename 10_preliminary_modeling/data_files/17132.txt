In the dream I had very easy control with telekinesis.  Pushing something around on the sidewalk, hooking the clasp of a necklace without hands, floating a towel somewhere.  There was a picture book of insects, and I could make the pictures move.  There were small helpless birds on the ground.  I picked them up and held them.  I got used to the telekinesis and flew up through the clouds.  They felt fluffy and icy, yet not really there.  They didn't have any particular flavor, but they tasted good somehow.
