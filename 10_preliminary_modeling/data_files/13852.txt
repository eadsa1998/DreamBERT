I was sitting on this lounge, which was two sided. Samantha, Silas, Calvin and Evelyn were on it too. Sometimes Silas wasn't on it. Evelyn was talking to us like nothing had happened but would sometimes just stare at the ground and we would giggle. She left to go to the toilet and we had been sharing some food, so we got Calvin to go to McDonald's (which was right next to us) and get a clean plate, to pretend that we had eaten everything. Roland was there, so Calvin asked him to get it. When we got back someone else had finished off the food anyway.
