I dreamed that I was at soccer camp again. Charles was one of my counselors and he kept teasing me, in a good way, I guess. Every time I tried to take a picture of him, he would duck or run away. I finally took one of him as we were walking indoors to eat lunch and watch the movie. Inside they were serving lunch (pizza and brownies) to us. Everyone kept saying, "It's OK, we have 2 hours before we have to run again. So I ate some. Then it got dark, as the movie was about to start. I started to fall asleep. When I woke up, everyone was unplugging the lamps. It was really weird, because it was already dark. Then I woke up.
