I was downtown with my friend Deanna and her boyfriend Calvin, riding my bike, at night.  We stopped at a store, and I was taking a long time to try and lock up my bike.  Finally I gave up and went in and was looking at the rodents.  When we left the store we went back to the apartment- Deanna and I were roommates.  I talked them into coming to the observatory with me.  I had to go to a meeting for the observatory- a bunch of us were going to go up as a group.  The sky was grey and we were sitting on a ledge to a grassy area outside a museum, I believe.  I was talking to a woman about when she was scheduled to work, and I mentioned how nice it was to only work in 1 or 2 hour shifts instead of for the full night.  Finally we got up to the observatory and someone showed us all to our rooms.
