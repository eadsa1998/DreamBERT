 I'm at work at Fishing Haven with my friend Stephen Ramos and others. It's the end of a shift. I keep working because I'm on a later shift. The people leave and take oranges and other food with them. There is a school bus where we are. On the back of one of the greenish gray seats is carved out the letters "KMHanson3". I could get in trouble because it's clearly me. Others have left their mark carved around there in a more disguised form, but no one has left it so clear. I go to the tiny bathroom and sit down on the toilet with the seat up. I start masturbating. Stephen returns to the trailer where I am. He is working a late shift as well. I stop masturbating. Stephen's night job is to go out near the on and off ramps of Superhighway 100 near Wilmerton and fix the signs there. The "Yield" sign needs to be partially fixed at the bottom: blue reflectors needs to be where pink and yellow reflectors have been.
