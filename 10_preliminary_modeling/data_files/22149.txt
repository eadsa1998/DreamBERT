I went to a house of prostitution and had very passionate sexual intercourse, but the whole thing seemed absurd to me and it looked like a dramatic scene. Seeing so many women trading with their bodies without assigning them any moral value made me sad, and to see everything they did to get a little money to support themselves. Afterwards I met my girlfriend and I didn't want to kiss her. I didn't want to soil her, because I felt very vulgar and I started to cry.
