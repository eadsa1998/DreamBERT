There was a colored man who worked in the post office in our home. He was sitting on a chair in a corner of the room. Ann walked up to him, then she put her hands on his chest and was pushing him against the wall. He had a hold of her arms as she was doing this. I yelled at them. I said, "You black bastard, you let go of her, and if I catch you touching my wife again, I will knock the hell out of you." He got up from the chair and walked out without saying a word. I was in some kind of office and the phone was ringing. I didn't answer it, but Ann came in and answered it. She said some boy called and said Bob was supposed to put brake lining on his car today. I said, "Sure he was not going to school, but doing odd jobs on cars. One of his friends came by. He had two guns in his holsters. I said, "Two gun man." He pulled them out and shot at a target with the toy pistols.
