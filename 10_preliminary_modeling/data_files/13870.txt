A bunch of us ended up in a shop, including Eugene. We thought something bad was going to happen. I went outside and saw this mist coming and I told everyone to go inside. We then had to go into this other section in the shop and everyone was taking a long time to get in and so I shut the door (it was airtight). Jeremiah didn't get in. We had to flush out the mist. People left behind passed out and were on the floor, but they were ok. I was getting some stationery and some magazines to read. I went out and took Tigger with me. Some guy attacked me. When I got back he was there. I told them to get rid of him because he was dangerous.
