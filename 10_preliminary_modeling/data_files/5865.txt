Am at some international sporting event. Gen De Gaulle is there and I watch him playing ping pong and wonder what he is doing there. Walk around outside the stadium and note everything, house, very honky tonk. I enter one and see a French movie star sleeping and awaken him. Then I ask someone to recall his name for me. I wonder why De Gaulle has not congratulated him. Walk to a table where De Gaulle is drinking a glass with some colored liquid. He mutters something about it being only a colored soft drink and that there should be more acceptable stuff around. He also mentions that the French Red Cross has labs there. He is at a large table with several people planning to enter a billiard game or something similar. Few minutes later he is gone and someone says he left in a huff. Later I see a man and a woman waiting nervously at an elevator. The man resembles De Gaulle but he could also be just a double. I hear someone say he is not De Gaulle, but that the General is out sitting on a bench with a girl.
