I was at this place. Samantha and Calvin were there. We ended talking to Michael Palin for a while. Later we were sitting down and his house was across the road. I decided to take a photo and I was thinking of the time when I took a photo of Eugene's house, then he walked out. There was a stage nearby for Spamalot and they were all in it. Eric Idle walked past and said hello to Samantha and the others and then shouted out "See you Izzy" and I was like "Oh my God!". I had a hat on and I put it over my face and giggled. Samantha made fun of me. Later, people were getting autographs. I was playing my DS and the sound kept going down. Some boy was around. There were some special glasses.
