I had a cute baby. Mother had been caring for it but I took it to tend it. I considered passing it off as hers but was reminded it was as awkward for her, as a widow to have so young an infant. Then I thought I'd pass it off as a sister's which I had adopted. It was always wetting itself and had to be changed. Everytime I handled it, it seemed older. I remembered nothing of its conception or of pregnancy but knew no one would believe that. I talked with mother as what to pass him off as. I noticed quite a pool of water and took the child to change him. The baby said something about the new carpet and I told mother of that so she could see how intelligent he was. The carpet was in new fresh colors.
