I was with The Doctor (David Tennant) and we ended up at this place where there were these mini volcanoes in barrels over the water. We had to win to prevent the volcanoes going in the ocean, which would be even more dangerous. We needed 11 and we had 11, but still had to answer questions. There was a buzzer sound and The Doctor pointed out that it was "from Pointless" at the same time. They asked what most people said came after 'Twinkies'. I said roll, because I couldn't remember what they were and she looked at me in confusion and said 'no'. A black guy called Nate asked me out and I agreed and then changed my Facebook status to 'in a relationship' and then I was like 'I don't even like this guy' and cancelled it and unfriended him. I was with Benjamin later and we were either dating or just flirty.
