 There is a plane crash. I see the plane overhead. It comes down and crashes into an unplanted cornfield. I run to the crash site. I am scared at what I might see. The plane is broken, but not disintegrated. The pilot is a pretty young woman who looks like my friend Emily Zates. She is alive: her eyes open. I see her, and tell her that I'll be right there, that I'll get help. I am stalling because I'm scared of getting too close to her. I feel guilty for not helping her right away, so I go up to her in the wreckage and help her. I do what I can. I am afraid the plane could explode.
