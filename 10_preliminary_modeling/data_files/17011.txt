I'm in a sparse smallish rectangular room that could be a hotel room or a hostel. There's a few people around. One of them is my brother. He is stressed - like a taught wire. Jasper from work is there too, but he is the opposite - relaxed to the point of being annoying. My partner is also there. There's a rumor about there being giant spiders in the building. I'm lying down when suddenly a giant spider comes scuttling across the bed towards me. Its body alone is slightly larger than my fist. It has a 'baby' which follows, which is about the size of a golf ball. The baby's legs are covered in a kind of glistening slime, as if the mother had just given birth to it. I am appalled. I jump up, terrified. I call out for help. My brother comes in, but is as frightened as I am of these things, and together we make a botched effort to try to catch them or kill them. I am disgusted by them, and I want them dead. Eventually my partner come in and fearlessly catches one of them - the big one I think. The other one has scuttled off, and she says it's gone now, but I'm not convinced - I think it will come back.
