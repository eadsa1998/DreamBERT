Some vague dream about my husband and I camping.  We wanted to go riding one day, up to the falls, even though it was late August and the water was drying up. We saw a couple of ropes stretched between the two cliffs above the falls, and finally realized when I saw a man sitting on it (this man sort of flew off into space) that it was a bridge and our mule trip would go over it. This was sort of frightening and I didn't know if I really wanted to go.
