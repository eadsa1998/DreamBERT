An art teacher is preparing a class lecture and is showing art slides or film strips but things don't seem to be working. I am sympathetic because I like him and want things to go well. His projector flies way up high and is up against the wall. He shrugs his shoulders and smiles like, "Oh, well, what can you do?" I see a swimming pool and realize the opportunity to relax and swim has always been there, but I don't take advantage of it. So I swim and go for a nice leisurely walk.
