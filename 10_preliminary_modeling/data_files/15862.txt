We had just moved into a new house. It was huge and lots of bedrooms. I was trying to decide which one I wanted. Mom and Darren were acting weird and looked upset. Mom said something and I didn't hear it so asked her to repeat it and she was like 'don't worry about it' but I asked again and she said she and Darren had decided to break up. Then she started crying. I went away and was annoyed and a bit upset because I was confused about what we would do since he paid all the bills.
