I was staying at a hotel thing with Granma and others, but I was sharing a room with her. I walked out at one point and then came back in and saw Simon Pegg leaving looking a bit dishevelled. I went to walk down some stairs and I saw Stephen Merchant. He was very tall. He was with a lady and picked her up and carried her down the stairs. I took pics and was excited about seeing him. I ran to the room and got the number wrong - went to 140 - and knocked and then quickly ran to 145 and knocked. A lady came out of 140 and looked around and went back in. I went into the room and it kept changing between Mom and Granma. I told her about the people I'd seen. I also saw Robert Webb at one point and there'd been some scandal video thing - someone told me that some actress had given him a blowjob, but I looked it up and it was actually him being forced to give another guy a blowjob. He started crying during it and I was like 'how is this porn, this is a torture video'. Then Mom had a room there and we could see into it. I had a flask thing that was steaming. Granma was like wtf and it was some illegal thing, so I tried to give a signal to Mom and she realised. Granma realised and called me like a traitor. I went on Facebook and was looking at photos of Dan Palmer and there was a comment by a girl called Christine Murray saying 'I'm his girlfriend' and my heart sank. I was looking at her photos and there were heaps of them together and also check-in's in London - at her place, I assumed. There was also this weird little frog and when I waved at it, it smiled excitedly and then jumped on me. It was then a frog-cat thing and I was wondering when it became possible for those to breed.
