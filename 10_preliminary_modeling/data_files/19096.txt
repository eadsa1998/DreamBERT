This dream took place in the past, I guess about a year or two. I was living at home and my little half sister, who is now about 5, was in the dream about 4, and she was somehow a photographer in the dream. That is, her hobby was she liked to take pictures, both still and moving. So my dream involved her running into the house and back yard. I was looking at a package of some film she had bought. It involved the fact that she was telling me that she was ready to take her big pictures that she wanted to take for a long time, now that she had the right camera and film. Then, for example, my mother came over to kind of interrupt, and we were both rather indignant, especially the little girl because an amateur would come to talk to us.
