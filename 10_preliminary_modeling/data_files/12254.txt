I was at some place with Calvin, Fang, Evelyn and Silas. I was lining up to go on a boat, and we were petting chickens while we waited. Calvin went on the boat by himself and Evelyn was upset. She went in the back of one with me and Fang (who wanted to go with me). Silas was serving dip, cheese, gherkins and crackers. The gherkin was yucky. He got sick of doing it and gave the job to Duane. Silas had been working there since the place opened. I saw this grim reaper guy and I asked who he was here for and he told me. Later, the guy told us he knew he was going to die. Some girl was on this bouncy thing.
