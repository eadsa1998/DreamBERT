I and a young lady of my age, along with another couple who are our age, seemed to be skiing. My date and I tested a long ski run. It seemed to be a long wooden sliding board though. We didn't have skis either. The ride down the board consisted of a slide, then one ski jump, then some more sliding, and finally before the bottom was reached there was a place which caused the slider to think that he was about to do another ski jump but instead, just as he reached the end of the take off platform he would suddenly feel that he was going to fall a huge distance and possibly get hurt or even killed. However, as he continued to go over the end he would actually safely continue a slide to the bottom of the run. All of this procedure was in a sitting position. My date and I tried out the ski run a few times and then proceeded to enjoy watching the anxiety created in the other couple by the trick spot in the run as they attempted it their first time. All four of us laughed then and then proceeded to enjoy having our stomachs come up into our mouths each time we slid down the exciting run.
