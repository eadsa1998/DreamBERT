I was with a fly-ins (journalism project) group on a Hawaiian island. We were studying something, but then our time was up -- and a terrifying natural phenomenon was occurring -- towering waves, taller than the mountains, were rising up out of the sea and slamming into the barrier islands. The spray washed for miles, and the huge, luxurious resort hotels were being rained on by the deluge, despite their distance. The water poured down the rocky ledges below the resorts. Many had watersides into the deep turquoise channel, which looked warm and welcoming, despite the darkness on the horizon, the area shaded by the rain and waves. The hotels were used to this, it appeared, because they had water channels. If I were a guest, I would be terrified. But the buildings looked to be built like bank vaults. Just before the hotel, I was running through an ancient aqueduct system, that was blue and sea green tile all over. The walls of water were rushing from every direction. Me and my accomplice ducked behind a pilaster to avoid the wall. When it passed, we ran some more, but couldn't run our fastest -- the floors were slippery. I pushed off columns with my hand for that much extra momentum. We made a right turn and entered the hotel level.
