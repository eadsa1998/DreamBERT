 I'm going to open gym at Carter School. My brother Wally is there. He may be working there. When I get to the corner of Holy Avenue and 1st Street Wally is there with the Carter principal Candy Bevner and my third grade teacher Liza Minikel. There are leaving, and Wally is done early so he is going with them. I talk with Candy and Liza about studying at the University of Wellington. They ask me questions about it, and I explain. We may talk about financial aid information.
