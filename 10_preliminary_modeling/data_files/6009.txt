I am travelling by train through England with some friends. In our car there is an official reception for the Queen of England who is travelling in the next car. My friends have brought chemicals with them and they start mixing them together. One of the male friends explains that they are making an explosive because he wants to blow up the Queen. I am disturbed by this, but another friend pleads with me to keep quiet. I remain silent since they are friends, but I feel that this is wrong. Finally, I can stand this moral outrage no more and I act decisively. I grab a glass bottle filled with a clear liquid and pour it out a sliding door on the train, thus thwarting the bombers' plans. A guard or policeman is standing there, and I complain to him, "You need tighter security around your Queen. In my country, you'd never get so close to the President with the materials for a bomb."
