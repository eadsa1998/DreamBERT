In a plane FLYING to San Francisco -- I wait to get on the plane with a white-haired woman and a white-haired man. I sit in a reclining seat in the front of the plane; it feels as if I were piloting the plane. Exhilaration! -- "I always wanted to fly like this!" I stand with Wendy outside the plane and we miss our flight; we get on a luncheon flight and I eat lunch from plastic cups and plates; I hardly know we are flying; before we know it, we have arrived.
