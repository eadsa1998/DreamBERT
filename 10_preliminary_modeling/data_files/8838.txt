Something about Freda L. There is a man that she was very interested in and she thought that I was interested in him also. Or, she thought I was trying to get him interested in me before she had a chance to get him interested in her. Maybe she thought I was trying to "steal" him from her. She looked very different than she does in waking life. Also something about my birth home. I was trying to get into the attic. There was so much stuff everywhere, including on the door that I was having a very difficult time opening it.
