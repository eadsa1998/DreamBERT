In this dream, which is hard to recapture or describe, it seemed it took place in this apartment in Trinidad that my daughter and I had rented, as well as in its vicinity. I didn't actually see anyone in the dream -- just the rooms and furnishings -- but no people. The "we" I refer to as I record this dream are Mary, me, Maria and her girlfriend. The general "plot" or "theme" of this dream is that Mary has returned to our apartment after shopping and starts preparing a meal for us in the apartment kitchen. I am very concerned and upset that Mary is doing these things because I know she is very weak. I try urging her to stop and to rest, but she is paying no attention to me and just continues preparing the meal. I return to the dining room, then hear a strange noise - sounds like someone falling on the floor, or like the sound of toast when it is done and pops up in the toaster. I run to the kitchen, but don't look on the floor but at the counter on which the toaster stands. The toast is burned and an empty teapot is turned on its side. I just feel something terrible has happened. Then, although that part of the dream is over, I see, in the dream, I'm lying in bed and crying uncontrollably.
