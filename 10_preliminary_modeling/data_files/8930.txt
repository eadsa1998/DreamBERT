Grey's Anatomy. One intern was selected to work with Dr. Bailey on a special case with the stipulation that they not discuss anything about the case with anyone else, including the other interns. Later the intern that was selected was told to select one intern to help with the documentation. The second intern would do nothing but make sure everything is documented and documented accurately.
