["Stampeding sheep."] I am outdoors. I see lots of animals stampeding toward me. I am carrying a small baby boy with me. I run to a building and go inside, although it's like a bombed out building. I run up the stairs which has piles of sand on it. The sheep are coming up the stairs at me and the boy. I shove and kick the sand in their faces, trying to slow them down. It works. They turn and go back down the stairs. I was on the verge of rounding a corner to the second flight of stairs but don't have to now.
