I'm seated in the front seat of a car in the middle. A man dressed in black is driving. A woman sits on my right. He keeps coming over and touching, caressing and wanting my butt. He's all warm and sexy and pleading. I say angrily, "Leave my butt alone." He would back off and then try again. I lean over to whisper in the woman's ear. I say, "I hope he can't hear me." She says he can't. [BL]
