Suggested to Matthew that we help each other wash our cars at home. I washed my interior, vinyl seats, the same way I would the outside. I had to rub hard to remove old, white streaks. Driving south on B1 Blvd. Very small black male child on bike road out in front of me and crossed Blvd. I was very concerned about him getting hit. I made a right turn in front of oncoming traffic. I would have had plenty of room/time except that I couldn't get my car to go for a few seconds after I made the turn. I was nearly hit and the cars that almost hit me were angry that I pulled out in front of them. My car power could be switched from peddle/bicycle power to engine. As I was headed south on B1 there was another black male child, adolescent, riding a bike. It had a platform on the cross bar and seat because he couldn't reach the peddles. His dad had fixed it so he could ride it this way. He sat on this platform and rested his feet on it. Crowd of people connected hands to feet, lowering each other down into this box. We were either trying to save someone or something or we were trying to get away from someone.
