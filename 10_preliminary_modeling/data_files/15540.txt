There was a sign mentioning Calvin doing some dance/show thing. There was a video called 'Tubby' and Benjamin, James and someone else were in it. Mom saw it and thought it was funny. At some point people from FilmForum were around and I asked if Poopsie was there and she asked who that was and I said 'James' and she knew who I was talking about. She said he was good-looking and that there was another good-looking one and I was like 'ok...'. The tubby thing was like a Tiny Teddy cartoon. Benjamin had written a bunch of short stories which featured me (and others). These alien guys came down and they had been in one too, but they got in trouble or something so had to come and fix it (we didn't know they were real). The stuff in the books was coming true and they had fixed some of it to come true and I realised they were going to kill me, but Benjamin hadn't clicked on yet. He eventually did. I started running through the house and they chased me. I ran into a bedroom and tried to open the window. It had a little latch, which I opened and jumped out; sliding down the side of the house. There was a car, but the doors were locked so I kept running down the street. I came across a bunch of bikes and took one and started riding. I ended up fairly far away, but then my friend, Vinny (who was now the guy who had written the stories) - found me and told them my coordinates. I dumped the bike and looked for somewhere to hide. I found a nook in the ground with a bed and stuff (gypsy like) and lay there. They walked past it but then one of them stopped and found me. Vinny was there and had an earring and was all douchey looking and he said 'I need the money'.
