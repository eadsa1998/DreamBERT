A group of fellows and I were on our way to a baseball game in Pittsburgh. We were walking along the street and one fellow by name of Robert Charlton was leading us. We didn't have our tickets so we stepped into this building to buy tickets out of some sort of machine. Different colors and prices determined where you would sit. I was the last one to put my money in the machine. It went out of order and I got about 20 of the best tickets free. I joined the other fellows on the street and proceeded to the ball park. The next thing I know is that we were in a large crowd. I saw several people I knew, Gilbert, male, and his sister.
