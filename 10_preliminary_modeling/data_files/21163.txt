Ann and I drew out or robbed the Parma Bank. The police were mad at the people for calling them silly names. A policewoman came to our house and I said, "What do you want?" and she said, "I want to talk to your old lady." I said, "Okay." Old lady, I'll tell her. So I told Ann and said, "Watch what you say to her." I was driving a bus. We made a dam and then it broke and the water ran down the creek full force. We met Ronnie by the creek further on and he said the creek ran full for a while. It was snowing and I said, "The 18th of June and a snow fall. It looks as though it will snow all summer". Marie snubbed me twice, then her husband talked to me. He was a friend of mine. They had a boy baby. His name was Johnnie. Some horse I was looking for, someone said he was running above the border. Audrey, Bob and I were on the bed and Barbara was shaking pepper on us. It made us sneeze. She did that twice.
