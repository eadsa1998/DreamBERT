We were getting ready for my brother's birthday party and we were going to watch a movie but the TV wasn't working properly. Setting: At my house. Characters: My brother, my dad, and me. My brother is almost 4. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried. I thought that maybe the birthday party wouldn't be much of a hit anymore.
