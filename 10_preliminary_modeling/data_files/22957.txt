I was in uniform again, and was again at the training fort or summer camp.  We were marching somewhere and were badly out of line, big gaps were opening up, etc.  It wasn't a formal parade and no one seemed concerned, but it made me slightly nervous and embarrassed that we were so badly out of formation.
