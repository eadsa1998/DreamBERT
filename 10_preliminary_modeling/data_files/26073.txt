 I go into a building which is a house-like place where some young women live. They are playing ping-pong. It's late in the evening. I go to see my advisor Mary Monroe. She isn't in her office. I wait for her. She comes and I ask her a question. I feel dumb and immature: like I am dependent on her. Whatever it is I asked her is totally up to me, which I know, but still want affirmation from Mary. I leave, feeling dumb, and say I'm going to work on a dream, even though I'm not going to: that is just an excuse for me not needing to be with her anymore. I leave the building, where there is a party going on. People don't like me. People are mad at me, and I think they'll chase me. I'm on the street in Wilmerton that runs past Jim's Bait Store. I fly and float. I think I am partially awake, and this experience must be what people describe when they say they were half awake and half asleep. I realize I'm dreaming. I focus on remaining flying, trying not to wake up. I float down past downtown. I know I am moving. It is as if I push myself by the buildings using my vision, by looking at the buildings.
