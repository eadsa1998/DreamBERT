Joe K and I are in a small sports car. He's driving. We are soon to be lovers. We like each other. I see we are going very fast and cutting in and out of traffic like a race. He's watching me out of the corner of his eye to see if I'm scared. I mostly am enjoying the wind and the grace of the movement, but I do have some concern. I'm thinking about whether I'm in danger or not and if I am, I should stop it. I decide I'm safe. We get to this city and pull up to an apartment. We go in to have lunch. I am aware that we might decide to make love. I see the kitchen and take over immediately. I am walking well and take a bag of frozen shrimp and pineapple pieces out of the refridge. I wonder why I'm being so domestic and then think, "Oh well, he drove, so it's fair I do this." He is seated at the dining room table just waiting. I expertly lay the table - the two plates, the cups, the knives and forks, the two salads. He watches. I then sit to eat. He says, "What kind of rocks are these?" He points to a small box of rocks on the table. I sort through them and I say, "This one is igneous. These are quartz crystal. This looks like agatized material." I see a square of rocks that look like they had been started to be onyx chessmen and haven't been carved out yet.
