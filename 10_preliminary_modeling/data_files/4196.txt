["I kill Howard."] I am in a room, nearly empty. Charla and I are packing to leave. On the floor are many magazine pictures cut out and each one laid out beside each other over most of the floor. I ask her to help me pack them. I show her how to do it so things are organized. I put the similar animal ones together. I show her three elephant pictures and put them together in a pile. As we are doing this, an odd looking spirit or ghost rushes in through the curtains. It comes at me. It has a round head like a balloon under a sheet. It is attacking so I defend myself, by trying to strangle it. It becomes Howard. I must kill it. I persist strangling it until he is dead.
