I start to take some red grapes from the sugar bowl and am told they are R's who put them there. I protest that they were given to us all and when no one is looking, take two. Start eating at table and help myself to center dish. I'm getting potato under a pile of vegetables but none under 10 or 12 slices of bread. As I help myself to the last of the green vegetable R. asks if there are any more vegetables. I say there are only small pieces of meat. She starts to take meat which is now on long strips of paper. I warn her she is spilling on the floor.
