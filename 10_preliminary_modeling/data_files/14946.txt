I was running away from people. I had to get some trapped soldiers out of a building. I took out the guards. They were German by the way. I went in and some others thought I was dodgy and I spoke German to them, to ease their suspicions, and then I shot them. I got chased by some others and I jumped some fences. I was then playing World of Warcraft or something and there were level 51 creatures. I found a teleport thing just as a 'bad' woman got there.
