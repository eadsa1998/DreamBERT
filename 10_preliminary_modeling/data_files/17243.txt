I was walking along the perimeter of a cyclone fence enclosing a big grassy area.  As I continued to walk, I came across the heads and front half of sheep and goat bodies, entwined/impaled within the fencing.  This 'wall of death' continued on for maybe a hundred feet; many sheep and goats had died, and most of the carcasses had some dried blood on them, either from where the rear of the torso had gone missing, from hooves, or crusted around their eyes, nose or mouth.  They all looked so sad, and like they had died in a lot of pain.  I was horrified by the sight and tried to stay away from it.  I started to sob, feeling sorry for the pain the animals died in.  My dad tried to comfort me to no avail.
