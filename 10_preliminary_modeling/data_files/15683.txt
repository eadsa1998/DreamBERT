I was at a shop (it was big; smaller than Westfield, but it had more floors) and then I left and went to find a car. I couldn't remember where I had parked. Then it was like a game and zombies suddenly appeared. They were weird and green and slow. Then I was in a pub. Lots of celebs were there. Martin Scorsese was one of them. The guy behind the bar made a joke to me but I couldn't remember who he was. I saw Nathan Fillion and I said 'ooh, can I get a photo' and he was like sure and really chilled about it. He put his arm around me, tightly, and I took a phot, but he was out of shot. I went to find someone else to take the photo. It took a while to find someone else and Dmitri was dancing to the music. After they took the photo, this girl was like "I LOVE him". Then I turned to see Alexander Skarsgard with 'nerd Eric' hair and I asked for a photo too and then I woke up.
