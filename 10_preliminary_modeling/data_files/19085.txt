My girlfriend and I were at Crandon Park. I'm pretty sure that was it, or some beach. It was at night and we were like on a series of islands. We were on one island in a series of many small islands by ourselves, and there were other people around, Negro men and women about our age, who were having a party or something and the Negroes had lights. We didn't have any lights. It was very dark, but we were kind of traveling along not too far from them so that there would be some light. We were talking and I was hoping that no one would shoot out the Negro's light or anything, or that he wouldn't lose it because then we wouldn't be able to see at all. [Max: Nietzsche thinks perhaps there was some kind of conversation before what he described, but he can't recall it right now.] Nietzsche: Also I was thinking at one moment that if they did shoot out the Negro's lights, I would have to swim from one small island to the next, which wasn't too far away, to get another light.
