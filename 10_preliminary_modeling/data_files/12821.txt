Calvin and I were talking next to the sports shed thing on the oval near North Midvale. The bars were stretchy, like rubber. Calvin put his arm through and grabbed a ball and let it bounce off the bars and back in. Teacher-M-06 told us off, although he hadn't seen the ball. He took all of this stuff of mine including my pillow, bag, TV and DVD player and put it into the shed. Dad was driving us away and I realized my phone was in there. Teacher-M-06 and Mr Willingham wouldn't let me in to get it. Autumn was there and we were arguing about getting my stuff back. She left so she couldn't say that I'd done anything. I grabbed my bag and pillow and left. Eugene was near our car and I saw Daryl in his car. Something he'd done earlier confirmed that he was gay. Ezra and Farrah were in the car. I saw Barry Pepper outside the car and I told Dad that that was "the guy who looks like Tigger!". Dad was laughing and Barry was like "what?". Dad said "You have to ask my daughter". I kept laughing every time I looked at him and I couldn't tell him. His friends were laughing and waving about. Debra Messing was on the oval and her friend was trying to make her meet guys. All of these 'college' guys started pouring out of North Midvale. Then a bunch of kids came. There was a crazy lady there and she said "I don't care which one; I just want one that's pretty". She caught this boy and was going to make her sister care for him so that he turned out like her. She was picking out clothes and he ran into the shed and she was like "Meh, that's where I'm going next".
