I was dating _____. It was somewhat secretive. I had many ambivalent feelings about it. I was at a meeting or something that lasted several hours. When it was over, I apologized to him that he had to sit around and wait on me for so long. I was concerned about him being bored or getting upset. He said, I told you it would be fine and it was. Oddly, I was now in bed. He was standing next to the bed, leaned over, and kissed me. We had a brief discussion about what to do about us. My feelings were very ambivalent. I think even more so than my feelings about Barry C. I said something about telling different people, hinting, or insinuating something about their reactions. I then said, what about. He interrupted before I could finish my sentence, saying Mother and Daddy. I finished the sentence, saying, Darren and Kay H. We were talking about the same people. I don't know why he called them Mom and Daddy. The next scene we were in a kitchen. There was stuff all over the counters. There was an old box of Frosted Mini-Wheat's on the counter, the bite size kind that I eat. I got a new box out of the cabinet. They were the larger ones. As I was pouring them into a bowl, the milk was already in the bowl. He was eating the old ones from his hand. He asked about the difference and I told him the ones he was eating weren't good anymore. He asked me if you are supposed to put them in a bowl of milk. I then got ready to add raisins to it. I told him that I always like to put raisins in my cereal.
