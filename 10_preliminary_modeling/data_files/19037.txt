There were 3 or 4 people sitting on steps and I'm trying to influence one or all of them in some way. I was saying there is no question that there are a lot of unintelligent voters, and that therefore race baiting can be expected to get some votes, but that this number of votes should not be overestimated as the privacy of the ballot box has a sobering effect on one's consciousness.
