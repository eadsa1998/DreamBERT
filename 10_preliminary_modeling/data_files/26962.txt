I dreamed that I went to take an examination and I was late for the class. There were ten minutes left in the period and the teacher was one that I had for an English course last term. The teacher told me that I should take the examdnation and to write as quickly as possible so that I could get some credit. I took a seat and was unable to find my pen. I looked through my purse frantically and finally found the pen, but it didn't have any ink in it. I got some ink from the desk and then I couldn't find my blue book. I just had a few minutes left when I did find the book so I quickly wrote out the answer to the first question. Then the bell rang. When I handed in my book, I felt that I had failed the examination.
