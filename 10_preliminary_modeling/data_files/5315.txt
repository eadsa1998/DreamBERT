I had a dream that the girls' lacrosse team had a really early game one day or something, so they had to wake up at 6am on Sunday. Leanne was complaining that this was unfair because no one else had to wake up, so she demanded that the entire school wake up at 6am as well. I turned to her and snapped, "It's going to be really unfair when you get into Princeton because of your lacrosse skills, when far more deserving people get turned down, especially when they are much smarter than you!" That shut her up! Then I had a dream that I was in a store and had a fixed amount of money. I bought a pink iPod and a bottle of Chanel perfume. Then I decided to buy different perfume. And then I woke up, but had none of my purchases!
