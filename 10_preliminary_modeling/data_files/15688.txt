Lydia posted a status on Facebook saying she got in trouble for having lesbian porn and videos of her and her girlfriend having sex on a USB. I thought it was TMI. I was watching Supernatural and Dean's girlfriend was crying at him. It was an emotional scene and she had to sacrifice herself for something. She had to become a vampire. It turned to day and she was burning and threw herself in a fountain, falling a few levels to the bottom. I don't know what she had to do but then I was there too. People were coming in and we went outside and she wasn't a vampire anymore and hid behind a statue. I climbed up to the roof to lie on this thing sticking out, but it wasn't hidden enough so I climbed over a fence and went out the front again. Then I was at some performance thing. I was sitting with people from school at a cafeteria. Lydia was there and had found out I like Eugene and she had pretty much told everyone and I was avoiding him. Then I was with Benjamin and we went to the performance. We were sitting together at the end of a row. Colin Mochrie was in the row next to us and there were some other famous people. Some people from FilmForum were there too. SuperGuy was behind us -- he had dreadlocks and gold teeth and looked sort of like an early 20s drop-out addict -- then someone was next to him and then FlyingSquirrel was supposed to be sitting at the end, but a girl was there. She got up and then FlyingSquirrel came back and he was kind of hot. Benjamin was pointing out some of the others, as well as Local and Gunnar. People got umbrellas out and I wondered why there were umbrellas and then I saw the show on the screen with umbrellas and water came from the ceiling. I was wearing my orange beanie and I laughed and Benjamin ducked under another umbrella.
