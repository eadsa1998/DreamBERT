This dream was unusual for me as the time and place seem to be absent. I seem to have been walking along a quiet street, and suddenly coming upon a woman screaming at her neighbor because smoke from his fire was getting her wash dirty. The persons were not clear, so I can not identify them. The black smoke and white wash seem to stand out. The thing I remember most is how funny it seemed to me at the time to see the woman yelling at the man and pointing to her ruined wash.
