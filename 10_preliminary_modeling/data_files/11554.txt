My brother and I were in Canada fishing in our motorboat. So without having any luck, we started for the cabin. I was steering when we came into an area known too well by us. The rocks up there are treacherous. We hit the rocks just submerged beneath surface and the boat went over. I kept my head and flipped the boat back over very easily even though the boat is large. It was still full of water, but still floating and we got it to the bank. The next thing I knew we were telling my dad the story. Right away he put us to work carrying lumber. I got mad when he hinted at us that we didn't have any brains. I was just carrying a piece in the cabin when I woke.
