 I'm with some men from Brimson. We're all going to get the same, short haircut. The men include my friends Nat Miller, Niles Zelling, Tom Napper, and others. There has been a bomb that has gone off underwater, and a prisoner is trapped underwater. He can't breathe, but he escapes. He gets help from others and I, and is saved.
