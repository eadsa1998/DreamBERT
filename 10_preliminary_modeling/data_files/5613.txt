[1997-06-15] A PBS radio station was having a contest and if we won we could travel to Minnesota and hear "A Prairie Home Companion" with Garrison Keilor. So Mort and I participated in this contest and we were winners and won the trip to Minnesota. We were just about to meet Garrison, or, we had actually begun speaking to him when I turned over and the dream ended.
