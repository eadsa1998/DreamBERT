In my dream I see my recently married cousin, girl age 24, walking down my street supported by two other girls. I recognize one as being another one of my cousins. They are walking very slowly and approach our house. My mother and I are standing on the porch. We greet them. I ask my cousin how she is feeling and she responds that she feels well. I remember thinking to myself that I was so glad she was well and that now perhaps she would be able to keep her baby. All thou leave soon thereafter and they continue to walk very slowly down the street. All of a sudden she (the one who is to have a baby) appears to be suspended in air with her toes pointing toward the ground. I remember thinking: well, if she can do that she is all right.
