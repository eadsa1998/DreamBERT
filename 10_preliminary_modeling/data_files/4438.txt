["My own house."] I had been in some institution and now each person gets their own individual house. I go inside mine to see what its like. It is small but lovely. The walls of the living room are almost all glass windows. Hardly any furniture but I like that. A spacious feeling to the house. I walk downstairs and see a large area. It is a tiled floor, blue and white. A very large shower that is wheelchair accessible. Lots of shower heads, maybe four of them. They turn on automatically when I walk into the shower area. I like this. I notice the two showers next to the entrance is spraying water out into the hall area. I try to think them more interior so I don't make a mess. It is difficult. I then turn and walk toward the other end of the room. I see two sleeping areas one for my son and one for my daughter. A third area is for their toys to be kept. I like this house.
