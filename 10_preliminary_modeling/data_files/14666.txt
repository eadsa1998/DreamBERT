There were these photos from a holiday with Dad and others. There was one with us on this floating ledge. I was there later and I saw this guy over there and he was floating and then I realized it was Michael Shanks' character from Burn Notice and he called out 'how'd you get a caravan?' and there was something about a time traveler. I called out something but I forgot his name and trailed off with "your mother". Mom made fun of it. Some time later the photo of the floating ledge looked fake and I said "it was quite photoshopped".
