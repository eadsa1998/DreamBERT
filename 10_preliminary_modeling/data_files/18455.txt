I was putting together a plastic bag full of buttons and sewing paraphernalia. It was time to break out of a Hong Kong prison and I was on the fourth tier cell block. I had to wait till the window washers were busy and distract them by throwing ping pong balls so fire hoses filled with cyanide could be squirted on passers-by. I threw a rock through a plate glass window. A thunderstorm had blown up from the south and a guy said I had to be real careful. (The job paid) $4000 to work Sunday through Wednesday with one day off. "Now count the money," she told me, and handed me a stack of counterfeit bills. One five. Two tens, twenty-eight twenties and a $14 bill with (a picture of) millions of New Yorkers. She said, "Leave or I'll shoot." I had to squirt the fire hose uphill to wash the bubbles out of the grass. Then the boss lady said, "I had 3 men working for 4 days and had to shoot them with cyanide sulfide. CLEAN UP THESE BUBBLES AND CYANIDE. Count the $4000. Two of them have the day off."
