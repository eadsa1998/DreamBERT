The dream takes place in a very large home, almost a mansion. I walk from the hall into a den with a large desk in it. With me is a very beautiful blond who seems to be quite attached but not married. She seems to be about 24 years old. I don't recognize her but she calls me Dutch. When I sit behind the desk, people who look familiar, but I don't recognize, come into the room and plead with me not to stay with her but she tells me not to listen to them since I'm a big man who can make his own decisions. Since she gives me a lot of confidence in myself I stay.
