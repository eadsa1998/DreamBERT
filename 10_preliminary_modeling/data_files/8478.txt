I was one of the women competing in the TV program Who Wants To Marry My Dad. The entire scenario was very different in the dream than it is on the actual TV program. For one thing, there were many more people around, or involved, of all ages, including children. The Dad was going to be making the decision himself. I was one of the finalists and from the things he had said to me I was pretty sure I was going to be the one he picked. We had gone somewhere with the intention of getting married in secret before the show was even over. Instead, we ended up putting the wedding ring on my hand and posing for a picture with the ring on my finger as the focal point of the picture but then returning to the house and the rest of the group and keeping what we did a secret. I was acting the way some people do when they have a secret that they know will be revealed soon.
