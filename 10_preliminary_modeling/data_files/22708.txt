The dream was very simple. I dreamed I met some friends whom I like very much in Chimbote. I saw them in my dream, but I don't remember if I spoke. Since we were going to make a trip, I dreamed that I was in another place and that I saw them. I don't remember anything about where it was, or how, or anything.
