We were playing ball and were beating the other team. C. Charvat batted up. He hit one thru a window at White's. It broke the window and went inside. Charley ran around the bases. A kid came out with the ball and waited for Charles to come home. I got the ball from the kid and I told the kid to go to the home plate and I would throw the ball to him when Charles ran for home. So Charley came for home. I threw the ball to the kid. It was a little wide and he missed it. It rolled back. When Charles saw me with the ball, he ran back and the kid had time to get the ball. I was at a party of picnic. There were a couple small lakes. The water was clear, cool, and I could see the bottom and feel the coolness from the water. We were raided by police. I flew above one of the lakes and looked down into the clear water. I saw a tail wagging or swimming in the water.
