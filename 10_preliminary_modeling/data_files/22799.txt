Some boys and I are playing ball in a lot sort of like Jimmy Creagar's vacant lot.  I am batting all the time.  Pretty soon two men come along and watch.  I miss the first pitch; it goes through fence and it take about 5 minutes to retrieve it.  On the next pitch I hit a hard ground ball, and one of the men remarks that it was a good hit.  As it is almost dark now, we go to a garage just adjacent to Christian Church, where a meeting of young people is being held, and discuss baseball a while.  I ask the man why I can't hit into left field lefthanded as well as I can hit into right field righthanded.  He says it's because I don't snap my wrists enough lefthanded.  Pretty soon I go into the church where the meeting is being held, and just after I sit down, a cute blonde girl comes in from the Chi Rho section and sits down by me.  I strike up a conversation and find out she will be a sophomore at McAddoo High next year.
