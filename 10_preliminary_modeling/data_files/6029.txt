I was in my grandfather's house. (He has been dead for six years.) I was lying down on a bed in a living room. It was an old studio, with which I was not familiar. I got up wondering which I should do: go back to sleep or study for a literature exam. My grandfather was cooking something. I noticed that two of my cousins also were there. One of them asked me if I wanted to have dinner with them. I said that since I had an exam the next day, I had to go home and study. They gave me a ride. It was dark outside. When we came closer to a tennis court, we noticed that there were many people both inside and outside the tennis court. We stopped the car and I went to see what was going on. I saw David Bowie talking to someone on a bench outside the tennis court. I entered the tennis court. It looked like a concert hall in the open air and was crowded with people. I found a friend of mine from high school and asked him what was about to happen. He said that David Byrne was expected to give a concert. Since he was not my favorite musician, I left the tennis court. On my way back to the car, I saw David Byrne singing and dancing a weird dance. I thought that the lighting was beautiful.
