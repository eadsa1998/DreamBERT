I woke up and I wasn't sure if I was dreaming. I got out of bed and went downstairs to the bathroom, I think, and then looked out the kitchen door. It was dark outside, and I was pondering whether I should leave the house and take the risk that I might be awake. I decided not to go out. I went to the den, and looked at something with writing on it. As a test, I closed my eyes and opened them again, and this time it read slightly differently. This still didn't make me lucid, however, and I wasn't positive I was dreaming until my dream faded. I'm driving a truck down my driveway. I realize the brakes aren't working, and I try to use the horn to tell everybody on the street to get out of the way. I think I almost hit a couple cars, but I don't. I drive up the street, putting my foot to the pedal as hard as I can, and I get the thing moving very fast for fun. The ride sort of felt more like a motorcycle than a truck.
