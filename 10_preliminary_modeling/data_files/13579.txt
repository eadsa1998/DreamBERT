Mom and I went to a shop and were looking at school bags, but I didn't like any of them. These people would go out and find an 'interesting' male and female to turn into a ghost along with their family. I ended up at this shop where the people and ghosts had been. They wanted the people working at the checkouts. The girl at the checkout and I had these red cards which meant that no-one could ask us questions or arrest us. Two cars crashed into the shop. William Sadler as the sheriff in Roswell came. The girl and I ran to the back of the shop to get out of the way. We went forward a bit and the sheriff told us to run and we all ran. He got shot and I was thinking 'What the hell? He doesn't die, he's in all the episodes!'. The bad guys were coming to kill us for insurance. The girl ran in the toilet to hide and I accidentally ran into the fridge next to it. I quickly ran into the toilet and tried to lock the first door but couldn't. I was thinking 'why do these doors never lock?'. I ran into the toilet cubicle. They were shooting at us from above but missed us. I ripped the toilet seat off and was hitting this guy over the head. They left and just one guy was left. The girl I was with was going to slice his throat but backed out. But then he left. A guy knocked on this glass door from outside and we went out and followed him, running. We got to this carpark and I saw this white car's door open. We ran up these stairs and I said "isn't this wrong way?". The bad guys threw a bomb. We got into the car and the girl got shot and died. We were driving off and I said the sheriff was dead.
