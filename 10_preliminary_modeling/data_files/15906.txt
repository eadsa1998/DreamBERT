A group of people and I went into this big house which was where some bad people lived. I think they were cannibals and stuff, and we had snuck in there for some reason. While we were in there they came back and I was in this pool that was upstairs and I had to try and stay low in it so they wouldn't see. They ended up catching us and Otis (House of 1000 Corpses) was there and he was in charge of me and he said 'I'm going to have you for dessert' and I was wondering if he was flirting with me or being literal.
