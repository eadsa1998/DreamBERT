I was at Mom's and my room was a bit different. I had my computer and this other thing positioned around my bed so the light was away from it when I slept. Dad and Ezra were there. I emptied all these little bits for a puzzle thing onto the floor. Ezra was on my computer and started watching Gossip Girl. I glanced over to see Chuck. I decided I didn't want to watch it and needed to go to bed because of an exam I had in the morning. Dad ordered a pizza. I can't read what it says next, but it looks like 'squeaky times', then "sorry".
