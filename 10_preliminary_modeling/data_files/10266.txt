I am climbing on a high ledge that is very NARROW and then sit on the ledge eating a pear; two working men join me; Frank is walking independently. We are in a government building and we have to register for something; Frank gives a false name; Later I see a letter Frank wrote to a Japanese girl: "To those who alter kisses by making love" (ref. to stamp?)
