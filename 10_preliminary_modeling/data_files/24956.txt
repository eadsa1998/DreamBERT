 A white truck is driving on a snowy, slushy, partially frozen road. This is a Chevy truck commercial. A man says, "What are you gonna do when your herd of cattle run across a snow bank?" He's implying that a Chevy can drive across it. I have a picture of the cattle in my mind. I thought the truck would cross over onto a different area using a passage, but it doesn't. It keeps going, and is then on a 2-lane road, which changes to a 4-lane road. Two semi trucks move into he fast lane and the white truck passes these on the right. There is a gunfight. The back window of the truck is shot out. <br/
