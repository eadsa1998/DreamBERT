["Spies in the office."] I am in an office building. A man (like the young man of Uni house who wanted to seduce me) is coming to steal something important. I am setting up a trap to capture him. I enlist the help of several people. I have one hiding in a closet. He is eating M and M's and trying to stay awake. At the last moment, a woman employee goes in to talk with the woman boss. I signal her not to tell anything. She doesn't understand and wants to tell the boss. I hiss at her and say in a tense whisper, Do not say anything. That's an order. I suspect the boss is in on the theft plot. I demand the employee come out to the hall and I explain to her in a conspirator whisper that I suspect the boss. The employee is shocked and thinks I'm crazy.
