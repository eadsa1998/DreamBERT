Michael J Fox is a split or multiple personality. I am his sister, who may be a part of his madness. He and another male part merge. It becomes obvious that he desperately needs to be around me and maybe merge with me too, but the merge could mean my death. He's relentlessly coming after me. As he is about to merge with me, I wake up with a massive irregular heart beat problem. It takes a moment before it evens out (that part is real and not just the dream).
