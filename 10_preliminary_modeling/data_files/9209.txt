After 22 years, I finally decide to give Darren a second chance. Mostly I feel okay about this, but it doesn't seem to take much to shake my confidence and make me wonder if I'm doing the right thing. We are moving into a townhouse in the same community where Matthew lives. We are trying to combine the contents of two households into this townhouse. I get frustrated with some of the junk, in my opinion, that Darren has kept and is trying to move into our home. I finally decide that a lot of this stuff can go in a room in the basement and that will be his space for all of this kind of thing. There was also something about getting our trailers close to the door and other people's vehicles being in the way.
