A group, perhaps 8 or 10, of the Museum people are standing somewhere on the top floor, when Miss Prims enters. She stares down when passing and I seem to know she has something to tell me. As I approach, she says she has been shopping. I say yes, but it's not very hot, though I then realize that Miss Prims looks .... decidedly oppressive (sultry). I then say however, it is rather sultry. We go to my office, where I open locker to get my coat and find the collar has come off. I remember that the collar has been loose for several days. The collar is attached to a strip which runs down to bottom of coat. There is a red label in collar. The edges of the collar, where it had pulled loose, are uneven and more or less frayed, and the whole thing has a cheap look. There is a gray sweater in the locker and this, I tell Miss Prims it will do until I have the coat repaired at a nearby tailor shop. Miss Prims. then says that she has heard that I have had some sort of an argument, almost a disagreement, with Dyke. I explain the trouble was with Duze, not Dyke, and was in connection with some "mail sorting" which can be explained as follows. There was a certain street on which were several houses built even with sidewalk line (as in Baltimore). On one of these a basement window stood open and when people passed this window nails (about 8 or 10 penny size) whizzed by them and struck against a brick wall across the street. 2 men (one apparently Anderson) and I did some detective work by walking back and forth past this window. We soon determined that the nails were coming out of this window, whereupon Anderson walks quickly to the window and directs a flashlight beam around the basement. It showed a boy, apparently black, crouched on the floor. He had shot the nails by means of a regular rubber gun -- or possibly 2 rubbers fastened to his fingers.
