My boyfriend Jeremy and I were near a dock, perhaps a tourist site or community center.  We were supposed to get on a boat, but somehow we knew it was a trick or not safe, and got on a different boat instead.  It was relatively small, like a 12-person speedboat.  Kids were hiding under the seats where the lifejackets would normally be.  We left dock and arrived in a town like Venice with waterways for streets.  There was a fancy sort of "Annie" museum and as we passed it I mentioned how I always thought her pupil-less eyes were creepy (thinking of the old comic).  It was Annie, but sort of like Lucille Ball, and I thought my mother would like to stop, so we got off the boat there.  Jeremy and I walked inside and decided to try the left wing before actually paying to enter the museum.  The wing seemed to join the museum up with a mall, and we looked at wedding dresses displayed.  The sheer veil-like material of one dress came up around the neck in little peaks, and I thought this was a bad idea because the material had no edging to keep it from fraying.  We continued on and I was holding red and green Mardi Gras beads in my left hand.  We reached the part where the mall opened up, and we decided to head back toward the museum.
