It was a Saturday morning and I had just woken up. I got dressed, went downstairs, and ate breakfast. Then I went over to someone's house. While I was there, my mom called to tell me what my scores (for the SSAT's, for high school entrance) were. When I woke up from my dream, I asked my mom if I could see my test scores. She asked me how I knew that she had them - they had just come in the mail that day. Setting: My house and a friend's house. Characters: My parents were in the dream, and so was a friend of mine, but I'm not sure who it was. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy. I thought that it was strange because of the whole SSAT thing. It was like a psychic thing.
