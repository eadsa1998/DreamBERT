 I'm in a liquor store. I buy a case of beer, a couple bottles of hard cider, and a single bottle of Leinenkugel's beer. I carry this to College Liquor to pay for it. I hope that it's okay that I got the alcohol at one place and pay for it at another place: I feel uneasy doing this because I think the stores don't like or wouldn't allow this. I get all my items for less than $3.00! I go out to the car with my friend Bubba Hacker. There are some black straps holding the trunk closed. Bubba tells me to get in, when I try to tighten them. I get in the back seat and he tightens the straps form the inside by pulling on a strap inside the car.
