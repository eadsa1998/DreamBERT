My sister and I were at some kind of open fair and we were sanding by some kind of gambling game, elevated on a slant where you would place your money in one of the open little squares and the guy who ran it would let a marble or something start at the top and roll down until it went into one of the squares The fist few trys my sister lost, but then she started winning. When she started winning, the guy wanted to change the game and did and instead of little separate squares on the slanted board, there was just a flat surface with a division in the middle to separate it into two sides. He set up pegs on one side to be his and pegs actually cylindrical circles about _" long and _" in diameter) on the other for her. It seems I was standing by watching all this and when he started the game by turning on a vibrator, the object was to see who had the most pegs standing in the end. Then the vibrating pegs turned into football players with me one of them running with the ball and being tackled.
