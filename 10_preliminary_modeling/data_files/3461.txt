There is a doctor, then John Laroquette, like Barry S, a doctor-type, and me, a nurse, and we are supposed to work together. The doctor leaves and John is coaxing me to stay and work with him. He loves me and wants me. I am attracted, but he is presuming too much. He has his arm around my waist saying, "And after we have a nice romantic dinner, we can relax and make love all night." I get haughty and say, "Oh, you think so, huh?" Now Fluffy is in my lap and I'm so glad to see her. I pet her and we are happy. Now I see Bitsy Cat is here too. I am surprised, but then I notice she has huge chunks of naked skin where clumps of fur is missing and blood spots. She's injured. I must help her and ask John to help me. He gets a can of antiseptic spray stuff and I try to hold her and spray and now John and I are doing it together and somehow we are laying down together while we are trying to fix the wound on Bitsy Cat.
