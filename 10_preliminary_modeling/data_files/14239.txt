I was at Nana's. Ezra, Dad and I were there. I could turn into Fido, but I don't know where he was [yesterday we went up there and we didn't see Fido at all]. Ezra didn't know about it. He was starting to get suspicious that Fido wasn't actually Fido though. There was a pond with weird steps scattered around it. I was sitting on it and he scared me off and I ran. I ran with my tongue hanging out as it helped to keep going. I tried to hide the female parts of the dog. Ariana was inside and had a box of toys. She almost knocked it over. I had to quickly run out of the house and ran out the front, as a dog.
