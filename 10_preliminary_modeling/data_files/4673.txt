["The sweet kiss."] I am with a muscular good looking kind man. We are attracted to each other. We are talking, getting acquainted. It is soft and gentle. I am talking and turning my head back to look at him. We are lying comfortably on the ground. He moves in suddenly to kiss me. He sort of half misses, getting mostly my upper lip. I am surprised but respond warmly. We smile shyly. Now we are walking along together. I hold his muscular arm. I like being close to him. We make soft contact often.
