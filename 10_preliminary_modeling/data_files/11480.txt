This took place in the South Pacific aboard a destroyer. Somehow my mother was also aboard this ship. I was about to be transferred to an aircraft carrier. I gathered my gear together and climbed up the ladder of the aircraft carrier. Another sailor showed me to my locker. I spent quite a bit of time getting the locker open. Finally I stowed all my gear and went back on deck to return to the destroyer and say goodbye to my mother. Upon returning topside I saw that the destroyer had cast off and was moving past the carrier and I wasn't going to get to say goodbye. The dream then ended.
