There's a war on and I'm trying to stop the soldiers from fighting, even the ones on "my" side. I capture the guys, seven of them at gun point, and order them to tie each other up, seated in chairs. They are real arrogant but do it. They tease me. I like the leader and he likes me. Then the enemy keeps firing. I try to respond non-violently. Finally, I take a gun and point it at the enemy woman and say, "Stop or I'll shoot." She decides to call my bluff. She watches me closely as she starts to walk away. I fire at her, deliberately missing by inches. She keeps moving. I yell, "Stop or I'll shoot you!" Again, she calls my bluff. I fire at her but I've run out of bullets. I reload the gun (which is white). She's gone by now. I have to decide whether to untie the men soldiers. I hesitate but then do so. Then he introduces me to a group of male giants, "International XXX Thumb group." The guy is so tall that in order for us to talk, he first gets on bended knees and he lays down on me, so we can be eye to eye. I tell him that he can take his group to the enemy castle and all peek into the windows. It will scare the enemy. They agree to do it. I then untie more of the men soldiers. The leader says to his buddy, "She thinks I'm leaving here, but what she doesn't know is, I'm not. She'll have to stay here with me." Here is North Africa.
