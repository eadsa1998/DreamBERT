One time I had a dream that we were back at Glacier National Park, and that we were there with Sandra and Derek and Dad and Mom and I. And we were hiking and hiking. We were hiking down by some lake area, and we were trying to get back to the Visitor Center and we thought we would have to go through a cave and swim to get back to the Visitor Center. And I came in wearing a dress. So we found a shorter route that was only a mile, and we got back to the Visitor Center and I kind of lost everybody, so I figured I would stand by the door in the Visitor Center and they would find me eventually. And they did. Samantha and Sandra came out, pushing this gingerbread house that was so big it had to be pushed along on wheels, and it was designed to be eaten on the trail ______ a snack. So Samantha and Sandra and I only wanted to hike one more mile and Dad and Derek and Mom wanted to go ten more miles. So Samantha and Sandra and I took the short trail and we said we would meet back at the Visitor Center. So Samantha and Sandra and I started off hiking, pushing this gingerbread house that was on wheels, it was so big. And we were eating little cookies and little candies and little nutty things off of it, and was getting top-heavy on the one side, so we had to lay it down. And I was just going to reach for another ginger cookie, and I woke up.
