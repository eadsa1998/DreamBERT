I was in the dining room and the pool table was in there, with letters on it. Daryl messed it up and I was setting it out and he was sitting with me and I was listening to music. I went to the toilet and something was peeing in the sink in the bathroom. When I went back, Daryl had changed the music because he thought it was gay. My phone had something about Donald Brown (an ugly townie Sim on Sims 2). Calvin and Silas were around somewhere too.
