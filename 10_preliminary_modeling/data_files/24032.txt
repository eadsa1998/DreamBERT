In my dream I was walking down the street where my house was in the country I escaped from three years ago. I was going towards the house. All my friends were coming towards me. A girl who was a really close friend passed me and said, "Hi," like she just met me, and the rest of my friends said "hi" and continued walking toward the house. I was walking and I saw a big black hole in my room. My windows were broken. My whole house was destroyed and I was saying, "I am not dreaming this, I am awake," and kept on saying that. I was going in the house, and that's when I woke up.
