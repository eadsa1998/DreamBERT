I dreamed I was somehow forced to get into a car. I had the feeling I was in danger and I had to get away. I began to drive this car and I felt as though I were in a strange environment. I realized then that I did not know how to drive and I began to feel insecure behind the wheel. I was a truck coming toward me and I did not know where the brake was. The truck gradually stopped as it approached me, but my car kept going and began pushing the truck in a backward direction. The truck driver was shouting at me trying to tell me how to stop and I kept apologizing that I was new at driving. The only other thing I remember was being stuck in the middle of a bill and trying to figure out a way to get off of it.
