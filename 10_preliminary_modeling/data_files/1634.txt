I am in a large room, sort of a bedroom/classroom. My client Tim (student) comes in with 3 pals, all in a joking mood. They are cute. I go over to a round table to check my appointment times. A man walks through, smiling to himself. I leave and am walking down a hilly sidewalk. I hear 1950's upbeat music and see a sorority group dancing with long sorts of charm skirts. It is amazing. I start to dance too, laughing. I stop and sit on the prickly grass near the area to watch. A man who likes me (like the cute guy from Mechanics Dept.) asks me over to sit with him on the sidewalk stairs to his house. He asks his son permission. I come into the house. The man and his son like me. The son is going to perform a trick for me. He will look like he's hanging himself, but he is safe the whole time. The father and I are nervous about it. It appears that the rope around his neck is too tight. We grimace when he does. He does the trick, sort of, and it's OK.
