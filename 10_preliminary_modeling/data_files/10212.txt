I dream that Father Andrew has come to give a talk at the Retreat Center. I touch his left shoulder as a gesture of greeting; I see the light in his brown eyes quite clearly; very vivid image. He implies that I had been "dandled on my mother's knee" (i.e. spoiled). I say "Father, even if I had a bad childhood, I am now in a good place." We shake hands and say good-bye. shift: at a dinner party sitting at a round table, but worry about a man at the next table who seems to be trying to be familiar with me (man is unknown). Frank and I talk of other things and I rebuff the man at the next table....
