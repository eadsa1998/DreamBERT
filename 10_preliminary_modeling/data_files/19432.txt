Cindy and I went to pick up Zack; my sister was also there. I told her to stay in the car with the baby. I would be right back. I went in and as usual Zack was not ready. My sister came in and I yelled, "What the hell are you doing? Where is the baby?" "She's asleep in the car." I called her an idiot and ran out the door. The door to the car was open and Cindy was looking right at me. "You're lucky, Bitch! I'll kill you if something happens to her." Then we were at Zack's mom's house. I said, "Where is Zack?" His mom said that he was in the back room, so I went to find him. He was sitting on a chair, looking depressed. He had a bottle of Scotch, half gone, a glass and an empty beer bottle on a small table. I said, "You're drinking! Why the hell are you drinking?" At first I was mad. Zack said, "I'm sad and I'm lonely. I've been feeling this way for a while, ever since Alice got pregnant. I wish it never happened. I wish she never had the baby!" I asked him if he felt that way about Cindy too. He just looked up sad and said no. But I felt he wanted to say yes, but he cares about me way too much to tear my heart like that. It made me sad. I felt inside that he wished we never had our beautiful baby. How could he feel that way?
