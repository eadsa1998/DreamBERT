I was in New York City, was working there with Fisher and Andy P. The streets were being remodeled. There was a deep cut in the center, which was for the trucks and heavy vehicles and the two upper sides was for the light traffic. The lower traffic had vehicles that would pick up any rubbish on the street at any time. We were walking along and Andy P. found himself a girlfriend. She was walking with us. I looked at her face. She was dark complected, had no makeup on. I passed Joe G. and didn't say anything to him, and he yelled, "Hello, Evans." So I looked back and said, "Hello, Joe," and walked back and said, "I didn't mean to be so rude. I was thinking about something and didn't see you." He said the same thing happened to him, but his daughter told him about it and he came to. I was on 68th St. helping Rose Lasko with some work. I was going home with the boys when Rose called me. I said to the boys, "You go. I'll be back later." I came to Rose and wanted to kiss her, but she ran. I gave chase into one room. My father was there, and into another room, Ann's father was there. So into the third room, I got her into a corner and intimated her.
