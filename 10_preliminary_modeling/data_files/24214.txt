I argue with a man at a zoo manatee exhibit. He is telling his wife and infant daughter they are carnivorous. I tell him they're not. They eat plants. He tells me, no, they eat meat. I say to him, look, they're eating water lettuce right now. They're larger than the usual kind of manatee. So I could be wrong. But that would be impossible. Look at them, slowly swimming around. He says they could eat fish. And I said to look at how slow they swim. They're like cows. They could be like whales and eat small stuff, but I know that's not true. I walk over to a tour guide and ask what they eat, are they carnivore or herbivorous? She says something about imported pigs, but then I clarify, "me and this guy are having an argument--do they eat meat or plants. The attractive black woman says "oh, plants," and I prove the guy wrong. She then says, "It's not like sand people trivia or anything." The 'comments' on the placard near the manatees has people talking about Star Wars. I flirt with her: "do they travel in twos or single file?" "Are they easily scared, or brave?" I think of more when I walk away.
