I'm in some weird abandoned house with a family that I can't recognize, but there is a blond woman with us who looks like Thelma Anderson. We haven't seen any yet, but all of us know that there are zombies all over the house and we're all armed with stuff. I'm holding two homemade sticks of dynamite and everyone's telling me that they're duds. One of them lights for no reason and I throw it in a dark room and it blows up in a huge explosion. Everyone's impressed, but they're saying how are you going to light the other one? All the sudden I'm in my kitchen opening the top cupboard door and getting a book of matches from where we usually keep them. Then when I have them, I'm back in the haunted house and everyone's happy I got the matches somehow. Now I'm walking through the house with just Thelma and some weird guy gives me a baseball bat (just like one used to kill zombies). As we walk through the house, we hear screaming and a zombie starts running toward us. I take the bat and start hitting it and it lays on the ground and I start beating it while it's on the ground, again and again. And while I'm doing that, I'm all the sudden transported to a library. Now me and Joey are in a library and the librarian says, "This is a training center for all the zombies in the world." I think the librarian was Buffy the vampire slayer (but I'm not sure). While Joey and I are walking through the library, I see Andy Gunn and I chase after him. I have to fight these people to get to him and as I get closer, this black guy stands right in front of me and as I punch him in the face, I wake up and actually hit my wall (which is what I think woke me up).
