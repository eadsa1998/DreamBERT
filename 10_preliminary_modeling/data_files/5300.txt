I dreamed that I was in the library on a Sunday and it was huge, practically the size of the entire main building. It was raining outside. Every Sunday, we all had to go to the athletic center for some reason, just the sophomores. One Sunday, I decided I didn't want to go anymore, so I just cut it and stayed in the library with Jackson. Then I woke up.
