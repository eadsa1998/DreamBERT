This dream is like a fantasy relating to today's events. It occurred because on the previous night I had been thinking that some day I would have a console stereophonic radio (big and ample). But this was really only a fantasy in my mind. In the dream it happened that I was in some kind of a garden and then a girl cousin of mine appeared and she had a pocket transistor radio. When I saw the radio, I asked her to lend it to me and I was amazed to see that it had several control buttons, just like a stereophonic radio, but in a miniature. I tried to listen and my amazement continued. That's all.
