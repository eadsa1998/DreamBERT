I'm trying clothes on. I'm trying clothes on in preparation for a trip that I'm taking. Like a jacket there made of straw. There's also a very fancy one of blue corduroy. I'm debating with myself whether I can afford this blue one. Then I decide what the hell, I will. Then there are some people around I haven't seen for a long while. This whole thing transforms itself into a very gala occasion. Gene _______ I remember especially was there, and John__________ and Gus ___________ and I think Gene -----____________ and I spot each other from a distance. We rush up and throw our arms around each other and slap each other on the back. I think I'm saying something to John __________ like, "Jesus I don't ever see you except at parties and yet you're around here every day," or something like that. In there there's this image of a jacket hanging on a metal hanger and it's like this jacket becomes a fixed object, not loose anymore. It's like it has turned from cloth to straw, and I'm looking at the inside of it and there are a couple of pins sticking up inside on the shoulder. I'm remarking to myself something like, "What novel arrangement that is. Leave it to the English." That's all the dream I can remember, but while I'm remembering after the last dream, I was thinking before going back to sleep about that symbol M3 female and I was going over in my mind the different kinds of actions I would put under that category. I was wondering if I put to get dressed under that wondering whether getting dressed involved enough circular developing movements to be considered inclusive mode. I thought of that when I was reporting this dream about dressing and undressing.
