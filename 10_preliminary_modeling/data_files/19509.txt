A big barn, probably on Ed Bow's place. Ground is muddy, and there is much wet straw and manure lying around. At left end of barn is a small extension, consisting of a sidewalk and roof, behind which is a spring or at least a place where water can be obtained. Because of the wet ground work in the fields has been suspended and this seems to explain the presence of about a dozen children (7 to 10 years old) who are playing at left end of barn. Somewhat to themselves are 3 girls, one much younger and smaller than the other 2. The youngest one says something (perhaps "damn") for which she was scolded by the 2 larger girls. A bird which looks like a coot (mud hen) (but which may have been a skinny chicken) runs toward drinking place at left end of barn. The bird is very timid or wild, and will not stand still long enough to take a drink. Presently it goes behind the little extension or shed and though it is invisible, I seem to know that it has plunged into the water and taken a drink. Soon it reappears and runs off to join several other birds standing a few yards off.
