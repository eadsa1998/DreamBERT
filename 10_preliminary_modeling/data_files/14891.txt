I was in a room with Ezra and some others (there was about four of us). There were lots of beds. There were zombies. We were on the second floor or so. We had to leave and Ezra was worried and checked outside but nothing was there. We suggested other places to look. I went to the window in the toilet and looked out and I saw some. There was a light on in front of our house/building. The curtain wasn't staying up properly now. It was also like a game and you could 'loot' -- I got new shoes from looting. Then we were outside. To get to other places you had to use this complicated rope system. You had to hold onto the rope and swing onto the platforms. Someone fell. I almost fell off and lost a bunch of stuff, but didn't. I think Mel Gibson had been part of our group or something and someone said something that referred to "the stranger that took him". He was in some show called Macabre and that was his character's name. It was Tom Cruise's kid's birthday and he sent him to 'Cowboy Land'. He had a black maid and he was like "What? It's cowboys!".
