 I'm at Ace Hardware in Oak Valley where it used to be on the corner of Main Street and Oak Avenue. I see my friend Tiny Combs there. The store is selling t-shirts for three or four dollars because they are closing and moving to a new store. The shirts are the thin, worn-in kind that my friend Holly Lapson likes. Tiny steals a shirt. I get in my mom's car and quickly leave. Tiny is in his car, and also leaves quickly. I am not comfortable with Tiny stealing a shirt. After we pull out of the parking lot we are near the round park by McDonalds in Wilmerton, as if we had just pulled out of the McDonalds parking lot.
