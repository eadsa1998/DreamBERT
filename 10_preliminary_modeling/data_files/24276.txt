It was going back to 13's childhood [a character in the TV show House], when she was living with her dad and stepmother under the ocean. He was a marine researcher. She had a dream that her dad was holding up the dead head of one of her dwarf hamsters. This disturbed her. The wall to their apartment was underwater. It faced a reef, and there were many, many fish flying around outside. I remember thinking how the could manage such a great setup. It was dark and blue inside, with a hint of being cold and wet. She got into a fight with her father because she didn't want to live there anymore. And in the argument, she flung her hand and knocked off the top of their very maze-like habitrail tube structure. The section flew off, and when her dad picked up the pieces, he saw a dead hamster inside one of the segments. It was decapitated. He picked up its tiny severed head. It was light brown and white. I then entered the scene, feeling bad for the hamster, and picked up another dangerously hanging section of tube sticking out in the kitchen, shortened it, and put it in a less precarious position. There was a nest inside.
