I was at a beach party with many people I knew, yet I felt lonely because the fellow I had come with had gone back to the car for something forgotten. It was a very black night with a haze over the water about 1/4 of a mile out. I wanted to swim into the haze and I knew I was a good enough swimmer to do it, but I was afraid of what was beyond the haze. I swam out to it and forced myself to go into it. It covered me like a blanket and I quickly returned to shore really afraid.
