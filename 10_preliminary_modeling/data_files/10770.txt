I dreamed that I was sitting at a table with a girl in my dormitory, her boyfriend and either 2 or 3 other people whom I don't recall. Anyhow, the girl was asking me all sorts of questions about a dance I was supposed to have attended last week, but to which I never went. I had signed out for this dance before I left my dormitory that evening, but had merely done this in order to secure a later permission than what I would ordinarily receive. The girl evidently knew I hadn't gone to the dance and she was asking me all about to see if she could trip me in any way.
