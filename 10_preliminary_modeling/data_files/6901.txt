One of my students had won an honor. Her name was checked on a newspaper list. She told me there was a fuller account in the paper and handed me a sheet of it printed in many colors, mainly red and green. I couldn't find the account and when she told me where to look I couldn't see it and when she explained further I couldn't hear.
