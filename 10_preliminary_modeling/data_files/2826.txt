I see a neat computer program in a computer and suggest we network our computers so I can use it too. We do and I am delighted about what this program does. I write in a story and it creates a moving picture or cartoon response to my words. It's very fast and well done. I hear two male voices, both talking at once, and comment that this was actually two parts of my mind that were working simultaneously, one intuitive and the other analytical.
