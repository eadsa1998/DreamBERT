I was in a room with George W. Bush and a couple of other people.  Bush and I were throwing a tennis ball back and forth when suddenly he started acting as if he was having a heart attack and fell on the floor.  Others in the room were alarmed, but I was pretty sure he was joking.  I went over and reached into his shirt and pulled the tennis ball out from around his shoulder.  There was another tennis ball under his shirt around his stomach.
