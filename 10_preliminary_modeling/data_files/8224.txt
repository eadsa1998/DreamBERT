Bev was visiting. Andrew S was with her. There was also a little girl, about 3 years old. I was trying to get ready for work and was trying on outfit after outfit. I was trying to find something to go with peach-colored jeans that I was wearing. The shirts either didn't match or they were too small or too big. I finally decided on something. I was running very late. I asked Bev if Mari Kate S could come up and help me but I don't know if she wasn't there or if she was doing something else. Andrew S came up to help me. He was helping me to pull one of my shirts down in the back. I was leery about having him help but finally decided it was fine. Then he stood outside the door. I told him he had to wait out there because I was going to try on yet another one. When I got ready to leave there were about 5 or 6 steps outside the apartment front door. I kind of ran down but almost in a skipping way. I saw Andrew S follow. I took a right on the sidewalk - it was sloped downward. Then I took another right and it was sloped upward. I was headed to my car. Andrew S was following me and the little girl was following him. I said, Andrew S. You have to watch her. You need to go back inside. Your mom is going to wonder where you are. He kept following me and the little girl kept walking out into the street. I said, Andrew S. You have to watch her. You have to keep her out of the street. She can't play in the streets here. I said it very tersely the second time. He wasn't paying attention. She kept going out into the street. I was getting frustrated because I was late for work. I stopped and turned around and said, Andrew S. You have GOT to keep her out of the street. This time I sounded even more terse. He finally turned around and went and picked her up and headed back inside.
