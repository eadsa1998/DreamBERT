We were at school -- Melinda and I -- and I was running out of the Media Center full speed ahead and tumbling and rolling, hoping that I could get out of there before they caught up with me because I didn't want to do what they wanted me to do. And then I came back in because I knew I had left them in the dust and I didn't want to leave them in the dust, so I came back in. I bumped face to face into Mrs. Talmadge, and she started telling me how, she was like, "Melinda told me your father's back-up alarm scared you when you were little, and I understand you're afraid of 'oo' sounds and my name has 'oo' in it." [laugh] You know, I never thought about that consciously. That's weird. Ooo-oo-ooh. But anyway, then when we were at the fire headquarters, and I was supposedly playing a computer game in virtual reality and I was running up the stairs with this like three-quarters of a birdcage that I was holding onto. And it was around my body and I was like holding it up. And I bump into Sharon and George, and they start saying, "Oh hey, how are ya? And how'd you like the trip up to the river, and all?" And then I woke up.
