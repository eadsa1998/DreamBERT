I am in a bus station and looking at a posted map of routes. A woman and a little girl are standing next to me. The girl opens her hand and it has a penny. I do the same and I also have a penny in my hand, but mine seems bigger than hers. I give it to her. Then her mother smiles and asks me what bus I am looking for. I tell her I want to go to Westwood or South City. She says those cities are not located where I am looking, which is in N.J., but rather are to the east of N.Y. and she points to where I thought Long Island was and it does say N.J. I am truly puzzled but I realize the map must be correct.
