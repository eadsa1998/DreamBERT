 I'm on a bicycle and I ride to Byerly's grocery store for ice cream. I was going to go to Dairy Queen but I change my course and park my bicycle at Byerly's. I see a young woman as I walk in who looks very familiar to me. I'm back by the ice cream freezer, trying to decide what to buy. I'm going to buy a box of ice cream bars. It is hot out, and many people are buying these. I see my high school classmate Carol Stilten as I walk and she sees me, but I don't look at or talk to her: I keep going.
