I am dressed as a man, 1800's, a cowboy hat and a business suit. I'm driving a wagon and come to a town owned by a greedy man. He charges too much for everything. So I decide to stay outside the city limits in my own wagon and be self-sufficient. I ask where the line is and go beyond it. I sleep in the wagon and have food. Another man follows me and watches. He knows I'm female (or suspects it) and seems protectively interested in me. He's leaning against a door jamb and I am also, looking up at the profile of his face, searchingly. (see drawing)
