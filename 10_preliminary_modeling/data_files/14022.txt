Dexter (Dexter) jumped into the water and swam to get rid of evidence. Then I was with Dad sitting on these train tracks. Al Pacino and Robert de Niro were there. Al was telling us what we had to do and I joked to Dad if he knew which one he was and he did know. We had to quickly cross the tracks. This girl said something to Robert de Niro and he came over and leant over to talk to her, but this train came and killed him. It reset and so he didn't die, but someone else did. He fell into the water next to the tracks and this boat exploded.
