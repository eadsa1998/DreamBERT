I am at a school as a guest speaker. A young man is also a speaker, We chat and pass in the halls as we go to our classrooms to speak. After we're done I'm going to leave and he says, "Do you want to eat one of those frank and cheese things they have for lunch? They're pretty good." I say, "Sure," hoping this means he likes me and wants to spend time with me. He goes to get one. As I'm waiting, I realize I'm feeling sad and frustrated. He won't really like me, he's just being polite. So I get up and start leaving quickly. An older man, short, glasses and balding like (Clyde?) starts talking to me. It slows me down. He stops to pee in a restroom stall, still talking. I can see the stream of urine. He didn't even bother to shut the door. I am offended and start running. Nobody cares about me, is my feeling. Another older man starts talking to me. I barely nod, feeling impolite but too angry and hurt to really care. Then an older woman says she wants to tell me a construction story and starts in describing the manger scene of Joseph, Mary and the baby Jesus. I give up and start walking back to where I left the young man, listening to her go on and on. I pass the two older men who look at me and apologize. I just wave them off. I know I'll see the young man again, but it can't be helped. Then I say to the woman, annoyed, "Are you telling me that the best occupation for a woman is to have a baby? You're telling this to a cripple?" I am incredulous at her insensitivity.
