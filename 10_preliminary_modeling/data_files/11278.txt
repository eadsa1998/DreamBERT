The location of the dream was a picnic ground far from anything else. The only people at the picnic that I knew were my father and myself. When it came time to leave the picnic, we found that our car had been stolen. As we were waiting to hitch a ride back into town, a good friend of the family (middle-aged woman) came along in her car. She stopped and asked us the cause of our trouble, but for some reason that I can't remember, she refused us a ride and drove off by herself.
