I dreamt that I was sitting in front of someone's home somewhere making mad love to my husband. My best friend and her husband were there also, and when all sorts of other people left us, we continued on our happy way. Then suddenly I had nothing but a coat on, and the crowds came back. I must grudgingly admit that I was slightly embarrassed but my husband came to the scene (I don't know where we were at this point) and I forgot all emotions except how happy I was that he was with me.
