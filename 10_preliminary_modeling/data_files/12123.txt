Dad got tickets to a show with a guy called Pat Hurt, who was a singer. But he cancelled and it was boxing instead. Ezra and I decided not to go. Nana was going to it. We were playing this game with these people and we had two thingies, which I think were Pokemon. They had Harry Potter and Runescape though. I got rid of one thing because of a card. I learnt spells and it turned into checkers because they gave up. Ezra and I ended up in a strange snowy place. There were bad people. I threw a snowball at them and then we ran off. We ended up in Midvale, across from the shops. We walked to the shops. The bad people followed and we ran into the liquor store and hid in the fridge. A guy came in and I bashed him.
