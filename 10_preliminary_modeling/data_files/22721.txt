I was at the university with a boyfriend and a girlfriend and later we went out, but a Philosophy professor I used to have appeared and started giving a series of opinions about the Kennedy family. We arrived at an eating place, and the owner was a very strange lady. There were no other people in the place; the place was empty. Suddenly three men with guitars appeared from the back. The lady sat with us and asked us what we were going to have. Since we couldn't make up our minds, the teacher said that we should first go to the school where he taught to let them know he wouldn't come to class. We went out and walked to the school. When we arrived, it was an old and big house with a garden outside in which there were swings and children's games. The children were playing there and when we arrived, they looked at us and the professor told them that he was not going to have a class and -- strangest thing -- they started to make fun and laugh at him. I can't remember any more.
