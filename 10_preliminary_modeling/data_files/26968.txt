I walked into a tiny picturesque blacksmith shop and there, at a large table, the blacksmith and his wife were shoeing a tiny white donkey. I knew it was a donkey although it was no bigger than a fox terrier. It was lying flattened on its stomach, front legs out front, hind legs out back. The blacksmith's wife was holding his head while the blacksmith held one dainty hind foot between his thumb and forefinger and filed the shoe around the edges. I talked to them, and noticed that the blacksmith had a handful of tiny horse shoes similar in size and shape to copper pennies with a horseshoe-shaped rim around them. Then I saw a rather large two-wheeled cart standing next to the donkey. "Does he really pull that?" I asked, and they answered proudly, "Oh, yes, all the time." I felt sorry for him, having to pull such a large wagon, but I just said, "Isn't that remarkable."
