I went up to the third floor of our house to visit the lawyer who lives there, but found that he wasn't home and that instead a man whom I didn't know and a blond girl who looked familiar were busily washing the yellow paint off the kitchen wall so that the wallpaper of rose and green flowered design showed through. I remember thinking this rather odd as the walls were freshly painted. I went downstairs again and was surprised to see a man on the roof aiming a pistol at my husband who was asleep in bed. I screamed at him to warn him and ran into the hall. The man climbed in the window, however, and was aiming his pistol at me when I woke up.
