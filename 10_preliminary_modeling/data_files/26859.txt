 I'm fishing with my friend Paul Jones. I catch a couple of tiny fish. We're using small and medium fish for bait. I get a large fish that looks the same as the smaller one I caught. I catch them off a cliff. I see the water below me through a hole in the soil: the cliff is undercut. We jig off the cliff for the fish.
