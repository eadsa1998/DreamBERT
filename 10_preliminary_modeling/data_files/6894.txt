I came a little late to the spread. It was not served but lady at end asked me to pass the bread. I asked her to serve me. She said, "this is only bread here, but you can have toast." I then helped myself, reached into one dish and got almost half of a small chick, missed it, found it on the floor. I got other things, one small chicken thigh which a young girl tried to take from me when I got up to get small green pickles, for most were leaving. I held onto the chicken and kept it. I also got 3 or 4-inch cubes of jellied salad. (in color)
