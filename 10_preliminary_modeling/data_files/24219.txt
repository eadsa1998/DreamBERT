I was in competition with another newspaper for a story. A big story broke, and I was sent to cover it. I was worried about when I should leave for it. It ended up getting dark and I just sort of hung around the parking lot of the newspaper where I interned. I was thirsty, and I went to find water or something. I went home and took a shower. It was one of the houses I lived in when growing up. There was a photojournalist from the newspaper where I work doing a story of Obama or someone like that living in the house. I stepped out of the shower and the photographer was sitting right there on the couch, with a clear view of the hallway. He took a shot of the candidate with me in the frame in a white towel. As I moved to quickly get into my room, I slipped. He took another shot. I grumbled about how they offer no privacy. The journalist, a young girl eager to get a good story, came in to talk to me. I offered some good quotes (I can't remember them) as I was trying to fall asleep. She put them in the story, along with pictures. One of the pictures she got was one of me with a skinny black girl, the daughter of someone famous. One was me with my arms wrapped around her. The other was of my chest on her breasts. I had a distressed expression, like I was confiding something to her. The reporter had painted versions of me from the shots. They made it into a "This American life" photo story that was up for sale. It contained shots of everyone with me in the family business.
