I was back to teaching, wearing a full skirt like in the 1950's that billowed and swirled around me. I was in my classroom, reading through a "reading" book and getting ideas to teach with. I felt good and capable. Xmas themes in the book. I hear a child crying, "Help! Help!" I go out into the hall. Some little girl was trying to push open the doors to get out of the girl's room. She had enough strength to hold it partially open but couldn't get any further! I picked her up and soothed her. I walked her up and down halls, feeling a limp in my bad leg but glad I could pick her up and carry her. Three times I went past the editor's office. He came out and walked with me (the girl disappeared). We were looking over lists of concerts (rock). He said, "You've probably not been to many." I said, "Ha. I certainly have." He showed me his arm. Two rock groups were engraved in red on his arm. "The Million Dollar Kid" and the "Crystal XXX." We strolled down the street. I told him how the people had kindly re-hired me and that I was feeling pretty good now and I could handle it.
