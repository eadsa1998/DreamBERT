My 19th birthday was tomorrow and I had organsised with Darren to find someone to lose my virginity to. At night time Darren picked me up and we drove. I said 'can we pick someone up' and we agreed to go the shop. There was no-one I liked at the place. There were pictures of some celebs -- I remember Nathan Fillion, but he as in Switzerland. A lady showed me a picture of a guy and he was old and had a comb-over and I said 'ew no'. I eventually found a guy who I thought was ok. Mom didn't know about it. I also talked to Leif on Facebook and he asked how much I got paid and I said '$6' and some other stuff. He said 'it's like you almost speak another language sometimes' and I said 'you don't always make sentences correctly' and he was like 'fuck you' and I said I wasn't' being mean and that I wished I could speak another language as well as he could. Linus also commented on something. I went to the beach with Dad and the waves started pulling back and I ran to get away from the huge wave.
