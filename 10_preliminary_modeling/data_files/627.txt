My husband and I go to our apartment on the second floor of a building in the town next to my hometown. One of three sisters who lived in our neighborhood is there with another girl and two guys. They remain at the table. My husband and I are still single and are planning to move to this apartment. He is acting strange and wants to talk about me cheating on him. I get the impression he wants to call off the wedding but he doesn't say that. We talk all night. I tell him the only thing that bothers me about him is his drinking. He gets so crabby. He agrees that is a problem. We look at the clock and it is 7:30 a.m. I know I am in big trouble because my parents will think we've been "shacking up". Then I remember we have witnesses because the other people are there. AS we get up to go I realize I am not wearing a blouse - just a bra. I can't keep the straps up but this seems very normal. Not a problem. I also notice Barbara, the mother of the neighbor girl, as she stands up. She is wearing seamed nylons. We start down the stairs with Barbara in front.
