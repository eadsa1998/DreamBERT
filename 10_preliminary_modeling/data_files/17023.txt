I'm in an European city rich in art and architecture (it's not clear which one). Apparently I've been a resident there for about six months, and I know my way around. There's a class of students visiting from my home country. Perhaps I am their tutor, or perhaps I'm one of the students. My friend Terry's younger brother is there with some of his friends, and he is involved with one of the girls. She is attractive, but perhaps a bit bitchy. It appears however that Terry's brother is in love with this girl. He goes to a lot of trouble to impress her. He's in a band and wants me to teach him some things on the guitar. I'm out in the city park with some other musicians. We plan to busk on a green opposite a busy road leading down a hill. We have guitars and amplifiers, however I'm unsure how to play all of a sudden, so I try to postpone it for as long as possible. A black guy comes over and tries to intimidate me by wanting to take or borrow a piece of our equipment. I don't know him, so I say no he can't. Now perhaps we are in an American city. We start playing, and he seemed to respect us, and whether he had good intentions or not before, he wanders off. Terry's brother was waiting for his girlfriend who didn't turn up to meet him until later that night. She had been drinking and was trying not to smile. Terry's brother looked hurt. She then broke up with him suddenly in public, saying "Sorry" but not meaning it. Terry's brother was devastated and I tried to cheer him up after she had left.
