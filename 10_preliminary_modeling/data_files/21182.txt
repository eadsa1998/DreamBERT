It was snowing. I picked up some of the snowflakes in my hand. Audrey was throwing a dagger at me. I told her if she did that again, I would send her to reform school. I was driving and my car started to roll backwards downgrade. I applied my foot and emergency brake and it wouldn't stop. I ran over the curb stone on the lawn. I came to a stone wall. It had a brick gate and a man opened it and let me thru. I looked thru a skylight and saw an airplane. I carried a 22 pistol in my pocket. I was a sort of detective.
