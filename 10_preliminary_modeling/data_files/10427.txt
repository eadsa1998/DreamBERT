On a long trip with Pedro. We go to a visit a nun w. whom I go to church with. Pedro is bored; We stop at a clothes sale, but I dont find anything I like. It is windy and sunny; a cat tries to eat a piece of steak I have just cut up for our supper. I finally give it to the cat and go up to my room to take a nap.
