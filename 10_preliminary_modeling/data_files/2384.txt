I'm in a house. A noise or light in the room sets off an orgasm and I'm sitting on a couch. Other people are in the room, a man, maybe Chuck. I put a magazine up by my face, pretending to read it so no one will see my face and I try not to respond to the strong orgasm so no one will know this is happening. I'm embarrassed. Then I hear electricity zapping in the next room. A cord is lying in the water. I am aware this is dangerous and am leaving the house so I'll be safe, when I see a small girl child bend down to pick up the zapping cord. She's standing in the water (Charla/Dovre) in a dress. I yell, "NO! NO! Don't touch that." I'm frantic. She pays no attention to me and picks it up. I must stop her, but to return and get her will endanger myself, but I must. I'm yelling at her as I rush in, grab her hands and pull her out. I'm amazed there are no burn marks on her hands. She seems unharmed. I rush out of the house, carrying her, looking for the fuse box. Others try to help me. I push them aside, they are in the way. I find the box and don't know which way to push the switches and ask, "Is this the on or off?" I turn them all off, one by one. Now I feel sad, the house is dark, the food will spoil, it will be cold, because there is no energy, but at least we are safe.
