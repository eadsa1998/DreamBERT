I was sitting at home (living room) one night listening to popular songs on the radio (portable). Suddenly it began to thunder and lightning outside. My mother (as usual) told me to shut off the radio so that no harm would be done if lightning should strike the aerial. I would not do so -- finally a bolt accompanied by a deafening roar hit the house and caused the radio to explode, shaving my face with glass, jagged plastic, etc. I looked into the mirror. My face was bloody, cut beyond recognition.
