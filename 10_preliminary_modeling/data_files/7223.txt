About a dozen visiting women sitting around. Several especially friendly, talking to me. I noticed the clock said 10. I said, "Sorry ladies, it is 10 p.m. and we are supposed to be in our rooms by 9 p.m. so goodnight." I start upstairs wondering why the nurse had not sent them home. But in another room upstairs I hear singing and dancing. As I reach the upper hall, I hear someone walking below and look down the stairwell but the walker is out of sight. I enter a bathroom but a boy is trying to get in thru the curtain and I push him back.
