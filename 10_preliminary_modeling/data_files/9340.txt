I am walking the streets near a university and go into a place unmarried professors have apartments. I find the one I want to talk to--an ugly man I know. I walk outside his room and sit at a library table with light in center. He brings mushrooms and a dish of raw vegetables. I feel the meal is skimpy. Then he brings beef after I have eaten the first two courses. It is in gravy and cut like sukiyaki. The door opens and a professor next door comes out. He is also unattractive. I feel both are mediocre in looks and talent.
