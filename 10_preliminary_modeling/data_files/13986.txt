I was in accounting and we had a test. The class was smaller. I got distracted by the teacher, who was Ms Madsen (but sometimes was someone else) and only ended up doing one of the many questions. Darius and Michael (and the rest) were sitting at these desks front of me. I had accidentally hit Darius and he went to the nurse. When he came back he said "I had to get a test" and Eugene laughed at him. Eugene asked me a question and came and sat next to me for me to answer, but then got interrupted by his friends. I saw Alejandro outside, walking to the classroom and I went to open the door, but it was already open.
