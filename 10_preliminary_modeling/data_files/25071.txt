 I'm in a light blue van with a few other guys and we're heading into an underground parking ramp. Two men try to get us to stop. We slow, but don't stop, turning and going down to a lower level. When the men are out of sight we jump out of the van , leaving it and run to the stairs. We try to loose the men following us by going up stairs, then over, then up, then over, etc. I think we lose the men. I'm in a very big building, looking for someone or something to start me off. I go outside, nothing is there that I need or want. I go back in, and on the way in I see a girl who tells me that her friend Jaime likes me. I remember Jaime from last year. I have no clue what to do next. I go in and am in a stairwell. My roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens are there. I try to see up on this "secret shelf" on the stairway. I don't think anything is there. I am with some other people who are lost. WE find a map. Walking up to it, I see a man on the telephone giving mouth-to-mouth to another man. I quickly look away, thinking that one must have killed the other. It is pointed out to me that I am in the Delaware or Syracuse section of the building on the map. <br/
