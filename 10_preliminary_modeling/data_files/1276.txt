I am preparing to go out and perform to a group of people. I walk out of the house, onto the porch. They applaud. I notice the applause continues even after they stop clapping. It's really some other group behind a wall responding to some other group. I start the intro. As I'm speaking, the group gets up and leaves. I call out to them, "Wait we've got a good show!" Only 4 or 5 persons remain. I say, "Oh well, the show must go on." I start the show anyway. I go in to get the rest of the "Birds." By now the audience is wandering all over the lawn. I go out there to see the stream that this guy likes to fish and relax in. I find water standing in a field of crops. At first I think, "That's it." I notice rows of funny looking trees. They have a name. Then I see the stream. I go to the edge and look. I start sliding. I reach out my arm to a woman and say, "Help me, I'm slipping." She is neutral. She doesn't help. I hang on, hoping and finally in desperation, I put myself up out of danger. We go back to the house. In the hall, lots of waiter people are working hard. Nate says he's going down to the basement to check it out. As he leaves, I fall head first down the laundry chute to the basement and get there before he does! A plump guy follows me because he knows that I'll be accused and will look guilty being there first. He wants to help me. He gets there and goes to meet Nate head on. The hall is now the inside of a diesel truck. The interior is painted red and there is spooky danger there! He calls out, "Howard! Howard!," (I wake up).
