 I am at Armstrong High School in the office. There is a new female principal. She is in her office with some teenage girls. The girls may be the woman's daughters. I talk to the woman in her office. At first I close the door, but then I open it because it doesn't matter if its' closed. I tell her who I am, what I do, that I graduated two years ago, and that I go to Brimson. I tell her that I had come before to do classroom observations for my Educational Psychology class, and I'm back to do more observations. I ask if she'll write me a pass. She asks me in whose room I'll be observing. I say Mr. Hacker, Mr. Grizzy, and others: whoever doesn't mind me being there. She says that Mr. Hacker will mind that I'm there. I tell her that he won't mind my presence. We disagree.
