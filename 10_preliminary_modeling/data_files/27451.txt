This dream was a series of vague and confused incidents, and I am sure there was much more to it than I can remember. I remember roller skating down a side walk in a rather unsteady manner, being conscious at the time that I could do much better than I appeared to be doing. Then I found myself in a car at the top of a hill with a middle-aged woman (I have no idea who she was). The woman was trying to park the car in front of her garage, but since the brakes did not work on the first two attempts, we rolled back down the hill both times--I was very frightened. The third time, however, the brakes held and we got out of the car. Then somehow or other I found myself in an amusement park with about four boys and girls my own age (I cannot identify them either). We seemed to be just standing around eating popcorn.
