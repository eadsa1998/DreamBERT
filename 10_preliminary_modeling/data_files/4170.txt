I am a young beautiful model in a swim suit at the beach. William Shatner is there. As I walk past him, I make comments that are sarcastic because he was being self centered and arrogant thinking I would fall for him. He has the beginnings of a pot belly and gray hair. He jokes back with me and we build a kind of friendship based on our mutual respect for wit and fast thinking. He follows me as I walk through a crowd of people on the beach and lie down on a sand dune, between two other women who are sun bathing. I ask one how her relationship is going. She says they are about to get divorced. I am sad for her and say That is the saddest part of a relationship. William finds me and the women go away and he and I continue to gain more respect for each other. He puts sun tan lotion on me. I am wearing a black one piece bathing suit, with a hole cut out where my belly button is.
