I was in St. Joe. There were five family members there, including myself. Mother and Daddy were two of them, but I don't know who the other two were. I suggested we go for a bike ride, suggesting that we ride around the block like we used to do. They weren't sure what I meant, because we're out in the country so I explain to them that I mean going right down SR46, take the first right across Route 1, take the next right up the road alongside the high school, the next right across the road in front of the high school and then another right back down SR46. As we were getting the bikes down from where Daddy had hung them in the garage I realized we didn't have five bikes. I didn't want Mother to have an excuse not to go so I suggested that we borrow some from the neighbors. Unlike in waking life, the neighbor's house was very close to ours, like city homes are. Their bikes were stored in a very run down shack behind their house. We borrowed two bikes from them. As we got on the bikes someone started out left going up SR46. I started to object because I didn't want to start out going uphill but decided not to say anything.
