 I am with the chicken catcher's and we are hauling watermelons for Bill's Country Farm Stand. Tim, the chicken catching supervisor, is handing out the watermelons. He hands me too many, and I drop them. The melons are slippery with spaghetti on them. My high school classmates Jared Nupe and Donald Dilson are there. There are also some girls there. My friend Tiny Combs and I cook macaroni cheese. There are three different kinds of macaroni: white cheddar, regular spiral, and plain macaroni that one has to add real cheese to. Jared and Donald cook macaroni after we do. They want to beat us to it. I get into a fight with them, and beat them up. Donald throws a pot of boiling water. Some guys need a small metal clip for something. They are rude. Tiny has the clip. I get it from Tiny and give it to them. I try to find a pan for us to use to cook macaroni. I am at my house. My sister Ramona and brother Wally are there with me. There is a white car out in front of our house that turns around. It looks like my friend's sister Jessica Thomas' car. A man is driving it, and it looks like my friend Annie Thomas in the passenger seat. I think it is Annie's boyfriend, but it isn't.
