Cedric, Ramona, Classmate-F-10 and I were standing outside our classroom. Cedric and Ramona were doing some crime scene acting. Cedric said "I'm home, honey!" and leaned over and pretended to kiss Ramona, but Teacher-F-06 walked passed and he kissed her on the cheek. Cedric and Teacher-F-06 were a bit shocked, but the rest of us found it hilarious.
