As the dream began a fraternity brother of mine, Herman Scher, was riding a horse across a field. As I rode up to him, I saw a bolt of lightning coming down toward him. I was also on horseback and I rode desperately to try and warn him to avoid the slowly descending bolt. felt secret elation however that the bolt was not directed toward me. The bolt struck Herman, but in some way I to wa's injured. It seems that I lost consciousness. When I awoke, I was laying on a cot in the field. Next to me, and in similar bandages, were Herman, and another friend and teammate on the basketball squad, John Kappos. Before us was a huge television screen and an indistinguishable figure was asking us if it was correctly tuned.
