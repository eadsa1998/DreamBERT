[At Needles, Canyonlands N.P.]  Robert K and I were making love.  He stood up with me straddling his waist and I thought - this is something only Robert does.  I got tired of it and did a back flip, rolling away from him.  I expected him to be a little impressed with the gymnastics, but he turned away to do something.  He cut off his penis at the base, and then said "look, I knew you weakened it by doing that, and I had to cut it off!"  I didn't buy that.  But I wondered why he was blaming it on me when he had done it himself.  I said "well, to the hospital then?"  he agreed.  Then came a long sequence of driving and pushing him in a cart and some frustration about not getting to the hospital sooner.
