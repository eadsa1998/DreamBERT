I was at McDonald's. Selena and Seamus worked there and I got a job application. I was in the car and Mom and Ezra were in the front. There was a shooting and this guy ran towards the car. I had told Mom to drive and lock the doors but she didn't listen. He opened Ezra's door and told them to get out and me to stay and I argued.
