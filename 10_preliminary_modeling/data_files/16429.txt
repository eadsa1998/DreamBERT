I was in this group of people. I think we were either singers or performers or something. And we were in a band room and we were kind of being taught by a man, but instead of rehearsing or stuff, we were talking about Greek mythology and we were talking about how to go around and take the path and the journey to find Theseus (?). I guess the ____ stories are going to my head. And so we decided we were going to take this little jaunt, trip so maybe we would finally understand how it went. And Mom was kind of volunteering with that and she came back to get me because everybody kind of left me behind. And everybody was going on their way and Mom was driving me in this van that is like the yellow cab van, except it wasn't yellow, it was brown. And it had like a two-way radio in it and I could hear Sparky talking. He's the cab dispatcher. And, oh, Mom was showing me that she bought these pins of like different figures for people to wear, and I was like dressed in this costume. And I don't remember ever getting there. And before that, I dreamt that I was investigating around by the tree, and that I had a longer, a box that was longer than it was wise and kind of not that high, and heavy and dense, and it was wrapped in green paper. Now I don't know if this is a prophetic image or if it's just wishful thinking, but I tend to believe it's just wishful thinking. And now I don't remember any more.
