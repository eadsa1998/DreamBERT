I am walking around my neighborhood by myself. I am right across the street from my house and this little dog walks right by me. He is smaller than a cat, but he looks like a miniaturized full-sized dog rather than a specific small-sized dog or puppy. I watch him walk by and I am going to let him go on his way, but I realize that he is not safe. I fear that he will get hit by a car or attacked by some other big dog. I catch up to him very quickly and pick him up. The dog is very friendly and seems happy that I have picked him up. The dog seems to understand that I have saved him and he is thankful. I take him to my parent's house so that he will be safe. I am happy that I have protected this dog and I am stoked that I have a new pet/friend who is grateful for what I have done.
