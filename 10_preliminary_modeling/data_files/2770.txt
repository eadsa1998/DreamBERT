Something about being in the M City house and seated on the living room couch and then I am seated in a old-fashioned school desk made for two with a good-looking young man with salt and pepper gray hair. He and I are very lovey. It feels wonderful to be close to him and touch his hair and flirt. He is Alfred Hitchcock's son. We laugh at the funniness that would be if I were fat and he were skinny (beings as how Hitchcock was fat).
