We're on a new highway interchange on the way to M City. We see snow and ski chair lifts as we get to the top of the mountain. I am seated backwards in a chair lift as we come to the top and over. I look down and feel dizzy from the incredible heights. I cling to my chair and try not to look. Suddenly we are at the coast. The whole valley got cut out. We can still take the old highway to get to M City.
