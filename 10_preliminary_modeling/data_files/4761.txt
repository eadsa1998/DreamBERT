["Funny little airplane."] I return home from some trip. Ginny is with me. Howard is gone. I am curious if he is gone for good. I feel very slightly sad about that. I am unpacking and trying to get back into the routine. I go outside. I see a small single person airplane. A male pilot is with it. It is interesting to look at.
