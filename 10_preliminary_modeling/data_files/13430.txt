Ezra, Mom and I were at a familiar playground. A guy that looked like Thurman Merman (Bad Santa) was there. Then I went to a place with the school. We had to eliminate people in our group for some reason. Charlene, Gemma and Jemma (except she kept getting called Madelyn) were in mine. Later, I realized that Calvin was in Eugene's group, all members of which were males. There was some dating/matching up thing and I didn't want anyone to get Eugene. I was writing my answers on my paper on Charlene's back. She had a paper mache thing and it had no mouth. Calvin wanted to steal something. Elijah and his friends were on this bus and he had chocolate.
