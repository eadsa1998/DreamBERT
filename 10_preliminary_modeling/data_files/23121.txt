I was going to eat breakfast at a school cafeteria.  It was summer, and I found that the main cafeteria was closed.  There was only a small counter where you could buy a few things that didn't need preparation.  I asked if they had cereal, and he said they did.  He named a few kinds that I had never heard of.  While I was making up my mind, I got a small carton of milk, and for some reason he also gave me a block of chocolate ice cream in a plastic bag tied with a twist-em.  Medea was there, too; when we went out to sit in the cafeteria, I realized that I had forgotten my cereal.  When I went back, there was no one there.  After waiting a while, it began to be one of those dreams where there is a long delay, and when I eventually went out to the seating area again, Medea was gone.
