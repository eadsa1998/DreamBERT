Am driving a busload of people who have paid for a tourist travel trip to a southern state. We arrive at the state line where I am stopped for a traffic light. Also realize that I am not familiar with the traffic regulations of that state. I look up at light and there are no colors, then look again and it is green. We continue down the road and then later someone else, a young man in dark purple shirt and matching trousers, is driving us, but the front of the bus inside seems more like a trolley car and he is manipulating the lever as we continue along. He drives up and down the hills and I note they are getting steeper and steeper. Finally in desperation he turns to me as we climb a hill and says he is using all the speed he can get and that we are just about able to make the hill. If they get worse, we won't make it. Ahead I see several grades, but they are small. We reach a plateau and in the distance to the left of the road we see some majestic mountains in the distance. They are misty and the sky is blue and the sun is strong. I realize the rugged mountains are the Rockies and also that I didn't know this southern state was so far to the West. We continue and finally the road ahead narrows until there is only one lane. Our vehicle fills the whole road. Ahead I see that the road swerves, has dangerous turns and then finally unbelievably, it actually turns on its side perpendicular. When I see that, I am furious because the state trooper had not warned us that the road was so bad. I realize we will have to go back and that the tourists will get a refund. I wait at the side of the road as the man in purple shirt walks ahead to see how the road looks. Then a sports car comes by and roars ahead and sweeps around the perpendicular road and is gone.
