[very hard to hear] We were in Jackson with Aunt Christine, and there were some strangers there. Maybe it was Uncle Burt &amp; Bobby. I don't see them that much, so maybe they were the strangers. But at first I was like sitting in a living room, but it didn't really look like their living room. It looked kind of more like Melinda's living room. And they had a really nice sound system. They put it on, and I was listening to something while I was drawing or writing. I was bored, trying to use up the time, you know. And I don't know what Mom and Dad were doing. They were out shopping or some activity like that. And there was something to do with the kitchen, I don't remember what. Somebody was either painting the kitchen or cooking in the kitchen or doing something. And then I got tired and I think I went to bed, but I'm not sure. Maybe I just slept on the couch.  And the next day Mom was saying something about wanting to do something with Aunt Christine's mirror because in this dream when you would go into the bathroom, it would be these three mirrors all tilted in toward each other like a bay window. One mirror was nice and a little fancy, like a little bit of ____________. The middle mirror was like really, really, really fancy. And the mirror to the right was like falling apart and real plain, so Mom decided she wanted to make the right mirror a little fancy to go with the one on the left. So she said, "Do you want to stay with me and work on the mirror, or do you want to walk?" and I wanted to walk and I said in this dream, something about how I did all the scribbling I could possibly do yesterday. And so we walked a little, and we came to this park and they were having like this fair and we were walking around these different booths ________________. ______________________ _________________________. And then _____________________ kind of looked like our park. And I could hear the band, and I was running up the hill to get closer to the band ___________________. And there were some ducks along the way and I was stopping to look at the ducks. I couldn't really get close to them.  Then I woke up. And actually before all of this, ______________________________. And so of course Aiden was bouncing off the walls when it was time to go. I didn't want him running around tearing stuff up.  And so I was on the porch and I was swinging on the swing and playing a little game with him. And then I was able to pick him up and carry him like a baby, right out the front door to his parents.
