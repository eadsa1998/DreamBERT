With Frank and Zena we are getting ready to leave the Retreat Center and sing the traditional goodbye song. See some of Wendy's friends and some Retreat Center people. They tell us of their lives and how they married. Zena and I see an ocean liner with three long ripples in the front of it; Later Zena drives a car downhill, very fast, but in control. I talk in my sleep: "Is the Beany sing over?" (name of Retreat Center goodbye song)
