I was in a lecture for my perception class. The professor wasn't my real professor and I thought that was strange. The man who was teaching me in the dream was Japanese. A girl who was sitting next to me is actually in my sociology class. In the dream I have a project due and the rest of my group hasn't shown up. So I get up in front of the class and do the project by myself. I figure that I am done with the project, but the presentation that I just gave was like a trial run and doesn't count towards the final grade. Then the girl seated next to me stands up and gives her presentation. Her group didn't show up either. Then I was at home in my bathroom and I noticed that all of the things that are usually on the counter were in a cabinet underneath the sink. I thought that it was odd that the girl I was sitting next to cleaned the bathroom and I don't even live with her. Then I was back at school in a room that looked like a science museum, but was supposed to be a library .The girl that had given her presentation after mine had come up to me while I was working on my project and said, "You didn't even pay attention when I was doing my presentation at the last class." I said yes I had and told her that her presentation was on photosynthesis. I wasn't really paying attention; I just happened to know what her topic it was. It surprised me that I remembered it.
