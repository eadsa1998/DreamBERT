Somewhere in a WOODS there is going to be a TRIPLE WEDDING: I keep asking "Who is getting married?" I am not invited and feel hurt; Then someone says; "Didn't you know, Wendy is getting married, to JOSHUA I am shocked and surprised and I walk in the moods and cry and cry and wonder why she did not invite us to the wedding? Then I hear that JOSHUA goofed and that the certificate of marriage was not legal. I am relieved, and think that now she can marry that Irish fellow she fell in love with on Inishere.... I am a bit relieved, but still SAD.
