I am in a department store - I see many perfume displays and come upon a powder box just like the one my mother used to use. I show it to my brother and to Frank,and ask them to buy it for me sometime. Dinner with Rita and Harold (close friends and my brother's in-laws) We sit at a round table that has a hole in the middle where there is a tree trunk that obstructs the view of the other side of the table. H. Iooks just as she used to be and I see her carrying flowers and talking with various guests. Very happy feeling.
