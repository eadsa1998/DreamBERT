["Hurting the baby."]  I am in a large room. A short woman is in labor, seated on a couch. She can't seem to get the baby to come out. A man is seated near me, perpendicular to me. He holds a baby and is slapping it around. I am upset and ask him not to do that. He is sullen, not appreciating my interference. I keep insisting he stop hurting the baby. Meanwhile, a man named Larry is slowly coming closer to me. He is attracted to me and wants to kiss me. I am attracted to him, but shy and not responding to him very overtly. He finally kisses me and I barely respond. I think, I'd better do something responsive or he'll go away.
