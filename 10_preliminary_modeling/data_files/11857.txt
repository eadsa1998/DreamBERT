I was at this "Seabird" place and I put up this bit of material and it ripped. I went to the little shop and I asked if I could phone Mom, which would cost $30. I called her and she said to let the cats out or something and I remembered I had Tinkerbell, Tigger and Widget in these mini boxes. They were in there for 3 days and Widget was dead, and I cried. Then I was walking around and went in some people's spa and they chucked a spaz, so I ran off. Later on I was in this hotel. There were strange dinosaur things. The spa people were looking for me and I got away and snuck up some stairs and when I went back down they caught me. My room was number 239 or something.
