["Three Jewish men and me."] Susie and Tom have invited me to a cafe with them. They sit at a table and direct me to sit away from them at another table, alone. I do it. Then three young Jewish men join me. Susie is setting us up hoping I'll like one and date him. The three are seated in a line across the table from me. The one directly across from me is talkative and interesting. We begin to enjoy the conversation. Suddenly, they get up and walk out. I half teasingly say Is it something I said? Because I don't know why they left. I get up and go find Susie and Tom. They are curt and tell me to return to my table. I do it. I decide I will rearrange the couch and table which had been set to turn in toward me. I turn it around so it will be more inviting for the public to join in. I look out the window and see the three men had changed their clothes and have returned. The one man looks at the furniture change and says he liked it the original way because it was more intimate. I say well, I was trying to include more people in my life. We now walk down the hall to the other room where Susie and Tom are. Now Charlton Heston enters. He has a hand grenade and is going to go out and throw it as there are enemies out there, possibly Arab. I agree to help him throw one too.
