I dreamt about stopping at the park near my parent's house.  There was a big house, looked like it used to be a bed and breakfast type of place, very beautiful.  I went in the side way, to the library.  It opened into a courtyard, and a faint whistling, and a sort of guru appeared.  He was there to give me some hints on how to...sing Tuvan?  He was very wise and highly respected. I had to be somewhat secretive about my lessons from him.
