The Drapes Nightmare. Ellie kept bothering me. She came into my house and wasn't thinking, just kept being in the way or annoying me. I tried to get her to leave me alone. I wanted to go to bed. I got into a small, thin brass bed but the covers and pillows wouldn't stay put. It was uncomfortable. I was very angry. I pushed and shoved to throw her out and she'd keep popping back in. I looked out the window and Arvonne was dressing up to go out. She was putting on a blond wig. It was a brassy, bright bee hive blonde hairdo. I was glad she was getting out of my way too. Now I'm in my room and sort of on a boat in a closed up space. A horrible dog/boy creature is attacking me and it bites savagely. A man behind me says, "I'll help. Let me do that." I say nothing but continue to take the attack. It is very painful; constant and scary. Ellie is also attacking. I throw it away and it lunges back at me. I scream in agony and frustration. The man can't take it anymore. He grabs the horrible attacking thing and throws it into a garbage disposal. I scream, "No!" and hear the grinding up of its body and can't bear the thought of its pain or death. I don't want to cause anyone else pain. Then I look again in renewed horror because the thing is now four times larger, an ugly large boy, and he's crawling out of the garbage disposal to get me even worse. I run to escape. I go into a room, like a living room or a captain's bedroom of a boat. I go to the tall windows and try to climb up, pulling myself hand over hand up the drapes. Each drape I try to climb up falls and is replaced by another drape. This happens over and over and over. I know now I'm trapped. I panic, sobbing. I pick up objects off the dresser to heave it at the window to break it open and it just bounces off like it was Mylar plastic windows. Nothing I do helps. I am condemned to this hell for eternity.
