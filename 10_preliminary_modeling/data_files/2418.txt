I am staying somewhere and everyday I go out and get a paper ticket on my car. I have to turn them in when I leave. Now it's time to leave and I'm packing, but can't find all the tickets. I hope that doesn't hold me up. I look at my left wrist and see long bunches of hairs (maybe 3" long) growing out of my wrist. I remark that's just like my mother and we compare our clumps of hairs. We soap them into "whale spouts" just alike.
