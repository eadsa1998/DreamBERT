I was at some place and some of it was on fire. I asked Mom for a car, but we couldn't call out. She let me use the pickup. I was then in this building and Eugene and Darius were walking up these stairs. Eugene was wearing a Spongebob shirt. I escaped through the roof. This building hadn't been destroyed yet. Ezra and his friends started chasing me. I went to a canteen and it was closed. I asked for water, but they only had this can one which was yuck so I asked for chocolate, but I ended up with one of those things you hang your keys on.
