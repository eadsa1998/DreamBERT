We were on our way to the Lingerman's farm, traveling in an open wagon or a convertible.  Just before we got to the farm, we passed a big field on our right where two guys were preparing to duel-with swords.  The guy farthest away had a second, but the one nearest the road didn't.  I shouted as we passed that dueling was illegal.  They looked at me like I was crazy, but I added the observation that the one guy didn't have a second.  That guy then raised his hand in some kind of gesture that I couldn't make out because we were too far away by then.  I raised my hand and gave the peace sign in response.  He then gave his sword a big fling in my direction.  I was sure we were much too far away for it to reach us, but it fell distressingly close.  He came to get it, and I tried to speed up-but when he got it, we were closer to him than before, and he threw it again.  This time it veered like a Frisbee, and I could see it was heading straight for me.  It hit me in the side with considerable force and made a small slit in my side but didn't stick there.  It really didn't hurt that much, but I felt that I was going to die anyway.  I made it to the "farm," which was actually Uncle Jack's house.  I crawled up to the porch, and that's as far as I could make it.  Someone came out to attend to me, and I found I had an enormous bruise all over my right side, hip, and back.
