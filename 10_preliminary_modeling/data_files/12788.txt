We got our essays back. I got 83% and a level 7. I was quite pleased, but Bradley got 90% or something and a level 10. Eugene got the same as me. Ms Solomon said that my "vocabulary wasn't very big, like Weezer". I was on a computer. Eugene was behind me. Later, I was trying to cover up stuff but I couldn't. Daryl was on the page, etc.
