We (my whole family) were at someone's house that I don't know. They had three baby food jars with one huge spider in each jar. Somehow all the spiders got away and we were looking for them. I found the first one on a shelf and as soon as I saw it, I was paralyzed (frozen), and I barely got away before it bit me. The second one was on a tree branch and we caught that one, but we only saw the third one on the ceiling. Setting: It was at someone's house that I don't know, and they had a big house with at least one huge tree growing in the house. Characters: There was a family of five that I don't know, my mom, my dad, my brother (I think), me, and three huge spiders that are very poisonous, with brown and black stripes. Feelings and Thoughts: Scared, worried. The whole dream, I was scared that the spiders would hit me and worried that we wouldn't find all three of the spiders (which we didn't).
