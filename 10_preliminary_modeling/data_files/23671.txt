I was with an alien.  We were on the alien's planet, a dry rocky landscape.  In this dream I was male, and the alien was female.  I was getting to know her, but we did not speak the same language, we communicated telepathically and with hand motions.  The alien was very small, under two feet.  It was pink, very sensual, it moved gracefully.  I kept thinking of the word nubile.  Its features were not very distinct, just a general impression of femininity, alien-ness, sensuality.  I dreamed I made love with this alien.
