Again, I didn't drink last night, but I woke up dehydrated with a headache. The dream was fragmented. There was a competition to put on a show or exhibition with many people involved. 'Our' show was postponed or something. The following night a team made up of my cousins Claire, Ashleigh, Adrian, Betty and my aunt Catherine put on a very successful show. The public turned up. I don't remember what the show was. Later, I took a cab, although it's more like a bicycle or rickshaw (like the kind you get in India). My partner is my driver, but later her character is a man. He keeps me waiting for ages, procrastinating and chatting to other people. I become impatient and leave, saying "Forget it, I'll walk". The driver becomes my partner again, and she says "You asshole, you'll have to pay for coming to pick you up". I give the driver a couple of dollars.
