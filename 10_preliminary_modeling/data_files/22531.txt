I dreamed that I went to visit a girlfriend and suddenly I saw a boy I like with his friend. When he saw me, he got a bit nervous, and on my part I was curious to know what he was doing there. After watching him, I got inside my friend's house and told her that I had seen that boy and that he probably would still be standing there in front of the house. I even saw it as though I were watching it through a telescope because I saw him closely through the window and besides, I could hear what he was saying. I saw his face and felt disillusioned when I saw that he had crooked teeth with cavities and that they were yellow. I felt even more disappointed when I heard him speak, because he was expressing himself inadequately and later he began to speak with his friend about a Math course. Then I saw myself outside the house and when he saw me, he and his friend got in the car and they left.
