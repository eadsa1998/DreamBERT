 I walk into a store like Sears on my way to a movie with my mom and my sister Ramona. I see a young man my age. He calls me over and starts talking to me. He recognizes me from a trip I went on, which is the Cancun trip, I think. We talk a little while. He seems more interested in the conversation than I. I leave to go to the movie with my mom and Ramona.
