 I'm with my friends Tom Napper, Niles Zelling, and others. We're driving in Tom's car. We are going straight up a very steep hill, with about a 75-degree incline! There is another car driven by a woman that takes a more winding road up the hill. We get to the top of the hill, and are in the clouds. We are overlooking Sydney, Australia. Many of us take photographs. There is a camera-like structure there. It is round and has individual areas with cameras.
