My friends and I went into a cave and dug up some sweet potatoes and regular potatoes, and we threw some of them at a cat but they landed on a washing machine that was across the street in a laundromat. Then we went to a woman's house.(The woman was in my science lab last year in real life. I had asked her out but she said no.) We went into her basement, my friends and I, and turned on the TV. Home Improvement was on, which is the only show I'll watch on occasion. But I wasn't paying attention to the show all the time. I was wondering how I was going to ask her out again. Then the dream ended.
