I was at the track and was a horse owner. A couple of buddies ran my horse and he was red when he came to the finish line. There was a small fire. I yelled at the guys and I went over to see the steward to find out if he was my horse. While my friend and I were looking at my horses, I picked out a cold red flat piece of sheet metal and that was one of my horses. My friend said he should be 100 to 1 and win. I slid him out on a conveyor and he slid down to the starting gate. A fellow with a ten-gallon hat was in front of us. The wind took his hat and blew it up into the air. We watched it go up, then it came down.
