A man will see to it that I will get the day off and he will take care of the woman I am with so I can get some rest and the woman will get some rest. We're both very happy about that. People say, "Oh, my God, you do so many things." I say, "Yeah. But Sunday I'll be sleeping." We're sitting on a porch or a verandah, talking together. We're all young students.
