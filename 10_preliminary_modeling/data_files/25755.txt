 My classmates Queen Billman and Beth Mock come running towards me. It is my birthday. They take me to a car. On the way I see my classmate Alec Johnson. We hug each other, and I tell him I referred to him as the Big Sluuu. We laugh. I get into a big shiny yellow and green Cadillac, like a pimp mobile. My classmate Christian and another man drive me to a place. There is good music in the car. I get carried into the place, which is owned by an older male friend of my friend Kevin Simpson, for a party. Kevin is there with his pants dirty. My friends Bubba Hacker and Sam Kingsley are there. We shake hands. During this whole experience friends and strangers treat me like a king. They had it all planned and set up. I feel really special that people cared enough for me to do that.
