The dream I had was one of the strangest ones of my life. All night I dreamt of a room where there was a plate rack, a sofa, two couches, a chair and curtains. I was sitting at the desk and a friend of mine went from one side of the room to the other, pacing. He was dark, with a beard, glasses, and was dressed in light blue slacks, a dark green jacket and green turtle shell glasses. I don't know how this dream is related to me.
