I got my pay and the man counted the cash and paid me after I signed my name on the pay voucher. It was wet and I had to sign way above the line. I signed John Evans. I was afraid someone would rob me, so I hid behind some rocks and I saw like a shadow behind others. I finally counted it. I had leather belts and it was stamped on the belt 21.00 and there were holes in the belt and by each hole there was so much cash per hole stamped on the belt. I saw myself being robbed by Biblical time. I saw a motor that pushed a drill in and out about 12 inches. There was a long, thin drill on it and I put it near Tesar's face and it went up and down near his face. Ann and I took a ride on a streetcar.
