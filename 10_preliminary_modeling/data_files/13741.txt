I was seeing a play or show or something. I was involved with it somehow. I was there with Kyle MacLachlan, but he was like Dale Cooper (Twin Peaks). While they were getting ready for the show, we went off to this restaurant. The food was already at all the tables and you had to pick a table to sit at. The one we chose had good shakes.
