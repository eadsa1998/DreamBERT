I was dating Eugene and he was the future creator of Facebook (it was before Facebook existed). Some people were after him because of it. We were in a building trying to get away. There was a hall with little nooks with paintings or doors at the end of them. None of the doors would open. One of the nooks had an Inglourious Basterds poster and a secret door, which opened, and we went in. There was a statute of 'Hamlet'. There was a soft wall in there with a room on the other side and I thought it was a theatre. It was darkish in the room. We tried to work out what to do. Sometimes we would time travel and try it again. Eventually he said he was going to make an announcement over the PA and he wanted me to stay here. When he was done he would travel back? He managed to make the announcement and as I listened, I was proud of him. Then it was the end of school/university. We were like 'we're not going to forget today!'. I put a book away and Elijah was standing next to me. I was then standing with Eugene and some others. His rival came over and touched my butt and I kicked him in the nuts. Nobody saw and I was annoyed. Also, at some point I was on the FilmForum group and Linus made a forum post like 'most handsome man' and I posted a list in alphabetical order. Tommy Wiseau was in there and I was confused as to why he was in the list (I thought maybe I'd put it in there as a joke, but I didn't remember).
