Sharon Ferguson, someone else (possibly Kenny Smith) and I are riding the street car.  Just before we get off, Kenny says that he and Sharon will probably go to the slumber party together.  I remember Sharon telling me that only girls are going to be there, so I knew she had been trying to cover up.  As we are crossing over to the cemeteries, Kenny goes in a different direction, so I take Sharon by the arm gently and tell her that I have no right to have her to myself, and that we should both be free to go out with others, so I don't want her to lie about it.
