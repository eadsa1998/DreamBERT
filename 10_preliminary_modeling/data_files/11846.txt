I was at some place with Vyvyan and Neil (both The Young Ones). Vyvyan was smashing things and Neil and I were hanging out and there were these people looking at this toy car display. We were at a school type place and some teacher asked me to bring a box of sport equipment to the shed. I couldn't find Neil so I went and they wanted to take a class photo so I hid myself behind the box, because I wasn't meant to be in the class.
