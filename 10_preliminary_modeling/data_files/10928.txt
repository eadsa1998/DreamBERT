I was at some kind of camp in the evening on New Year's Eve. Some people asked me to go with them somewhere. I went with the others in a truck with an open-topped back. We set out about 10:30 and built a bonfire when we got where we were going. At about 11:15 I looked at my watch and realized I had to get back to my date before midnight. I rushed back and didn't find him there. I was told which direction he had gone. I hurried along the path and found that it led to a football stadium. I found the fellow I had a date with sitting there with one of his boyfriends. It was after midnight. There were only three main people--two fellows and me. The group I went with was mixed.
