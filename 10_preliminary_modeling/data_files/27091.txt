I came home from school for the first time in some two weeks (although school seemed to be within walking distance) to find that we had moved into a new house. It was a very modern, spacious house. It was so big I didn't even get a chance to see it all. I went down to the basement and found my mother (age-45) ironing. There were big picture windows in the basement. I said good-by to my mother and started off to school. I found another flight of stairs leading up from the basement into a passageway (with a glass roof) leading to the living room. I went outside and it was raining very hard. I ran to the corner and stepped into the doorway of a store. I fell down and got mud on my raincoat.
