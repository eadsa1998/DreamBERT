I dreamed that I was standing on a hilltop. I knew immediately that it was Mexico. Seldom even in a movie have I seen such a beautiful scene. (This was a thoroughly enjoyable dream). It was early dawn. I saw the sun cast long golden ribbons over the softly rolling hills. I swear I felt a fresh breeze on my face. The hills were brown, freshly plowed with long furrows. I even noticed that many of their hills were contour plowed. In some of the fields, white skirted peasants in straw hats were sowing seed with a rhythmical precision. I stood on the hill and looked at everything with a peaceful pleasure. Suddenly I heard shrieks and shouts. I glanced down into a valley and saw many horsemen driving crowds of people before them. The horses reared and whinnied, the riders shouted and cracked whips. The people wept and screamed as they were driven down into a huge ditch. They were forcibly thrown down into it. Their baggage and possessions were flung all around them. I rushed forward and threw myself into the ditch with these expelled people. I learned that they were Spanish but I never found out why they were exiled. I was considerably surprised (even in my dream, which was quite credible) to hear myself announce in ringing tones "I'm Spanish too." I talked in a friendly manner to a little girl of about 8 years. Her name was INES. As my dream ended I was sitting in the dirt of the ditch, quite happily making paper dolls for INES, who crouched beside me.
