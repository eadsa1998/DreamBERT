I dreamt I had cut off all of my hair and that my girlfriend left me due to this. Then I went to a pharmacist and he recommended a formula which he prepared himself, and told me it was to make hair grow. I bought it and put it on daily until I had a beautiful head of hair, long, and I turned into a hippie. I frequented clubs and friends, and we smoked pot and all the rest. This dream didn't please me because I really don't like that.
