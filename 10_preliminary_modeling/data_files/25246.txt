 My neighbor Alvin Broud, is a burglar and is a part of a ring of people who sell diamonds. He has a lot of parking tickets to pay. He comes out of a movie theatre-like place with a woman and the police are here his car to arrest him. His car is on the west side of Home Ave in Oak Valley, just down the street from my home. Alvin takes off on a bicycle and rides down Next Avenue towards the Robbins' house, with a police care following him. The car goes past the alley that Alvin has turned into to evade the police. He turns and goes through the driveway of Mrs. Shelly's house, coming back towards Home Ave, as the police circle the block. He goes through our yard to the north side of his house. He hesitates before going down the steep hill in his front yard, because the police car is going north on Hill Avenue, right in front of his house, looking for him. More police have been called. He evades the police, somehow using the department of motor vehicles to do so, for many years, all the while living at home. He has acted smart. He comes into his porch area and into his home. He has just returned from cataract surgery at 3:00 am. A high school classmate of mine, Analisa Paulsen, is there. She has been living with him.
