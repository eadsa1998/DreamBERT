I was by the door of someone who died. I can't recall who it was. Wiatrak brought over a gas cap and put it on the car and locked it. I took my gas cap back I was giving the deceased. In my sleep I was thinking of my income tax. I must pay $97.98 and Frank Brown said we can use Air Attack and Air Attack seemed to be in my mind and dream continuously. Air Attack is a name of a horse and I remember he won the last race and paid a good price. We were out in the country. I saw funny-looking cow. I thought it was a bull. I climbed a fence. Then I flew up and was above the cow and it turned out to be a man and he was a nasty one. He couldn't do anything to me because I was in the air flying. He had a couple of bottles and I picked one up. He hit one of my bottles and his broke. Then he hit mine again and his other one broke and there was glass on the sidewalk. I was finding pennies on the ground and as I picked them up, I counted them. I was kicking someone's head, a horse's or cow's.
