I was at this house and there was a murderer guy. When the lights went out someone died. I was in this room with all these movies. I saw To Kill a Mockingbird. Then it disappeared. Joseph Cotten was in a wheelchair. It turned out that the killer had 'killed' him and then taken over his body. George (Grey's Anatomy) put this water helmet on Izzie (Grey's Anatomy). Alex (Grey's Anatomy) already had one on. Then they put blue liquid on them. They were slowly edging away from the killer. Some people and I hid in a room. The power went out and I looked out the window and realized it was actually a movie. I was then out there walking with some people. I found a card and it turned into a phone. It was Ms Bigwood's phone and some person was yelling that I was stealing phones. Then Ms Corbett was there and I sad "now this'll be Ms Corbett's phone" and it was. She came and I was saying that I was picking them up to give to the owner.
