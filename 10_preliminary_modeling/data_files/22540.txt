There was going to be a show at my university and they had commissioned me to paint a mural which would serve as background to the stage. I was painting it on the stage itself, when I went out to see who was outside and found that two of my classmates were sitting behind a table. One of them I can't remember well. I don't know who she was; the other was Cherry, a classmate who has joined a convent. I shouted, "Cherry," and she called me and I ran and fell on my knees and put my head on her lap and started to cry. Then the rest of my friends came to say hello to Cherry and she was petting my hair and told me, "Don't cry, silly."
