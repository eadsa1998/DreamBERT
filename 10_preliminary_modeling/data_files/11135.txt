I dreamt I was present in the room that was discussing where to drop the atomic bomb. I saw them load the bomb on a very different type plane that carried the bomb on a cord outside the plane. I sensed the fact that all this was top secret. They were going to drop the bomb in a valley very close to where one group would be, but it was the softest of all places. The dream ended as the plane took off to its destination. Everything seemed so mysterious and powerful.
